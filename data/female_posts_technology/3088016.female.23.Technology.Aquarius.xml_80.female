When I get in to see the doctor, she asks if I can come back in three weeks once the swelling has gone completely down.  I tried to explain to her that I may be smaller now than I was before the surgery, but she wasn't buying the chubby cheeks excuse.  Sigh.    She also gave me something that everyone had been telling me about from their own surgery experience: a curved-end syringe with which to rinse out the tooth holes in the back of my mouth after eating.  Talk about disgusting.  I'm so far not having a good time with this.  After the first rinsing session, I learned that very cold water is not a good idea in there.  I'm grossed out very easily, and I just dread every time I have to rinse with this contraption and wait to see what comes out.  The good news is that I shouldn't have holes for long.  The doctor says that since I didn't have room for wisdom teeth in the first place, I won't have room for holes either.   My pain is mostly gone in the back of my mouth.  It's funny, but all of the residual pain I'm feeling is from the rest of the teeth still pushing forward as if there's still pressure from the wisdom teeth trying to get in.  Some people have to wear braces for years, which I figure to be an illustration of how long it could take for my teeth to realize that they can loosen up.  This is nothing compared with the pain I felt before the surgery, though.  I'm glad it's behind me.
