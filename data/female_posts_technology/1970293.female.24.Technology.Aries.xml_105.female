There was so many trees that it blocked the sunlight from touching the forest floor though she could see a few sun spots ahead.  She could feel the forest vibrating under her feet and the whispers on the cool breeze brushing her pale cheek.    "This forest is old and alive."  Morrigan whispered to Aidan as they moved slowly forward.  "Be careful.  Do not disturb anything, touch any of the trees, and do not start any fires or go towards the trees with an ax."  "Why?" Aidan asked close to hear, surprising her.  "Because the forest is alive.  It might take offense to you burning a piece of wood and I don't want to think about the penalty for that.  Remember the forest is full of fair folk."  Morrigan answered quietly sweeping her arms back in a grand gesture taking in the whole forest.   "What are the fair folk exactly?  I mean I heard the stories in the village but sometimes I wondered if they actually knew what they were speaking about."  Aidan stepped carefully over some roots that creeped under the ground like snakes intertwined.  "The village stories weren't always accurate but they were close.  You have heard of elves?"  Morrigan continued after seeing Aidan nod affirmation.  "Elves no longer live in our world though they do visit at times especially when the the planes are close together.  They are the most powerful of the fair folk but also the most dangerous.  The elves blame us for destroying land so they left to preserve their power and their kind.  Then of course there are the faeries, the brownies, the gnomes, the pixies, and the dryads.  There are many more but those are the ones most people have heard about in stories."  Morrigan stopped for a moment to catch her breath and to glance at Aidan.  "Should we worry about any of the fair folk or will they leave us alone?"  Morrigan glanced at Aidan as he stopped beside her and gently rubbed her shoulder as he asked his question.   "It depends.  Sometimes they take an active interest and other times they do not.  There is no use worrying about it until something happens.  If something does happen, I'll take care of it."  Morrigan smiled distractively as he continued to rub her shoulder.  It felt so good on her tired muscles.    "Well let's hope they stay away until we can reach our destination.  Come, let's continue.  This forest makes me somewhat nervous."  Aidan smiled as he pulled her along by her hand.  She squeezed his hand tightly.  "Morrigan, do you know how far we must go in order to be safe or do we just keep going until we stop?"  "I have no idea.  I think we should keep going.  Either the specter will come back to let us know when we finally arrived or someone else will let us know."  Morrigan replied as she hopped off a large rock.  Aidan sighed.  "I wish the fair folk and ghosts were just a little more clearer in their messages."  "Be happy.  We're finally having an adventure instead of doing drudge work in the village."  She smiled mischieviously.  She tapped him on the shoulder, "Catch me if you can," and pranced between the trees and bounded over the rocks.  She could hear Aidan following behind her.  She giggled and heard Aidan laugh in reply.  All too soon, Aidan caught her around the waist and hugged her close to him.  He smelled good, she noticed, squeezing him around the waist tighter.  She could feel his warm breath on her hair.  Finally after it seemed they held each other for hours, they parted and continued on their way north through the forest.   To my loving husband who has no idea that I dedicated a story to him
