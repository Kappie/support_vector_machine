I bit the hell out of my mouth, accidentally of course, during lunch.  And I had to deal with all the little issues this morning with the cry baby in the UK.  Geez, I just want a beer, a fan, and something good to watch.  Renee should be here soon, so I will be able to go home soon. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.  So, I've done my bit of complaining...thanks for reading, because I'm sure it is really boring.  As there was a three hour time delay since the first two paragraphs....I'm feeling better about life now that I've eaten and a couple beers down the hatch.  I'm looking forward to getting the three day weekend going on.  I know I'm enjoying the last days before we go back on the diet.  I will always enjoy the totally aweful food that is so bad for me....and will add to my hips and thighs....and make me totally ill to my stomach.  God, I remember when I use to enjoy these food and not feel ill.  I feel that something has been stolen now...gah.  Now, I'm on the search for a home gym and free weights...so that means I'm going to get into shape??  WHAT IS THE WORLD COMING TOO?!  At least I still have my beer and wine...for 5 more days.    So, this is me not whining....I really suck at it, don't I?  Don't worry....it always can get worse.
