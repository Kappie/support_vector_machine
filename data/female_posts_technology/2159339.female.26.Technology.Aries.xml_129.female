You see, I had this great plan to start bringing lunch to work every day - I even purchased a Costco shitload of tupperware. I figured I'll eat healthier, spend less and feel really good about myself. But then I realized  that it's never going to happen. Because I am too lazy/busy to plan ahead and I HATE leftovers. So instead, I will now get my lunch from the freezer at Walgreens across the street. Usually I pay at least $7 for my mid-day face-stuffing. These little frozen creations run only $2-3 and require no planning. And  little  is the operative word. Today I had Lean Cuisine Swedish Meatballs  Pasta, which I rate 3 out of 5 stars. It lacked salt and the portion was too small. Instead of Lean, they should call it Tiny Cuisine as I could have easily polished off three of those. But not bad as far as reconstituted meat is concerned.   I just told Jann, my work mama, about my plan and she is horrified. She's throwing grapefruit slices across the divide. I think I also heard her say "I would rather die than eat that shit." That's ok, I'm not offended. I secretly think she's jealous of my plans to get Stouffer's Mac 'N Cheese tomorrow.
