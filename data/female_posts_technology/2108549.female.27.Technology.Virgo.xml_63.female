I saw the ortho surgeon Wednesday and it seems like I will eventually need to have another surgery.  My pinkie is *scissoring* over my ring finger and frequently gets stuck.  While its not causing any extra damage, it is painful when it gets stuck and quite embarassing.   I spent last night dealing with the landlord and all his lies.  I don't like the situation and am looking into what options I have available to move to.  I love the apartment, I hate moving, I love the setup of the place as it was promised, I hate the landlord.  Its all a mess.   On a funky note,  urlLink this  looks fun.
