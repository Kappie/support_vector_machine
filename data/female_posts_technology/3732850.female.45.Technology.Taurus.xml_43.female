I stayed home. In January this year, I somehow got started in school and my self esteem has increased. It's been hard because I am a single mom and tire easily because I also have Lupus, an immune disease. At present, this is in remission. I only planned on school and taking care of my kids. I had no interest in finding someone in my life. This didn't happen. I was helping my friend get ready for an aution sale and she had company stop in. He wanted me to meet this guy. I wouldn't agree to the blind date deal but I would meet him if he were to come with. I had a bad experience on a blind date and this turned me from ever going on another one. This guy seems really nice but is not divorced. He had been separated nine months and I think today is actually when the divorce is final. I've been seeing him for about a month now. For the first week he called me everyday and was also over everyday. I found it hard to get my school work done because he would stay until 11:00 p.m. or later and then go home. One time he called and asked about us and I told him the truth. I really have been getting mixed messages and don't have time for anyone in my life right now. I got a bad feeling and within minutes he was over. Thank goodness I was at my friends. He stayed for three and a half hours. He did take the kids to the park but my friend told me not to leave so I didn't. I thought it was over. He called leaving a message to call him back. I didn't. Friday, the last day of speech, my friend rode back to clearbrook with me. She lives in Bemidji but her parents live in clearbrook. She is one whosmokes and it was late. There was no place to stop but the Leonard bar and this guy was waiting for me. Before she got out of the car he came out and gave me the dirtiest look. She went in for hercigarettes and he came over. He told mehow rudeIwas on Wednesday. I thought it was rude of him to come over and I let him know it. He told me it would work and of course talked me into going tothe Besida Bar and Grill for supper and talk things over. We never did talk much but had prime rib which was delicious. We went toSportsmans Lodge afterand danced. On the way there,he talked of his drunken, soon to be ex-wife. I hear of her everyday and finally told him if I got to listen to one more word i'm going to get mad. I did. I let him have it and told him of my divorce. He said,  "See, you do the same thing." Oh, if nothing made me more mad that did and to top it offhe told me to get over it. This really pissed me off because I have been divorced five years, joined a supportgroup for divorced, widowed, and separated and felt much better and I am glad to be over mine. There was another incident soon after thatI would say was about a week ago. He told me Ihad problems and worded it justright to piss me off again. I told him to stay out of my life and I didn't need this. Just stay away from me and leave me alone. It didn't work. The waterpump went out on his pick-up and today I am going to try work up my nerve to end it again. I went out saturday night. I am not a drinker but I'm glad I was drinking and by myself that night. I had a lot of fun and stayed at a cabin so I didn't drink and drive. Ithink I was drinking just to get all the worries off my mind and this doesn't make me proud to drink. I just don't like it but that night something got into me and I drand windsor cokes. I had four. More than enough for me becauseI am a non-drinker. It hitme hard. This guy just wants tobe friends but gives me mixed signals and turns this around on me saying I am doing this to him. I see his good points in how he is a good worker, keeps his house clean and takes care of his kids. His bad point is he wants to see me all the time. Last time, he said I should just put school off.I told himnot achance. Anyway, I how I get this worked out soon before I get sick and my Lupus flares up.
