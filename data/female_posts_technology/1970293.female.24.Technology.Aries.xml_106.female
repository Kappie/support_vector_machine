The forest filled with tall trees, bushes low to the ground, and rocks created a shadowy atmosphere that hid many secrets.  They stopped to take a break to eat some bread that Aidan brought with him.  "Morrigan, what is it like to use the craft?"  Aidan asked before chewing on another bite of bread.  "The craft is dangerous.  I have this power to do pretty much anything I want for good or evil.  It is my choice after all but I also know that whatever I send out I will recieve times three in return.  Of course those of us who use their power to do bad sometimes don't recieve their due for a long time but always eventually they do.  Even if it is in the afterlife they get their just reward."  Morrigan took a bite of her bread and smiled at Aidan.  "So during this period of your life, you must choose your way?"  Aidan took another bite and looked around the forest.  Something didn't seem right.    "Yes I get to choose.  It's always been this way in my family.  Though I am a little late but I do choose to perform good things if I choose to use my craft."  A branch snapped causing them to scramble up and look around.   "There."  Morrigan pointed a little to the left from the direction they just came.  Aidan pushed her down and squatted beside her as a handful of people could be seen through the trees.  The people beat the bushes as they passed and looked around as though searching for something or someone.  Morrigan looked at Aidan with concern and squeezed his arm tightly.  Aidan grabbed their stuff and pulled Morrigan with him as he ran between the trees and bushes squatted low to the ground.    Soon they stopped to look behind once more to see if the people saw them.  "Are they looking for us?"  Morrigan whispered quietly in Aidan's ear.  "I believe they are.  At least they are doing the things that are normally done to look for someone though beating the small bushes defeats my thinking."  Aidan whispered quietly with a shrug.    "I know why they are beating the bushes.  Some witches are known to be shapeshifters though it taxes the strength leaving the witch defenseless when she returns to her natural form."  Morrigan answered quietly.  "Can you do that?"  He asked amazed.  "I know how though I've never tried.  It's very dangerous.  We better hurry on.  We need to get to the dark forest before the villagers find us."  Morrigan grabbed her things and darted through the brush.    Morrigan heard Aidan keep up with her as she darted between bushes to the edge of the forest.  She broke out into the late afternoon sun and ran flat out for the dark forest across the clearing.  She heard Aidan pounding behind her and shouts coming from the edge of the forest behind her on the right.  She ran harder even though she felt a sharp pain grab her side almost causing her to bend over.  She stopped at the edge to look behind to make sure the villagers weren't going to follow.  Aidan stopped behind her and looked back too.  The villagers stood there at the edge watching to make sure they entered, she guessed.  She gave a cheery wave and stepped forward into the unknown.
