Doh!   Why can't my husband put things AWAY and/or BACK WHERE HE GOT THEM FROM? Is this a hard concept; am I being anal?  Don't answer that.   How come this 70+ woman at the gym last night had a better body than I did?   Can I keep up my savings habits and still have fun?   The fact that I cannot seriously look for another job until after my Pinas trip next year since I want those three weeks off   Am I slowly going crazy? Don't answer that either
