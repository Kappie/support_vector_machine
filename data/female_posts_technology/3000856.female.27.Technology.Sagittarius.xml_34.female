It is none of my business, but the thing that pisses me off is, she is mad at me because I lied when in fact she herself is living a lie. Too much frigin drama. I have spent so much time w/ all of this guilt and remorse and for someone who I don't think knows what the truth is anymore! I am going to the show tonight. If she shows up well.... I don't even care if she shows up to be honest w/ you. Last night was interesting went to the Iguana after practice. Some of my friends were up there for karaoke. Jake kind of flaked on me and  put me in an awkward situation. He is a great friend and a good kid, but I could never ever date him for many reasons and how do I go about telling him this w/ out ruining our friendship? Yikes I hate situations like these. That is the only down fall of most of my friends being male.  There is a chance they may start to like you on a different level and could put you in a strange situation. Oh geeze. I just want one area in my life to be normal!
