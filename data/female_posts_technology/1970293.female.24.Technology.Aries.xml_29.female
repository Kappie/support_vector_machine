She can't remember the last time when she was well enough to go outside to walk through the grass and flowers.  She felt her mood deepen further into depression and despair.  There was no end to the coughing and spitting up.  Every muscle in her body ached and she could feel herself wasting away as each day went by.  The village doctor did everything possible for her to no visible effect except that she worsened everyday.  Soon she would fall asleep and fall into a dream in which she would never wake.  It was no longer a bad thought but a good one filled with no pain and lots of rest.  She lifted a frail, shaking hand to push her tangled, greasy hair away from her face.  She closed her tired blue eyes, took a deep breath, and drifted off to sleep.  Her chest rose and fell for a last time as her spirit finally found release from its weak vessel to rise up and beyond all earthly wants and needs.
