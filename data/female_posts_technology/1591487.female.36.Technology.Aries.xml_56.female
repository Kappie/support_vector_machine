I refuse to unravel shit this time and they can just be kooky for all I care. Honestly, as if there aren't enough rules and regulations in life, I'm not going to be dictated to by some dogmatic manifesto of a knitting pattern dammit!   Also I think I've realised that I can't drink coffee after 6pm. This has officially put me in the category of 'old person' I think. Long gone are those wild days of sucking up the espresso at 11pm and still being able to sleep like a log immediately after.   Uh uh, not anymore. Like last night, having a lovely latte after dinner at about 8:45pm, and then lying in bed approximately two hours later with my eyes wide open a la 'A Clockwork Orange' with a procession of ridiculous thoughts running through my mind such as " I wonder if there'll be any Craisins at the supermarket tomorrow because I want to make muffins' or 'I don't know if I can buy a new bike because some assembly is required' and "will I like any of the summer fashions this year?".   Clearly, this is not going to stop me drinking coffee, all I need to do is ensure I have my quota before 6pm. I wonder if I'll get any work done?   Sadly, though I have to admit (and this is not good as the daughter of Italian migrants who mainline espresso every five minutes of the day) I've been drinking a lot of those 'fake' coffees in sachets. I try really hard not to think about the froth in those things. As in, what exactly makes it go frothy when 'real' froth on a coffee is just aerated milk. I don't even want to begin to imagine the composition of the 'froth-making' chemicals. I do wonder about the person who's job it was to chemically approximate real coffee froth. How do work that out? Do you do a 'CSI' and put random samples of froth into zip lock bags and race back to the lab? Or would you have to go and do a barista course first? Who knows? I wonder where I can find out?   And while I'm on the subject, I've also been having a lot of Cup-A-Soups, you know the ones, packets of something pretending to be 'Hearty Beef and Vegetable' or 'Seafood Bisque'. Again, not really wanting to know the exact composition of that shit. I mean, who are they kidding? Sodium and dehydrated onion bits do not a 'hearty' soup make, do they? Yet, they are oddly delicious. And really, it's all so 21st century isn't it? Hey presto, instant food! In one cup! Fantastic and oh so modern!   I told you I had nothing to say.
