(Kar, do you think  Jerry Yan  is already home/back in Taiwan?)  "Ummm,  ambot  (Bisaya word for "I don't know")  "Three days  daw sya dito e. Siguro nakarating na yun sa Taiwan. " (They say that he will stay here for three days. Maybe he has arrived in Taiwan already.) And she proceeds to hum the theme song of  Amazing Twins .
