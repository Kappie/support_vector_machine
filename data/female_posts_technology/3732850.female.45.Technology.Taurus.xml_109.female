She writes from how she feels he sees her, and wants her to act. After reading this essay "I Want A Wife" the reader can tell that this relationship isn't a two way ordeal, it's more of the wife doing all the giving and the husband doing all the recieving. Basically the only similarities betweent them are that they both are living for "him". She's working to care for him, and so is he. For most women this essay could be quite similar to their own lives, how the husband are so dependant upon their wives.Growing up and seeing how my parents are together, I can say this essay is nothing like them. My parents are equal with everything, they share all the responsibilities, and really respect eachother.  I liked this essay because it was true. It was written from experience, and after reading it, I could tell that the writer wrote this because she needed to get her feelings out. She probable felt it was the only way she could be heard, and understood.
