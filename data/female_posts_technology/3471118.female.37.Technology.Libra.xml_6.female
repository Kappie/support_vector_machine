You will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. 13 The LORD will make you the head, not the tail. If you pay attention to the commands of the LORD your God that I give you this day and carefully follow them, you will always be at the top, never at the bottom.   More of God's promises...  He will make us prosperous in our lives (using examples more relevant to the times, but also applicable to our lives today).  We will be blessed in everything that we do in God's name.  We will have enough to loan to others, but won't need to borrow from anyone.  God will put us first, not last.  If we do God's will, do the things he wants us to do, we will always be on top, not at the bottom.  God will take care of us.
