Now there’s an anti superhero guaranteed to create nightmares, therapy and children who grow up to become cartoon show writers and use the word bizarro repeatedly as the dialog for an entire episode of sealab 2021.  By saving the planet I mean recycling. I suck at that. It’s  hard . Am I evil because I don’t recycle? Or just a lazy cow. I went to grade school in the early 70’s (make that a lazy,  haggard  cow) where I attended classes on recycling. I.am.not.kidding. Every day with a text book and posters of woodsy the owl and every other bit of tree hugging madness the rest of you think was embellished for television. I remember thinking it was just another thing I’d never need to know once I grew up. Just like dodgeball, math and this game all the girls played where we would get out our tubes of lipgloss and see who could get the shiniest lips and who had the fruitiest smelling lipgloss.   (Oh side story! This one girl fascinated me because her situation was beyond the realm of anything I could conceive. She always had 5 or 6 bottles of lipgloss-yes, it came in glass bottles with a little plastic roily ball for application ease and a screw off top-because her parents would buy her as many bottles as she wanted. Her brother kept taking them, popping out the roily ball and drinking them. Her name was Tawny, his name was Tawn and they were twins. This is all true, they were freaks and I grew up in Tennessee.) Anyway (heavy sigh), I wish I’d paid more attention to those lipgloss lessons. At least now I’d be able to get more…um, shiny lips. I quit using aerosol cans (possibly because they quit making them) and a lot of really good stuff came in those things. And I always cut up the plastic rings from six packs so that the Beluga whales or manatees (they’re the same, right?) and the tuna fish won’t choke on them during oil spills. Sometimes I use old magazines and comic books as wrapping paper. And I always leave crappy paperbacks places where other people can take them and enjoy them, instead of throwing them out the car window. You should see the load of crappy paperbacks I’ve been saving to dump in the doctors’ waiting room when I go for my hag year check up. I would like to be able to buy those fancy pants light bulbs that save you a bazillion dollars a year and last for forty years but the last time I looked they only came in *unacceptable wattages. And were stupid expensive. (*Acceptable wattage = I can hold my hand up to the bulb and see my bones through the skin.) God this has gotten out of hand. Let’s sum up by saying I am taking baby steps towards saving the planet and I’m not evil, just casually wicked. And now, onto the linkin’ logs.Watch out for the pork madness!   urlLink ew, just really,EW       urlLink politically active women need panties too you know.        urlLink The perfect gift for your evil friends who are on the highway to hell      McFly's gonna wet her pants when she sees this(and possibly Veronica as well).    urlLink More people using their powers for evil instead of good.     Just to show you I'm not the most obsessed person on the planet about Spike.    urlLink A bigger freak than me!     Some of these links were stolen (oh, who am I kidding, they were  all  stolen)by digging deep within a link Fred sent me. Fred got the link from her friend but I forgot the friends' name so she doesn't get an alias. Besides, every time I try to give credit for stuff I get a bunch of crap for improper credit assignment so now I can't be bothered. (Well, just this one last time, thanks Fred!) And thanks Rhoda for inspiring me to actually read the tutorial on making words and phrases into the links. You are so clever, I saw it on your blog. And thanks for being a big sucker and adding my name to the list of people that can write in your blog! When I get tired of mucking my blog up I can have a go at yours.    urlLink My very favorite dirty whore    I finally got to see the Buffy musical episode (thanks yet again Fred)and so, having just proven I'm not the biggest geek on the block, I'll end this rant with my, at least so far, favorite quote from it. "If my heart could beat it would break my chest but I can see that you're unimpressed so leave me be and let me rest in peace"-Spike
