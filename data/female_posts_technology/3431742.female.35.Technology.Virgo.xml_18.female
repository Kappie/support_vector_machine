I slowly unpacked all the stuff...wait I'm still dragging my feet on some stuff.  Ah well that is what a single girl can do. It was totally sweet to come home to a clean apt.  I so love it.  Did I already mention my babies missed me terribly?  Well they did and I loved every second of it.  Also found out that the helper dude that I had (yes that's past tense there) missed me as well.  He wasn't used to doing all of it.  He just did the imaging and reimaging and I took care of everything else.  He did most of the job most of the time.  My "backup" would tell him that he was too busy.  Yeah right!  He's too busy doing his schoolwork on company time.  I'm all for screwing around now and then but get the work done first.  Leaves more time for screwing around.  As for more work info, my boss decided to bring in a guy while I was out.  The person has his MCSA.  Only to find out later, not to my happiness, that he's a paper mcsa.  The best part was his first day.  Helper dude was showing him the ropes.  When he opened a laptop he asked where the power button was.  I knew I was in trouble from that moment on.  It took the combination of my helper dude and myself to convince my boss that this is not the time to give someone a chance to learn.  So now I have a new helper dude starting Monday.  He's done this work before. Finally a bright person so I can get something done around there.  This week was quiet and I like that.  Not sure how this week will end up but I hope to have din w/ a friend I haven't seen since she quit.    Well it's off to get dinner in my humble pad.  What's in your bathroom? (The one closest to the bedroom)
