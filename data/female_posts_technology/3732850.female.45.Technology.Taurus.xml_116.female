One example is how the media preys on public interest by posing difficult questions which catch the interviewees off guard. When we as listeners hear these questions, we assume this is the generally held opinion of our society.  She points out that the path to truth is not necessarily as easy as it appears. There are many ways we try to get there, including public discourse, finding the weak spots in the people you are debating and trying to find “the other side.”  This is definitely an easy essay to relate to the real world. Face it, we do these things. We argue just to argue. We attack another’s point of view just because it doesn’t tango with ours. We even lie sometimes because we are just so sure we know the other person is not telling the truth. We can have no way of knowing for sure what another is thinking or that they are intentionally lying.  I loved the illustration of the irate talk show guest. I have always been disgusted with anger-driven talk shows where none of the issues are really presented and it’s all a bunch of screaming fanatics who don’t listen to a single word of what the other person is saying, except to attack it and call them raving lunatics. It’s sad that it has gotten to this point. People don’t want to hear both sides, they want to see these “distinguished guests” holler near obscenities at each other. Arguing for just for the sake of it.  Justification for inappropriate behavior. The first paragraph illustrated this. When a journalist was asked why she had to attack others so she could be right, she replied, “It’s an argument.”   This essay got me thinking about my own life personally. I don’t want to end up a bitter old woman with opinions so set that she is blinded to what might really be true. I liked this lengthy line, “But when opposition becomes the overwhelming avenue of inquiry, when the lust for opposition exalts extreme views and obscures complexity, when our eagerness to find weaknesses blinds us to strengths, when the atmosphere of animosity precludes respect and poisons our relations with one another, then the culture of critique is stifling us.”  It really sums up the whole point of his essay. I’m not sure if this is what Julie meant by putting the ideas behind essays into real life. Sorry if I misunderstood!
