He always made her feel that he was laughing at her.  It made her so uncomfortable to be around him.  "Why don't I walk with you for a while then."  Ty stared walking beside her.  "If you wish."  Shari groaned silently.  She looked at him.  He was a few inches taller than her with blue hair.  Of course he would have to follow the multitudes and dye his hair.  That was so like him.  Mr. Popular.  She shook her head.  "So why are you walking out here in the corridors?"  He combed his fingers through his hair as he looked at her.  "My parents.  They are driving me nuts just because I like to read and spend time in my room.  They seem to think I have no life when I am perfectly happy with mine."  Shari complained.    "Yeah my parents are like that too.  They want me to be a doctor and are dismayed everytime I bring my grades home.  They keep forgetting that I am not quite old enough to be a doctor yet even if I wanted to be one which I don't.  At least not a doctor of their particular fields."  He shook his head.  "I didn't know your parents are pressuring you too.  Why do they do that?  I realize that they are only trying to look our for us but pressure isn't going to help.  It's just going to make us more determined not to be pushed.  Now I have to help out in the labs every day after school starting next week."  Shari sat down on a bench outside of the library.  "You too?  I thought I was the only one."  He sat down beside her.  "I guess we'll be working beside each other doing the exciting task of washing beakers."  He said with a slight tone of sarcasim.  Shari laughed.  "Maybe we can make it a little fun.  Either that or they will throw us out calling us lost causes.  Now that would be nice."  Shari giggled as she said that.    "I don't know.  It really could be fun.  At least it would be different.  We live on a station and there isn't that much to do.  I heard that you read all the time so that probably does entertain you but I don't like to read unless I am really interest in the book so I have lots of time on my hands.  Probably why I am always in trouble."  He grinned at her.  "Yeah I do like to read.  I am also running out of books.  My parents have also threatened to stop buying my books."  Shari sighed.  "I guess we will have to make the most of it.  Well I have to get home before my parents get mad at me.  I really don't want that on top of everything else."  Shari smiled at him and started back the way she came.  She looked back to see him wave from the bench.
