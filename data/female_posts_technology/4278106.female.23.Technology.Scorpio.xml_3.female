Saddest thing is that this artist might turn out to be just like the rest, rush for money, fame. Althou I should hand it to her - her voice is angelic and beautiful. Time will tell.  My boyfriend seems to be going thru mood swings, heck even worse than myne - my excuse is my hormone medication, he's I have no idea. I had so many things to write about this morning and found that there was nobody to E-mail or call. Cause the friendship circle I have is so limited and my passion for music overcomes any wants or needs to have anybody else in my life.  I caught a breath of releaf at the image of me in the mirror, felt I wasn't alive anymore and couldn't grasp the concept of my life for a breaf period of time. Everything is spinning so fast yet slowly altogether @ the same time. Iwant success yet I want it today and not 3 years down the line. I need someone stabding by me, yet not too close to feel my thoughts.  There is plenty I need done, to prove to this 3rd world rated country that I have what it takes, to stand at the top of mount success and say "I worked for this - just so as I can replace the things that God forgot to give me" I am a woman of many talents and gifts, so now I leave to make love to my guitar and let my mind flow with poetry. Today I will smile again. It's not self pitty I give out, but my dreams
