So, over the past couple of days, I have hit the driving range and the batting cage.  That may not seem like a lot to some people.  For me however, it's pretty major.  The thing to know, is that as a child I was riddiculed and made fun of for my lack of athletic talent.  I had no understanding or comfort level with any sport.  I was always picked last for a team.  Always.  And when it came time to play, I was petrified of making a fool of myself.  Talk about shakey and nervous.  So at 34, I've finally realized I'm over it.  :o)  It doesn't matter how good or bad I am, just that I try.  So with my pal Casandra's help, I'm hitting golf balls and smacking softballs.  And yes, I have actually hit a few.  AND I'M TICKLED PINK!!!   Yes it will take some effort on my part to improve my swings and get comfortable in the activity.  It's worth it.  Last night was cool, because it felt good to hit those softballs with the bat.  And then roomie Doug and I went to hit some more golf balls.  It's amazing the difference a shorter club (I'm only 5'4") and a tee can make.  I actually got the balls up in the air and further than 75 yards!  I'm loving my new adventures, and plan to add them to my list of fun things.  Next paycheck I'm hitting the go carts.  Never done that before either.  Look out Dale jr!  Roomie Doug is going through a bunch of change in his life with the finishing school, getting his doctors license, practicing at a new office, and getting his life back on track.  We spend a lot of time talking.  Okay, he talks and I do a lot of listening.  I do throw in some thoughts every so often.  On one side, I envy him his plethora of options.  On the other side, I wouldn't want to be faced with so many choices.  He's definitely got a lot to think about, so my new found sports interest will hopefully keep him entertained while he figures out where he wants to go with his life next.   It feels good to be able to support someone and to be there when they need to talk.  As for me, well I'm back to the online dating thing.  Am chatting with a few people.  One has good potential.  Of course I've already had 2 coffee dates for this week scheduled and cancelled.  The 3rd one has been scheduled for Saturday, so we'll see if it makes it.  I'm still pondering that loneliness issue.  It's not as strong or overwhelming for me right now.  Still a small thought in the back of my mind though.  Work has seen some changes.  One of our lead developer guys is going to work in another office.  It's brought up some team communication issues that we need to work through.  I still feel really good about the work we are doing and the things we are accomplishing.  Right now it feels like everyone is getting along better, and we are doing greater things than we have since I've been here.  It's a great thing to experience.  On the totally not deep and thought provoking front, After a day of 105 degree temperatures (that's what the thermostat in Rex's car said at lunch), Nashville had some freaky weather move through last night.  High winds and electricity outings before the rain even hit.  Very bizarre.  All my peoples are okay thankfully.  On the completely shallow front....my fingernails are looking really great and I haven't broken a one in all the batting and golfing activity.  I do believe they'll end up with a french manicure before the week is out.  :)  I'm off to a quick lunch and an all afternoon meeting.    Happy Wednesday!
