For example, a college friend you're carpooling with happens to have a first-degree uncle who has a high position in the police force or military. You get caught by the cops for speeding a red light, and your friend just shows him his uncle's calling card, and you're off the hook.  On the other hand, remember when you read in the newspaper about this politician who got away with not paying taxes because he had connections...while you slave away at your desk and work hard to earn your keep, and pay your taxes, and live hand-to-mouth to save?  Well, the same abuse of power and position happens in the workplace. All the time. And some times are more bearable than others.  Example 1: You work as a day-shift nurse in a public hospital and have a friend who happens to be the night-shift manager. One day, he requests you to do overtime because one of his nurses called in sick. You say yes because: 1> he's your friend 2> he's a night-shift manager  IN THIS ORDER. You don't do it primarily because you fear he's gonna rat you out as being unhelpful. You say yes because you know what this means to him and his workload. And the nice buddy that you are, you help him out.  Example 2: You work in the quality control arm of Product A of a commercial food company. However, you used to work as an assistant marketing person for the same Product A of the same commerical food company. You inspect the work practices quarterly and make your report. Based on this, people will be reprimanded/fired/promoted. This quarter, you see that work practices for the Marketing arm of Product A are below standards. You let the manager of that arm know the results (as is protocol....your former manager when you were still at this arm), and he gives you a stern look and tells you exactly what he thinks you should do out of 'PAKIKISAMA'.  Do you report what you find and be ethical? Or do you let your former manager lord his pwoer over you?  I say, let him lick his own ***!  You do what you have to do because it is your job. He cannot presume that just because he used to be at a higher position than you are means that he can still COMMAND you to do stuff for him. For all he knows, he was the reason you wanted to be transferred from that department. Because he was never an effective boss.  And these are the times you hate people who have position and power over you...  But, then again, they will only have power if you let them. If you act all courteous or fall for his 'PAKIKISAMA' routine, then you would have let yourself down and NOT felt good about yourself..nor of him. And you would have given him the power of walking all over you using his position.  My twenty-five cents' worth: 1> Say no 2> Tell him details of where he failed and let him know that you will do your best to try to get Upper Management to listen to his side 3> (if you've got the guts) Tell him "'Pakikisama'? Alam ko yan. Ka-level ata nyan yung 'Trabaho Lang', 'di ba?" 4> Let him know that he can't change the situation now, but he can prevent it from happening again in the future.  I know it's hard being Pinoy most times. But communication is often the key. OPEN communication. Two-sided communication.   Remembering that honesty and integrity will (and should) always win over 'pakikisama' or any other cultural norm. And that power is just a state of mind.  Besides, like the anonymous non-person said 'F*** da norm'! (Feet daw ba?...yech...I HATE FEET!!!!!!!!!!!)
