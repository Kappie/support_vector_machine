I don't care what anyone says about the end of the game getting rained out. The Cubs would have won regardless, so all you stinking Sox fans can go cry to someone who fucking cares! LOL Laundry done, did some work on my car and worked more on the songs.  These songs are gonna make me go insane! Nah. I am just trying to find that final something! I got this crazy email from Matt. It was really funny, especially coming from him. I kept saying Mike was corrupting him! ha ha ha Mike emailed me in his defense of course! LOL I fell down the ouitside stairs at my sisters house. All I can say to that is .........OUCH! Man that hurt. My back is all sore now. I hope to god there is no damage. Ok well I need to get some shut eye. Happy 4th everybody!
