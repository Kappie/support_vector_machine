I had Denyelle in the car and we were heading to the superstore for groceries during rushhour and some lady rear-ended me on Dundonald Street. Being so packed in, I hit the car ahead of me as well.     We were lucky there was an off-duty cop just around the corner who came and helped us move our cars and told us what information to have on hand. An officer showed up and wrote out the report.     Nobody was badly hurt and no air bags went off, thank goodness. My poor friend Denyelle has just finished recovering from injuries suffered at another car accident over a year ago, and so this immediately brought back her whiplash. I had some mild discomfort about an hour after the accident. We both wanted to get checked out right away so we sat at emergency for about three hours just to be told to take some Advil.     Both of my car bumpers are messed up now, hopefully there's nothing else that isn't immediately apparent. The lady that hit me was driving a Volvo, and surprisingly she took more damage than I did. My bumpers both shifted the force of the impact out to the sides, the ends jut out on each side now. On her car, the front light was all smashed out and her hood was pushed up considerably.     I've made the report to my insurance company, and they said the adjuster will be calling tomorrow. Hopefully this won't be a fiasco, I really don't need that right now.
