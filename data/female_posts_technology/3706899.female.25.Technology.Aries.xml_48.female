(How's that for a badly-structured sentence?  You'd never believe I have a degree in English, would you?)  Just a thought I was having while I was starting someone's Christmas present just now.  (I'm making my advisor a mistake-rib scarf in raspberry alpaca.  Mmm, soft.  I have maybe half an inch done now *grin*)  Edit:  The alpaca just told me it doesn't really feel like being mistake rib.  (It tried it for 3/4 of an inch, and they just weren't getting along.  I've got the lean-y back and forth thing going on the columns of single knits.  I totally need to take the master knitters course.)  Maybe feather and fan instead.  Where's my stitch dictionary?
