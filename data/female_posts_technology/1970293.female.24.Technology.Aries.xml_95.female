Bardric bowed slightly to show his respect. "We bother because the Drakken are a dangerous threat. This isn't the first time they appeared in these lands."   "Drakken? Is that what we fight?" The elf said suddenly. He turned and looked at the man. "We will not win against the Drakken. You said they were orcs and ogres. You have deceived us?"   "No we didn't know. The reports we got were fuzzy at best and we thought that since the reports said monsters that they were referring to the orcs and ogres. We have never heard of the Drakken." The man started to get very excited and waved his arms about or at least as much as the armor would allow him.  "Might I make a slight suggestion? How about we disband your knights and soldiers while we have a conference and share information?" Bardric said quickly to stop a panic of everyone in the area.  "That is a fine suggestion." The elf said. Quickly he said something in elvish and all the elves turned to the far end of camp. Apparently it was their camp with all the colorful tents that almost resembled a fair. Suddenly a pale green sailed over Trellian's head to be joined at the tree. Soon there was a tent above their heads as well to keep the sun out.   Soon there was a ring of the top leaders, Bardric guessed. He couldn't be sure. The elves, of course, provided refreshments. They are such a courtesy race. He slid off the dragon's back and perched on a rock beside him. Trellian curled up on the ground with his face lying on the ground to be close to the men and elves.  "Is everyone here?" Bardric asked before beginning.  "Yes, everyone is here that is suppose to be here." The elf answered as he quickly assessed the ring.  "I should start at the beginning so the men can catch up. The Drakken are half dragon and half man. How or why they were made I don't know but in a time long ago, they raided these lands. They destroyed everything in their paths including men, women, and children. Soon everyone knew that something had to be done or else no one would be left. So the elves, dragons, and wizards gathered at a land while men lured all of the Drakken inside of this land. As soon as the Drakken were inside, the elves, dragons, and wizards worked their magic to create a magical border to keep the Drakken inside of this land. Recently someone destroyed the border and left them out. Why, well we can only guess. Anyways that is where we stand now." Bardric held out his hands to show his helplessness.  "Do we know who left them out of their confinement?" The elf asked at last.  "Yes, but he won't be able to help you. He's mad. The magic back lashed and ruined him." Trellian replied quietly.  "We should be thinking of ways to get them back to their lands and how to recreate the border. Trellian and I haven't come up with anything that could possibly help." Bardric said quietly as he looked at Trellian.  The men during this time have been very quiet. Not quite believing what was said and yet they had no choice since no one else was denying anything. Bardric hoped that this wouldn't spark a small confrontation.
