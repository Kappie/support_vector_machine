Dinner was tuna, lite cottage cheese, carrots, and leftover canned tomatoes.Over the courseof the eveningI had a Fruit-to-Go, some raspberries, a few pickles, and a piece of cheese. I went swimming, but I didn't get a whole hour in. I guess I did about 40 minutes. I would have gone for a walk or something to make up the rest of the time, but I am getting a cold and just wanted to sleep. Darn sick boyfriend; always breathing...      I'm getting very antsy to weigh myself. Hey, you know what I haven't had in a long time? A doughnut. That just occurred to me. (I used to eat them almost every day when I was in school.) I don't even want one; neat!
