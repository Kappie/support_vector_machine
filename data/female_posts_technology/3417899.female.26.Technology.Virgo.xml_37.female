Six Israeli soldiers were killed today in Gaza.  "They were armed soldiers" some of you may say. "They were casualties of war" or "they were there to kill". I would disagree with all of the above, but that is beside the point.   The point is what happened next. Body parts being flaunted, a soldier's decapitated head being waved in front of a camera, children stealing body parts: limbs, fingers, torsos - and hiding them so that soldiers will not be buried. Song and dance on the streets of Gaza with bloodied hands waving in the air....  And yet - on CNN - here is what it says:  "...Six Israeli soldiers and seven Palestinians were killed Tuesday in what Israel Defense Forces called a major operation in Gaza City to destroy workshops making Qassam rockets, according to the Israeli military and Palestinian hospital sources. Four of the dead Palestinians were said to be children, according to Palestinian hospital sources...."  (Note: According to other news stations - fox, msnbc, ap wire - the palestininas dead were all armed - but again, besides the point).   The article mentions Palestinians are holding body parts as barganing chips. But it doesn't mention the partying, the bloody head in front of the camera, the teenager waving a limb of a dead soldier.   Not having this mentioned in CNN compounds the horror of the incident for me.   I keep wondering: what if the tables were turned? - If, G-d forbid, these were American soldiers' bodies?  - If these were Israeli masses mutilating Palestinian bodies?  what then?
