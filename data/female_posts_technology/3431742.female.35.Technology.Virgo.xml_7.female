Maybe there should be more than one movie at the north budget. :p  It's so sad that going to see all these great movies lately that I know the commercials and previews that will be showing.  One benie is that you do hear/see about new movies like Collateral with Tom Cruise.  It looked interesting.  Can remember when it's out so please don't ask.  For those that wanna know, I'm heading to Summerfest the following days to see the following: Thursday - Night Ranger, Friday - Rufus Wainwright, Saturday - Tantric, Monday - Joan Jett and The Blackhearts, Tuesday - Kenny Wayne Shepherd/Saliva, Wednesday - Tesla, Sunday (4th) - Fuel.  Figured the fireworks will be the 3rd per usual.  Figures the night that I want to check email and do a post there are Tornado warnings.  That's my luck.  Going on vacation with the fam in about three weeks.  Won't be posting then so get your fill now. :)  I'll be lucky to get a signal in the great up-north.  As for the other great vacation, seriously if anyone does want to join me in Fiji, let me know now.  I'll be actually booking/ticketing the great wide adventure Sunday or Monday the latest.  Any questions,  urlLink email me .  I can almost not wait.  I'm just about ready to pack just for Fiji. I bought a new piece of luggage.  It has a detachable front backpack and the entire piece is on rollers and can become a med/lg backpack.  It's very cool.  Ok I have to go and do more magazine reading so I don't fall too far behind on that.  Like I'm near getting caught up, yeah right!  QUESTION of fun o'rama:  What non-sexual things do you do to make the day/minute/moment fun for yourself?
