I'm actually drunk...so it doesn't make a difference.   - I'm sitting in front of my TV watching SNL in hopes of seeing an Internet star a star...and Jack Black. Damn he's funny..although I really am not wathcing because I'm busy being drunken and not laughing so I'm not sure what to make of this year's SNL cast
