He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty."   Jesus is pointing out that it was God who provided the manna from heaven, and not Moses, but that God is providing something even better -- Jesus, so that we can have eternal life with him in heaven.  Jesus came down from heaven and gave life to the world, and living in him, believing in him, will give us eternal life, free from hunger or thirst.  Basic concepts to remember and believe in.
