Mostly hers...oh how I miss Lila.  - Seeing Laura's fiance/corporate lawyer bizillionnaire rap to Young MC  Kris Kros on the badass karaoke system, complete with the lyrics guide part on tv. - Zachary's pizza - if you actually add topings, it tastes good after all...try jalapenos - Getting home in time to be in bed by midnight! Thank you sleep, thank you, thank you.
