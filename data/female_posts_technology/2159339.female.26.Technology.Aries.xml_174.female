I was her friend cohort and Eaton (her sweetie) brought his friend Tom and before you knew it, it was just like high school...would have been if we went on double-dates instead of practicing dance routines in her living room and hosting bake-offs against the boys. Tom is a landscape architect who lives in the Mission and likes emo music. We bonded over Sleepy Jackson and "shy clams" (clams that don't pop open when you cook them). He was nerdy, courteous, sweet and handsome. We sat next to each other at the Asian Film Festival Music Videos presentation.  Before that, the four of us shared tapas at a French restaurant, told stories of car breakdowns and Canadian cuisine, and strolled down Fillmore street in the most amazing evening weather San Francisco has ever experienced, complete with lilac smell permeating the air. It might have been perfect if it was June 15th and M was leaving for good and I was looking for something (someone) to take my mind off things. But he’s still here and I’m finding myself getting attached even though I swore up and down that I wouldn’t. He spills champagne on the carpet and brakes the internet, sending me into bitch-mode tirade about "what it means to be responsible".  But all it takes is for him to sign his email 'wuv' or compare our "story" to some cheesy romantic comedy and I can't stay mad. I no longer feel clear-headed, sensible and pragmatic. Instead I feel slightly out of control, anxious and restless and if you tell me it's love I swear to god I'm going to puke this very minute.
