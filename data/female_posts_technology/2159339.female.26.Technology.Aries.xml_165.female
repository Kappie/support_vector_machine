I don't want gauzy billowy sheets or Enya or the sound of the pan flute. I'm teaching XX to stop jumping out of his clothes and instead letting me unbutton and unbelt and unzip and tug and pull and take off... What's the perfect soundtrack for a rhythmless Asian femme?  Air's new album,  urlLink Talkie Walkie . It's slow, pretty, and sexy. I feel right at home slowly taking off XX's clothes while this is on. I can't make love to old soul like "Between the Sheets" or "Smooth Grooves" because it makes me feel cheesy and like I'm acting a part. Like I should move with my hips instead of my elbows. Everyone's got a different style, and while I'm making my own rules for making love, "Talkie Walkie" provides the inspiration.
