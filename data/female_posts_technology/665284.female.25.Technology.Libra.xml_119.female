It's like the soap opera for muscled idiots what with sons, daughters, fathers fighting each other and coming back from the dead.    Sarah lent me  "The House of Sand and Fog" .  I'm not sure if this was made into a movie.  Good storytelling.  A former Persian colonel living in San Francisco.  Bought a house from an auction to start a business of buying houses and selling them again.     "I pass a Filipino maid pushing her cart and I take notice that she smiles.  And even bows her head."   Small ouch.  Filipinos portrayed as a maid again.  Stings, but true.  On the way to Glorietta, I look at the back of the book.   "Becomes obsessed..."   I am not someone that one can get obsessed with.  Comforting thought.
