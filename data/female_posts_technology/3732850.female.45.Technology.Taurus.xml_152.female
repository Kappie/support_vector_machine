In the second paragraph he speaks of them as having, "a reputation for being progressive."  He then goes on to say, "the theater world likes to think of itself as a seeker of such challenges and is proudest when a play or musical becomes a vehicle for change."  It doesn't look like they were being much of a "vehicle for change" as the manager told him he'd have to leave.  It seems that all the people in the arts community couldn't have cared less since no one dared to step forward to help him or defend his right to be there.  I noticed the reinforced authority of the manager as he was holding the copy of "Policy for Disabled Patrons".  The irony of this story is spelled out in the author's last sentence, "Art and theater are nothing if not honest."
