It used to be I would spend all my Friday nights watching reality TV shows at home. Gosh! I can remember how just 2 months ago I was always updated with "Survivor", "American Idol", "America's Next Top Model", "Paradise Hotel", "Joe Millionaire", "For Love or Money" etc. I could never bring myself though to watch "The Bachelor" or "The Bachelorette" though. I think toying with relationships is taking the reality TV show genre too far.  Anyway, last Friday I was invited by some colleagues. I almost didn't go because I really just wanted to go shopping by myself. But then, I saw how my officemate reacted when I said "No." He had that "There you go again avoiding us," look so I said I would go but only stay for dinner.  I joined them for dinner after buying 1 dress at Tang's Mall and 5 books from Borders. Then, I wound up joining them for drinks on Mohammed Sultan Road. So much for saying I would only stay a short while!  We ended up at this bar called Double 00 because Siam Supper Club was full. They were having their anniversary celebration. One thing about Singapore, I've never really liked any of the bars I've been to so far. They all remind me of Greenbelt 2/3. People really dress up and check each other out. Nobody really has fun because they are all too concerned with being hip. I didn't care though because it was a Friday and it is the only day of the week that I can wear casual clothes!   Another thing that I hate about Singapore bars is that men keep trying to pick me up. For others, this would be a good thing except that I am not into meeting strangers in bars. They can also be quite aggressive with it. I'm okay with being nice to people whom other friends introduce to me, but I would never strike up a conversation with someone who just happened to be sitting there before I arrived. It's really not my thing. I just want to be left alone.  Everyone knows I have a reputation for drinking. However, since I wasn't with people I could really trust to take care of me in case I got really drunk, I just had 1 beer and 3 tequilla sunrises. At 2 a.m., I thought we were going home. Instead, people were hungry so we ended up going to Newton Hawker Center and having raw clams, chicken wings, hor fun and carrot cake. Weird combination, but most of it tasted nice.  I stil prefer the nightlife in Manila. People really know how to have fun. They dance, sing and don't just stand around checking out other people. But then, for now this will have to do. As long as I am clear about my limits, then I'll be fine.
