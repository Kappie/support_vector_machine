The colours of the opening ceremonies (by the way, weren't they fantastic today??), the sounds, the sights, the sparkling of all of the camera flashes going off in the stands, the roar of the crowd, the whole world pulling together, uniting for a common denominator of sport and game.   I particularly enjoyed the portion of the opening ceremonies when they had a "pregnant lady" descend down into some water and her belly lit up, representing hope and new life....it was stunning!  I think that some of my favorite Olympic sports to watch include diving, rowing, swimming, but most importantly, the gymnastics.  In fact, I can feel a trip down memory lane coming on...  When I was a little girl, it was the summer Olympics of 1984.  I would have been 6, going on 7.  I was in Maple Creek, staying with my  urlLink cousin , Janine, because I was taking swimming lessons in the summer.  We would play in the backyard, and perform and do gymnastics for my Aunt, Janine's Mom.  We were experts at cartwheels, round-offs (I think that's what they were called), and all sorts of other "interpretive dance" and gymnastic type activities.  Now, our idols, or the people whom we pretended to be were based upon a very scientific method of deciding.  It was the colour and design of our bathing suits!  As I recall, my bathing suit had a criss-cross back, and was royal blue, with red and white.  Therefore, I was none other than Mary Lou Retton!  Now, Janine's bathing suit was red and white striped, so she was Sylvie Berniea (sp?).  Yes, it was good times.   We had a lot of fun back then, and maybe that's just one of the many reasons why I enjoy the Olympic Games.  I wish Canada's athletes the best of luck.  Make us proud and do your best.  That's all we ask.  -J.
