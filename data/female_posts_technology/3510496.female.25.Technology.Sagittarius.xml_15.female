But, the fact that I care, why must it end up in a penalty shoot-out (after 2-2 final score).   Now, Here I am almost droning, not only because of the till-early-morning-up, but because I have yet to get over being smitten by Orlando Bloom in Pirates of Carribean  . I felt like I am 'falling in love all over' again, as similar as I did when he's Legolas in LOTR trilogy. Tihihihihihi..... Johnny Depp's good too and he carried his scripts superbly well. "Because I am Captain Jack Sparrow....."     urlLink Real Simple 's August edition is already out in the library. And I can't help but sharing more of these stuffs.     solutions   | NEW USES FOR OLD THINGS      Double-Duty Pantry Items    rolling pin    ORIGINAL USE:   Rolling dough   AHA!

I especially love to have my nachos with this avocado dip, apart from the salsa one. I know anytime I want it, I can  kapur  it from my company. But let me tell you bought-from the shelf ones usually taste  stale . Fresh made ones are wonderful. Anyway squeezing and stirring a little lemon into it,will eliminates the browning that occurs when guacamole sits.
