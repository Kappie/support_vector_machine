Really thinking if there is a Singapore Idol 2, should I go give it a shot... haha... but the idea of having to queue kills all thoughts... Simply too lazy... guess I am not that desperate yet... but still... it's a chance to stardom for some...  I guess after so many years... i am still me... I still dun have the courage to go for auditions... I still can't forget how I actually went for the hall 7 jam band audition... wouldn't have gone if not for some friends who accompanied me... will always remember the many rounds of audition they put me through... and how i thot i was a goner at the auditions... singing with a sore throat... but the miracle... I got in... the feeling to perform on top of a stage for a crowd is certainly very different... you really need to experience it to understand it. Hope I get a chance to perform again... I really hope... =D It's up there when all my troubles go away... all I can do is try to remember all the words to my song... and concentrate on my singing... no worries... no troubles... free... for that few minutes... free.
