Needless to say it was the result of drunken debauchery, only this time someone had a camera...that and well...this match went on for a while.       actually this picture isn't true to life. 2 seconds later I had flipped him and had "pippo" pinned and calling out for mercy.....hahahahaha. oddly enough his mercy cry was "I'm farting, I'm farting"...you had to be there.
