If you look at all his initials, it's JCC, and we all know what that stands for: Jewish Community Center.  I have a lot of CDs in my collection that others would term "guilty pleasures" but I am proud! They are mine! Sure they may have come about because of my dalliances with questionable women and horny himbos, but they are my legitimate slutty bebes. Yes, I own Jordan Knight's solo album, some N'Sync, and even Christina Aguilera's spanish album, "Mi Reflejo." Yes, I am ten years older than the target demographic, but I am only human. If you prick me, do I not bleed? If you test me with catchy hook-laden pop, do I not succumb? En espanol?    Lyric from JC's new album: "When I'm alone I lie awake and masturbate." Who can resist that? Can a wan and pale indie rocker meet that lyrical daring? C'mon Stuart Murdoch, I challenge thee in the name of Jesus Christ Chasez!
