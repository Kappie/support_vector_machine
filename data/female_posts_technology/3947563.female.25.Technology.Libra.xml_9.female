I told Nick not to let me have any. The pizza arrived and all I had was the crust of two slices! I know it's not an entire success, but it's half way!   I didn't make the gym last night unfortunately - movie started at 7 so raced there after work then spent the night sewing.   Today has been good so far. Grapes and granola bar for breakfast. Thai chicken skewers for lunch (@ new thai restaurant in the AMC complex) with rice and spring roll. I'm eating some almonds as we speak right now for a snack. Dinner I plan on salad and stirfried veggies.
