Which is good enough for me. It's much easier to think of an excuse for why something is not done than to spend my off time doing it.   On Friday, Marcus and I went to eat french food. To help him use up his gift certificate, we each got a 4 course meal (with "tasting fish"), some champagne and lots of wine. I got some interesting looks from other patrons who were probably wondering if we were on a date. He's old enough to be my father, perverts! Ok, so the good news - Marcus wants to go ice climbing in Canada for two months and agreed to let me look after his business. Even better news - if I make patterns that are halfway decent, he'll pass them on his japanese clients. Plans have been made for this Wednesday to visit the sweatshop..er..factory to learn how to 'inspect garment quality' and meet some peeps. Also on Wednesday is Wendy's memorial lunch, so I think I'll be sick that day.
