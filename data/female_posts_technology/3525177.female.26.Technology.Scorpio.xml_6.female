But, when they throw up all down your side and onto your foot...the "ICK" factor makes you think twice about having your own.    Yes - spit up between your toes is definitely something that makes you stop and think about whether or not that extreme life style change is something you want to be a part of.  Of course, then they look up at you and smile.  Your heart becomes a puddle of "AWWW" gooiness, and you hug them close and say, "Oooh - I want one of these".    If you are truly intended to pro-create, the little darling *won't* puke on you a second time.  If, however, they choose that moment to splatter you again with breast milk - you may wish to avoid the experience. No, JL didn't treat me to anymore viscious spit up.  But it was sufficient enough an "ICK" moment to last me the entire week.  What else:  Oh, yeah - Cajun Snow is the BEST place in all of Little Rock to get snow cones.  The grape is my current favorite.  It's nestled in Hillcrest. Look for the oodles of people standing around a shack.  Hasta la Pasta, cutesox
