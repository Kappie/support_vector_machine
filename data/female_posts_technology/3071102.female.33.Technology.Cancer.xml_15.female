I am not understanding why the game has not been called off because it is incredibly windy and the ground is incredibly wet... not to mention it appears as if the sky will dump buckets upon us VERY, VERY, VERY soon. And my biggest beef is the time of the game... not until 6:30PM. I am dreading this game, as we play different teams every week, but they are continuously the same people over and over and over again. Can we hold onto our top slot?
