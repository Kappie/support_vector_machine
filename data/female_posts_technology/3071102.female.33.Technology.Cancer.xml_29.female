It's my vacation, and I am just going to see family (well not just...), but still I am hyped. I have packed, and of course it is after midnight as I type, there are, of course, things that only can be done in the am... that bathroom stuff.  I need to wake up early, but here I sit, typing away at the computer, inexplicably. There are, of course, things that I could do.  Perishables in the fridge, yeah, I suppose that the tuna won't last 10 days, do you?  Or that lime... or the basil, and thyme.  Maybe if I can keep this group of plants alive I can rationalize fresh herbs outside on the balcony. And the cats have already created a fur duplicate of themselves on the rug.  They will have another before my friend comes to actually stay the night and sit with them.  So, I could vacuum. MMmmmm, the longer that I think about it, the sleepier I grow.  Perhaps THAT is why I am tapping away at the computer.
