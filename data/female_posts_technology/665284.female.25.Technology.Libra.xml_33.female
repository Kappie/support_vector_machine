I was more into anime kasi and my money went to other things during my school days.    So what is this about?  This is a thank you.  Your work is wonderful at kuha nyo ang humor ng Pinoy.  You certainly got mine.  I love the stories.  Although I draw, I am not much into criticizing the "technical" details of other's works.  Kinakain ko yung story.  My favorite is Pasig, but I like all stories.  Nakahiram ako ng backissues from a friend of mine.  Certainly if I can find some issues to buy for myself e go na.  Advantage sa situation ko ngayon e hindi ko napagdadaanan ang frustration ng mga fans habang naga-antay ng susunod na issue.  Well, not until I read the 9th.  Then I'd scream for more.  And wait.  I hope not to wait too long.  As with an artist friend, kung kaya ko lang mag sponsor I'd sponsor CCCom.  Pasensya na ito lang muna ang mabibigay ko.  My dreams for you guys and buying the issues.  Ofcourse I'll send this through e-mail once I confirm what the addy is.
