Throughout the essay, she gave many examples of all the things that she would like a wife to do if she could have one. I think that what she was really saying is that she wanted some recognition and appreciation for all the things she does for everyone else on a daily basis. She wanted someone to pamper her and make sure that everything was taken care of for her. I think the idea of this essay is to make us aware of all the things the "woman" or "wife" is expected to do for the family. Why is it the wife that always has to make the sacrifices? Why is it the wife that thinks of everyone else first? This essay is so typical of families today. There are certainly exceptions to this stereo-typical relashionship between husband and wife, but for the most part, I am sure that a lot of "wives" can relate to what the author is talking about. I liked the way the author ended the essay. I think what she was saying was, not only did her husband not appreciate her and all she does for him and the family, but he expects more. Somehow her husband puts no importance on his wives wants and desires. I never thought about it, but maybe I would like a wife also. :)
