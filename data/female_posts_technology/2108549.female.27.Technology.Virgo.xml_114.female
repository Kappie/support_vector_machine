She came back to my place, watched Uptown Girls while I picked up the apartment and then she, Ju and Ju's nephew E (age 10) and I walked down to Old Sac, ate caramel apples (a first for the kids) and wandered around.  Came back, BBQed and then the kids came back to my place to watch Dickie Roberts.  Ok, that movie was so funny.  I normally don't care for David Spade but it was way funny.  Walked E back to Ju's around midnight and then crashed.  Got up this morning around 8, made breakfast for K, and then we headed to church.  They were doing the water baptism today at Goethe park and it was way cool. While at church, we picked up V (age 19), the daughter of one of Ju's friends and she and I got baptized.  Her reaffirmation, the first time for me.  After that we ate lunch and headed back here.  K had to be home by 4:30 so V, K and I drove out to Antelope, dropped K off and then V came back with me and we watched In America.  Weird but good movie.  Very strange though. I dropped V off around 8:30 and I am headed to bed shortly.    I'm beat, Freedom is worn out.  Off to bed we go.
