I first saw this blog thing when I joined the  urlLink Sun Star News Forum  some time back in June. I came across the blog of one of the members and I thought this was a pretty cool concept. I'm starting my blog, and this radiohead tune "YOU" is still stuck in my head and has been for days…" you are the sun, the moon, the stars, aahh you...and I could never run away from you "…it's bugging me already.  Ok, since I'm still trapped in the Radiohead mood, I decided to pick "Subterranean Homesick Alien" as my blog name/theme.  I am not a creative person. My ideas are never clever nor original. I am not a writer. English is not my native language.  This blog is an online journal to update my family and friends in the Philippines of my recent activities, thoughts, moods, blurbs, rants, ramblings, etc. My entries will not be intellectual nor amusing. If you want to find some good blog reading, you're in the wrong blogspot.  I'm not subterranean - not hiding underground, I do feel homesick sometimes, and I'm a legal alien of the U.S. And yes, this is one of my favorite Radiohead songs. Until I can think of a better blog name, I will stick with this one. There is no other special or meaningful reasons why so don't ask and that is that.    The breath of the morning I keep forgetting. The smell of the warm summer air.    I live in a town where you can't smell a thing, you watch your feet for cracks in the pavement.     Up above aliens hover making home movies for the folks back home,    of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits, drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets.       They're all uptight, uptight, uptight, uptight, uptight, uptight.    I wish that they'd sweep down in a country lane, late at night when I'm driving. Take me on board their beautiful ship, show me the world as I'd love to see it.    I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me, They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely. I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life. They'd shut me away. But I'd be alright, alright, I'd be alright, I'm alright.    I'm just uptight, uptight, uptight, uptight, uptight, uptight, uptight, uptight, uptight.    SONG INFORMATION Released: June 1997 Found on: OK Computer  Originally called "Uptight," which is how Jonny referred to it in its early staged, the song pays homage to Bob Dylan's "Subterranean Homesick Blues." It deals with alien abduction and stems from two incidents in Thom's life. The first occured at Abingdon School, when he was assigned an essay question that went something like this: "If you were an alien from another planet arriving on Earth, how would you describe what you saw?" The second incident occurred when Thom was driving down a country road and hit a bird (which he believes was a pheasant). He stepped out of the car and at that moment began thinking about alien abduction.  (song info taken from pitchfork media)
