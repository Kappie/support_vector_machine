Now how stupid am I to be sitting my ass here and not taking a dive myself? Pure Logic comes to mind. I think it may be that I am scared and I think about my fucking $2000 mortgage and my other bills.......oh! and food. I'm thinking about doing it anyways sometime down the line because i plan to sell my home in 2 years by myself.    GRE  I'm taking the GRE test so now I have to shape up and get back into studying. I've been so laxed for the summer, its miserable (in respect of the GRE). ughhhh... unfortunately procrastination won't work in this deal for me. btw, i'm a procrastination at heart when it comes to school. The GRE looks terribly hard. What kind of words are contumacious, peregrination, loquacious, munificence. People don't use these words!!! not me anyways. ugghh.. and MATH!! i'd forgotten how to do math. of course i had to take Calculus for my major but that was a long time ago. I find myself forgetting, at times ONLY (not all the time), what 8X7 may be. My son usually will confirm or make an idiot of me with the answer. God help me thru this one!
