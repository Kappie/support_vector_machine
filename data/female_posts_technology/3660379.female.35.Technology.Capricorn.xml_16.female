Now, as many of you know, I'm a great swimmer, so I was sad to learn that the swim portion wouldn't take place.   I started out with a nice paced jog and finished the initial run all the while wishing we had been swimming.  Then it was onto the cycling portion, which I consider my second strongest portion, with swimming being my first.  I caught many of those speedy runners during the cycling portion, only to be passed by them again during the final 3 mile run.   While the day was a little disapointing becasue I didn't finish as well as I would have had the swim portion taken place, I am proud of myself for "toughing" it out and finishing strong.   I'm certainly looking forward to next years event... Bring on the Swim!!!!  :-)
