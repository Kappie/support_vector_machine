No, but a statement he made on the show did.  He told Regis and Kelly that he has received many letters of encouragement during this process, and told about one in particular.  A girl wrote him and said that she was considering dropping out of high school, but something about his success on the show made her change her mind.  There is nothing sensational about this guy.  No headlines about him saving a baby from a burning building or other acts that are generally considered heroic, but something about him helped somebody choose the right path.  I don't think that this girl thinks that graduating from high school will ensure her fifteen minutes of fame like Jennings, but who he is, made her want the best for herself.    I know this isn't with the my normal blog theme, but I was inspired by this story and wanted to share.    Remember to be the good person you are, and good things can come from that.  I think that Jennings place on Jeopardy is not to win a million, that's just a bonus.  He is there to provide a good example, maybe just for that one person.
