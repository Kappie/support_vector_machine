You don't need that!    Must I remind them that when I had the surgery I weighed more, what they are looking at are the results!    2. By looking at you I would never have known you had been heavy!    What does a formerly heavy person look like? Do we hold some visible scars from our weight that are apparent to all we see?    Anyway, they are not offensive at all, just kind of cute, and really they are compliments if you look beyond the "confusion".
