It's comforting and safe to stay and a risk to go. But if I stay in this confined safe state, I will not grow. It is a bit scary to embark on another journey when for some time I have grown accustomed to this environment. But then life is about different journeys and taking risks. And the only way to survive and remain strong is to have faith
