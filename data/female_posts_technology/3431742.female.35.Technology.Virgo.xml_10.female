Ok I was willing to see it cause of the semi-accurate history behind the legend.  And well I wanted to see Orlando Bloom too.  Man was I shocked. I saw so much V and treasure trails! .... YUMMY!!  I barely remember how sexy it was to see men in leather, men putting on their armor, and eyes that are a bit piercing.  DAMN! Orlando had such great locks that I could just play with the curls for hours.  I've not see so much chest at one time in a movie, I almost forgot what a site that is.  The major muscle stuff can go but the rest of the movie, well.... It has hollywood-ized the story of course. It's great blood and guts kinda film.  Acting was good.  The  urlLink actor  playing Hector did an awesome job.  Brad Pitt did very well in here also.  Orlando was so not right for the part of Paris.  I'd see it again for the battle scenes.  I would say they are better than the LOTR scenes - all of them.  Preview of an interesting  urlLink movie  I think it comes out in fall.  I'd see it just 'cause of Keanu.  Not major fan of his.  Only like three of his movies that he's been in.  It looks interesting so I'll have to see when it comes out.  Thanks for all the email, those folks that I haven't emailed back or talked to in awhile.  Hope to year from you more or see you at summerfest. :)
