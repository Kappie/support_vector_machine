He has a tattoo of four lizards on his wrist.   I am still looking for my John Wayne. Where is my prairie son?  In my CD player today I listened to Nirvana. I need more romance in my life.... Do men still try to win women's hearts? Do men know how to win a woman's a heart?  I will watch David Chappelle tonight on CC. He cracks me up. :)
