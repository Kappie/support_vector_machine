All that's between Minnesota and Washington, was mostly dirt, dry, desert, except for the beautiful Glacier National Park in Western Montana. Very scenic with its mountains and evergreen trees.   Our train seats were recliners, we slept in them.   Spent 7 whole days with my parents, in my home town of Yakima, Washington. Both 59 years old, still married after 40 years...merely living in entirely separate sections of the house, as are most of the still-married parents of most of my other friends my age. 5 of my 6 brothers and sisters still live in town, in fact 2 of them are back living with my parents. One brought his wife back with him. So they were all 5 in and out of the house, with or without spouses, at any hour of day or night, with all their children, as well as the 4 of us, visiting, and my 2 parents.   I was sorry to find that the two siblings I have who have NOT been diagnosed with mental illness, compensated by marrying spouses who MUST BE, including this brother in law who is wearing this same shirt in all his pictures I came back with...      In case you can't tell, it is a picture of a guy getting a blowjob by a fish.   I attended my 20 year high school reunion. It was great for me to see so many people again after 20 years! Especially my best friends from that time, who used to hang out with me  listen to the B-52's, Devo, and the Police. Me and two other girls were voted "least changed." The other two really did look like they were still 18, and had been frozen in time since June 1983, but I really have no idea what I was doing up there with them.   I took my kids up Mt. St. Helens. They're bored by my reminding them I lived 80 miles downwind of it when it errupted in 1980 when I was 15, and our whole town was covered in ash. Ho-hum, volcano stories from old people.

You can see what's left of the volcano, behind my daughter's head.   I drove the 4 of us plus my mom to visit my 6th sibling, in a neighboring town, in the "Adult Residential Treatment Facility" to which the State of Washington has committed him. He's so drugged up it was like visiting Forrest Gump. When I talked to him on the phone before we visited he said, "I'MSOEXCITEDTOTALKTOYOUMYMOUTHJUSTDRIEDALLTHEWAYOUTANDMYTOUNGEHASSWOLLENUPTO4TIMESITSNORMALSIZE!"   I've never eaten out at so much fast food restaurants so many times in 7 days, in my whole life.   36 hour train ride back. Came within 20 miles of a forest fire in Western Montana, we could smell the s'moke (intentionally misspelled to avoid the emoticon) from inside the train,  see the fog out the window. Immigration boarded our train car as I was sleeping, and took the Spanish-speaking lady, seated directly behind me, away in a van!!
