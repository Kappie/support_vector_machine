As well, kudos to Heather for the bike ride and to Harshala for stomaching bowl after bowl of cabbage soup!   I did the shake breakfast/tuna salad lunch thing again and was pretty hungry when I got home last night so I had some baked pita chips with salsa, a couple of baked fillets, and some green peas. I'm not sure that my 2 coffee/ 1 large chocolate milk each day is necessarily a good part of my diet, but I feel like I need the coffee and the chocolate milk is 1%, so my calcium needs are being well met. And since a high calcium intake reduces stress levels, I just can't get worked up over it (ba-doom ching!).   I again lifted weights last night (I've got jello arms this morning, so I know I did enough), and did some serious (aka painful) stretching. I've noticed that I sound like a bowl of Rice Crispies (snap, crackle, pop!) when I stretch. Hopefully, I'm heading to the batting cage tonight and may take a walk around Centennial Park while I'm at it. The nice thing about walking is that I can read while I'm doing it.
