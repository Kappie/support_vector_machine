Before mass I prepared my traditional pasta, Pasta Paradiso.  Love the smell of cooking wine.  Thanks to jeffer for updating  urlLink Homecomings  and coming up with another  urlLink fic .  For X fans, I recommend you read her  urlLink My Beloved .  No, I did not watch the F4 concert last Dec. 26.  My officemate who did bought me a calendar though. ^_~  I was and still am short on money, but it did not deter my hunger for a book.  I found myself browsing Powerbooks Greenbelt after finding out that the branch in Pasay road is closed.  Not finding anything that could whet my appetite, I proceeded to Book Sale (?) beside Tokyo Tokyo.  A Different Bookstore near Rustan's finally had what I wanted.  Dai Sijie's  urlLink Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress .  The fact that the movie version which I failed to see was shown in Greenbelt ArtFilm for some weeks helped.    The ending stunned me.  After some education from books stolen by Lou the storyteller and violinist and narrator she took off for the city!  She said "There is one thing I learned from Balzac.  Beauty is a price beyond measure."  Now, where is she going?  Be an actress?  Model?  Find a sponsor?  Why was I stunned?  I was comfortable with the story.  The young men's visits to the Little Seamstress, the mountains, the straightforwardness of it all and then they were burning the books!  My latest music food today is Italian composer Ennio Morricone.  Check him out.  He composed scores for movies and tv like Malena and Twin Peaks.  His official website is  urlLink Ennio Morricone
