I could really get into this having off thing. It really makes life so much easier when I don't have to go to work.  Spoke to Lynn for a long time today. Told her of my desire to find some new friends. I think she was offended, though she won't admit it. I really meant nothing personal by it. I just want to find someone I truly connect with. She is moving in with this chick that is in love with her...and she just happened to go down on her once. So of course the girl is sprung. I told Lynn that she is getting no where near my kitty. She ain't turning me out! I'm lying. I do want her to do it. Just once. Or twice.....heh, a 26 1/2 year old sista got needs! I needs to find me two steady luvahs this year I know that!  Called a Craigslist girl and I could tell immediately that she was not "it." She must have too because she said she would call me back and she didn't. I think even when she does, I will ignore the call/e-mail. I didn't really feel a connection.  Thought about Derreck a lot today. Wondered briefly if I should have called for his birthday. It's not like he could be mad at me though. I think I've come to the realization that I love him. I really do. I came to that realization the other day I think. I was standing on the train platform and it just came to me...the thought that if his mother was to die suddenly, I would drop everything and go with him to Ala. to be by his side. (Don't ask why I had this particular scenario, long story). But that's love. And even though I am meeting Mark on Wednesday to possibly begin a little "off the bench" relationship, Derreck is still very much always on my mind. I'm hoping Mark will be a nice distraction. I think the true test will be if Mark hits it JUST right, will Derreck still be on my mind. Hmmm.....  Well, back to boring azz work tomorrow. I think I prefer the weekdays though. More structured for me I think.
