The physical abuse always came first and the emotional abuse almost always began after I broke down and started crying. The pleasure received from watching me cry was obvious and she liked to prolong this feeling for as long as possible. While doing so she would tell me how worthless I was, how ugly I was, that I reminded her of my Father and how much she hated me and wished I had never been born. She would tell me how much she hated me or how much I reminded her of my father because of my “ugly nose.”  Out of jealousy she made me feel bad for being so skinny.  She would constantly do things to make me ugly and make me feel ugly. Sometimes she was just plain mean.    During the winter she would pull the car over, a couple blocks away from our house and tell me she didn’t want me to come home ever again.  Once stranded on the side of the road she would pull up just far enough to still be able to see me in her rear view mirror.  Since I had nowhere to go but home I always walked in that direction.  She would wait until I got to the start of our street, pull up next to me and tell me to get back into the car.  She yelled it in such a way that I felt as if I did something wrong by getting out of the car in the first place.  I don’t think she wanted the neighbors to see me walking home alone in the snow.  They were already talking and it was obvious by their actions how much they had grown to dislike her.  Whatever the form, emotional abuse occurred on a daily basis and I soon preferred the beatings to her mind games.  Sometimes we would go for an entire month without getting into a violent argument but on the average they happened once a week until I was in the latter part of high school.   If you were to have asked my mom, during any stage of my life, if I was well behaved she would have said something to the effect of, “She was always a good kid.”  I remember her saying that to me many times as well as her friends and our counselors over the years. If you gave her the opportunity, she would go on and on about my accomplishments, whether it was something small like doing well in a class, or something big like my music competition awards. As far as my general behavior I can count the amount of times I got into trouble on one hand. My mom thought her morals were very high and sometimes had the aura of being better than others. Because of her attitude and lessons, I learned at a very young age not to act up in public, not to talk back to anyone and most of all not to get into fights, do the things that bad children did or hang out with a bad crowd regardless of my actions. I did, however, skip school once in high school, light all of her prized, formerly untouched, candles once in the seventh grade and often turned the heat up in the house when I was about ten or eleven, which was against one of her many rules. I also defiantly kept a messy room until we moved to California. Besides from those instances, no matter how much good I did or how much I kissed up to my mom, she always looked for or invented a reason to start a fight with me. Around seven years old I learned how to tune my mom out as much as possible during her fits of rage. I will always remember the types of pain inflicted during each beating but I only remember the specific details of what started the biggest fights as I got a little older.   As an unspoken rule, every time my mom either left the house or returned I had to stand at the window adjacent to the driveway and wave. If I didn’t, especially after a hard day at work, she would take it as a sign of aggression and lay into me as soon as she came into the house. Before I could say hello she would yell at me and tell me how worthless and stupid she was. She would often say, “I had a bad day at work and you can’t even come to the window and wave hello when I get home?”  No matter how many times I said I was sorry she wouldn’t accept my apology. On these days the next thing she would do is walk from room to room and inspect all of her belongings to see if anything was out of place. She would also check the thermostat to see if I had touched it while she was away. Sometimes I would follow her around to silently let her know I knew what she was doing. Other times I would stay in the living room just waiting to see what kind of lie she would come up with. The rare times she couldn’t find anything she would drop the subject and let me be. If she thought a picture was out of place or something was missing from where it should have been, she would grab a fistful of my hair and, if necessary, drag me to the part of the house and asked me what had happened. Even though I always knew what would come next I always told her I didn’t touch anything. She would pull my hair harder and harder while pushing me away from her until one of two things happened. I could say that I did and get dragged and beaten around the kitchen or I could say that I did or I didn’t touch what ever it was and start crying. Even though the latter lasted longer I wouldn’t get hit as much. This is how she got her fix. She wasn’t satisfied until she made me sob. I would cry and choke out, “I wish you loved me, I know you don’t,” or better yet, “you know I don’t have any friends, you are my mom and you don’t even like me!”  From those early beatings up until I was in high school this is what she was looking for in one of our fights and it wasn’t until I started up this charade that she would stop hitting me. Instead she would back up as if to get a better view and cross her arms in defiance. She had a look of smug pleasure on her face and didn’t speak a word to me no matter how much I pleaded for her love. I hated this choice with every bone in my body for three reasons. First I hated telling her that I loved her and asking her to love me back just to end everything. I stopped loving her after my Grandma died and these events began to take place. Second, I hated having to tearfully apologize for something I didn’t do. Lastly and most importantly I hated having to let her see me cry. I knew her game. I knew that crying was the ultimate sign of weakness for her. I wanted her to know that she wasn’t bringing me down and that she wasn’t getting through to me emotionally like she had hoped. Inevitably, especially when I was younger, I would tire of the beatings or decide to avoid one and cry. I couldn’t win.   The earliest fight I fully remember happened not long after my Grandmother passed away. My mom was still taking me to my weekly ballet rehearsals and the time had come for my first recital. We were putting together a dance that would go with “The Yellow Rose of Texas.”  My mom wasn’t pleased with having to dish out money to buy my little yellow tutu and in turn when it came to purchasing the white tights that were required for the costume, she refused to buy them. Instead she spent the same amount of money and purchased a pair of Capezio tights in deep tan. When she came home she told me that she thought the brown pair would look better than the white pair.   I was only in the second grade but was already tired of being the one who was different from everybody else. I was the ultra-skinny red-head who was constantly made fun of by the other kids since kindergarten and recently my mom, for reasons I could only imagine, had begun perming my long, stick-straight hair with curls so tight that I literally had what looked like a big afro. At that age I actually thought of it as a clown’s wig. On top of everything else I had just lost my two front teeth. These tights were the last straw.  I raised my voice and reminded her that the flyer that was given out a month prior had specifically said white tights. She smiled and said, “I know,” and walked out of the room. I ran up to my bedroom and silently cried for hours. The next two Saturdays were living hell. They were the dress rehearsals and of course I was the only one with dark tights. Everyone looked at me, laughed and asked if my mom was too poor to buy white tights. The teacher looked at my scrawny legs in horror and said in front of the class, “No, no, no, that is all wrong. You need to get white tights before the recital or you won’t be able to dance with your class.”  As my mom always waited with the other parents in the lobby I wished my teacher had confronted her herself because I thought if I was the one who brought it up she would refuse to buy a new pair of tights for me.  On the night of the recital my mom still hadn’t bought me the correct color tights and despite this she was dumping blue eyeshadow up to my eyebrows and putting red blush on my pale face. I asked her why she was making me get ready if I couldn’t participate. I couldn’t help but start crying. She called me a selfish bitch for not appreciating the pair she had already bought me. She said if I didn’t stop crying she wasn’t going to take me. As she walked out into the kitchen I followed her, closed the bathroom door behind me, slumped down into a yellow ball of lace against the door and continued to cry. My whole body went limp. Some of my first memories and dreams were about music and ballet. My mom had finally found something that would really bother me. As I continued to cry, my mom walked back into the kitchen and threw something at me. When I opened my eyes I saw an unopened pair of white tights lying before me. She hadn’t left the house, which meant she could have had that pair the entire time. Instead of dwelling on the uncalled for abuse I became overwhelmed with excitement. “Hurry up and put those on. We’re going to be late!”  I quickly took my tutu off and changed my tights. I looked in the mirror and breathed a sigh of relief.  The recital went well. We all had a great time and our teacher couldn’t have been prouder of the class. When we took our bows at the end of the routine my mom threw a bouquet of flowers up on stage. I couldn’t make sense of the flowers but all in all they meant a lot to me because this was the first time I was ever on stage.   When my mom and I returned home she decided to take some Polaroids to remember the occasion. The bathroom door was still closed from before we left and she decided the white color of the background would be the perfect backdrop for our pictures. My mom gave me my flowers to hold and told me to smile. As usual my eyes were partly shut because of the flash. Irritated, my mom told me to get ready for another picture. I tried my best this time but my in this picture my eyes were completely closed. When she saw this she became furious. “You are wasting my film. This time keep your eyes open!”  Now I was getting upset. I managed to keep my eyes open but because she was making such a big deal out of getting a good picture I was only able to put on a fake smile. When the picture developed my mom noticed right away. This time she grabbed my hair in the same spot as before and screamed, “You’re so ugly you can’t even take a decent picture!”  The entire evening’s events plus the lump on my head from before brought me to tears. “Stop crying!”  She pulled even harder. “I said stop crying!”  She pushed me back towards the door and put the camera up to her face. In this next picture I had a big open-mouthed fake smile but my eyes were still crying and my eye makeup began to run down my face. In a trance-like rage she yelled “I’m gonna take one more picture and you better look happy, or else!”  This final picture turned out similar to the last one except this time my mouth was mostly closed and the smile looked more like a frown. I really tried. In that picture you could see that all of my energy and spirit had completely escaped from my body. I looked beaten and worn out. Finally she gave up and had enough. Three of these pictures, including the last one are proudly displayed in the photo album she still keeps of me.  Another major fight happened when I was in the third grade. I know this sounds like a total cliché but my mom loved the movie “Mommy Dearest” and insisted on watching it every time it came on television. I dreaded these evenings. It was my mom’s way of confirming to herself that she didn’t treat me the same way Joan Crawford treated her children. After all, she never locked me into my bed and she never threw powder all over the place and left it for me to clean up. Every time we saw those dreaded scenes she would turn to me with a small tear in her eye and ask, “I’m not that bad… right?”  Like reading from an old worn out script I would reply with feigned concern in my eye, “No mom. You’re not that bad at all!” This usually put her in a good mood for the rest of the evening.       That night we had just finished watching “Mommy Dearest” for the fiftieth time. After assuring her over and over that she wasn’t like the mother on the screen, I went upstairs to pick out an outfit for school the next day, which was picture day for our class. Picture day was always a fun event and that night I was on my best behavior so I wouldn’t upset my mom any more than usual. I had begun to realize that my mom, like clockwork, would start a horrible fight right before a big event or an outing.        Earlier in the day my mom had given me notice that she would “inspect” my room that evening. This was sure to include a good two-hour beating and I had already become accustomed to this. These inspections happened about once a month and each time I received the warning I became absolutely terrified. While cleaning I would literally shake uncontrollably the entire time. I did however have my work cut out for me. After about a year of these inspections I had begun to rebel and always left my room in a complete mess. I didn’t do this on purpose. As I look back I realize that after a while I was completely oblivious to the mess I was creating. I believe I was unconsciously showing my mom that her seemingly schizophrenic bouts of anger and abuse didn’t affect me. I knew then and now that it wouldn’t get me anywhere but I couldn’t help it.       After the movie was over I went upstairs and quickly took one last look around for anything that she would consider out of place. Since she couldn’t bend over because of her back injury I made sure that if I had stuffed anything under the bed it couldn’t be seen from any angle in the room. When I looked I saw some dirty clothes that she would surely search for. In a bellowing voice I heard, “I’m coming upstairs now.”  I quickly took the stack of clothes from underneath the bed and put them in my closet. Once I opened my closet I realized that I had forgot to clean it out. Shoes weren’t in order and I had a stack of old school papers on the left side that I had taken out of my backpack and forgotten as well. If she found these she would undoubtedly go off. She took slow, heavy, deliberate steps. There were thirteen steps all together and I counted every one. As she neared half way up I gently closed the closet door hoping she would forget to look in there and went to the top of the stairway. As she made her way up I threw her a nervous smile to try and put her in a better mood. As she got closer to the top of the stairs I seriously considered pushing her down the flight of stairs, after all it would have been the perfect way to kill her so she could never hurt me again.        The reason she didn’t come upstairs to my bedroom more often was because since her back injury, the nerves in her leg didn’t work correctly and whenever she lifted her leg up the slightest bit she felt a lot of pain. Knowing this history, if I pushed her and she died the police would have no problem believing that the fall was an accident. Sometimes on her way up, even though she took very slow steps she wouldn’t raise her leg up enough and would trip. She had always managed to catch herself by grabbing onto the wall in the past but by now she had grown much larger and probably wouldn’t have been able to regain her balance. This is also why I could have pushed her at eight years old. I wasn’t very strong but it wouldn’t have taken much to make her go off balance. This wasn’t the first time I had these thoughts and it wouldn’t be the last. That night I really would have but I had never even laid a finger on her before. I was too scared. So scared in fact that I was in a daze and couldn’t move. When she made it to the top of the stairs I just stared at her face in horror and thought, “I lost my chance.”  She pushed me away and began the inspection. This evening she was very particular. She even looked for dust, which she had never done before. She strutted around my room looking in every nook and cranny. In one of my closets she noticed that a book was missing from my old encyclopedia set. Then she walked over to the orange desk in my room and saw that the middle drawer was not straightened up inside and there were random pencil shavings in it. After looking around for a while she seemed unusually satisfied. As she was getting ready to leave she remembered that she had forgotten about my clothes closet. I was on the other side of my room planning a way to escape when she came after me because the bedroom fights were always bad. When she opened the closet I heard a gasp. “What is all this?”  She yelled at the top of her voice as she threw the small pile of dirty clothes all over the floor. “I knew I couldn’t trust you!  This closet is a fucking mess!”         “I’m sorry I’ll clean it.”  I turned the waterworks on earlier than usual but to no avail. She grabbed a hangar from the closet and barreled towards me only the way my mother could and started beating me as hard as she could on my arms and legs with the thick plastic hangar. I was screamed out in pain and my mother put her hand over my mouth and nose so I couldn’t breathe or scream. She did this a lot. “Don’t you dare scream!  The neighbors will hear you. If they call the police I will hurt you so bad…”  Even after I stopped screaming she wouldn’t take her hand off of my face until I started freaking out, trying to get air. I began flailing my arms and became scared for my life but she let go before I started to pass out. I was left on the floor choking and gasping for badly needed air. Just then she came back with the hangar and whipped me some more. She was always more violent during the winter months than she was during the warmer ones. Winter clothes left less bruised skin for everyone to see. She did this for a half hour straight (I always watched my clock which seemed to stand still). Suddenly she stopped beating me and grabbed my hair once again. “Let’s go downstairs right now.”  I had no idea what she was planning to do next because she had never taken me downstairs the other times. As she began her descent down the stairs I realized I had yet another chance to push her. I wondered how she could be so stupid to let me follow behind her. As we neared the end of the stairs I realized I had lost my chance again. I was upset because this time would have been much easier since her back was towards me. When we got downstairs she once again grabbed my hair and brought me into the kitchen. She said, “Wait here,” and left the kitchen for a few minutes. When she came back she had a pair of scissors in her hand and I started crying again. She turned me away from her and said, “How dare you!  Your room was not up to my standards.”  She grabbed a chunk of hair on my left side and slowly and agonizingly cut it off. “Oh, too bad tomorrow is picture day,” she said in a sarcastic voice, “it’s too late now to go to a hairdresser and you will never be able to fix it yourself. Just imagine what everyone is going to think about you tomorrow!”        “How could you do this to me?      “How?  Well, how come you treat me like you do?  I work at a crappy job all day and have to come home to this?  I hate you and I hate my life. In fact…” Her voice drifted off as she walked to the other side of the kitchen. She walked over to the drawer where she kept her big knife. It was some kind of a hunter’s knife and the blade was about seven or eight inches long and two inches wide. She grabbed it, pulled it out of its sheath and held the tip right up to her skin over her heart. You could see it pushing slightly into her breast.      “Do you want me to kill myself?”      “No mom, no.” a million things ran through my head, all completely selfish.      “I’ll do it I’ll stab myself right now. Do you really want to lose me?”  She sounded possessed and pressed the knife even harder against her breast.      “No, don’t do it. What will I do without you?”  I was concerned about being homeless, losing my friends and my dog. I didn’t care about her.       She put the knife down onto the counter and started sobbing. She soon put the knife back in its leather holder and put it away. I immediately ran back upstairs to my room crying. I didn’t care about my mom’s drama. It wasn’t the first time that scenario had played out. I was concerned about myself.        Since the year before, my curly perm had grown out into straight hair that fell a few inches below my shoulders. In the mirror I saw that my mom had taken off about two inches from the left side and as I had expected, and even though it could have been worse, it was obvious. The next day came and I tried to compensate for my shorter hair by tilting my head slightly to the side all day. When it came time to do pictures the old man insisted I keep my head up straight. I felt my face redden and he took my picture. I could have died. Unbelievably, my teacher never asked me what happened to my hair even though the other kids did. I told them I got bubble gum in my hair and had to cut it out myself.       Usually my mom was the queen of incomplete threats, or should I say, actions.  She tried to kill me quite a few times.  She would have succeeded if she hadn’t just gone through the motions.  She tried to suffocate me numerous times by placing her hand over my mouth and nose.  She almost always alternated between pressing hard and letting up just enough for air to come through.  There were many times, however, when she refused to lighten her grasp.  When I tried gasping for air, I only made the seal between her hand and my face tighter. I don’t remember looking into her eyes.  I was so scared during these moments that I could do nothing but flail my arms around and squeal as loud as possible, knowing it wasn’t loud enough for anyone to hear, even if the windows were open.  She had done such a good job of brainwashing me into total submission that I wasn’t smart enough to try and fight her off me.  I might not have been able to pull her hand off my face but I could have kicked her and startled her.  I hate those memories.       I also hate the times we went to the beach.  Two summers in a row she took me as far out as the ropes allowed in the water and physically tried to drown me.  After that first summer I knew what to expect.  For “safety reasons” she made me stick by her even though I was good swimmer.  She would pretend to get playful and I knew to stay as far away from her as I could.  Unfortunately she had trained me like a dog and I was powerless to her anger and beckoning. Once I started to swim away from her she would yell, “Get back over here.  Don’t you swim away from me!” Like a patient under hypnosis I did what she said. “Come here,” she said while playfully splashing me.  She knew I hated that.  I did my best to stay above water to wipe the water out of my eyes.  She always got me to choke by doing this as well.  The more I told her to stop the more she splashed.         When I got to the point where lake water was coming out of my nose she would move in laughing as if it was the funniest thing she had ever seen.  She would put her hand firmly on top of my head and pushed me under water.  Not yet recovered from the first flooding of water into my lungs I gasped a barely audible, “Stop!”  Right in the middle of a good choke she pushed me down again, this time somehow pushing me into a forward roll. I needed air.  I was disorientated and opened my eyes in an attempt to distinguish up from down in the murky water. I followed the few bubbles I managed to push out and found my way back up.  Frantically throwing up and gasping for air I yelled, “Stop! I can’t breath!” This time I was loud.  This time I caught her eyes.  She wasn’t laughing at that moment.  The look on her face wasn’t of concern either.  It was an eerie moment, which passed in slow motion.  It’s hard to describe but the look on her face wondered, “Is she going to make it?”  There was the slightest bit of fear in her face as well.  In that moment of desperation I heard her thoughts clearly in my head.  She looked around to see how many people were around us.  Fortunately a group of people swam over and began playing near us.      “Oh stop,” she said nonchalantly as if speaking to a child who was whining for no reason.  Once I had my breath I started crying hysterically.       “You almost drowned me!”      “No I didn’t.” Her tone of voice was almost sarcastic.  She said it in a way that anyone within hearing distance would think I was making it up.  This was the second summer she tried this and I wasn’t sticking around to see if it would happen again.  I swam towards the shore and towards safety.  That was the last time we went to the beach together.        Over the years I told both my Cousin and eventually my husband.  Both said, “Maybe she was just playing around.” Knowing they thought I was exaggerating infuriated me.  I was, and still am, speechless. By the time I was in seventh grade I was a poster child for the emotionally disturbed. This was the first time I realized how bad my life was. One afternoon I returned home from school severely depressed. I knew I had hit a low point. I felt sheepishly destructive and needed an outlet.        I went to my backpack and got out a stack of index cards and threw them into the bathroom sink. I grabbed a matchbook from the kitchen and proceeded to light the pile of cards on fire. At first I just wanted to start the fire for the sake of starting a fire; that’s why I did it in a sink in case it got out of control. I knew what I was doing was wrong but I felt miserable and revengeful towards my mom. I couldn’t stop myself. In a small way I thought if I could start this fire and not get caught I would have won the game.        As the flame grew I suddenly felt thirteen years of rage fire up as well. While the fire was burning I ran into the bathroom closet and grabbed one of those pornographic books and started ripping out the pages and placing them into the fire. After the pages turned to ashes I ran into the living room and grabbed the photo album. I took my third grade class photo, the one with the chopped off hair, ran back into the bathroom and put that in the fire as well. I did the same thing with the last 5X9 photo of my third grade picture. Now they were gone forever. Then I did the same with my second grade class picture with the afro, my two missing front teeth and the ugly green vest with the matching green and white Girl Scout turtleneck. Once those pictures had melted I turned the water on until the ashes cooled off. Finally, I ran around the house with the matchbook and lit every single one of her plain candles that she had been collecting for years and never burned once. Once they were all lit I walked from room to room and watched how each candle burned differently.        In an instant I snapped back to reality and realized what I had done. I ran around the house blowing out all of the candles and tried to salvage the ones that hadn’t been burning for quite as long, but it was futile. Then I remembered the mess I had left in the bathroom. With that thought I looked at the clock and realized I only had an hour lose the ashes, get the black out of the porcelain. Most importantly I had to get rid of the smell that by now had invaded the entire house. I took the ashes and stuffed them into a plastic grocery bag. I let the sink soak and opened doors and windows while I tried to figure out where to stash the bag so my mother wouldn’t it. After careful consideration I decided to throw it way back in our backyard where my mom never went. The back of the yard was like a dense forest and would be easy to hide back there. I ran back into the house, finished cleaning the sink and was finally able to close the doors and windows. There was nothing I could do about the candles but maybe she wouldn’t notice.        When it was time for her car to pull up I waited anxiously by the window for my mom’s homecoming. I prayed that she wouldn’t notice a strange smell. When she came home I greeted her outside like I normally did when I really needed her to start out in a good mood. When we walked inside I watched her face for any signs of that smell. Nothing. “I can’t believe I pulled this off. Oh my gosh, I’m never doing anything like that again, thank you God!”  I went past her to walk into the bathroom and she exclaimed, “What is this?”  I thought the worst. I turned around and followed her stare down to a single burnt match sitting on the kitchen counter. “Oh shit, oh shit, think fast,” I thought. “It’s just a match mom.”      “What is it doing out here?  What the hell did you do?”      “Nothing mom, I don’t know, maybe you lit a candle and forgot about it or something.”  What did I just say?  I just left the door wide open. She started moving forward and looked at me with one of those “oh no you didn’t” looks on her face. I followed her into the living room where she immediately noticed how every one of her candles had been lit.       “You burnt my candles?”        “No!  Maybe you did it.” I should have said yes.      “You asshole, you burnt my candles?  You burnt the candles I received from your cousin for Christmas?  Come here you fucking…” Her words became softer as she rushed over to me and slapped me as hard as she could on my ear. The clock said 5:30pm. She slapped me again on my cheek. 5:31pm. I knew this would be a long night and honestly I didn’t think I would make it.       My mom had limited strength and endurance and therefore wasn’t able to hit me with full force for too long. She would have rather pulled my hair (her favorite means of punishment) or kicked me while I was lying on the ground. I believe she was also unconsciously scared that she would one day go too far and kill me on accident, even though she stated many times how that was her goal. This night was different.       For the next three hours the beating was relentless. It was so bad that our dog cowered in fear underneath a chair for the entire evening as he often did when there was trouble around the house. At one point my mom, once again, had grabbed my hair and pulled me into the kitchen. My nose had started to bleed a little, my lip was bleeding, my ears were ringing from the hits, and I had two or three lumps on my head, not including the one that was in the making at that very moment. She pushed me up against the wall and put her hand around my throat. She had tried to suffocate me with her hand many times before but she had never actually choked me like this. I started to black out, not because of the choking but because I really thought she was going to kill me. The thought terrified me.        She wouldn’t let go so for the first time in my life I reached out towards her and pulled her hair like she had mine so many times before. It was like a dream where you can’t run. I immediately felt shaky and weak and I don’t think I was able to her hair very hard. Astonished she backed up in silence and just stared at me in disbelief. She made a fist and went to punch me and at the same time I made a fist and was planning to punch her in the face or at least block hers but instead I just flinched.       “How dare you raise a fist to your mother!”  With that mistake she used my hair to throw me onto the hard tile floor with enough force to make me slide into the kitchen door. She began to kick me as hard as she could and was yelling obscenities the entire time. After what seemed like eternity she stood back and looked down at me with crazy eyes and spit on me.      “I hate you more than I hate your father. You are just like him. I hate how much you remind me of him. You’re worthless.” She spit on me two more times and left the room. I couldn’t get up. I can’t remember if I was crying or not but I do remember the unbearable pain and loneliness I felt right then. I remember thinking if I could get up I could grab the big knife in the drawer and end it all right here. Maybe during the autopsy the pathologist would see the tear on my lip and the small amount of blood on my nose. Maybe he will see the bruises on my arm and the lumps on my head. Maybe in the end they wouldn’t believe that it was a suicide. They might think that my mom actually did it. I was seriously considering it but my mom walked back in.       “Go put on your pajamas and come back down here when you’re finished.”  I did what she said, still dazed, and still in pain.”  I went back downstairs. Come in here,” Her voice was coming from her bedroom. “You don’t deserve to sleep in a bed tonight. You have to sleep right here on the floor while your dog sleeps with me in bed.”  I started to cry but she made me sleep there until it was time to get ready for school.             Later that winter, while in the car with my mom, she pulled over and started to cry. When I asked her what was wrong she apologized for being such a horrible mother. She said, “I never meant to do any of this to you. I know you can’t be happy living with me so I’m going to give you a choice. You can either stay with me or I can turn myself in and you can go live with a foster family. I promise I won’t get mad if you decide to go.”  She sat in silence waiting for my answer. She wanted the answer right then and there. Deep down I knew she was being sincere but there was still a part of me that was terrified of giving her the answer she didn’t want to hear. I was also afraid of moving away from my friends and my school. Even though I hated my life so much I was comfortable. After what seemed like an eternity of silence, the scared and weak side of me answered, “No mom. I love you and want to live with you.”      “Are you sure?  I can’t guarantee that I will never hit you again but I will try.”      Despite knowing that hitting me was like a drug habit to her I answered, “Ya, I’m sure.”       As she pulled back onto the road I got a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. Had I made the right choice?  Was I just too scared to say no?  This was my first of three defining moments that would change my life and my spirit forever.      Over the years my mom had made it a habit to find a reason to get in a fight with me right before an important school event like an orchestra or chorus recital. Her punishment was to try and take the one thing away from me that meant the most, my music. Luckily I always managed to get a ride from either a friend or a teacher. One evening, an hour before my orchestra concert my mom did the inevitable. Not long before the night of the concert I had finally moved up to a full-sized violin. Since it was bigger than my previous one I used to joke around and call it my viola. As we were about to leave I mentioned that I had to run upstairs to get my “viola”. Apparently my mom didn’t appreciate my music humor. She didn’t say anything right away but by the time I came back into the room she had decided that she would use that comment against me. In a calm, sarcastic voice she said, “I don’t think you take your music seriously. I pay all that money each month to rent your violin and you disrespect it by calling it a viola. I’m not taking you tonight, you have to find your own ride.”  I didn’t feel like going through this once again so I immediately opened the floodgates and pleaded for her forgiveness and begged her to take me. When she said no and started to undress I lost it. I yelled, “I hate you!  Why can’t you just take me like a normal parent?”  It was a stupid thing to say but you don’t mess with my music. She turned around and put all of her weight into her footsteps so that the whole house shook. She pushed me into a wall and put her hand around my throat. She was too chicken to really choke me. She was just going through the motions to try to scare me. At the same time she was pulling my hair and the words “ungrateful fucking bitch” flew out. For the first time in my life I went to grab her. Out of some kind of deranged respect I had never laid a finger on her. I went to throw a punch at her but instead I threw my hand up and started to pull on her curly hair. As soon as I did that I was mentally beating myself up for not punching her. I was skinny but I was strong and even though it would have been so wrong I still believe to this day that if I had hit her, the fight would have been over right then and there. Her anger and delusions were fed on the weakness I emitted. Instead the fight went on for another ten minutes. She pushed me onto the ground and started dragging me around by my hair in an attempt to get dirt all over my black outfit. She then said, ”Ya, you go to your little concert looking like this and see what they say.”  I could tell she was serious so I quickly got up and ran upstairs to my room. That year Kari was in the Orchestra as well so I called her up and asked her for a ride. Thankfully Kari always ran late so I managed to get a hold of her just before she left the house. Sobbing, I told her what had happened and she said she would be right over. I straightened out my hair and dusted off my clothes with some tape before I went back downstairs and told my mom who was coming to get me. My mom was livid. She knew Kari knew about her abusive ways but wasn’t sure if her mom, Kathy, had known. Either way she would know for sure that evening. Now was also the time to ask my mom if I could stay over at her house that night. My mom agreed in an attempt to quiet things down before Kathy came over and saw what was going on. There were stipulations though. The only way I could stay the night was if I found a specific suitcase to take. I was only spending one night over there but my mom insisted I take the biggest suitcase she owned. If she couldn’t beat me in front of Kathy she would make damn sure that I was embarrassed. She wouldn’t tell me where it was so I was starting to get nervous. As I heard Kari and her mom pulling up I decided that I wasn’t going to play her game. I couldn’t find the suitcase and I knew I could borrow some of Kari’s clothes and toiletries in the morning. My mom watched me walk out of the house without saying a word. As I walked down the driveway and got closer to their car my composure quickly went away. As soon as I made Kari’s shadow out inside of the car I started crying. She opened the door and hugged me harder than anyone had ever hugged me before. Just as Kathy began to back out of the driveway, a suitcase came flying out of the garage door. Surprised, Kathy slammed on the brakes. My mom came next in all of her glory, screaming at the car. Before the suitcase came to a halt I had already opened the car door not sure what to do. I head my mom yell, “It doesn’t matter if you ruin this one…” She kept yelling and trying to get me to walk over to where she was. Kathy calmly said, “Lynn, get into the car.”  I did just that and we drove away.        As we drove off the first thing out of Kathy’s mouth was, “I’m going to see about adopting you.”  I could tell that she said that in the heat of the moment. Kari had brought it up a couple times with her in the past year but, as I fully understood, Kathy couldn’t take on that kind of responsibility. One time while I was over at her house, she told me she had considered taking me in but she wasn’t sure if she could afford it. She said she was going to have a difficult time sending Kari off to college let alone paying for both of us to go. Knowing she considered this was more than I could have ever expected from anyone. That was the kindest gesture anyone has ever given me to this day.        Once we moved to California the fights lessened, probably because of the fact that I was older and stronger, or perhaps because I had became a volunteer at the Sheriff’s department and most of my friends were cops.  Our first day in California was a different story.  One of her worst spontaneous outbursts happened the day we arrived in Los Angeles.       Our emotions already ran high.  Out of nowhere my mom decided to quit her job and move to Bakersfield, California, to start a new life for herself and to live near her cousin.  Meanwhile I was fifteen, in the tenth grade and had just started my first week of high school.  I loved North Syracuse and didn’t want to leave.  She was taking me to a place where there was only one family member, a cousin whom I had met once before my Grandma died. Kari and her mom believed she was literally stealing me away from them. They were scared for me. I was nervous too. I cried in the airport and for the first half hour on the airplane.  My mom, on the other hand, was excited and ready to leave everything behind.       After we arrived at Los Angeles International my mom rented a car.  When she went outside and saw the traffic in front of the airport she quickly changed her tune.  She wasn’t the most confident driver to begin with (she drove with one foot on the gas, one on the brakes and sometimes used them simultaneously) but I must admit I felt for her this time. Los Angeles Airport wasn’t exactly the best place for an out-of-towner to gradually become acclimatized to California driving.         Her next obstacle was finding I-5.  She was hit with a barrage of highways and wasn’t sure if she would find it the first time around.  The rush-hour traffic wasn’t helping either.  She was losing patience with her surroundings and started taking her frustrations out on me.  Since I was relatively calm I tried to help her out with the street signs, as per her request, but each time I opened my mouth she yelled out, “Be quiet!  Can’t you see I’m lost?”  She wasn’t lost and quickly found the exit for I-5.         My cousin had left her good instructions but, not anticipating my mom to be a nervous wreck, she failed to mention how long it would take before you saw any signs of civilization.  Once she passed over a steep grade known affectionately as the Grapevine, the terrain became isolated and desert-like.  My mom was certain she had missed the entire city of Bakersfield.  When I informed her that I hadn’t seen any exit signs she pulled off to the side of the road and started shaking.  She started hitting me as hard as she could.  I was accustomed to getting hit in the car but this was different.  Her rage was at its best.  While punching me in my upper arm she shouted, “Shut up! Shut Up!  Do you think I really want to live here?  Look at this place!  It’s ugly!”  She began to cry harder than I had ever heard her cry before. It sounded like an alien mating call. As bruises began to develop she cried out, “I hate you and I wish I never brought you out here!”       She continued to cry as I sat in silence.  Nothing I could say would stop her madness.  A few minutes later I began to cry too.  Maybe Kari and her mom were right.  I made a wish for them to come and save me from her.  Suddenly my mom snapped out of her trance.  She repeated how sorry she was over and over.  I stopped crying and shot her a hateful look but otherwise didn’t respond.  That was one of our last major fights.  We moved into an apartment for the first time.  My mom didn’t want the neighbors to hear us so our arguments from that moment on were kept low keyed.  In other words she hit me but I wasn’t allowed to yell out anymore.
