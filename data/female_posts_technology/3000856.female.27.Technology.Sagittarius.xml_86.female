Cooked dinner, cleaned, picked up my new phone, did some grocery shopping and bought some stuff for Boston. I leave next Fri. Woo Hoo. Yeah me! Jeremy I called you back so no more grief for me thank you very much! LOL April, Joe and the kids are coming over tonight to meet Dena and have some pizza. Dena came to work w/ me today. Quite a few people say she and I look alike. We have different dads so they have to be traits from our mother. Talk more later!
