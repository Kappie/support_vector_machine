Tapi biler dah dapat benda yang dikejar-kejar tu ada pulak orang yang stupid enough to let it slip away. Stupid?  Yups..i'm one of the stupid dumb ass people who let it slip away right in front of my eyes.  UWWaaa... i can't believe i said NO to that. A big fat no! This is like the biggest regret in my life...ever! No wait... second kot..second biggest regret. I feel like nak hantuk je kepala kat dinding..tapi sakit.. isk! isk! isk! PENYESALAN!!!!!! That was like the only chance i have to prove myself tapi skarang ?uhuk uhuk.. ;( akulah orang paling buduhhhhssss buat masa ni kat planet  ni!  note to self ... do not make any decision/dealing right after waking up early in the morning !  natural born loser?
