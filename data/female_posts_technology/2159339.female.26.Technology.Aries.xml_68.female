You see, many years of ignoring the holiday season completely with family, combined with boys who weren't big on gift exchange resulted in never having to brave the malls in search of presents or expecting them in return. Sure, G  I make lists of things we want - and then we go shopping and get them for ourselves. We may not be surprised, but we're never disappointed. Once every couple of years mom whips out her checkbook and asks "How much?" to which we reply  "Oh, I don't know. How about a hundred?", but this year she is too preoccupied with dad's existential crisis to remember that the holidays are in full bloom. Which is just fine. Except that two days ago, I received in my email 'A List of Gift Ideas for Me' from M. On the day before that, he had asked me what I want for Christmas and, thinking he must be joking, I said car air freshner (which I could ideed use). Well! His list contained camping gear, magazine subscriptions, photo books and ... um, other things of questionable practicality. Worried about what I may get in return, I emailed him a list of things  not  to get me -  anything that vibrates, porn, anything with heels and/or leopard print, etc..etc.. So now, in the midst of moving and working and dealing with family problems and school applications, I have to spend my precious time looking for something cheap and sensible only to give it to  someone else ? I'm afraid not, my friends. Must think of plan B.
