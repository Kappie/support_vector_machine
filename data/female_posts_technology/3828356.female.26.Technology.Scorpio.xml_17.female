Does anyone really care about what I would have to say?  I guess we shall see.  I'm hanging out with my cousin right now, listening to some mellow piano music.  Acutally, she's singing some Willie Nelson...the classic "You Were Always on My Mind".  We're conspiring that we will each start our own blogs and link to each other, and create our own network and community.  So, we'll see if it works.  If you're reading this and am interested in what I have to say, keep coming back.  In fact, I will be curious to see if anyone finds this page and comments on it.  Perhaps I'm setting myself up for disappointment.  Ta ta for now!!
