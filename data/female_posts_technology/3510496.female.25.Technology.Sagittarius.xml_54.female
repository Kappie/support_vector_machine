Ficelle is a particularly a skinny French loaf. Delifrance baguette will work fine, too.  1 stick of celery, cut into small inches (original use red onions which I abhor) 2 tbsp of olive oil, for brushing 1/2 tsp of salt 1 10-ounce of merguez, or few sausages, sliced in 1/2 lengthwise 1 6-ounce ficelle, or baguette, cut into 2, then sliced in 1/2 lengthwise 3 tbsp of Dijon mustard  Cook the sausage and celery on pan fry, or better grill it with olive oil and sprinkle with the salt, till celery softens. Spread the inside ofthe baguette with the mustard, and then fill it with the cooked sausage and celery.  So simple to be serve!       Turkey Sandwich with Cucumber Slaw    total time: 20 minutes to 2 hours (to whip the slaw), 5 minutes (to put to sandwich) | makes 2 sandwiches  Cucumber is one of hubby's favorite 'fruit'. I am not fanciful of it, unless its very finely sliced or better still grated. For this sandwich, using normal, soft white bread is the best, because it best soaks up "juice" from the tangy creamy slaw.  1 cucumber, grated 3 tbsp of sour cream 1 tbsp of Dijon mustard 2 tsp of capers 2 tsp of gherkins 1/4 tsp of salt 4 slices of white sandwich bread 4 thinly sliced deli-counter roast turkey  In a medium bowl, combine grated cucumber, sour cream, mustard, capers, gherkins and salt. Refrigerate for 15 minutes to 2 hours to let the flavors mingle. Divide half the cucumber misture between 2 pieces of the bread. Alternate toppings of cucumber slaw and turkey on the sandwich bread. Use a kitchen scissors/knife to cut the sandwich into triangular halves.  Voila! Ready to be eaten.
