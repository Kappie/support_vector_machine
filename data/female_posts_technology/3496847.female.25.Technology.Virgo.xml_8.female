Symptoms:   sore throat  cough  tired  general ickiness  headache I ended up staying at work until 2pm.  I was on course last friday, so there was some work piled up from that and other stuff that had to be sone today.  As long as I kept busy and didn't move too much I was okay.    I took the streetcar from the subway station because it drops me off right infront of my building.  Normally I never bother with the streetcar, but I just wasn't up to walking the few blocks home.    A few friend's have had this codl too, and it's a bitch.  It seems to come and go - one day you feel okay then you feel like crap - for a about two weeks.  I'll 've had it for a week on Wednesday.     Too tired to continue bitching.....for now
