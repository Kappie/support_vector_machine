Sad, yes it is, but when considering the odds of an extension or a re run, haha, it was getting to be a comedy of errors.  As life treats me with an iron rod and I begin my journey towards the new horizon, I have learnt a few lessons...and have learnt it the really hard way...  1.  Never trust ppl....yes, I had said this before....but then there was someone who stole this principle from me and I had to share and then also put this on the back burner.....trust none, coz that gives you extreme pain and misery.  One day you will be happy and the next day you will feel like garbage!  2.  Pack your emotions aside...yes, me the romantic and ever open yourself up person is saying this.  Never allow your emotions to rule you, always rule over your emotions. Emotions just kill you and choke the daylights out of you.  Before you know you will find yourself in the morgue of misery, counting each of the moments you gave into your emotions and wrecked your peace and sanity!  3.  Extreme care with words...This has always been a principle with me, have never let myself down with this and never intend to ever do so too!  Always give one answer for 4 questions, never say something too nice or too harsh to ppl, coz they will twist it around and make you look like an absolute idiot.  4.  Never allow ppl to say " dont think about I first "....always think about I...I is important, never let yourself down. The minute you let yourself down you are assured of one thing, ppl will treat you like a door mat and slam you across the floor with zero mercy!  5.  Never be nice to ppl...Ppl always mistake niceity and at the end of the day, you will find yourself mopping your own tears. People will care for you till they get what they want, the minute they have achieved that you are useless material and they forget about your existence!  All these things are really hard to say...but believe me..after I went thro a rollacoaster today..I have learn tthigns the hard and very bitter way...GOD SAVE ME...pls....take away this misery...take away this pain...I cant take this anyone...why so much hate and misery in my life..what did I do to deserve this!   I dont know if I will ever get answers for these questions...but I do know one thing....this pain will teach me a bitter lesson for life and I will never ever make these mistakes again...and if I do...I think I will rest assure myself, that will be the last time I write a blog in my life!
