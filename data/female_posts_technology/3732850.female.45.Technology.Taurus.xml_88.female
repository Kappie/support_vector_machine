I like the emotion and the love he had for his grandfather. Ever since I was very young I’ve had an interest in nursing. I remember when my grandpa passed away when I was eight years old. I thought to myself that if I was a nurse maybe I could have helped him. At the young age of eight, I realized death is forever.  When I was twenty I began working as a nurse’s aid. I worked at Havenwood Care Center in Bemidji. I worked at the nursing home for two and half years. As a nurses aid I helped the elderly residents with their activities of daily living. Many of the residents come to the nursing home. They come to live out the rest of their lives in nursing homes. It was difficult because they could no longer take care of themselves at home. Their skin was fragile, and sensitive. Some residents had dementia and Alzheimer patients. I enjoyed visiting them at supper time and I would talk to the residents that could not speak although the other staff would not. I just hope someone would talk to me if I could not speak.  I was frequently asked to stay over. Although, exhausted from working the evening shift, I would stay and help. First, rounds at one a.m. involved a lot of lifting and turning patients. We would answer lights and take turns taking residents to the restroom. Rounds went by fast and it kept me from being sleepy.  At three a.m. it was time to round again. Half way though rounds I checked the lady in the second bed, and I found something shocking. I turned on the light and noticed the woman’s skin was yellow and cold. Her eyes were open, and her leg was hanging over the bed as if she was trying to get up. I said her name but she did not answer me. Just two hours ago I had spoken to this lady and she said, “So is it time to get up.” Wow, this was the first person I had actually found dead. I felt very confused and I felt like this wasn’t real. I had no idea this would have such an emotional impact on me.  I found it was hard to deal with at first, I couldn’t forget how scary she looked lying in bed starring. I didn’t know if I would be able to continue to work in this field but as they say time heals all.  Today I am working at Cass lake Public Health Services hospital. Although people die there too, I am gaining experience in a variety of areas. Now I have three children and I cherish each day that I am able to play with, feed, and provide for, there for them because someday I too will be old.
