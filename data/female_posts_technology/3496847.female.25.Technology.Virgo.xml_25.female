There are a few runs that are challenging, but you feel great once you're done.  I've made it to week 6 or 7 on a few occasions, but I tend to give up then.   But I will not give up this time!     Cool Running also has a great forum - great people to help keep you motivated.  Some are new runners and some a veterans.  A great place to visit if you're thinking of starting running.  I have a cat and while I was trying to type this entry she caught a fly in my bedroom.  I was a little grossed out when she tried to eat it on my bed.  I managed to shoo her off the bed, but then she was carrying the fly, in her mouth, around my apartment - and it was still buzzing.  I'm so glad she's an indoor cat.  I would hate to have her bring mice and birds in the house.    Well, I'm off to mentally prepare for a Friday at the office.  I like Friday as much as the next 9-to-5'er, but do we all have to go around on Fridays saying, "Thank G*d it's Friday."  The same goes for cursing Mondays.
