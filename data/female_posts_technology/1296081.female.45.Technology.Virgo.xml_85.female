I got a brand spankin' new computer at work today and let me say right here and right now - it's smokin'.  No more slovenly computer behavior, no more waiting for the freakin' windows to open and most importantly to me - NO MORE GRINDING!!!!  I almost don't know how to behave with the quiet in my space.  This new computer is a lovely thing too - goes well with the government issue cubicle furniture and it doesn't mess with the feng shui of the workspace at all.  I am feeling mucho better about life and work right now.  Of course - there are some noses out of joint that I got a new workstation before them but that's the way it works.  Don't hate me because my computer is beautiful.
