I believe the top two canidates will now get hired to fill the posted open position and the recently open spot.  The HD team needs a good boost/shot in the arm.  Too much bad past blood in there and new favoritism is not helping the situation either.  Anothre fun moment about the situation today; the part-timer, AKA: The Princess, is so far, AWOL.  She's almost outta here as well.  If not on her own according then theirs.  Good thing I'm in an isolate spot and pretty free to do what I want when I want. Love the size of my office too.  If anyone is in the area and wants to do lunch, let me know.  Call the cell it's on during the day.  I can go almost any time I want too. :D  Another fun part of my day is sending out 10 laptops to the UK to get there by Friday.  Let's see if this goes better than last week's did.  They did get the machines, a day late thanks to airborne cause they can not read but they did get 'em.  Strange out of the 700+ machines I have shipped out of here in approximately 4 months, I have only "lost" 3.  I say "lost" cause 2 were scanned as being on the truck but funny how they never made it to the airborne hub. hmmmm.  The third made it onto the truck, into the hub, shipped to the state but never made onto the truck or to our office in NC.  I find it a big odd and humorous at the same time.  Now I'm not perfect by no means.  I have done my share of miss shipments but I have not lost a laptop on my own accord.  Budget Movie night tonight.  I have one friend that is available wants to go.  Not sure if I so much up for it but we'll see how the day goes and how my back holds out from a crazy busy day.  Question:  Is life an adventure or something to get thru?
