The days drag on and you wonder when is all this going to end? Sometimes I long for death and yet I've escaped it a couple of times. The only probable reason why my life has been spared is that I still have to do something before I die. But what is that something!? Could it be that I'm meant to become an influential figure that will change the world?-yeah right. I know that certain actions-no matter how simple they may seem can actually be life changing so I try not to discount them no matter how small they look to me.  I've drafted a list of things to do before I die and so far I've only accomplished one. The list isn't really long but the items on the list can take forever to finish. Still, I'm not giving up. It's not because I find them too difficult but I let myself be lazy. Sometimes I feel like the princess of procrastination. I keep putting off the things I have to do until the next day. So many days have passed and it's about time that I get my ass of this chair and do something about that list. And then perhaps once I get the items on that list done, life will let me rest.
