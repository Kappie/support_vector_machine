I think it has to do with the fact I'm a little confused as to my job situation. I'm not sure exactly where I stand. I made the decision to go part-time, even though I have kept the main duty of redesigning the user-interface for the software system our company sells.      Anyways, it's as if magically by going part-time all my smarts and insight are no longer valid. I am no longer an individual to which people come for input and ideas. I'm not "management" anymore. I don't know why I let it bother me, but I do.      I have put in 8 years with this company, mostly in a management, or at least leadership, position. My input being very valued during pretty much the entire time. Except now. We did a reorg, and I now have a manager over me. Someone who really wants the job, but is about 10 years younger than me, and who has only worked here a little over a year.      No problem with that, really. I did after all make the decision to not come back full-time, otherwise I would have my current manager's job. However, it still rankles. I"m all of a sudden a non-entity. Is it because I'm part-time, and therefore cannot participate in a fashion where I can provide good feedback, or is it because I'm not a manager, and therefore not 'important' enough to have a valid opinion anymore?      It bugs me either way. Don't know what to do about it, since I don't want to go back full-time...although I pay full-time daycare so I can be available to come in on the days I don't work, when necessary. I also work at home on days I have off, so I can't say that on average I'm incommunicado during my days off....I work 27-30 hours on average. My days off, besides Saturday and Sunday, are Wednesday and Friday.      I don't know what my point is. I haven't told anyone about this because I'm not sure it's an issue, but somehow, in my gut, I feel it is. Oh, well, at least I got it down on e-paper.      Thanks for listening,   shawn
