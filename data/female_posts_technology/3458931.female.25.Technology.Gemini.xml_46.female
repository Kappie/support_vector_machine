NEUTRAL  Waited around for the person who was going to teach me to make said cables and then at 11AM was told to go to lunch and come back at 1. Two-hour lunch break: GOOD  Was spending the two hour lunch break by the water, very peaceful. Suddenly the cell phone rings. Jasmin is having an incident at the day camp again: BAD  Show up at the day camp to collect my child. Was told not to bring her back, and to collect a refund for the remainder of the week at the main office: BAD  Have half a day off work on a beatiful sunny day: GOOD  Ring up Jeff. Jeff is off work and taking care of a friends' dog, and this is probably an opportunity to hang out and go boating. Yeah I'm not very good at punishing my kid. I get a call back after a bit and sure enough, he's got the boat and the dog and would love to take us out. It was a short trip but my gosh it was fun. I just love the water. Now I'm lusting for a sailboat again! GOOD  Appointment at dental surgeon to talk about my wisdom teeth. Will require all four wisdom teeth surgically extracted for a total cost close to $1000: BAD  Grab a quick bite to eat and head out to softball game where I make a wrather good hit: GOOD    I have tomorrow off too, Jasmin and I have an appointment at the mental health clinic and then she'll be staying with my parents in Saint John until I can find an alternate child care solution here. I have mixed feelings about this; I hate that it's a bit of a burden on my parents, even though neither my brother or sister are employed at the moment and my dad is only doing odd jobs for my aunt. At the same time, it's the one place I know won't kick her out so it gives me some much-needed peace of mind. Oh, and it means I can actually have a bit of normal 25-year-old life for a while.
