On Saturday I visited my auntie (and alsochecked in with the family members who are taking care of her) and she looks even worse. She could barely talk to us because she was in so much pain from the cancer. She has a morphine patch that supposedly provides relief, but she was teary-eyed and her face was in a constant grimace. She tried to say hello to us, but then another surge of pain would shoot through her and she would hold her stomach and squeeze her eyes shut. This is from a woman who never complains about anything. I sometimes have to leave the room because I feel so helpless and sad and frustrated that I can'tlessen her pain. I know the magnitude of it must beexcruciating when she whispers, "It hurts."   After that my brother, his gf, and I drove up to visit my dad. On the way there my brother goes, "It's bright!" and reaches for his sunglasses. And I just about choked on my own spit because he puts on his face these monstrously huge, hideous, Yoko-Ono-type, my-pupils-are-dilated-so-I-have-to-wear-these-sunglasses sunglasses. And he puts them on OVER his regular glasses. I laughed so hard. "Where did you get those?!!" I said and he replied, "Walgreens. 5 bucks!" and I said, "God, I can't believe you were making fun of ME with MY sunglasses; just look at YOU with YOUR sunglasses on!" He stated in non-response, "I wear them to play poker."   Me: What??? Why??  Him: So people can't see my reaction. And so I can look at people and they can't tell.  Me: I can't believe you wear those. Isn't poker a coool game? Don't you want to  look  cool?  Him: No. I just want to win money.   Together we visited my dad who looks worse. His mouth was frightening to look into. His tongue was dried out and layers of skin were peeling off in rows. His entire mouth on the inside was peeling and it was like peering into the mouth of death. It was a cave of dried skin cobwebs instead of a regular mouth--an openingthat is normally lubricated and alive. It was wrong and horrible. I wanted to help him. I wanted to take a spray bottle and mist his mouth with a couple squirts. I wanted him to respond when I talked to him or when the doctor shook his shoulder to try to rouse him, but nothing. The doctor told us he was still unresponsive and that he had kidney failure, a lung infection, and a urine infection. He said he would be able to tell us more on Sunday.   Sunday morning I got a call from my mom. There's no hope for my dad and we all decided together as a family that we could not prolong his life in the state that he was in. He's unresponsive, emaciated, doesn't talk, and cannot eat. We didn't want to prolong his state, connected to IVs and catheters, with a feeding tube. The doctors assured us that he would be comfortable and ensured us that they'd do their best to minimize any pain. My mom said that it was the right thing to do because he shouldn't suffer anymore. I told her that I agreed.   My mom said to me, "It's so sad that all these bad things are happening all at once,  con ." Then she corrected herself, "Well, not BAD; that's just life,  con ... It's just life."
