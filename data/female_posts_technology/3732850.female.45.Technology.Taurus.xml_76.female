Sanders wrote "When America was all wilderness except for occasional villages and orchards and clear fields, a journey of any distance was a serious undertaking." This reminded me of my uncle because we too would take journeys into the wilderness that were sometimes difficult.  I helped my uncle build his cabin far in the deep woods of Minnesota. What made it so difficult is that there are no roads that would allow a standard size vehicle to enter, everything was either brought in by hand or with the use of a four wheeler. During our jouney into the woods, I can recall a feeling of being one with the land. Much of the wood that we used to build this cabin came directly from the forest we cleared in order to make room for the cabin. We spent many back breaking days working and on occasion we would visit the closest town just to take a well needed shower and have a "home" cooked meal. I felt as if I was a pioneer back in the old days.  Sanders essay also reminded me of how our(Caucasian) culture differs is comparison to the Native American culture. He states "We will carry a pouch of tobacco to placate the old water monsters, along with a water-treatment kit to placate the new ones, those poisons and parasites we two-leggeds have flushed into the remotest rivers and lakes." This made me think of how the Native American culture seems to be more in tune with their surroundings. Many Native Americans have beliefs that differ from what society has deemed "the norm". They seem to nurture the land, not taking anything of value from it, leaving it as they found it after they have been there. Whereas the (Caucasian) culture seems to only look at something for their benefit without concern for what could have been, a lasting beauty.
