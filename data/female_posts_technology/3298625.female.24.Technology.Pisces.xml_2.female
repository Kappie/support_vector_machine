I mean don't I know how? okay a new guy came into town, one I hadn't seen in ages, and wam he kissed me... it was short but not at all very impressive. I admit to trying it out and seeing how it was when it wasn't all that stopped it.. that was evil.. but hey it has been a while and a girl has needs and ohh kissing is such a need..;) I think I will take kissing classes, I believe there is an art to kissing and if done right shit could be the most erotic things ever. Actually as I am writting this I have discovered what was wrong with his guys kissing.. for him kissing isn' just kissing it is a way to get a girls cloths off. I think when it is that guys don't pay all that much attention to it and then they miss all the signs that the girls give, like slow down or lets do the nibbling or maybe lets make it a dance. Am I putting way too much emphasis on kissing? mhhh I think not. I mean afterall it is kissing for heavens sake.. give it as much emphasis as you can. LOL.  My first kiss to a guy I was heads over heals for tothis day remains one of the most erotic kisses ever, I will try to explain how it happened. it was around 11 at nighton august 3rd 1997 I believe, it was his birthday and from me he asked for only one thing a kiss. This guy had loved me for 3 years without any reciprocity from me.:( anyways, he was slightly taller and when he saw me he knew I had finally agreed and he didn't say a word he took me in his arm and when his lips touched mine, the magic started. It was a dance, when I withdrew he came in for me and when he withdrew I went in for him and then right on top of each other there was suction but not like suction.. get it? The rest of the world seriously evaporated, I didn't hear anything, I saw fireworks, literally maybe it was in my head since my eyes were closed but damn it was good. and then my first serious boyfriend he knew where my limits were and so he would never push the line and his kisses were addictive like literally, and I remember he would drink redbull and then uhhh... he would tatse like, ohhhh I don't know what but it rocked my world.  Since then I haven't met any guys who kiss just to kiss you. Oh yeah there was another onebutI think I have told enough kissing escapades don't you think... and he eventually destroyed it but wanting to go further LMAO.. why do they do that?  later
