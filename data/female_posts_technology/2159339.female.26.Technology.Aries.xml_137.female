This time for three months to Wisconsin for a photojournalism internship. He wants me to drive out there with him. It will take us five days and we will stay in motels of my choice. I'm looking forward to the roadtrip but wonder what will happen when he's gone that long. A month wasn't bad, but three might be a bit much, no? And then I think, who knows if we'll even be together by that time, anyway.   It was awkward for a few minutes when he came over, us relating as bf/gf, more solemn and timid than we used to as friends. I tried not to make fun of him as much, seeing as he's more sensitive about it now and he refrained from doing anything asshole-esque. He laughed at my idea of us spending stupid Valentine's Day at home watching tv as 'letting the romance die too soon'. But I'm vehemently opposed to getting a mud bath, so we'll have to compromise somewhere in the middle.  He lost some weight and got darker. When I hug him, my small arms go all the way around his waist. He brought me trinkets from San Salvador and Antigua and agreed to get a donkey for the Grand Canyon trip. I gave him a book that he doesn't already have (which I purchased with the Stacey's gift card I found on the street) and I am almost done with his scarf. I looked at his photostory of the family who lives in a cemetery and told him of my recent visits to the factory. It's been 14 whole hours and we haven't fought once.
