Still looking to move the old Quix art over here. and Finally start a major project, just for Metahari.com  Started a new job at rotozip.com , it's nice to be employed.  For those who don't read my stuff over at quixotica.com, I got layed off with a bunch of other people all around the country in december.  so, things are looking up... and only 11 weeks till I get married. woo
