I have been running on and off for almost 10 years now.  A few times in high school I would decide that I need to lose weight, be healthier, or just get a hobby.  So I would try running.  It would only last for a few weeks, then I would quit.  Last October I joined a running group and stuck with it for 4 months, but I'm back to square one now.   Yesterday morning I dragged my bottom out of bed and went for a "run."  I was able to run a minute at a time, with one minute walking in between, 7 times.  It was a sunny, cool morning.    Tomorrow morning, before work, I will run.
