All, the above relations aremonetary in nature and none of them is without anypurpose.  The philosophy is very simple, Give and Take.In the process, we are forgetting/ignoring ourpersonal relations, family relations and General HumanRelations, relations, which are based on values, love,affection and care.  You may call it as an influence of western culture orlack of time or self-fish nature of a person...we approach or remember our friends, relatives andsometimes even our parents...only at the time of need.There is no trust, no faith, no believe, no loyaltyand no love in relations.   Generally, whenever I extendmy hand for friendship, I face two types of queries from other people.  1)I don't know anything about you I am not interested? True, I don't know anything about you but does that stop you or me to know about each other. Relations,need time...in fact quality time.  2)What do you want from me? This is because, we knowthat nothing comes free and if some one is approaching you, it is only for some purpose. We believe that noone will be approaching you, without anypurpose...there is no self less relation. Probably yes, but I can assure you that I don't need you oryour help, I like to know about you, your values, yourbelieves, to understand you as a person...andprobably, I may be able to help you...sometimes...downin my life time.  I believe in two things:  1)Learning from other's experience  2)Every Person is Different  A child is born with numerous relations'...relations of parents, grandparents, relatives and what not. Why we are so poor in maintaining our relations? We are selfish, we are opportunistic, we never feel happy inthe happiness of others, we never celebrate otherssuccess and most importantly, we have doublestandards.  It is pathetic to know and read news like," Son murdering his mother or a father raping his daughter", these are the foundation of any relation...and if that foundation itself is so weak,what can we expect from other relations. Where are those values and culture, we are so proud off?  The question is very simple, if you are not able to maintain your relations with your parents, your children, your relatives and yourfriends, which are lesser in number and known to you;how are you going to maintain your relations with employees, which are larger in number and not known to you?
