There is nothing like getting new pens, pencils, paper, notebooks, etc.  As a kid, every summer I would wait in anticipation for the flyers to come out with the sales for school supplies.  Then I would sit at the table with my paper and pen and scour over all the deals making detailed notes about where each item could be found and for how much.  Not only was I excited to be getting new stuff for school, but I was also excited to be going back to classes.  I even looked forward to the homework and reading.  But now that I have completed my formal education I have no more need for school supplies...and yet the urge remains.  Maybe it's a sign. I can feel the classroom calling me...
