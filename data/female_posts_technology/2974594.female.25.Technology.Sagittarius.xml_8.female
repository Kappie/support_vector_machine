After meeting up with my long lost friend at One Utama, I went back home to get ready for Zouk's party. Picked up CC and the party at Zouk was much as expected... Boring rave music. I'm still a sucker for RnB music when it comes to partying I guess. After coming back home at 3am... I called my ex.  Damn... I was having fever and all...It made me realize about why we were never meant to be together in the first place anyways. After the 2 hour conversation, having my phone barred today because of it... I realize that I still haven't done the list of "What I want..." Just yet. I'm still flipping thru my pass... Clinging to something... I cant quite figure out what or why. DC didn't even cared when I told him I was sick. That's when I decided MT ought to be given a shot... Don't ask me why.. I just needed to get over my ex, DC, RT... everyone!!! I'm just sick and tired of being lonely, being so hard on myself... forcing temporary temptations on me just to forget things... Just cause I believe in fairytales...I'm really tired of the bullshit around me. So i began SMS MT and his respond is just overwhelming! I hope i dont get carried away again...  So, as of today, I managed to ignore DC... To decline his coffee invitation for the very first time....More to come,perhaps. I know it's just cruel of me to ignore... But I wish I could disappear instead, like how Frodo disappeared when he wore the ring. I'm taking time to think things over about what I want. Something good might turn out from all of this insanity. I took my parents to dinner last night. I felt really good that despite my troubles and depression, I managed to make my parents happy. And my cats are just as adorable themselves... I love them so much! It feels wonderful to wake up to Angel or Daisy in the mornings.. Knowing they are there for me thru my good and bad times and never once deny my love nor not give me their sincere affection. Even if my parents don't show me as much love as they ought to, I'm still thankful for the love they have for me.  All this grateful feeling coz someone SMS me late last night:  Bersyukur itu adalah tanda2 orang beriman.  I used to be very grateful of the things I have in my life. It's been a while since I thank God for everything he has blessed me with. This should be a good week ahead. I'm just gonna be friends with DC, hope things will be good for him, I'm looking forward to see MT again and perhaps, not hoping anything but just to give it a shot, perhaps we can be friends again...    "Everyone falls in love sometimes... sometimes it's wrong, sometimes it's right. For every win, someone must fail... But there comes a point when, when we exhale"
