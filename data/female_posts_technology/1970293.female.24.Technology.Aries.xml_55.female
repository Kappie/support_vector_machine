It was sweet bliss.  She sighed as she rested her head against his shoulder.  Her fingers played on top of his chest, running her fingers through his dark hair.  She gently kissed him on the cheek.  Nuzzling against his neck, she nibbled gently tasting his salty skin.   She felt as if she was in heaven with his arms wrapped tightly around her.  Safe.  Loved.  Cherished.  Treasured.
