My momtold me I'd run too much so I was to take it easy.She would rub the back of myknees until I would fall asleep andthe minute she would quit rubbing I would wake up immediately. Later on, during my teenage years, I ended up in the hospital with pnemonia for a week and lost forty pounds.  After that I kept having health problems. I ended up in the hospitalagain for ablood transfusion. I had to have three pints of bloodthat my brothers had to donate back because my mom and dad were too poor to pay for the bill. I ended up in the emergency many times for sprained ankles and wrists.The doctors never could figure it out until 1986 whenI was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritus. Thatwas in fosston, minnesota.Dr. Havens was the doctor at that time. He sent me to Dr. Lessard, a rheaumatologist,in Grand Forks, N.D. Hehad a bad bedside manner. I went to him for five years. One time he told me todrink a beer at night to loosen up. I was upset because my health was going to hell in a handbasket.  I took my health for granted, started to feel sorry for myself, and getting depressed on top of it. When I married, I had a little girl and I wasoverwhelmed with being a new mom. I had postpartum depression thatI was not diagnosed for but I would cry overlittle things. The way she smiled, the way she cryed, etc... When in Warroad, I worked at Marvin Windows andwas pregnant with my second child.In the fourth month, I was sick from here on out with thepregnancy.She was born five weeks early and in the NICU in Grand Forks hospital forthirteen days. She was five pounds, seven and a quarter ounces. The doctors werestumped of herearly delivery and I was scared myself. I started to have blackouts and had trouble walking. Istayed home four months and then returned to work. I brought in an American with Disibilities handbook and withinminutes I had a sitdown job.I put up with a lot of sny remarks. It was aweful. I tryed other jobs and still was sick. I kept getting sick and slipping deeper and deeper into depression. Finally, to the doctor again. This was in warroad, mnand was diagnosed with Lupus. I was sent to the Mayo Clinc and there were various tests where I was diagnosed with a blood clotting disease, a thyroid problem, and lupus. I was put on medication and feeling much better. Then the depression hit me hard. I had a terrible job, my marriage was terrible and I ended up in the hospital for medication that worked against me. I became suicidal and was taken off of the drug. I got better eventually. I have been stressed and burdened with health problems tremendously. And now, I still have problems but do the best I can to cope with what is a lifelong experience that won't go away.
