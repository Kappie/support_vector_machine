I could open a pool-cleaning service, considering how much I learned about that in the last week. I didn't go swimming; the water is too cold. So I grabbed some beer and sat by the poolside dangling my feet in the water and read while the sun set. Pretty. Goddamn bugs.   No stupid  movies last night, unless you want to call 1/2 of  urlLink X-Men  stupid, which I guess you could. Eh, it was entertaining; but I spent most of the time wishing Hugh Jackman would do something about that hair helmet. Magneto's cool. The second movie is much better. How often do you get to say that?
