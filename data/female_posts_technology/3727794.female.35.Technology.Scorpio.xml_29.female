Heard from an old friend from way back in my dating-the-first-hubby days.  She also is divorced from the butt-head she married (actually her butt-head ex was best friends with my butt-head ex.)  We should have looked out for each other better.  Actually the problem was we'd all go out together and she  I'd have fun and the butts would have fun, we didn't realize what a pain the guys were until we each moved away and we were stuck with them by ourselves.  Ah well, I wouldn't have the munchkins and she wouldn't have her little one either, so we're all better, stronger women now I guess.   I'm here all alone....just me and the bitter ones.  Everyone slightly normal is out on vacation, sick, or moved to TX.  I think I'll hide quietly, maybe no one will notice I'm here.  Cleaned off my desk, I actually saw the fake wood plank again, woo hoo what excitement down in the basement.  I'm taking the Joe-man out mini golfing at Incred-A-Bowl.  Then, my cousin's coming over and it's off to the boats.  I'm gonna take me some money from the old guys.  :)  Please, please, please let time move forward................
