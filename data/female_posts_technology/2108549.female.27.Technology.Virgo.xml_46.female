They are both exceptional people with quantities of love and acceptance I can only hope to have one day.  I got on of the Jars of Clay CDs yesterday in the mail from a friend on  urlLink LJ  and while I haven't had a chance to listen to it yet, I can't wait!  Yesterday M.A. and I had lunch.  I realized as I was driving to meet him, just how much I miss having those weekly lunches!  Work definitely bites in regards to that.    Freedom has a staph infection, nothing major that antibiotics and a sterios shot won't clear up but he was definitely uncomfortable.  $100 my baby is non-itchy, and relatively happily back on his way to recovery.  I am just incredibly tired.  I have plans tonight and tomorrow night but Thursday and Friday are going to be reserved to getting some rest.   A friend and I were talking last night and apparently its time for me to grow up.  This wasn't said meanly or cruelly, nothing like that at all, simply matter of fact.  This is probably very true.  The problem is though that I don't know what the traits of a grown up are.  Does it mean that I do everything by myself and don't lean on people?  Does it mean that I don't talk to anyone about what's going on? That I don't ask anyone for help? I don't know what *grown up* looks like. Its not like I have had a lot of examples to follow.  And I think my fear of growing up stems from the fear of not doing it right, especially when I don't know what *right* is.  Its frustrating.  I just want to do everything right all the time.   And without a way of measuring right, I don't know how to do it.
