Is it Murphy's Law that people who say that they will help you move always seem to find a reason at the last minute to back out?  I was unable to get the day off, and so it was Dave and a friend with a horse trailer.  Yup..two people to move our worldly possesions.  However, it got done, and the stuff that didn't...well, it was stuff that could fit in a car.  Thank goodness!  BUT...now the daunting task..yes, unpacking.  Oh, how I hate unpacking.  I don't know what's worse...packing or unpacking.  The house is littered with boxes and bags, everything looks so cluttered, and I haven't got a CLUE where to start putting things.  It's so overwhelming.  My response to being overwhelmed tends to be to just sit and stare at it, and then turn on the TV..or in this case, write a blog.  In any case, my long weekend will be filled with boxes and the ever exciting NEW adventure...WHERE are we going to put THIS???  Anyhow, Happy Long Weekend everyone...talk to you soon!  -J.
