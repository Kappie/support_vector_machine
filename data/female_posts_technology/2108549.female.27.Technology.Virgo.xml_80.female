Something has to be torn up and replaced and reseated and installed and a dohickey is needed in someplace and well, yeah.  Its got a long ways to go.  Hopefully I can get my phone up by Saturday night though.  Trying to unpack at least one box a night so far has been working but I am running out of easy boxes to unpack!  How tempting to just take them out and donate them!  :)  I got to have a long talk last night with my upstairs neighbor and she is a sweetie.  With him being a chef and her being so nice, we'll have fun.  Especially since I have the Freedo mutt to seal the deal.
