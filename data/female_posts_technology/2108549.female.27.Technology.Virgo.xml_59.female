I don't care too much really about who reads what on here however when I see the same IP address hitting my journal five ten or fifteen times a day, it makes me uncomfortable. I have blocked access from thier IP using an htaccess file, they change their IP, I block the new one, they get a third one.  So I am in effect, going underground with my journal for an unknown time period.  If you wish to be added to the mailing list and have my entries emailed to you, please  urlLink email me  and let me know.  Maybe this seems a bit paranoid or defeating the purpose and to be honest, I don't care.  Its unnerving to have someone checking back so very often during the day to see what is going on in my life.
