Yes, we can live with this lovable opinionated little bastard running around the house.   urlLink     I can only imagineâ€¦  Cartman:  I would never let a woman kick my ass. If she tried something, I'd be like, HEY! You get your bitch ass back in the kitchen and make me some pie!   Cartman:  Respect My Authoritah!   Cartman:  Why is it that everything today has to do with things either going in or coming out of my ass?   Butters:  We're not Christian, we just pretended to be.  Cartman:  Remind me to cut your balls off when we get back.   Cartman:  Hippies.They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad.   Cartman:  That movie has warped my fragile little mind.   Cartman:  I'm not fat. I'm big-boned.  Stan:  No, Jay Leno's chin is big-boned. You are a big, fat ass.   Cartman:  Well, Kyle, appreciate you being so open with me about this, but as we know, you have a warped perception of reality because you're jewish.   Cartman:  Well, I've been lickin' this carpet for 3 whole hours and I don't feel like a lesbian.   Cartman:  The poor kid passes it to the Jew, the Jew shoots. He misses! Proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!  Kyle:  Shut up Cartman! Your body is bigger than the goal!  Cartman:  No, I just have a sweet hockey body.   Mr. Garrison:  How would you like to go see the school counselor?  Cartman:  How would you like to suck my balls?  Mr. Garrison:  What did you just say?!  Cartman:  Oh, I'm sorry (Clears throat and pulls out megaphone), actually what I said was, "How would you like to suck my balls, Mr. Garrison?"   Cartman:  If some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, 'Hey. Why don't you stop ... dressing me like a mailman ... uh, and making me dance for you ... while you go and ... smoke crack in your bedroom ... and have sex with ... some guy ... I don't even know. On my dad's bed.  Stan:  Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?  Cartman:  I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all.   Kyle:  Wow! That's a lot of seamen, Cartman.  Cartman:  Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley.  Stan:  That's cool.  Cartman:  Yeah, and the sweet thing is, the stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck on a hose.   Cartman:  Now stop wasting Mel Gibson's time, you little pussy prick.  Stan:  Don't take that tone with me, kid. I'll kick your ass.  Cartman:  Yah. Well, I'd like to see you try. I'm, like, 6 feet tall.  Stan: Yah.  Well, you sound like a little bitch to me.  Cartman:  Bitch! Don't call me bitch, bitch!  Stan:  Bring it on then, bitch!  Cartman:  I already brung it, bitch. I brung it, opened it, and set it on the table, bitch.   Cartman (singing):  I want to get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus. I want to feel his salvation all over my face.    If you don't know  urlLink South Park  you wouldn't understand. Only Cartman can get away with this.
