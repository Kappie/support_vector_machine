At first I thought that this story was actually being written by Mary Cassatt because of the great detail given by the author throughout the story. I realizedtowards the end that it was actually written by her niece.    The author did such a nice job describing and creating a mental image of Mary Cassatt from her desire to be an artist to the sacrifices she made in order to fulfill her dream. I like the statement the author used, "She typifies one kind of independent American spinster who keeps reappearing in our history in forms as various as Margaret Fuller and Katharine Hepburn." The author demonstrated a deep understanding of these woman, from their love life to their old age. Thank goodness there were woman, and still are, that dare to go against what society "believes" they woman should do.    I found it ironic and sad that Mary Casatt lost her eye site in her old age. Her art was the focus of her whole life and then to not be able to see. . . . Her life was truly a lonsome life but she felt she had accomplished her goal.
