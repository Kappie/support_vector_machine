The Dr said it is mild and I may not get that bad.  They don't want to put me on meds right now cause the side effects from the medicine may be worse than the actual symptoms right now.  If my attacks or symptoms get worse they will reevaluate the situation.  There are 2 things that scare me right now. 1)The band starts looking for someone to replace me and 2) I turn into one of those helpless people that ends up in a wheel chair. I have always done everything for myself and if it ever gets to the point where I have to depend on someone else I think I would rather be dead. Moving on....We tried out a new drummer last night. He kicked ass! Very quiet though, does not say much at all.  I guess we will see how that situation turns out.  Other than that nothing exciting. I think that is enough excitement for one life time! LOL Oh yeah and I am trying to fly one or both of my sisters here from California at some point this summer.  I am very excited about finally getting to meet them.
