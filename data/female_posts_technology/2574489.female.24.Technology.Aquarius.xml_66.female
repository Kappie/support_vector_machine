Today, my phone rang off the hook from friends and family wishing me a happy birthday, I got b-day wishes from strangers and from family members on my blog and greeting cards in the mail.  I love birthdays.  It's strange, people always asks me if I'm worried when my b-day falls on Friday the 13th but I have never looked at it that way.  To me its always been the day before Valentine's Day.    Oh, and probably the best part about my day is that my hubby sent me flowers at work.  My husband who doesn't believe in sending flowers, thinks its just for showing off, thinks that if you buy flowers it should be randomly and whenever you feel like it and shouldn't be from an expensive place....Well, he sent me flowers...and they were beautiful and smelled good, and I appreciated them.  I love you husband!  What a day...soon senility will set in...;)
