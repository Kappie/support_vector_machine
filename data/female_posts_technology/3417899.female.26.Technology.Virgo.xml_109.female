In trying to prove the robot will never be human, the detective asks him:  "Can you compose a symphony? Can you take this paper and draw a masterpiece?". The robot doesn't hesitate and spits back to the detective: "Can you?"....   Can I? Isn't that what make us truly amazing - the ability to create art, out of thin air - not out of imitation, not out of taught practices - but out of creativity and emotion?  .... Can I?
