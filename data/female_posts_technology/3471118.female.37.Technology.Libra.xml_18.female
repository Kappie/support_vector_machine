See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop and how patient he is for the autumn and spring rains. 8 You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord's coming is near. 9 Don't grumble against each other, brothers, or you will be judged. The Judge is standing at the door!   I am so far behind in my Bible readings it isn't even funny.  I have a feeling this is one I should have read the whole chapter to understand. We are supposed to be patient -- for what, I'm not sure, maybe Jesus' return, maybe with people who we don't get along with, maybe just in general.  Jesus will be returning to earth, and when he does he'll take care of judging people.  We don't have to do that now, we don't have to be angry with each other or judge each other.  We can be patient in the knowledge that when Jesus comes back, he'll take care of all that.  I have no idea if I'm even close on this one...
