I'm privileged enough to know that a lot of the people who I exchange blog visits with live in and have traveled in many different countries. And for those who dream of traveling to foreign countries like me, to all of you, what's your choice of financial poison?   Paris, France        Rome, Ital y        London, UK       Malaga, Spain     Let's all dream about it over the weekend shall we?
