I am off to buy a $12 power supply replacement from Fry's Electronics.  That's all that's wrong with it and so we cannot justify buying a new system.  I am sad. Very sad.  But I am happy too. Because this means we will leave our $$ untouched save for $12.  And this means more money for my upcoming SD trip and others.   I am happy...I guess. :)
