Some people announce that they have a giant secret and make you guess.   Some people tell you they have a secret, and they tell you who knows their secret, but they won't tell you the actual secret.   Some people tell you you're the only one that knows their secret then you find out that all your friends already know. Some people pretend they have a secret just to get on your nerves. Some people never talk about their secrets.   Some people don't even know they have secrets. I don't have any secrets that would ruin me if they got out.  I don't think. I won't usually tell a secret of mine unless I'm prepared to deal with the consequences. Most secrets are only really important to the beholder.  I told a secret today and I feel great about doing it.  I've gotten lots of responses about the  urlLink reunions pics .  Lots of people think they look funny.  One person said: "I couldn't tell if that was me or some spastic man-beast that barely grasps the english language."  I'll let the readers decide who it was.  I've also gotten "There's one where I look pretty weird!" and "I've always looked like a strange dancer."  This is what strange dancer says about man-beast: "He does kind of look like an odd creature."  My favorite comment:  "Ooh-  I love the photos! And such a cute one of you with the purse/ben with the shoes! What a dynamic duo - so Batman and Catwoman, so Lucy and Ricky, so Kermie and Piggy (okay, I'll stop)." Notice the "Ooh."  I've been told that I overuse the term "ooh" in my blog.  I'm not sure that's possible.  Now's the paragraph when I share some deep revelation I had today.  It's a secret.  If you close your eyes, I'll whisper it in your ear...
