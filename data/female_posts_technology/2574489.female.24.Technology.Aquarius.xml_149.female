We all have to work hard to make everything add up just right.  In the U.S. the average household holds $8000 in credit card debt alone, so I guess a lot of people are not having an easy time making expenses and income equalize. One type of business booming across the U.S. today are payday loan businesses, where they extend you a loan against your coming paycheck.  This is supposed to be done for emergencies, but analysts have found that these payday cash advances are used for anything as trite as going shopping or a spa getaway.  The interest on these? Anywhere from 200-1368% APR!  Think this is exaggerated? Google "average interest payday loans" and you'll see countless articles verifying this.   Has America gone insane?  Or is it just a fact of life manifesting itself in a way that capitalists can take advantage of; that of limited resources, unlimited wants?  Or maybe P.T. Barnum said it best when he said "There's a sucker born every minute."  We may shake our heads at people who go to these lengths to pay bills, but the truth is, most people don't know where their money is going. You can itemize the big ticket items like your rent/mortgage, car, insurance.  Unless you itemize every single penny you spend for a month of two, you won't notice that you spend about $500 a month on that cigarette habit, or $1200/month on eating out for lunch, or $1000 on clothes.   When I started keeping track of my expenses on an excel spreadsheet, I didn't know I spent almost $800 a month on items I marked as miscellaneous.  Things I didn't need.  The hardest part about being on a budget is that you can't lie to yourself and tell yourself you've got a couple of hundred dollars left to do this and that.  Your bottom line on that damn spreadsheet is telling you that you don't. So I can't tell myself that I can spend whatever I want on this upcoming San Diego trip. I have to be on a budget.    The best part about being on a budget is that you can't lie to yourself anymore and dig yourself deeper in debt. If you lie to yourself anyway, then you're just a sucker.
