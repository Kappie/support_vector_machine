I'm trying to do too much at work today - I had thought I would define the templates for 6 sections of our site, but I'm going to settle for three.  I think my brain's overheated (or is that just because they turn off the AC over the weekends at the office?).  Iron Chef America is terrible. Not terrible like the version William Shatner hosted, but not Iron Chef. The hokiness of the show when it's actually filmed in Japan is part of what I like about it, but when it's here, it's just bad.  Soap opera bad. I think I'll pass on the three remaining shows...  Oh well, there's always tomorrow.  Sunday paper and mimosas...  :)
