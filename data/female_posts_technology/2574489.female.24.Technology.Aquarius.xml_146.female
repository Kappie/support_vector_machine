I can still see the old me sometimes when I look in the mirror.  I'm the tall one in the middle. Funny how everyone thought I would grow up so tall, and now some of those pictured shorter than me are now taller by far!:     Here's a close-up. I look mataray but was actually sad and had been crying. My mom had yelled at me that morning.
