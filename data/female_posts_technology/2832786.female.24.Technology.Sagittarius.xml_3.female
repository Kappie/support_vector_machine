For my last three dining experience, after I've placed my order, the waiter/waitress has suggested something else, and for all three times I have taken in their suggestions.   At Ruby Tuesdays, I ordered a coke and ended up getting a Mega-rita (see Niagara photos)   At Dave  Buster's, I ordered a Caesar and ended up getting a Margarita.   At Moxie's, I ordered mashed potatoes and I ended up getting a stuffed potato.   Why do the servers always pick me out? Because of my bad choice of meals? Because I have the word “pushover” written all over my face? I mean... this doesn't happen to anyone else at the same table. I don't understand.
