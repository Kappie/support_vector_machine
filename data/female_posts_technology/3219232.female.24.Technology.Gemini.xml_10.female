     
      Took a very short vacation after I resigned from my job. Celebrated my birthday and turned 24. Stayed in bed the entire day after drinking with friends at a small party I threw at a friend's bar the night before June 1st. Wondering what was in store-as with my last entry. Made decisions and I'm trying to stand by them. A bad girl trying to be good is how I see it to be.  I was contemplating on postponing my starting date with my new job but decided not to. And so I went to work the day after my birthday. For the past few days, I've been nothing but busy busy busy with learning what I had to do and I've been overloaded with information. Too much information that left my heading spinning. Although, I'm not complaining. This is what I wanted-to be busy and keep myself-more like my mind preoccupied. I wanted to change my work life and partly my lifestyle. It's time to move on to better and more fulfilling things. I'm finally moving. I've finally left the sinking boat.
