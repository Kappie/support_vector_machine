Sure, I was in love with the bastard, but like my wise brother said last night "Love should trump logic" and if M wants to be  logical   about us living in different parts of the country, then it must no longer be love. And I'm okay with that. If he was still staying with me, every night he would be in the living room drinking my beer and playing on his laptop (probably looking at porn) and frankly, I don't need that. On a random note, I'm hanging out with his ex-girlfriend in a few weeks. Not the friend from high school but the other one whom I met at his Good-Bye dinner. He said that if we have any desire to make-out and get naked, we should take pictures and send them to him. I told him that, instead, we'll probably talk a lot of shit and send him the transcript. I'm so glad we're still friends.  This weekend Batty  Green Marble are in New York, which means I have the house aaall to myself. My sweet little gramma wants to come over, which means I'll have to clean my room. Also mom expressed interest in seeing Farenheit 911, which shocks me because she has only seen one other movie in a theater since we moved here 16 years ago and that was "My Big Fat Greek Wedding". Rami and I are hanging out Saturday and TJ Maxx is having a BBQ on Sunday. Then there's there's a possible hike with Aaron and Izzy, which I'm still debating over as the bump on my head a.k.a. 'Rick's former home' has gotten bigger in the last few days and I'm afraid Rick might have left a little brother in my head.
