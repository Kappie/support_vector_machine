The sign above the display said  urlLink Mr. Wonderful Talking Doll  so out of curiosity I picked one up and pressed his hand.  The first thing the doll said was "Here, you take the remote, as long as I'm with you, I don't care what we watch."  I thought, hey this is great!  So I called my roommate over and told her to press his hand.  He said something like: "The ball game isn't really that important, I'd rather spend time with you."  You can also get Mr. Wonderful on a  urlLink keychain , just squeeze his tummy and he says what you want to hear.  So to all you girls out there searching for Mr. Right, look no further...guys, you taking notes?  At any rate, Mr. Wonderful would make a great gag gift.
