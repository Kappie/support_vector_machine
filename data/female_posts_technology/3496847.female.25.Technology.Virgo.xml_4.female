I finished it a week ago, but I got sick and wasn't able to move on to W4 right away.  I was barely able to get the energy to get out of bed to feed the cat so running was out of the question.  I'm feeling a lot better now and I've decided to repeat W3 and start W4 strong.  3.) How do you feel?  Since I hadn't run in 9 days and I'm still a newbie I figured today would be horrible.  I was paranoid that I'd have to go back to W2.  Luckily, I made it through today's run.  4.) Will you move on next week?  Yes  5.) Tell us your thoughts.  I'm just happy to be running.  6.) Are you taking extra time off to recover?   No, I'm not even that sore after the runs yet.
