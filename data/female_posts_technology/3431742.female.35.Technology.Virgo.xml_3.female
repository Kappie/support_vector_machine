I'm not exactly looking for details, a yes or no will do but i would like some comment or two added to yes or no. :)   ON THE WAY TO COOL SIDE... I have "reserved" my costs for FIJI.  It looks like it will be about 3k for an all inclusive week w/ flight out of milwaukee or chitown.  Ok i'm a tad bit excited about it....i so can't wait to be out of the states and somewhere completely new, different, across the international date line!
