After some debate over wording and much fiddling with the margin sizes, we finally came up with something we were happy with. It took a while to print since we had to feed them in manually and the printer would decide that there was an imaginary paper jam every five cards or so.   We finally got to addressing the envelopes, which caused yet another round of confusion. I pulled out my Miss Manners books to clarify issues like "How do you address an invitation to a couple with different last names?" (Woman first, then the man on the next line.) Buck finished his family and went home. I think I'll finish mine tomorrow. Buck went a lot faster since I was trying to write in neat cursive and he just printed. If any Bordens or Creels are offended by the way the invitations are addressed, blame Buck. *grin* Of course, the flip side of that is that anyone in my family gets to blame me for any invitation improprieties.  We're using Buck's address as the return address since he lives in a house and can better receive massive amounts of mail. (My box in the apartment mailroom is small.) Also, his address is shorter!  I'm thinking of drawing up a map and/or directions to the church to include with the invitations to people who have never been there. That would be his family and whatever friends we invite. My family knows the way by now, although I might end up tossing maps in all the envelopes just to be sure.  Dude! It's nearly midnight! That's it, I'm going to go to bed and forget about wedding stuff until after work tomorrow.
