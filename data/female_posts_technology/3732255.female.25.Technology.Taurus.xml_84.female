Among the 28 tracks we give ya 20 unreleased/rare songs from bands like Green Day, Lagwagon, The Lawrence Arms, Dwarves, Yellowcard, The Unseen, Foo Fighters and shitloads more. On top of all that greatness, we're also including a DVD with: videos from bands like Alkaline Trio and NOFX; Comedy pieces from Will Ferrell and others; and six informative political shorts. Bush is doomed! Seriously though, there's TONS of great stuff on this comp and it's real cheap. Six bucks from us, in fact, which brings us to the next point. We start taking mailorders for this epic comp on 8/4 and those orders will come with a free "Rock Against Bush" bumper sticker. While they last of course. And if you reside on the East Coast, the fine people working the Punk Voter booth will be selling the comps on the Warped Tour as early as August 4th. All that said, you probably wanna hear some music off this thing before you blow your entire allowance on it, and that's where this e-card comes in.
