Celebrating the occasion at Olive Garden like we do all others would have been ludicrous, so instead, I agreed to look at the condominium with my mom and G-brother and Leisure-Suit Larry (as we call the real-estate agent due to his uncanny resemblance to a character from a video game G  I played as kids).  After 30 minutes of driving, we finally got to Fern Valley something or other estates. The condo was exactly as I pictured - woodsy surroundings that could pass for college dorms, a loud freeway across the street, ugly architecture all around. I felt sick the whole time due to a lingering cold and wanted to go home, but Leisure Suit just kept going on and on about the tennis courts (don't care), swimming pool (don't care), club house (don't want to play billiards with geriatrics). We ran from building to building trying to escape the pouring rain. As I caughed and wheezed, G  I made jokes about the fact that I am frail and sickly and will most likely die soon. My mother stared at us in horror. I stuck my tongue out at her when Leisure Suit wasn't looking, signaling that I was ready to go. G kept pointing to old men with beer bellies and nudging me to meet my 'future neighbors and possible husbands'.  We ended up looking at a studio - the person selling it was still living there, although she wasn't home when we came by, and while Leisure Suit blabbered on about marble countertops and high ceilings, I checked out her shoe collection (mine is better) and at least 30 family photos. It was a drawn-out affair. We waited under the cover of the garage while Leisure Suit fetched the car and then drove us back. I never have to hear about this condo again and for that reason it was almost worth it. That and making fun of the place with G. I think I'm finally friends with my brother.
