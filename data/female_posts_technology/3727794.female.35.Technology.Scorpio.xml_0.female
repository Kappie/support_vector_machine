I guess it comes from a combination of eating KC bar-b-que and being one of the fattest cities in America and sitting on our BUTTS knitting all the time.  I got a little frightened because everywhere I look I see all these patterns for knitted bikini's.  I started thinking, just who the hell is skinny enough to wear those???   Or are these chubby women getting a little too "knitters gone wild" and wearing them out in public???  Then I realized, oh yeah, NYC is where all the trendy little knit chics are blogging from that are making these things.  I'm afraid no amount of working out and dieting/starving would enable me to wear one of those things in public, heck even in my bedroom with the door closed!  They do look amazing on the right girls, but that's an outfit that won't be on my list of things to create.
