I'm piqued by auteurism and my movie-going is dictated more by directors than by actors/stars. I like all of Jim Jarmusch's previous work like Ghost Dog, Down By Law, and Night on Earth. He's not for everyone though. Coffee and Cigarettes was shot in black  white film and at times its pace was plodding. But I like that kind of stuff. I don't care about plot or action in a movie. Like Harmony Korine once said, "Fuck plot."  Batty's Top 5 Auteurs: Woody Allen David Gordon Green Jim Jarmusch Wong Kar Wai Spike Lee
