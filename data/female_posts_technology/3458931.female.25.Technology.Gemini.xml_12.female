There is a mother of an american soldier in a large part of the film, and as a mother I found her story really hit home.   We weren't the only ones from Fredericton at the movie either, there were two (nice looking) guys sitting just ahead of myself and my friend D. They started up a conversation just before the movie started, and I was hoping we could continue it afterwards but they took off.   Well this is my last Saturday for a while with free babysitting (thanks grandma). I'm invited to a barbecue in my neighborhood, hosted by a very nice and attractive guy who just happens to be crazy about kids. Is that fate I smell? LOL, don't worry faithful readers, I am giving myself adequate rebound time before making any moves towards a new relationship.
