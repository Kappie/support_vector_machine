This whole next week is going to be one big cluster fuck.  I have to get my car worked on, work, my 2nd grade ccd class that I teach has communion practice twice this week, teach, I am moving and I have to fit in practice w/ the band.  No rest for the wicked. What little sanity I have left will be gone this time next week. Oh yeah cubs won, won, won baby! Rawk on.  Jeff Gordon took first today w/ Jr at a close second.  Kick ass. Although my guy is #38 the m's car Eliot Saddler, he took 28th.  Boo hoo. Oh well.  I needs to get some sleep.
