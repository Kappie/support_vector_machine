I may not write the best but i do the best i can.  I enjoy reading the storys' and trying to write on the subject afterwards.  It's fun to see what i come up with and i think by the end of class i will be doing a lot better.  I am having fun and i do think it also is helping improve my own self-esteem.  I feel more confident than i did in the beginning.
