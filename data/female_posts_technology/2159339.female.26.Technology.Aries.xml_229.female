This is a tiny bar filled with taxidermy. Taxidermy both fascinates me and gives me the heebie-jeebies. He bought me an Apple Martini which made me Drunk. The 2nd round I ordered a pear cider to calm down and the bartender was like, "The martini wasn't good?" and I drunkenly assured him it was breally vberry gooood and XX said, "Yup, maybe TOO good" and the bartender laughed. Then we headed to BOTH to go see a show.   urlLink Gravy Train    urlLink Ex-Girl  @ BOTH 05-28-04      Last time I saw Gravy Train, their equipment broke down and they didn't know how to fix it. There was a frustrating time lapse while they pretended to figure out their Casios. Their new member - this out-of-shape skivvies-only-clad black dude - "entertained" the crowd by inviting audience members to simulate fellatio on his crotch. It was downright dees-gusting and I left because it wasn't funny to me. It's funny when Chunx is raunchy because she's smart and tongue-in-cheek and respectful of boundaries. When this new guy does it, it's offensive because he doesn't perform with a wink and a smile--he's aggressive and bossy.  I clued XX in on Gravy Train when he was making beats on his drum machine last year, and he likes them. I figure, he should check them out because Chunx and Funx are awesome entertainers. Totally John Waters-y because, well, they're full-figured women with a knack for outrageous style and sass. We would just have to ignore the new member.   Their set was alright. Chunx and Funx are losing their baby fat and looking more like women. Their music is exactly the same -- house party music; the new guy was there -- running around grossly in his tighty-whities and baring his butt all over the place: it's the same old 'Train. They've been around a while now, but they still don't know their way around their equipment. They need to move on. Find a producer. Chunx is supremely talented and is capable of better things.   Ex-Girl are from Japan and man, I wish I wasn't crashing right when they took the stage (week-long morning shift--waking up at 4:30am). I checked out their merch before they went on and it took up an entire table and wall. There must've been over 40 items for sale ranging from polka-dotted canvas handbags and bright vinyl totes to pencil pouches. I bought a lime-green terry-cloth frog water bottle holder because it was a frickin terry-cloth frog water bottle holder! I love Japan!   They took the stage in elaborate flower costumes with gigantic iridescent petals framing their faces. They did art-y dances as flowers. They played some songs. Then they removed the petals and revealed huge puffy colorful wigs. Their music was punchy art-rock. They reminded me of Devo. XX said they were really good. And I was crashing. I'd close my eyes for a second and start dreaming while standing up. My eyes were streaming tears from the lack of sleep. Bye-bye Ex-girl. Maybe next time.
