The basement is a total right off. I mean there is still christmas stuff out in the hall waiting to go in the storage room on in the garbage. I have attempt to put all this stuff away, but when I am off for my four days I have to clean up stairs cause god forbid he could actually take a dirty dish from the living room into the kitchen or pick up a piece of paper or swipe the floor well I am working for my four days 12 hour shifts. On my four days off, I do laundry clean the living room do dishes, try and finish the kitchen that I have been trying to paint for a month now but can't get finish because the kitchen is consently a mess from him trying to cook stuff and leaving stuff all over the place. I get groceries mow the lawn clean the yard take care of the kids and the dog, oh the list goes on. Yes I do have a nap in the afternoon and some days I just get so frustrated that I don't do anything. Why can't he just do something anything. It just gets so frustrating when I take my days off and clean and clean and then go to work for four days and come home and the house is a complete mess again.   Ok I feel a little better, well not really the house still isn't cleaned. :)
