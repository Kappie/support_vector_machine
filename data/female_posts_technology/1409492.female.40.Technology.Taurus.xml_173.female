Go  urlLink here  and see what Lileks is blathering about. His blather is usually far more entertaining than mine anyway.     Are you still here? Look. Here's someplace else to visit:  urlLink simply the best  review of the original  Spider-Man .     I warned you:   10:  Wierd violin woman. "Spider-man, spider-man. Does whatever a spider can.."   9:  A free nerdboy is a happy nerdboy. "Raindrops keep fallin on my head..."   8:  Willem Dafoe and Cliff Robertson show up again. Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi show up again. Is it just me or is Bruce looking more and more like Fess Parker?   7:  Spidey taking the elevator. "It kind of rides up in the crotch a little.."   6:  J.K. Simmons still manages to steal every scene he's in.   5:  Doc Ock not wanting to die a monster. For that matter, keeping the final battle short. The subway battle was the centerpiece; no WAY were they going to try to top that.   4:  Harry finds out who Spider-Man is. Yikes! Mary Jane finds out who Spider-Man is. Whoopsie!   3:  Harry finding his dad's secret pumpkin stash, as well as an extra exo-skeleton, glider, and evil-bad guy transmogrifying liquid. Uh, oh!   2:  The hands coming offscreen to keep Spider-man from falling into the river. The people on the subway promising not to give away Peter's secret when they see his face. He finally gets to see some of the good he's managed to accomplish (never mind Aunt May's sanctimonious speeches. The looks on their faces explain far more in far less time).   1:  Peter accepting his fate but Mary Jane doesn't. Mary Jane saves Peter Parker's life. Yay! The girl got the spider! Hooray!   Okay, now that you're  thoroughly  spoiled, I just want to say how much I loved Mary Jane when she ditches what's-his-name at the altar to go after the man she loves (and who loves her). I love the fact that Mary Jane loves the whole package; both Peter and Spider-man and totally accepts who he is and what he feels compelled to do. Yes, I realize that Peter is right in not wanting to endanger anybody and yes I know something awful might (might? will!) happen to her in the 3rd movie, but face facts: Harry all ready  knows  what Mary Jane and Peter feel for each other, and Harry is going to be the principal villain in  Spider-Man III . So I wish them as much love and happiness as possible in the meantime.  I  told  you it was a chick movie!
