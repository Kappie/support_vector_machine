Tonight I'm going to celebrate life - Tonight I'm going to live it up with a bang, if only for a little while. You know I'm not as young as I used to be. I'm going to gossip fiendishly and flirt shamelessly. And somehow manage to get to bed at a respectable hour.  - haven't got any money riding on it though.
