These Journal Notes were written in my Journal last May and June in anticipation of my first mission trip outside of the United States.  I have moved them to my  urlLink Bluebonnet Missions  website in order to be able to share them more readily with others.  This is, also, just a quick glance of the excitement leading up to my Guatemala Mission Trip.  Plans are for, in the future, to add to my  urlLink Bluebonnet Missions  website other notes and information received during the trip, as well as translations of tape records that I took while there.  I understand that I may actually be able to record those sights/sounds and discussions on the website directly.  As soon as I am able to figure all that out, I will certainly keep you uptodate on that as well...  It was such a wonderful trip; it would be a shame not to share that information and knowledge with others.  Hope you will enjoy!!
