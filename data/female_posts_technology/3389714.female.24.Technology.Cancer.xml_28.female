I wanted to go c a hindi movie today.. I don’t know y I watch the bloody 3 hour epics lately.. it not like i know hindi.. it like watching pictures on the screens … I don’t know.. it’s probably me tryin to be an Indian.. mom says I’m a coconut.. brown on the outside straight up white on the inside.. I think she might be right.. I want something to talk about to my desi friends, aunts, and parents… so I watch desi movies.. don’t get an ounce of it.. but I try to read the sub titles as fast as I can.. anyways.. I seriously have issues with certain desi movies.. they really need kissing scenes .. ½ the time I think the lovers in the story are brother and sister ..dancing and singin in the rain..hell I think u can dance and sing in the rain with your brother.. I know I can.. plus my brother is 6’5 imagine the huge splashes he can create when he jumps in a puddle.. hehe.. yah but to all u directors out there please add some kissing scenes into your movies so I don't misinterpreted them … nah I’ll tell u what’s worse then the brother sister rain dance routine.. it’s what happens after.. the brother and sister hug ..and in the next scene the sister is holding a baby…and guess what.. the bloddy brother is suppose to be the god damn father… I mean hello… if they had a kissing scene right before the rain dance ..i’d know immediately that they were lovers and not bro and sis .. and then the baby wouldn’t gross me out.. yah I need to go to bollywood..and give Subhash Ghai, and company some friendly advice.. god damn.. but yah I want to c hum tum..i like that saif boy..looks like a fun filled movie..lets c if S anti is up to it..ok coffee is getting cold ..yes I know I broke my coffee rule…but u know what there’s things out there that are worse then coffee..like President Bush..so leave me alone..and if not come over and kiss my mocha colored bootie…MUHAAAA…   Something To Think About:  Wouldn’t u want to dance around in the rain with your lover..like Maduri and Salman..? I know I would …but guess what …do to my atrocious misfortune..I’m only 2/3’s of the way there.. I got the backyard..and hell I’ve defiantly got the rain…just need to find myself a god damn man..y..does it always come down to that … ahh ..life officially sucks…wonder if u could rent one for a few hours just for the dance…umm something to think about…yah..
