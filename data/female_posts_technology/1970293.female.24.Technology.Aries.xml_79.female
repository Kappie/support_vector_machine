Bardric said as he jumped off. He scurried inside.  Hewten Mountain housed the largest library in all the lands. It also housed the largest art collection featuring the best pieces from each race. The library was carved completely from stone with pillars holding up the ceiling through out the inside of the complex. It was considered the dwarves greatest masterpiece.   Bardric noticed that there weren't many wizards about but that didn't really matter. He immediately went to the book of requests and questions. It was proper protocol to sign in with name and reason for being in Hewten along with the date. He glanced through the pages after writing his information. He noticed a few wizards had looked up information on the Drakken. Three to be exact. He knew two of the wizards but the third, he never met before. The two he knew were very recent with one two days ago and the other yesterday. The third visited a month ago which would be along the same timeline as the Drakken leaving their country.
