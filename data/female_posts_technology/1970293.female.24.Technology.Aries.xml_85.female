He noticed that the Drakken carried a short sword on their person as well as keeps a long staff with a metal point at the end.   In the center of the meadow, the huge bonfire still burned hotly and the smoke billowed upward covering the sky and the coming of darkness. He tried to look closer at the fire to see what they were burning but he couldn't see anything. The dragon had said it in such disgust that his curiosity was peaked. He looked closer into the clearing and noticed a few caged wagons standing in the shadows. He saw some shields and axes lying on the ground not far from the fire. Further investigation would have to wait till later though. It was time for him to get out of here and find the dragon.  He slowly backed up away from the bushes. As he turned, he heard a twig snap behind him. He stopped and slowly looked behind him. Three Drakken stood behind him with their staffs pointed at him. Even close up he thought they were hideous. He shuddered again. He stood up and held his staff into the air. Reciting words in an unknown language, the smoke suddenly filled the clearing until all visibility disappeared.   He ran through the clearing with his robe over his mouth. It didn't matter which direction as long as he got away from the Drakken. The forest grew dark fast because of the thick foliage but he didn't need the light. He would rather have the darkness covering his path instead of full sunlight in which it would be easy to find him. He found a tree with a low branch and jumped up into the tree. He climbed steadily up until he reached the top and he could see the tops of the trees as the sun set in the west. He looked around to see if the dragon was flying nearby but he couldn't see any sign of him.   Whispering a few words and a wave of his hand at his staff, his staff became a bright beacon in the darkening sky. He caught his breath as he waited for the dragon to come only hoping he was quick about it and didn't take his time like normal. It was a pretty forest but too bad about being infected by the Drakken as he glanced across the trees that spread out all around him like a thick green carpet.   Behind him, a whoosh of air startled him from his thoughts. He turned quickly to look at the dragon hovering near him with a rope dangling from his feet.   "Well are you coming or not. I am not going to hover here all night you know. I need to get some sleep." Trellian yelled as he brought the rope closer to Bardric.  The wizard held tight to his staff as he grabbed the rope. "Glad you could make it. I was beginning to wonder if you did fall asleep."  "Hah! You wish. Hold on tight." The dragon slowly flew up and away from the forest for the nearest area he could land and still far enough away from the Drakken in case they were seen leaving the forest.
