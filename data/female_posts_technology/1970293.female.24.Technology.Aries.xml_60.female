Worried about bills, work, and many other things, sleep has been the last thing on her mind these last couple of days.  She didn't know when she would get to sleep again.    Running some water into the kettle for a quick cup of tea before she would try to lay down once more.  She doubted she would sleep tonight.  Maybe a movie or a book would do some good.    Suddenly she dropped the kettle on the floor, spilling water all over.  A loud shrill scream fell out of her mouth without her will.  She fell to her knees.  Tears came to her eyes and she cried.  She cried as if her heart was breaking into a thousand pieces.  She huddled upon the floor in a tiny ball of misery.  When would it all stop.  When would all the pain and the misery stop.
