I eventually told him that I really don't mind.  Actually, I love it but didn't want to get comfortable with the gesture because there was no "us" and it would not do to want and miss something like that.  What would it be like to finally see him again?  What would it be like for him?  Dad sent another batch of computer books.  It would probably take me forever to read all of them.  Most of the books are UNIX.  Will come up with a list of said books and probably put them up for sale either on  urlLink Bidshot  or the book sale happening on the 18th.  For more details visit  urlLink http://mparaz.com/booksale.html   We've got new VHS tapes like "The Wedding Planner", "Girl Interrrupted", "Shakespeare In Love."  We also have three DVDs that will probably be screened by someone else because we do not have a DVD player.  January 07, 2003 Tuesday.  January's birthday.   HAPPY BIRTHDAY WALENG!
