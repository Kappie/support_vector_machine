At some point of the movie, it was really fast pace, at some other points, the conversations are too draggy. If you haven't read the book, you might not beable to follow. Even if you had, you might need to refer to them again. If you are not a fan of fantasy or Harry Porter stories, you might not enjoy this movie.   I enjoyed the movie, it was fun and thrilling. However, it was more fun reading the book then watching it. Guess the script writers didn't do such a good job. In comparison, the first instalment is better. Especially the Quidditch match!   How many stars is it worth? 3/5 because I'm bias, I'm a fan of Harry Porter!!
