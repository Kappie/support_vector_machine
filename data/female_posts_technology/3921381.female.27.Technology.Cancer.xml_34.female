God, how pathetic i was.   o! i just remembered.. totally off the topic... i was smoking at work with the ladies. they laughed their asses off at how i held the cigarette. this marks my second attempt of smoking. once back in the younger gangsta days and now. believe it or not, my love is second hand smoking. and yes, i'm aware i'll die faster.. thats why i don't intentionally go out to do it. however, it must be like when ppl have a fetish of smelling stinky toes or something. LOL.... read this correctly. i'm not saying i like smelling toes. i'm saying it must be like that.
