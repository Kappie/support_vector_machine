I have been to so many concerts that I can't even name them all, but something was different about this one.  There was an energy in the air that I haven't seen.  The coolest part about it was that 80% of the show was spent performing her old hits.  I'm sorry it's over, but I'm glad I got to go.  One last parting comment before I hit the sack...  While Madonna was incredible, I have to say that she's no better than Janet Jackson (pre wardrobe malfunction, of course).  This isn't a negative comment about Madonna, but rather it's a compliment to Janet.  I didn't realize how completely different those 2 artists were until tonight, but they both put on fabulous shows in their own unique way.
