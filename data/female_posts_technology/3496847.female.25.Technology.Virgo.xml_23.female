This left me with a 20 minute walk back home, but it is beautiful out so I didn't mind.    The running went really well this week.  No sign of my shin splints, and the runs haven't been very difficult to complete.  I'm optimistic for the next week, which I will start tomorrow.  Week 2 is run 90s and walk 2mins for 20mins.
