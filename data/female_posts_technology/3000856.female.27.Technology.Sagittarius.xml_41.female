It is so last min w/ Jake filling for us, but we should have no problem pulling it off. (I hope anyway) Last night I was really getting freaked, to the point where I felt I could not even do this gosh darn forsaken show! I for some reason can not remember the lyrics to probably one of the easiest songs in the set (lyric wise)I need a security blanket, so I am going to bring up the lyrics and put them by my feet. Hopefully I won't need them, but at least they will be there if I do. Man I am getting big time jitters right now. Damn it! I have a totally booked weekend once again, but hopefully in the next 2 weeks I will get to relax.  I leave for Florida June 19 right after a show, that ought to be interesting. Ok I need to get back to work so I can get out of here on time and ready for the show. Wish me luck cause I need it. :op
