Comprised of rich  urlLink Zambelli Family  secrets yield to generations of secrets and traditions.    What I didn't see the show emphasize though (perhaps I had come in too late in the show?) was the fact that the  urlLink Zambelli Family  were not alone; there are other families -- i.e., the  urlLink duPonts at the Longwood Gardens  and others, as well as more recently developed firework companies (like the  urlLink Phantom Fireworks  and  urlLink Alonzo Fireworks .  Some fireworks have even made their mark in the  urlLink Guiness World Records !  Years ago when I lived in South Carolina, I attended a fabulous fireworks display at  urlLink Patriot's Point  in Mt.Pleasant, South Carolina.  Growing up, I remember the firework displays in  urlLink Ft. Sam Houston  in San Antonio, Texas,  urlLink July 4th Fireworks  in Annapolis, Maryland,  urlLink HEB Austin Symphonic Fireworks  in Austin, Texas, and so much more.  This year....well, this year I am finding myself having to work, although I believe that I am getting the day following off.  Unfortunately, they don't have fireworks on the 5th of July!! :(  Perhaps, I will be able to a Fireworks display soon.  I miss the grandeur of the sights and sounds that go along with it, as well as the awestrucking amazement that is beheld in each firework going off in a very systematic fashion.  To those who read this on the 4th of July 2004, may you all have a very blessed and safe 4th of July!! :)
