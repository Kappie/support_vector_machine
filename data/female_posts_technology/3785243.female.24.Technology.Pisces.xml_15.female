All you have to do is boil water, put in a #2 filter in this cone that fits on a cup, and slowly pour in the water (basically being your own coffee maker).   It's not too shabby.  I've messed with it a couple of times, and the only alteration I would make is to put in 3 tsps of coffee, instead of the 2 on the label.  It's fun for trying out different flavored coffees, that way you can make one cup without forcing the whole household to drink or having to throw a pot out.  My heart is very near and dear to tea, however.  I probably have like 15 types of tea between my house and work.  Tea is a much more gentle and subtle stimulant than coffee, and also the whole brewing thing is relaxing.  You drop in a tea bag, and the water around slowly blooms with color until it fully develops like a picture.  The different teas also have distinct layers and an intricacy to their taste you don't find in coffee.    I remember going to Whole Foods one time, and picking up some Taylor's and Harrogate's, an imported tea from the UK.  All of a sudden, I felt a tapping on my shoulder and I turned around and there was a tiny, wizened elderly couple.  With very distinct British accents and a homesick tone to their voice, they asked me if I was from the UK.  Unfortunately, I had to tell them I was from the States, but as I work for a company based in the UK, I was able to talk to them about their county, Yorkshire.  They recommended that I go to  urlLink Betty's , a traditional tea room  that hasn't changed much since the early 1900s.  Anyways, tea brought us together, and I was happy to bring back memories of their homeland.    Happy drinking,  -- Aeryth
