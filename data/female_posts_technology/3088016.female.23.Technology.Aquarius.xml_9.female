Pulp Fiction (1994)  I was not initially excited about seeing this, expecting blood and guts.  It turned out to be my favorite of the two.  There are a lot of very strange things that I didn't expect to laugh at, like when they accidentally shot the kid in the car.  My colleagues were right about it being a comedy with dramatic elements.  I realized that since I've never been shot, stabbed with a sword, overdosed on - or even taken - drugs, or been held up in a restaurant, I don't really have problems.  It wasn't incredible, but not a total waste of time either.     The Breakfast Club (1985)   I would have been entertained by this movie once upon a time, perhaps when I (like the characters) was in high school.  It's about five whiny kids who are all from different cliques but find something in common in each other all through the course of one day in detention.  The absolute worst plot twist was when all but one of them paired off in the most unlikely of couples.  An hour before, they had hated each other!  Give me a break.  I liked it better when the snobby one said that they'd never talk again after that day.  I'd like my two hours back, please.
