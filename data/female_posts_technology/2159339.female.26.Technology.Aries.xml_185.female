Specifically, he told me why he is refusing to talk to us and now I'm in tears and people are stopping by to wish me a happy birthday and I just want to hide in the filing cabinet. It's a good thing I don't wear mascara.  Basically he said that he's tired of putting everyone's wishes first when none of us are doing that for him. He said he is tired of having to ask my brother and my mom and me for simple favors over and over again when we never have to ask him for anything twice. It's true. He even phrased it this way "Abby, whenever you ask for something, it becomes my top priority, but I'm still waiting for the Rubik’s cube that I asked you to solve 3 months ago". He said he's tired of life and tired of everyone and that he's done talking for the day. And then we hung up and I have a lump in my throat and a freakin Rubik’s cube at home that I have to solve asap.   Growing up, Alex and I were thought to be so similar (both in character and looks) that my family called me by a name which roughly translates into "Alex Number Two" in yiddish. In second grade when the commie teacher made us pick a favorite parent (wtf?), I was the only one in class that picked my dad over my mom. We are both stubborn, moody, somewhat competent and rather dramatic and for these reasons we understand each other best. Or at least used to. I don't know what's going on with him now and it breaks my heart to pieces to see him like this. At the same time, he is being childish and manipulative and I want to punch him in the face.
