This at the best of times would be inconvenient but when a part of the globe at the site of quite extensive conflict does not have lines to the rest of the world, circumstance becomes particularly unsatisfactory.   There are several issues involved. First the loss of infrastructure due to recent damages, whether as a result of coalition force damage or insurgent damage is a mute point, civilian supply is lost due to the action of two warring factions. Second, the complicating factor that the previous regime used communication and other basic infrastructure in a reward/punishment manner. Among other things, areas uncooperative with the former regime had their phone lines "disconnected". The shadow of the former reward/punishment system casts itself upon current circumstance so that it becomes understandable civilians without reliable infrastructure might feel not only inconvenienced but also unconvinced, irked even, by the continuing "punishments" eerily echoing life before liberation.   Of course, there are many other services that falter and fail in times of war, but communications are significant in that;  a). Relatives and friends outside Iraq worry about the fates of relatives  and friends inside Iraq who cannot easily be contacted. b). Information from inside Iraq is controlled by slow release from sites with better infrastructure. In other words people who can phone out of Iraq have phone services that are at least partially operable, suggesting quality of life for them is a probably going to be better and outlook possibly more optimistic then people who do not have access to phones. What we cannot hear we do not know.   Information flow is restricted particularly in areas that are experiencing more extreme difficulties, for example large sections of Kufa which have been without phone service since recent fighting destroyed some facilities.   All of this is admittedly beyond obvious and if you are impatiently pounding your head against the monitor  saying "emigre, for gods sake, say something new" i apologise. Please stop pounding head now, dented cranium is unbecoming.   The long and short of it is that i have started a new link section in the sidebar for areas that i hear of without phone service. The astute among you will probably see difficulties here already relating to point b) .  If you know of any areas your input is more then welcome. If you would like to copy/paste the link/s (atm there is only one that i've heard of, Kufa) into your own blog that is also more then welcome.   This is not a finger pointing exercise, so before you email me a tirade or post thousand word accusatory essays in the comments please understand that i am doing this  in the hope that drawing attention to the situation might help speed up repairs, or at least raise awareness. (*Sigh* this weblog is hardly that influential but, dreams at least are free.)
