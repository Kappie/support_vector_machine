You approach the corner that you need to turn at.  Then you think to yourself, ok, what will this corner be like, how much slush will there be, will I slide around or will this be a clean turn.  A couple of times I thought to myself, uh oh, I hope I can stop...snow bank here I come :)  But I didn't have to resort to landing in any snow banks, which was good.  I don't need that kind of excitment.  The only downside of winter driving is having to watch out for other drivers, aside from them, driving in the snow and slush is actually pretty fun.
