And by that I mean I am circumventing normal company procedures and talking to the director into whose group I want to transfer to (HR is seriously lagging, it's been two weeks). I will look at him with a serious look on my face and say "Marvin, may I close the door? This is confidential." Then I will tell him about how awesome I am and why he should hire meinstead of the 'mousy girl' he has been interviewing for the past two weeks. I will say 'You want this!' and I will point to myself. Iwent over all sorts of scenarioson the bus and most of them conclude with him saying "Thanks Abby, but no thanks. Wealready promised the 'rat-like girl'thejob and you know how that is." And then, discouraged yet ever so determined, I will walk back to my desk and download and sendporn photosto '#everyone'. This will likelylead to me getting fired, which will lead to limitless days of sleeping in and sewing and rock climbing and Dr. Phil and going camping while receiving unemployment checks. See? Either way I win!! Fuck, I'm alittle nervous. Kelly has been coaching me on the 'urban planning' process so that the ass I make of myself will not be as enormous. And I'm listening to Franz Ferdinand to get pumped up. Wish me luck, gentle readers.    Also - Tonight Battz  I are seeing my number one favorite   Magnetic Fields   ..I'm wearing a shirt with absorbent cotton sleeves into which I will cry like a baby. A baby in love with Stephin Merritt.
