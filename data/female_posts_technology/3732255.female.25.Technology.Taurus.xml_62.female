Well I'm glad that I have some good shit coming up soon cuz I am going completely crazy with my life right now...I hate the city that I live in and everything around me seems to be failing BUT I hopefully have Boston to look forward to and Warped Tour and WWE Raw all in the same week.  So yeah I have one more week to wait before the week from hell but the best week of the year.   So it is 2:03am and I have had the worst week of sleep so if this makes no sense that is why but hopefully that is just stress of the Hell/best week.  Cheers all!
