The article, in  urlLink Real Simple  magazine, told the story of a woman who was always giving, in the hopes that people would like her in return.  I noticed some strong similarities between this woman and myself. I realize that in the past, I've gone out of my way to be nice to people and/or do things for them in the hopes that they would like me or "include" me in their lives. AND... this isn't the first I've noticed this trait in myself, as is evidenced by my mid-years resolutions.  I'm tired of trying to get people to like me! If you like me, GREAT... You'll see that I'm a wonderful person. If you don't like me..... well, it's your loss!   :-)
