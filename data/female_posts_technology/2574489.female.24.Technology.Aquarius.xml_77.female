I know what a hub and bridge does in theory, so why couldn't I have figured it out myself?  I don't know.  Wasn't confident enough probably because when my mentor showed my the answer, it was sooooooo easy.  He gave me the answer key to all the labs. Hehe...My mentor is awesome.  Very knowledgeable, approachable, taught me a lot of tricks on how to retain what I'm studying.  He loves questions.  Oh, and what message did I see on the sign-in screen when I got to school but:  "congratulations on your wedding.  please pick up your gift in bob's office.  it's in a yellow bag"  The bag was lovely, but the thought was even lovelier.  Bob is the guy who signed up husband and me for our classes.  He wasn't there for me to thank him.  I need to drop off a thank you note.  Truth be told I am way behind on my labs.  I'm supposed to have finished all of them in one week. But its self-paced so I'm not sweating it.  Although my hubby is ahead of me so maybe I should step up my efforts. Competitive much?  Aside from that I am still smoothing our finances.  Calculating, making everything balance.  I don't enjoy math but I do enjoy accounting--just not in a classroom setting, thank you very much.  ***  I got a cheesy-looking certificate for getting perfect attendance for last month.  Being rewarded with an extra 1/2 day off.  People are giving me and the other two people that got the certificate a mixture of amusing smiles and dirty looks.  Mostly making fun of the cheesy certificates.  I think its cool. Extra 1/2 day off, yay!
