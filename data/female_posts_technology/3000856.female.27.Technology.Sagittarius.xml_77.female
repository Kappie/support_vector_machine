We are going to see Harry Potter at the but crack of dawn pretty much. 9:30 am which means we will have to leave by 8:30 cause we are going to the Imax at Navy Pier.  He will like that. There is an issue I am gonna have to address soon and I really don't know how to do it.  I am really taking a look at my life, priorities and the things that highly upset me.  I am doing some serious soul searching these days and am working on myself for once w/ out worrying about everyone else. That has always been one of my main problems.  I have a busy schedule tomorrow and again Sun.  I have looked over my planner and I am seriously booked every day in the month of June and already many days in July.  How in the hell does that happen to me? I miss jammin w/ the band.  We took last week off.  I really need to know if we are going to be booking shows and working on getting a drummer or if this is all gonna just fade.  It seems like we are kind of slacking and I don't like the feeling.  This band has potential once we have everything set w/ a drummer and what not. Anyway off to bed.
