I'm trying to get back in touch with that artisty side of me that somehow got lost in the race for money, for a better business card, for respect.   I used to write, I used to dance, I used to play the piano and the harmonica, I used to read (a lot). I used to have depth...   It seems like the more money is poured into my bank account, the more meaning is drained from my soul.
