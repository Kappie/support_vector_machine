I took the next 3 days off from my day job to spend with my daughter  get new school clothes and spend time with her while she has no day care this week. Next week , her school starts again! Just surfing the internet tonight and checking all my web-based email accounts. What makes all these spam emailers think I want to buy Viagra from them!
