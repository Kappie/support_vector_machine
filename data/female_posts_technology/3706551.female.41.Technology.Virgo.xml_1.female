If you want to see what a really smart guy he is, take a look at  urlLink this . Or why not grab a Starbucks and tuck into  urlLink his dissertation  (only 156 pages!!!).  Needless to say, he is the genius of the family and, comparitively speaking, I have the IQ of a geranium :) Back to my Spongebob cartoon ....
