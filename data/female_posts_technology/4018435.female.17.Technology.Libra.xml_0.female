My manager and the current key holder approached me about the position and I was undsure of it at first...but y'know? More money and showing that I'm sumwaht responsible would be great! Finally, I can tell people I've earned something on my own!   Talked to my cousin today and well...these travel plans are really screwy! Now I mite go to Florida with my older cousin for a week. Sounds good to me. As long as I get into a different atmosphere for a while, then sure! I'll just go so I can sit in the sun and draw, write and dream.    Thanx to everyone who's been supporting me through this hard time. I know how the family wants me to go travel with them or elsewhere so I can have some fun and get things off my mind, but to be honest, I jsut want to stay home and fix my room...I mean REALLY fix it. Work towards buying new furniture and painting the walls so I can have my dream room. That may take a while...I still have to save money for the Corrs concert at the end of the month which my brother promised to take me to. Then I owe money to my brother still and then I owe mom money cuz we all pitched in for dads b'day present. Ugh, I still have lotsa stuff on hold at work...I gotta stop spending money. Shit, I need to get to university so that I can stop spending money on things that aren't necessary. I know I'll be great on my own :)    I was hanging out with Kevin earlier. The guy's a lil down. Cheer up! I know how hard it is u guys! Amanda! Live it up! j/k. I know guys...life's a bitch. But at least we know we can survive on our own right? No need for money with us three! and yep, taking in life's beauty is the best thing, i tell ya!    Yep! Got my web site in the making again! Can't WAIT for this one to get goin'. It looks amazing so far and I finally came up with a name for my future animation/filming company. Yeah...it's obvious aint it? but hey, gotta love it!    So tomorrow, mom and dad are taking me and my bro out for lunch and then we're heading to Quebec for a few days...The on sunday? ELEMENTS! -Headsprung!- HAHA!    -staying strong- but for how long?...   The Lonewolf
