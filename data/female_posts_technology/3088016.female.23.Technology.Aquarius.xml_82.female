A church in Pennsylvania celebrated Easter by conducting a service (with kids present) where the Easter Bunny was beaten and had eggs thrown at him in an illustration of what Jesus Christ went through.  What were they thinking?  If the liberals get a hold of this, someone will have to get fired.  To be fair, I found/stole this story from another blogger, and I'll refer you to  urlLink his site  for the full details and link.  Don't adjust your monitor - we're using the same Blogger skin.
