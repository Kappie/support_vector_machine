WHY? i dunno if i’m just being paranoid but right now, my stomach’s churning and i can feel the insecurities coming back.. know why? coz he was supposed to go here at my place to teach me programming in visual foxpro (coz we have the payroll project to be released on September and we barely even started on it) but his friends asked him to watch a movie and yeah, there he is right now, watching Aliens vs Predator. this bothered me a lot coz just a few days ago, we discussed that it was not a movie to watch and we would just waste our money on that. another thing is he was so exhausted and sleepy during our meeting at DSP coz he was not able to get enough sleep last night due to the revisions of our HR project. get the picture? i feel that he was becoming bored with me and he’s not happy with my company anymore..oh dear..=(  and sadly, i have to admit that the mean me is trying to take over the charming (hehe) me..i became irritable at the slightest disappointment, i’m becoming ill-tempered and i would say nasty things without really meaning it…  it’s quite ironic, right? yesterday i was so happy that everything’s just the way they are after our fight..but here i am all confused and worried. gosh, i feel………aaaargh..i dunno! i’m pushing my mind to think of happy thoughts but it can’t..i feel sick..my whole body’s numb..tears are pouring down...i dunno what to think anymore..helllpp!!!!  to me, what we have is perfect, we are so in love with each other and that’s it, that’s what made this perfect…and i really hope that it will continue to be so…  btw, i've had one happy thought just as i was about to end this...he gave me flowers this morning and it was really sweet of him..i miss him..hope he'll be home soon..
