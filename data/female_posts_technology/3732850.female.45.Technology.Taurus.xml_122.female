They felt if they weren’t able to take care of themselves they why take you the space. They didn’t want their lives prolonged. It was their rights if they wanted to live. In the essay the man said, “We are not afraid to die….” This was their right to live.   The essay was a narrative essay because someone else is telling the store of Van Dusen. It used repetition to reinforce the point of the essay. They didn’t like the fact of taking up space when other people need help. In religion, the human mind finds a larger dimension and is relieved of the ordeal of a confrontation with non-existence. Death is not the greatest loss in life. These are some of the examples from the essay. The tone of the essay was sad.   I like the essay because it is true. People should have the right to choose if they want to live or not. The last paragraph in the essay; death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live. The unbearable tragedy is to live without dignity or sensitivity. It makes a good point that people who go into nursing homes loss their dignity. That is why they give up and the greatest loss dies inside them. This essay made me think a lot of what the elderly think. It also gave me ideas of how to write more essays.
