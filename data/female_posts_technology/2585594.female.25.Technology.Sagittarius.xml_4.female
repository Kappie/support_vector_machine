On January 2, I got myself a popup saying I won accomodations/tickets to 5 destinations in the US. I called them and confirmed. I now have my confirmation number. I just have to call them and reserve 3 months in advance. Me and some officemates are planning to go one weekend in April.   WIll let you know if it's bogus or not. If it turns out to be for real, then woe to those who thought it was just another internet scam to get ads into our line of vision. If not, then woe is me.   I'm getting coffee.
