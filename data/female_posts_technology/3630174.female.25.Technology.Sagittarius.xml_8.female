I suppose call center agents really have to stick by each other, or else things can be a real drag at work.  enough bout work.. today i'm juz chilling at home..surfing the internet.. especially for mobile phone reviews.. yep, i'm looking for a new handphone to replace my 3310. Reason being my 3310 has gone a bit bonkers.. talk to someone for juz a few minutes and the thing goes dead. I've juz changed the battery and same thing happens again. *sigh* problem is, i don't know what phone to buy. Heck, I haven't even decided on my budget yet. On the one hand, I feel like giving myself a well deserved treat and buy something really feature packed..but on the other hand, i'm thinking, should i waste so much money on a handphone?? *sigh* don't know bout that.  Hmmmpphh...have to clean the house afterwards. starting to become a pig pen. till later!
