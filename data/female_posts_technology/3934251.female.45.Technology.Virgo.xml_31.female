I tried my best to only do what I wanted to do (apart from doing laundry, I can't avoid laundry for 2 days or it takes me weeks to catch up).  We had lots of people to stay on Saturday night, we had lots of wine and lots of laughs. Everyone was in a lovely summery mood and I was as happy as a happy thing.  And then my mum and dad called round (not actually to see me, but to see my sister). My sister and friend were still there and we were sat in the garden trying to recover with coffee and ciggies and water and my mum went off on one. She told me off about the state of my house, the behaviour of my children and my outfit (vest top and denim skirt to sit in the garden??) amongst other things. And what on earth was I thinking about getting drunk at my age, I'm such a disgrace.  What gets me is, why does she always manage to upset me? I'm 39 (plus vat) for chrissake. I AM old enough to decide how I want to live, surely. Why can't I stand up to her firmly, but politely, and point this out to her? Because if I do, she bursts into tears and accuses everyone of picking on her.  She eventually buggered off, and to spite her (and frighten the neighbours) I sunbathed topless and then went to the pub. That'll teach her.
