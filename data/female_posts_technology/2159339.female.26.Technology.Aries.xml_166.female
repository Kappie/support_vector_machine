Not many people have left my company since I've started, but within the past week, I've learned that three people are leaving. I'm jealous!  I wish I could ride out with them. I can't catch a wave or be my own wave because I've been supremely apathetic in the job hunt. XX is here and though I complain about his motives, I really like getting a ride to work and having someone to go home with afterwards -- it bookends boring sterile robo-work with warmth and tenderness. Actually, that's all I want from a de facto boyfriend: someone who picks me up in the morning and gives me a ride in the evening... Wink, wink! Yee-haw! AWOOOOOOGA!
