Problems:  Although I have had one or two interesting experiences lately, I'm not willing to share them --  you really don't think I'm going to reveal any deep secrets here, do you?  ;)  There are always current events/items of interest in the real world, but I don't have time to comment right now.  I'm stuck in IA hell for a while.  Hopefully not much longer.  If I HAD the time to comment on experiences, events or thoughts, it would by no means be coherent.    My brain is mush.  Mush is the value of metadata property state of said content object brain.  Context for that includes (but is not limited to) work, personal life, and family life (although I'm not sure what other types of "life" I have).
