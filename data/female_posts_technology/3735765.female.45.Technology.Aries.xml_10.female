I will be sharing these posts with you on the upcoming posts.  I hope that you will enjoy and share the excitement that I felt as I embarked upon this new journey! :))    Today was eventful as I set up a separate account for my sideline income.  I travelled to Brenham, Conroe, The Woodlands, and North Houston seeing to some business evaluations.   I stopped at a place to check on a car that they had on their lot.  They wanted way too much for it.  I think it is because of the poor economy that they have gotten so insane with making money for themselves.  I am desperate for a newer car, but not that desperate.
