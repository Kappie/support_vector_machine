In order to write an accurate account I found myself reliving certain moments that I had previously tried very hard to forget.  My emotions were tremendously raw at times and in the end writing objectively was easier said than done. I wrote the most difficult pieces of this story while my family was either away or late at night while they were sleeping so I wouldn’t cry in front of them.    Though I partially took on this project for cathartic reasons I didn’t want it to be an outlet for revenge. In an attempt to keep this promise I chose not to use the names of those who have hurt me. I also tried my best to avoid causing hurt or embarrassment towards my family.  This book is a virtual cornucopia of issues not limited to child abuse. Besides from the emotional and physical abuse I suffered as a child I have also dealt with sexual abuse, substance abuse, anorexia and more recently severe anxiety, depression and anger management problems; all of which I will touch on.  The physical abuse I suffered at the hands of my mom was rather moderate in comparison to other cases of abuse that has been brought to light. I was never locked in a room or denied food. Sometimes the beatings were severe but they could have been much worse. One of the reasons I wanted to write this book was to let the world know that a lesser degree of child abuse is out there and cannot be ignored. Regardless of how restrained parents think they are when it comes to physical and emotional abuse, they are ultimately denying their children a sense of love, self-worth and the general sense of well being necessary for them to grow up and become fully functional and emotionally stable adults.  I am not claiming to be a mental health expert in any way, shape or form. I am only an expert of my own past experiences and am proud of the fact that I was able to turn my life around. Even though I’ve made some mistakes I’ve won a major battle in not letting the past repeat itself for the sake of my two beautiful little girls. This in itself is more progress than I could have ever hoped for, and if nothing else, I hope my story encourages other women to take the steps needed to improve their outlook on life.
