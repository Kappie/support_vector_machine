Unfortunately, I'm nut a BloggerPlus user, so no free additives in my site for me, except for capability for comments from people...(someone please try it out...should be flattering to get at least one comment, so I feel like someone's actually reading my blog hahaha).  Eh, who cares, anyway. Only a handful of my friends read this anyway. it's more for my sake than for anyone else's. Hahaha.  Sidebar: I've been surfing, and some people do take blogging to a whole new level (so much so that I am a little embarassed to publish any more of my very mundane thoughts). Very deep, serious stuff.   Interesting.
