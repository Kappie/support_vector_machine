I prefer to stay up at night when I can have all the peace and quiet I need (to do work, watch DVDs, workout). So I've been sleeping at about 4 - 6 am and waking up at about 12 - 2 pm for the past two or three days.   My diet has been horrible. I still eat a little chocolate or cookies or chips or ice-cream each day. It's not only just one each day .. it's like a few of them at once! I mean I should  be cutting each and every single one of them out of my diet .. but no, I'm still at it. I feel so bad about that. A new day tomorrow and we'll see. I think I should just cut it all off .. completely, so I won't be tempted. When you reach for one .. you just have to go for another  another  another. Argh!   Today I did an amazing workout. I did 60 minutes on the treadmill (5 min warmup, 5 min cooldown). Then later did about 15 minutes on the bike, very high rpms .. so burned about 150 cals. I don't know why but the bike makes me feel like I work harder .. I'm hitting my THR totally. While on the treadmill, that 60 minutes I only burned 200 calories!!! The bike was like quarter that and almost the same cals. Maybe it's not accurate? Although not sure which one. I use the treadmill on an incline and I can feel myself working it .. but it's so discouraging to look at the cals and just see 200 in one whole hour! Tomorrow I hope to continue with the cardio like today and do some toning with the tapes/VCDs I have.   I'm STILL 170lbs. Stuck at it for the moment, which is really really horrible. I mean about a week ago I was 165 and moaning about it and now I'm 170 (and above) and ... it's so depressive to think about. I'm back to this point where I said I would never be again (because of ANY man) and sure enough ... it happened yet again, for basically the same reason!   I'm so tempted to start hitting the laxatives (Epsom Salts) again. I used to do that A LOT because I really thought it made me lose weight ... and it did work. I got down to about 155 the past year.
