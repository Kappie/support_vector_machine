And i'm grabbing my piece of the pie while its hot! We have a new U.C. coming in 2005, houses are appearing out of nowhere, the city is expanding in all directions. Supply and demand is screaming at each other. ppl from the Bay are buying homes here. Besides, i plan on selling my own home when my 2 year mark comes up and that's next year Christmas 2005.  I won't quit my current job though. i plan on starting real estate part time, then depending on how it goes, i'll contract for my services at my current job. i know they'll do contracted services because i have my competitive edge and they need that.  I am successful in most things that i do, so i have a clear picture of what i will get out of this career. I only plan on doing this for about 2 years.   my motivation is my drawing plans of a nice home on acres, landscaped with japanese garden and a fish pond, a nice huge library and a indoor rock climbing area in the house. It's going to be awesome.   i'm so damn materialistic. next week, i'm prepping for the test. ambition is such a wonderful thing! Its what drives me to the next level.  wish me success!
