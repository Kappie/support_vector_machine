And your humor be applyin' to all interns everywhere. Avast.   Ode to Interns  Oh, interns, how I hate ye  You are so very stupid   At my job, you sit near me  You get yelled at  For being stupid  But today you have brought  Your dad  To work  You are introducing him  Like a total douchebag   You are the worst things  to happen to Washinton  Since Panda-mania  (you are even more useless)   You roam the streets of Georgetown  Like a horde of wild animals  Last night at a stop sign  I had to wait 10 minutes  For 100 of you to cross  With your stupid Lush bags  You might also shop at  Commander Salamander  What are you,  In high school?   The fourth of July  Will be the worst intern day  In the history of stupid interns  They will take the metro  To the mall, which will be near  Their stupid Hill office buildings   Oh interns, you are so stupid  I bet you have never even  Heard of Wonkette   I have three words for you   Go fuck yourselves     I be returnin' shortly with another sabre rattlin' rant about...somethin' else pirates hate. Yo ho.
