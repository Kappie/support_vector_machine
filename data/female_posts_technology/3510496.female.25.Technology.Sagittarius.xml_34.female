Thank you to the anonymous Ah Pek, who regularly durian-hunts, in the wild along the expressway near our place.  - Anonymous Ah Pek also shared knowledge with us, don't immediately eat durians that just fallen off. Such durians have super-strong 'gas' that will make its consumer easily goes queasy.  - Still on durians again, lil' brother says Pulau Tekong bears good wild durians too. So note to current/future NSmen, try to 'nice-nice' your 'Encik' during those night-marches there.  urlLink     - I attempted the promised Swedish meatballs. Hubby gorged down most of the balls even before I managed to prepare the sauce. So what are Swedish meatballs without its sauce?  - The calamari @ Mas-Ayu (Siglap) quite commendable. We saw lots of people ordering its fried chicken. Next time must try-try.  - I am so glad to be able to get a jumbo-sized glass of fresh sugarcane juice for a dollar only @ Beach Road hawker centre.  - I believe Beach Road h.c. also is one of the few places that offers generous fillings for its Pita Kebab (other place like Simpang Bedok). And its menu comes with fanciful names too like J-Lo, Macarena.  *Sigh* so much for the McFasting   Bit   - Hubby *finally* agrees to do Bungee Jump Singapore Style (reads: reverse) this coming weekend. (so come down to Clarke Quay to la-lah-tuay us ok)  - Beside Mas-Ayu, is a teakwood furniture shop. I saw my dream daybed (read: Not to sleep on, but to sit on. To fill up the empty space of my living room). But its price tag dampens our desire to get it.  urlLink     - On a happier note, we managed to get my dream daybed at more than half the price  urlLink    in the middle of Woodlands industrial area. And we chipped in a lil' bit more for the 3-inch cushion seat and dream coffee table. And yes, its walnut-finishing (the closest to  urlLink   -like) matching-matching with our TV console. Thanks MIL for the tip-off. So much for the excitement, the new-addition will only come down to occupy in 2 months time.  *Phew* Next, hunt for that side-seater, phone-table and wardrobe.
