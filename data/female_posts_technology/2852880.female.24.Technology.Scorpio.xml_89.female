Fun stuff. He was working with my group for a little bit, so we took him out for a little goodbye evening when he had to go back to Brooklyn.  The first big thing Ze ever said to me was "You don't move your arms when you walk." So we already started off on the wrong foot. It's not true actually. I do usually move my arms, but at the time I was playing with the cuffs of my shirt and in order to reach them I had to straighten my arms. Whatever. I'm not defensive about it. Then he made fun of something I said in a meeting at work in front of a bunch of other people, and I was like geez, is this guy  ever  nice to people? Such a smartass! It happened one more time, then eventually, after like 6 weeks I tried talking to him again and it turns out he's a pretty nice guy. He's just kind of intense and likes to pick on people for the sake of humor. I'm usually ok with people making fun of me in a friend situation, but maybe because I was seriously trying to learn from him and have real discussions, so I just wanted to be taken seriously. In the end I did end up learning a whole bunch. I feel like after the past 3 years I know so so so much about social computing. It's a fascinating field. I hope I can do more with it even though I'm leaving work.  Here's Ze.  He's my buddy now:  urlLink     urlLink More Pics from Ze's last night.
