I didn't have actual tears on my pillow, but it was still disturbing. In my dream, which I actually remember, my parents couldn't understand me and I kept trying to talk to them in every language I knew and they still didn't register a goddamn word. Hmm. It's not that far off from real life now that I think about it, but it was much worse in my brain, trust me. I think my nightmare was due to the fact that I'm hanging out with them this weekend. We're going to the cemetary on Sunday and I'm sure it'll be a hoot. At least G is forced to come too.   In other news, I still hate my job. I started this campaign in my head last week to change my attitude. I decided that I would dress in a more proper attire (and wear bras!), speak in more proper business terms, be more pro-active (I HATE that word) in going after the projects that I'm interested in and communicate better with other drones, I mean co-workers. And every morning, as I come in and sit down and get really excited about my new positive attitude, I realize that I simply don't give a rat's ass about this job and I can't force myself to. This means that my campaign will surely fail. This also means that either a) I take this job for granted and don't I know that enjoying work and doing it well are in fact mutually exclusive or b) I should be working at a job that is more challenging and interesting. Maybe both. My boss emailed me (from her vacation in Europe no less)  that she wants to have a 'talk' on Monday. Maybe she has finally realized that I haven't done anything in the past year since it's so goddamned BORING here and will fire me.  Then I will receive unemployment while I search for something better. That or she will give me more boring projects to not do.
