Crazy!  Been going to lots of parties and stuff with b.  Even went to karaoke but I didn't sing.  B did a fun rendition of Glory Days.  It was surprisingly good. :)  Maybe next time I'll do a song, but the idea of it pretty much makes me want to hide in the corner of a dark closet.  Going to see Against the Ropes today.  I LOVE Meg Ryan.  She's awesome.  Gotta go eat a wrap for lunch now.  Such a strange concept, the wrap.
