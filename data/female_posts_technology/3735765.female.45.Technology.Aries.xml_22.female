Defensive driving classes (during the last time I took them) were taught primarily through community education programs and driving instruction schools.  Throughout the years, the list has been expanding to reach out to the community through offering them in comedy workshops, restaurants, online, and - the one I chose to do - through video rentals.     urlLink Take Home Traffic School  is available from  urlLink your local Blockbuster video store . (Note:  not all the Blockbuster stores offer this; you will have to call your local Blockbuster store to be sure!)  Other sites to refer to for additional informaiton, see:   urlLink Comedy Defensive Driving School   urlLink DMV - Defensive Driving   urlLink American Defensive Driving School   urlLink Driver Campus  urlLink Online Traffic Schools  urlLink Traffic School  urlLink I Drive Safely  urlLink Web Traffic School    There are many other avenues -- no excuses now for a person to save off of their insurance or get a ticket dismissed through a Defensive Driving program.  These options will fit even the person who has the strangest working schedule on Earth!! :)    Hope everyone will be driving safer on the road!!
