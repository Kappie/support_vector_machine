I am tired of other people dictating what will and will not happen in my life.  I worked way too hard on this site to keep it and maintain only to let some asshole run me off from it. If they want to be neurotic about it, so be it.  That's on them. I have a life and if the only thing they can get out of their is to peer into mine well, they are someone to be pitied.  That being said....  This journal is back.    So here's the update:  I got the job at Intel.  I start in a week or so.  I had given the current employer the standard 2 weeks and last night I got a call saying they were ending my contract early.  My boss never said a word when I left yesterday.  Needless to say, my feelings are hurt, I am disappointed in him and I am confused.  I have been told it was a financial decision and I did nothing wrong but then my question becomes, what was the harm in letting me finish out that one week.  Let me retain my dignity and take my things home and say good-bye to the people I worked with. It makes no sense but the notion of going to work for a real company again is ten times more appealing than it was yesterday morning.   I am excited about the opportunity and scared about the financial loss for this coming week.    I'm moving again because nothing with the landlord has been easy.  In the 7 weeks I have been here, nothing has been repaired yet.  I still can't even open the windows here.  I found a place that is a little cheaper every month, a little smaller but right down the block and the 2nd floor renters here are moving to the same place.  They rented the 2nd floor there, I rented the 1st floor.  We do well as neighbors together and I think a friendship is starting up there.  I just wish there was a magic spell I could cast to move all the stuff here to the new place.  *sigh*  How I hate moving.  So that's the latest.  For the most part things are well, the job thing though sure has thrown me for a loop.
