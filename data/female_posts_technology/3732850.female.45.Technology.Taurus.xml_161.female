And why was he carrying a bottle of urine? He never did explain that. Or maybe I’m just missing it. ?? 	I did feel sympathetic towards him when he mentioned the ill treatment that he received just because of his disability. I wanted to smack the house manager that kicked him out so rudely.  	But all in all I wasn’t that thrilled with this story. Aside from feeling a little indignant with the author, I wasn’t left with much of an impression with this essay.
