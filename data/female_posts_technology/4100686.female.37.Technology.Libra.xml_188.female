Nominations for the council are as follows, you will have to excuse me on this, there were only a handful of nominations to work with and there are a number of portfolios to be appointed. Yeah, i know, it's heavily biased by the number of emigre nominations, other suggestions welcome.  ~ President;  urlLink Zeyad  nominated by  urlLink The Commissar   ~ Minister of Planning, Finance and Optimism;  urlLink Firas  nominated by  urlLink Fayrouz   ~ Minister of Culture;  urlLink Salam  nominated by emigre.  ~ Minister of Irrigation, Water and Power Infrastructure;  urlLink Faiza  nominated by emigre.  ~ Minister of Public Broadcasting;  urlLink Riverbend  nominated by emigre.  ~ Ministry of Youth Affairs. There are three ministerial positions in this office; - MYA Entertainment  Spirituality;  urlLink Khalid  - MYA Foreign Exchange;  urlLink Omar  - MYA Youth News;  urlLink Majid  (all nominated by emigre).  ~ Minister of Sport;  urlLink Nabil  nominated by emigre.  ~ Minister of Education;   urlLink Abbas  nominated by emigre.  urlLink Ihath  nominated by ihath, seconded by emigre.  ~ Minister of Web Affairs;  urlLink Raed  nominated by emigre.   Ambassadorial nominations;   Ambassador Canada;  urlLink Ihath  nominated by emigre   declined in preference of, ah, other restructural activities.  Ambassador Dallas;  urlLink Fayrouz  nominated by emigre. Ambassador Sweden  urlLink The Torso Blogger  nominated by emigre. Ambassador Kurdisphere;  urlLink Kurdo  nominated by emigre.  Well, thats enough for now, might have some  urlLink poll monkey  fun with it later.   Update ; to Ministry of Edu nominees  embassy in Canada (re comments).
