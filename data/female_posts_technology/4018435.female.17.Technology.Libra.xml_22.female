I ended up falling asleep on the basement couch and waking up to a sore throat and a terrible head ache. Fun fun...  Last night was great. The three of us were depressed as hell so Kevin bought us a shit load of junk food. Cake, cookies, smarties, chips, pop, salsa...oh man...i was pretty sick in the morning. we caught it on video too! We called it our fun and depressed junk food night. Yeah...I had to throw my comforter in the wash today cuz we spilt salsa, crums and cake on it. Ooo messy! So when we were asking each other on teh video camera the cause of our troubles...it was obvious what mine was, melanie's was C and Kevin's was A. Love sucks... it really does...it causes so much fucking pain and we knew it!  Today I went to Ikea with Mom and Kevin. Mom was amused as hell cuz kevin kept making us laugh. I haven't seen one of my friends make mom laugh that way in a long time.  Looks like I'm not going anywhere other than places in Canada this summer. Yep. The deal is, if I stay home, my parents are remodelling my room. FINALLY! My dream room! I'm getting a new Double sized bed and a bunch of ikea shelves :) I can't wait! We're painting my room white (the way I've missed my old room)!!! I picked out new sheets and I needa new comforter. I'm emptying my room out now so we can start painting it by probably the end of the week. LALALA I'm soooo excited!  So tomorrow we're all going to Elements. Fun fun fun! Can't wait for that either! Gonna be spending some time with some great people! Of course I hope that I can get rid of this headache by then. I wanted to go drinking with Candice last night, but I was out shopping with my mom for too long so it was too late by the time i called candice *cries* I want my vodka! lol!
