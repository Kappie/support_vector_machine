She hoped he got out okay.  She headed for the next cafe for coffee and a computer. She would have to contact him in some manner and find out where he was going to go. Possibly they could hook up and help each other out. She definitely didn't have a clue about hiding in reality. She could hide all day in VR as long as she could eat in between but reality. Scary.  She sat down with a nice hot cup of coffee in front of a not-so-old terminal. The place looked like it was from the early twenty-first century but as long as they didn't ask for ID she was happy. She quickly checked through different forums for any kind of news but she didn't see anything new. Now time to e-mail him a quick note from an anonymous mailbox using a complex code of some sort to let him know that it was her. She hoped he would check his mail. Maybe she should check hers. After she wrote him so that way they couldn't find her right away.  She wrote "Brett, I am ready for that wild weekend you promised me. Write me back soonest and let me know where to meet you." There that should work, she hoped.  She quickly scrambled to her mailbox but didn't see anything from Brett. Nothing important except one from corporate. She clicked it and read it quickly. Pretty much it said that she needed to come into the office immediately to discuss security. Like that really convinced her of their intentions.  Quickly she logged off and left the dingy cafe carrying her bag. It was time to leave this city. She would go to the next town down the road to the next cafe and check the e-mail.  She quickly scooted to the monorail station and bought a ticket to the next town. She never heard of it but it should work for her needs.
