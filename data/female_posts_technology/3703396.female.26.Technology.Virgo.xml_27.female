A little humor is needed today after the past few days of oncall work.  Not only am I suffering through two different oncall rotations, but I'm also on Change duty, which is the hardest and most time-consuming duty in my position.  The first two nights I was up at 3am and 4am and did not get to go back to sleep.  Last night was better though, without any pages at all.  It didn't stop me from waking up occassionally, thinking I had been paged!  Another HOA board meeting was held last night.  Talk about boring!  At least I had some neighbors to help pass the time with passing notes, funny faces, and making fun of people.  It's a good thing we were in a high school classroom, because I certainly felt like I was in 9th grade History class.  We've been finding tons of bugs inside the house lately.  During the summer in Arizona they take refuge inside the houses from the heat.  I've seen earwigs, crickets, spiders and knats.  It's horrible and disgusting!  I hope the exterminator gets rid of most of them this time.  I've found some praying mantis on my roses lately which is nice because the leaf-cutter bees ruin them every chance they get.  The Mantis eat the bees.  Well I suppose I should get back to work.  I have a lot to do before lunchtime.  Will try to write again soon!
