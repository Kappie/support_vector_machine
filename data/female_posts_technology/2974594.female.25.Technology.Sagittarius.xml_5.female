Because it involved a "soulmate".  And yes, anything to do with soulmate, I am THE person to talk to about. And so after catching up with our working life and achievements... We went straight to his problem. His soulmate problem wasn't as bad as I thought.. Just needed someone to tell him to not be a bad person by being selfish, but to look at the other person's perspective and think about her feelings as well.  A lot of men tend to forget and be very selfish... It's all about what he wants, what he feels and what he expects out of a gurl. Apparently too, there are some goody-two-shoes men out there that have this burning desire to be a devil for a day or a night and go for a kinky one-night stand to let of his steam. If this person wasn't my friend, I'd straight tell to his face "Go jerk off somewhere u fucked up bastard" But since he was a dear friend and looked like he needed help... I gave him a point to ponder and think for himself.  By the time we all reach a mature age, say 25 plus (this does unfortunately vary depending on a person's intellectual level), we should be able to differentiate things in our life, the rights and the wrongs, the good and the bad...We made a good point last night that we are  UNIQUE  people, due to our balanced values and mixed upbringing (me being 1/4 Pakistani, not any typical Malay family, and him not from any typical Chinese family).  But somehow, with that perception, I just CANT quite comprehend why he wanted to be that devil. It's only fair to let out your "steam" to someone who deserves it and not just find a nice innocent gurl (or a friend for that matter!) to let it off .. just because you are having the burning desire or urge to do so.    Come on, how selfish is that??  Logically, why would you want to have sex with someone you dont love? Too much PORN maybe? I dont understand... dont think ill EVER understand!  What if someone does the same to someone very dear to you... Your partner? Or your sister? Unfair isn't it? Seriously, I don't know why people have less compassion for others like I do. I guess I learn that from RT.  He used to tell me this and I treasure it for life:  "If some one truly loves you, he wouldn't hurt you or treat you like trash or even use you. Those who do, must get rid of them. He who loves you will only want what is best FOR you."   Sigh... I wish RT and I got married and lived happily ever after.  I probably wouldn't have to go through life with these issues so much. Oh well, since I am a good-hearted person, I'm just happy for RT's current girlfriend. I hope she treats him as nice as he is and I wish them well. Anyways, back to my friend's problem... I just told him not to be selfish and must think of the consequences of your temporary desires. Bad things and bad intentions always comes back with bad consequences.  It's just pure LOGIC. And you know how we ended the day? Before we left he said "I'm still up for the kiss you told me...anytime."  OKAYYY.. That was just too much! Fine, I did say I fancied him the last time we were working together. I WAS ON A REBOUND! And I SOOO know he wanted to take advantage of my fragile phase. The nerve of a man!! I truly endure our friendship and wouldn't want anything physical to ruin it, but I just cant believe some men who ARE friends would think of such things of ME! It's just disappointing! And heck, I told him I wouldn't go all the way with him, ever, because he's got a wonderful girlfriend and I was on a rebound and we're not from the same religion. And I told him that maybe I'd kiss him but it probably wont mean anything because I'm not in love... Meaningless just like Mint and my ex. But of course... how silly of me, he wouldn't mind!  See here's the thing. How can men out there treat women like me... Like trash. Gurls like me have our values, are worth the respect and just coz we look hot and sexy doesn't mean we are CHEAP and EASY. We look good on the outside coz we ARE great on the inside, and just because I don't wear a   tudung   doesn't mean I'm sleeping with everyone I meet. To these men with such narrow mindset, unlike tudung gurls who potray innocence, I somehow potray a social lifestyle, like pre-marital sex is OK.  How narrow minded can a person get?   Why do men have to generalize me based on the outside?! It's very disturbing and upsetting for sure. This is why I want things to end between me and DC...Apart from the relationship not being right and all. I don't know for sure if he's not trying hard to get in my pants and that's all he wants from me because most men are like that.   And that is why I told DC:  don't mind me if I generalize men for being pricks and bastards because I've met more than one who treat me like dirt because you men generalize women like me based on our appearance. And I don't even generalize men based on appearance!"   It's sad that it's really hard to find good-hearted Malay men for keeps these days. And I haven't even narrowed down this topic to the aspect of religion itself! My colleague mentioned this morning that I should go find a matsalleh (foreigner) who would understand my perspective and who is not so narrow minded like the Malay men.  If only finding THE ONE is  as easy as buying a new CD for keeps at Tower Records... Worth the effort and money too.  Anyways, I guess meeting up with weirdos and psycho men taught me one too many lessons on narrowing the criteria I want in my life partner. I'm gonna go home now and do just that list. Here's my theory for the day:   "Too many people care more about always doing things the right WAY, rather than doing the right THING."   So yes, I shall do the RIGHT things very much soon to re-organize my life into a much, much better one.
