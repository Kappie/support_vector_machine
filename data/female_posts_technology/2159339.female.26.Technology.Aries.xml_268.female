It was a dream line-up: Modest Mouse, Le Tigre, Sonic Youth, BRMC, Morrissey, PJ Harvey, The Von Bondies. Together in one day. In a non-desert setting. What a loss. I'm easily consoled though because in the summertime, shows compete with another love of mine: BBQs. I will exchange my Lollapalooza sorrows for a grill of fragrant meats and kebabs in my cousin's backyard. So far this BBQ season, I have been to four. The last being W-gal's bday bbq that was celebrated with my consumption of a turkey cheeseburger. Birthday turkeyburger always trumps birthday cake in my book.   I'm sneaking peeks at a Time magazine article on bloggers and here are the sites they deemed notable:   urlLink fark.com   urlLink boing boing   urlLink instapundit.com   urlLink wonkette!   urlLink rebecca's pocket   In personal news, I went into Kaiser last week to get an HIV test and some other STD test and the nursedude stuck a needle in me and it was very painful then after a while I hear him say, "Sorry we'll have to do this again. Give me your other arm?" And I was already like almost crying so I go, "What happened?" and he said, "You have a rolling vein. It moves." He carefully pushed the needle into my other arm and I decided I could never be a heroin addict or even get a tattoo because it fucking hurts! I'm too much of a weenie. Then I thought if he doesn't get the vein this time, I am just going to have to live assuming I have a disease because I can't go through with it again. Then he goes, "It's working" and extracted two vials of my blood.
