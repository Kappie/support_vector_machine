Surprise, There is an awesome  urlLink new piece of work  in the gallery, go, enjoy.  And eventually, all the art that was posted on  urlLink Quixotica.com  will be moved here, due to a recent Quixotic Redesign. I've decided to have this space focus even more so on the artistic side of things. So, expect to see some things you might have missed before.  Talk to you later, kids. Metahari
