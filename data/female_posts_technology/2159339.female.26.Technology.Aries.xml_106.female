The work I neglected has become insurmountable and I feel like my relatively easy job has become Sisyphean. I update the database through my lunch hour and I spend my breaks in the file room, but still my email inbox is a triple-digit and the "to be filed" tower of paperwork looms high.   In my personal life, I have tomorrow and Friday off to attend the various funeral ceremonies for my grandfather. They span three days, with the actual funeral and burial on Saturday morning. I've never been to a funeral before, let alone a Vietnamese Catholic one. From my experience with Vietnamese Catholic ceremonies, I can tell you right off that there will be no booze, but plenty of prayer and stern glances of disapproval from the older folk. My aunts will gently chide me for my strange clothes and my cousin Hai will probably fall asleep sometime during the homily.   My cousins and I are all grown, but we still feel like little kids. We have cars, day jobs, responsibilities, and even children, but when we get together, it's like adulthood is an outside-of-the-family joke. We glue ourselves to the television, put off eating to play video games, and make fun of each other honestly and ruthlessly. Because there are so many of us, we all talk in quick, brief soundbytes. We're loud and obnoxious and always interrupting each other. It is the opposite of an American family and this has proved problematic for new boyfriends.   An American family is much like Diane Keaton's family in "Annie Hall". Each person talks for a few sentences while everyone else listens attentively. Then it is another person's turn to say things while everyone else nods their head in quiet thoughtfulness. When Dizzy D first started attending our gatherings, he'd be frustrated that every sentence he'd say would turn into a set-up for someone else's punchline. He subjected himself to undue ridicule because he couldn't adapt quickly enough to the cadence. It was his own fault! Extended talking in my family translates into self-importance and self-importance is grounds for ridicule. To further muse on this, I could draw parallels between rhythms of conversation as reflective of American individualism vs. immigrant values on group preservation.   Anyway, this will probably be my only post this week, as I will be grieving. On a happy note, Bart Davenport is playing thrice this month in SF and in my love life, (drum roll please) XX asked me to be his valentine! My grandfather would be proud!*  *I'm just kidding. No he would not. He would actually be indifferent as he blasted an ear-shattering fart and blew a snot rocket into a tissue-lined envelope while bickering with my grandma.
