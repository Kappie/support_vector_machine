I just thank god it is all over and I am doing what ever I can do not to make him upset with me.  I have been working real hard trying to really clean my house and then everyone is going to think I am the momma from hell when I dont let them mess it up,  I was up til 2:00 this morning.  Working on the house.  I am tired but its worth it as long as he likes it!   I am like 85% done with the laundry.  The downstairs is cleaned and I need to get the upstairs done next.     I have to say....I was hurting so bad the other night but did not want to make him feel bad so I told him my head hurt.  but My back was killing me.  I could hardly sleep for a couple of days and my throat ...ohhh my god how it hurt.  I did try giving him a Bj but it hurt so bad.  I know he wanted to make love to me the other night and I REALLY wanted to make love to him.  But I was hurting so bad.  The pain has finally went away.    Last night ....  I needed and wanted to make love to him so bad.  That is actually the main reason I was staying up. I wanted to show him how much I do love him.   He called at 2:00 saying he was going to eat with Daniel so I went to bed.  He came home and laid down..but did not want to make love to me.  It hurts so bad.  I wish he knew the reason is that I was hurting..but at the same time I do not want him to feel bad about it.  I just dont want him mad at me.  I love him so much. and NEED To show him.
