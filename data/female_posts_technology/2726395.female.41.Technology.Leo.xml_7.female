But over the course of the past two years, I have become so accustomed to the practice of beginning each day with typing "Dear Thomas," that my fingers ache if they don't feel that pattern.  There is so much I would like to say to you. But I can never say them, and you don't want to hear them. And I know that you will never find this blog, so I can write them here and at least they'll be expressed.  Thomas, I dreamed about you before I ever met you or knew you existed. I dreamed that one day I would have a dear friend with whom I could walk and talk, meet for coffee, exchange e-mails, share secrets, have fun. I didn't want a partner, or a lover, or an affair. I wanted a friend. And then there you were, and you made me so incredibly happy. I felt so much joy in your company because it meant that my fondest, deepest wish had finally come true. . But who knew that it would so abruptly end?  I guess it ended four months ago, but it's taken me this long to realize that it wasn't a mood, it wasn't a phase, that it was permanent.  And now you have the nerve to say it wasn't personal.  How can shattering my heart  not  be personal? And without even so much as the slightest tender mercy of an explanation.  Do you think you are the only one who can feel pain, Thomas?   Yes, of course I know that you are dropping me because it's  easier  to drop me than to fight with Nancy about it.  And yes I know that it's symptomatic of a larger problem.  It has been so maddening to watch you over these past few months, gaining weight at an alarming rate, complaining about your terrible relationship; you must have been thinking if you put a ring on her finger, it would stop the fighting. If you dropped a dear friend, maybe  that  would stop the fighting. If you dropped all your hobbies and lived only for her, maybe  that  would stop the fighting. And you must now think, If you buy a house, that will stop the fighting. If you marry and have children, that will stop the fighting. You would do anything to stop the fighting, but nothing works, does it, Thomas? In fact, it gets worse. And you resent it more because nothing you have given up gives you the payback you want. You have chosen, stubbornly, to live this life, which can have no end except for lonlieness and destruction. It has already begun, and it began with me. Or perhaps earlier, I don't know. Except that I do know you have isolated yourself from everything that does not meet her approval, which is most everything you ever enjoyed.  And because I love you so much, it kills me to know that this is the fate to which you have sealed yourself.  To be terrified to step out of her view for more than two minutes, clutching your cellphone for dear life, waiting for her to call you to tell you what you must do next.  Such a brilliant mind, Thomas, such a loving and dear heart, completely controlled and dominated, completely without independent thought. Or if you do still have them, you must surpress them, for fear they might cause another fight.  But you know what? I would accept you this way. I would silently watch you become alarmingly heavier and heavier, I would dance at your wedding,  I would continue to love you and support you and listen to you anyway, because that's what good friends do.  I would continue to be the one beacon in your life, but you won't let me. I thought you had the ability to recognize a true and stable friend. But your ability to recognize anything has become so clouded with the desperation to end the fighting by doing anything at all, no matter the cost, except the only sensible thing you  can  do, that you don't see loyalty, you don't see heartbreak, you don't accept love or caring.  You don't even have a sense of your own self worth. Once you asked me plaintively, "Do you think I am that weak? Do you think I am that low?"  The answer is yes to the weak, no to the low. Because, my dear Dr. Thomas Loecherbach, I will love you until the day I die. I will always be your friend. I do not allow anyone to say anything negative about you in my presence, even when they are outraged at you, or are simply trying to make me feel good by painting you in a negative light. I don't let them do it. I think you are a wonderful man, and it has been a privilege to know you. I will never desert you, even though you will not allow me in your life. I am resolved to love a ghost. Your fate is a life of abject misery, a life you have chosen for yourself. Mine is to love a man who will soon be a distant memory.  And this started out as a dream coming true. How bloody ironic.  I miss you, dear Thomas.
