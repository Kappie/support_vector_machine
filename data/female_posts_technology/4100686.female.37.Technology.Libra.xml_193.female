It isn't so much that ethnic politics have been empirically shown to be quite destructive that bothers me. It's the fact that the very notion of ethnicity in Afghanistan is very nebulous and fluid, like all other aspects of politics in the country. I actually have a very extreme view on the subject, as I feel the notion of ethnic identity does not have much meaning within the country itself, and certainly there are no clear borders or lines of demarcation separating groups from one another...     urlLink Afghan Voice  the thoughts of a young Afghan, Arash, blogging regularly since Jan 2003.
