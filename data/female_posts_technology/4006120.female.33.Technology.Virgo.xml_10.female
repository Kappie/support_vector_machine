Me:  Whoa...what happened to the other people?  Carla:  Um, they're gone...they've been laid off...  Me:  Serious?  Carla:  Uh-huh. Only one, your name is posted on the board in the employee lounge.  Me:  Really, oh dear...should I be worried? (sigh) I think I see a trend here. Am I next in line?  Carla:  (giggles) Anyway, what cake do you like?  Me:  Hmmm. I dunno, anything goes…  Carla:  Do you want a pie? Ice cream?  Me:  Hmmm. They all sound good to me. What would people prefer?  Carla:  Well you get to pick coz it's your birthday…  Me:  Whatever you pick. I'm not really a big cake or dessert person. I'm sure it'll be good.  Carla:  Alrighty then. Bye... (giggles)   10 seconds later, Birthday cake "meeting" was sent to all employees via email for August 26 at 2pm. Laid off, no job, birthday, scary thought. I don't want to be the only celebrant, I don't really like be put on the spot...waaaah!   My birtday is actually on the 23rd. Last night, Budz asked me what I want for my birthday. I dunno. Haven't really thought of anything...  1) I want new hiking boots. 2) I want a new pair of comfy walking sandals - black. 3) I want to try a bikini wax - a brazilian bikini wax. 4) I need a new haircut and re-touch on my higlights. 5) I want to fix my crooked nose. 6) I want to fix my crooked teeth. 7) Can I get new boobies? 8) All of the above.  Budz? tee hee...
