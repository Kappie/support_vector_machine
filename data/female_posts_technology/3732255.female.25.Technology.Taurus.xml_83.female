Only Crime's debut full length will not disappoint and it's hard not to drop names when the band is made up of members like Russ from Good Riddance, Bill from Descendents, and Aaron from Bane! That's pedigree. With that shameless stuff out of the way, you should know that if you order it through Fat mailorder you also get a free Only Crime pin with your order of  urlLink To The Nines . How can you repay us for this generosity? Have a look at their smokin' hot e-card:  urlLink http://www.fatwreck.com/junk/oc.html
