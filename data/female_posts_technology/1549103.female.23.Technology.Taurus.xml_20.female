People shy away from getting involved, and I think it's because it seems like too great of a burden.  Like for some reason, it's not enough to use Windows versions of free software, or to learn more about Linux, or dual boot or whatever, they think they have to be (as someone said to me) a "Linux guru" and get rid of Windows alltogether and install Debian and write their own device drivers.  I can see how it's overwhelming, because once you start caring, there is so much to care about, but I don't think the answer is to not care about anything.  
 Not being able to do everything is no reason to not do something.
