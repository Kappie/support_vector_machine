Trader Joe's has made this transition a helluva lot easier by supplying interesting salads, 4-packs of white nectarines, and snack packs of celery sticks that come with a small pot of peanut butter. A warning though: don't get their curried chicken salad because the curry has RAISINS in it. BLEAh!!! Though TJ's makes vegetables fun, it's still a chore to eat them because I'd rather feed veggies to rabbits or horses. Or I'd rather dangle them from a stick to propel my pack mule.   2. I'm drinking more water.  This sucks sucks sucks. Drinking a lot when it's cold outside is really hard. It doesn't cool or rehydrate me because there is no sun interplay. In hot weather I chuzzle water like a maniac but when it's freezing outside in the cold cold summer, I'd rather be drinking other things, like spiked cocoa.   3. I walk during my lunchtime.  I don my pink Roos and trek to IKEA and back. Though this isn't a rigorous exercise, I think it's better than no exercise at all, which I actually prefer. XX says the secret to exercise is finding an activity that you like. You know what activities I like? Eating, sleeping, and sitting on my ass. I also like to take baths and read magazines. I also really like to play Taboo.   4. Smaller portions.  I eat less now. Before I'd eat a lot because I really enjoy the taste of food and the act of eating itself. I like to taste and chew and savor and swallow. I like the alchemy of cooking, the appetizing incarnations of food, and the aromas and textures involved. Eating is a pleasurable experience for me. But now, I've kind of lost my joie de eating because the repercussions of it hang on me like an albatross. An albatross around my mid-section.
