It was heartbreaking to see my mother cry, because the last time she cried was when I was very young, probably 20 years ago. She wept and called him "father" in Vietnamese which I rarely heard her use. From the time I was born, she used "grandfather" which is the Vietnamese tradition: to address people as your child would address them. Your formal relationships change when your child is born, so it was moving to see her as the child, instead of my mother, and to understand my grandfather as my mother's father.  The women ripped up sheets of white fabric into long strips and we tied those around our heads: women wore them with the long ends trailing, and the men wrapped the fabric all the way around and tucked in the ends neatly. In the chapel we stood in line to light incense and bow 3x in front of his framed picture, then we processed past the open casket. I walked up to light the incense with Green Marble and her bf Jason and I forgot how many times I bowed because I started too early, then lost count trying to synchronize with the other two. I hoped no one noticed my flub, but right when I thought that, Green Marble dropped her incense and the red-hot tip burned her on the way to the carpeted floor. "Ouch!" she whisper-shouted, jumping back a little. Jason recovered the incense from the floor and handed it back to her. She was embarrassed. I was relieved that a bigger spectacle dwarfed my own faux pas.  Afterwards, all the cousins got together and we went to Hong Kong Flower Lounge and pigged out on dim sum. We stuffed our faces with dumplings and various pork delights and when the bill came, the total only came to $14 a person. This included the subsidization of the 2 college kids and the one unemployed cousin.   We split up to go home and nap and at night everyone drove up to the city to see my and Green Marble's new apt. We drank beers and ordered massive quantities of Chinese, Indian, and Thai take-out. And everyone met XX. He was like John Corbett in "My Big Fat Greek Wedding". We put him in charge of choosing the Indian entrees and he was like, should I order one order of samosas? (This was before most of the cousins had arrived.) We looked at him in horror and bafflement. I was like, "No! You gotta do 3 orders! AT LEAST." And one cousin laughed and said, "You're not from a big family, are you?" Everyone showed up and we ate and laughed and drank and poked fun at each other. We compared notes on who cried the most and who cried the least. My grandfather would have been pleased.
