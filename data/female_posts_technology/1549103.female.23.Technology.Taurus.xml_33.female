I've pretty much given up being weirded out by everyone getting married, so the fact that everyone I know seems to be breeding just cements our existence in very different worlds.  These showers have consisted of a bunch of young married women, most with at least one kid; I have been one of two or three single women at each.  It's weird to me, it's like here you go straight from being a child to being middle-aged and responsible, but it still smacks of playing house.  
 I realize now that I used to be obsessed with marriage, as most of my friends were.  But this wasn't entirely our fault, we had no intermediary steps of adulthood.  Every now and then I get a glimpse of how I used to think, like how I should be jokingly but secretly truly bitter about not being married.  Maybe this shows that deep down I still have that mindset, but when I'm elsewhere, in cultures where 22 and unmarried is to be expected, it rarely even crosses my mind how I'm "supposed" to feel.
