The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you. 18 I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.'   Because we love God, we'll do what he asks of us. (In return?) he will give us the holy spirit to be with us until Jesus returns. The spirit brings us to truth (the truth about God, about Jesus, about the Bible) but many people in the world will never accept it because they don't have faith in God.  Since we do have faith, the spirit will live with us and inside us.  We won't be left alone until Jesus comes back because he will be with us through the spirit.  That's kind of a nice thing to remember.  I wish I did remember it more often.
