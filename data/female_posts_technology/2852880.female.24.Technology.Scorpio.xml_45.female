I'm currently not affiliated with any party.  But I'm scared of what Bush and his people are doing to the economy.  Sure, working for MS, I get to cash in on some of his big business favoritism, but it's just so wrong.  I saw the WORST MOVIE EVER on Saturday.  It's called Hellboy.  I was convinced by a couple of guys.  I don't know what they were thinking.  Definitely a movie worthy of walking out on.  SO BAD.  And I don't have very high standards.  Think about it.  My favorite movie is The Cutting Edge.  Don't waste your time on this one.  I'd rather go to the dentist.  My BC t-shirt shrunk in the wash.  Bummer.  Who listens to the instructions on the little tag anyway?  Guess I'm going to have to show a little midriff.  Tomorrow I'm transforming myself.  I'm going to see Shaun.  He's amazing.  He works at Vain.  I think we're going to do some red and blonde highlights and some sort of cute cut without going too short.   Does anybody read my blog?  Not too many comments!
