With just a pinch of optimism.   Nevertheless, let us celebrate this momentous occasion with a  urlLink Ben Harper  song.   The Will To Live ~ Ben Harper  I met a girl whose heart was on the right hand side and upon the left an angel did reside they told her mother that she never would survive but she kept the rhythm and is still alive  We must all have the will to live you got to have the will to live  Then I met a man who had to walk with his hands born into a world he couldn't stand blessed with life but cursed as a man still he walks taller than most of us can  We must all have the will to live you got to have the will to live  Some are born with more and some born with less so don't take for granted the life we've been blessed it's hard to understand that we're only a guest and each one of us shall be put to life's test  We must all have the will to live you got to have the will to live
