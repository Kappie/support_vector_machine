Grand Cayman was a blast! You never realize how beautiful things are until u are out in the open and all u can say is wow! It really makes u sit back and think about all the wonderful things in the world and how precious life is. I did alot of thinking while on my cruise. Well I'm not about to sit here and get all mushy. I'll be all day! But nothing else is new. :( Hopefully I'll have more good things entering my life soon. Hint Hint a man! Cuz I'm tired of sitting my tail on BP all darn day! Now if I can just get my best friend to come and see me here inNew Orleans! LOL. I know ur reading this. Later!
