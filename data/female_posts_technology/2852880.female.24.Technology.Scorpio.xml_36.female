He is talking about what it's like to be totally infatuated with a friend of yours.  Back when I was a writer for the Princeton Triangle Club, I wrote a song called "Guys and Girls Can Never Just be Friends."  It was along the same lines, and it was also a bit of a comedy with some truth to it.  But this guy REALLY captures the feelings involved.  It's definitely worth reading.  It brought back all sorts of memories.   urlLink http://www.dailycollegian.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2003/11/21/3fbd76353e7dd   Happy Reading!
