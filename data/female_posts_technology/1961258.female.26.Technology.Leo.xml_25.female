It's not too long, but long enough .. 4 nights, 3 days in a beautiful resort. So I have to go shopping for a new swimsuit and hopefully will not look that horrible in it!   My weight has stagnated to about 165 - 170lbs. which is not good. I have 22 days to lose 22 lbs .. hah .. i wish! 1 lbs. a day would be such a miracle and something I so need but it's so unrealistic. I'd settle for 5 - 10 lbs. so get working! No kidding .. I want to lounge by the pool and swim as much as I want.  Eating has going pretty well. Not too much of anything, but I need to work out to tone up a whole lot. Wish me luck!
