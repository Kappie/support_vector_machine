This was a bit of a dormant topic, till yesterday, when I was watching this news cut on a news channel about Live relationships, and the gaining popularity of this concept among Indians.  I personally have always liked this concept essentially for the following reasons: 1.  Good check of compatibility under the same roof 2.  Easy transition to a commitment of marriage 3.  Better learning experience 4.  More quality time gets to be spent with your partner In all:  It gives you a chance to test out the waters before taking the Big plunge.  But then, are there negatives to this situation ??? Well, I can only think of the following: 1.  Things are taken for granted 2.  The relationship starts to be more driven by Sex, than that of an emotional commitment. 3.  People get into the mode where they take things for granted and forget to spend time with each other!  Funny but dont these negatives really sound more like the downsides of marriage? Hahaha...!  So whats the difference really! Well, as far as I'm concerned, Live In relationships is a commitment of a non legalised sense, essentially a marriage of two souls which aint on paper!  Well..some people can also see this in terms of Co habitation....kindof like a due diligence process which needs to be completed before the final jump!   Just curious but in this form of relationships...is the independent self maintained at all???
