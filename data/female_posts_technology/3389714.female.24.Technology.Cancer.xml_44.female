I know she was happy to see me..and she really wanted to play..but hello “u gigantic freak of nature can u not see I’m deathly afraid of u”… well while her 150 pounds of raw meat came running towards me at super sonic speed .. my life just FROOZE.. you got it ..it bloody froze.. I mean I thought I’d see my whole childhood flash before my eyes.. I mean there’s not much of a childhood cuz I’m only 23.. but still nothing flashed ..now the dog was on me and u’d think I’d scream “get off me” but the only word that came out of my mouth was “DON’T” I mean don’t what…don’t pee on me, don’t eat me, don’t lick me…I have no bloody idea what I was thinking of at that point…I mean who say “DON’T” when a dog is attacking you… G Anti started laughing when sweetie started licking my hand I wanted to vomit…I was so scared… I used to luv this dog when she was a lil pup…I remember carrying her around the block like a little baby ..but now man .. this dog can carry me around… it’s so damn huge.. but guess what I didn’t even sweat a tear.. however G Anti said the look on my face was beyond a Kodak moment.. oh well .. I guess I’m afraid of big dogs…I just need to be more aware and work on my, “OH MY GOD YOUR DOG’S GONNA EAT ME VOCABULARY”….   Question of the Day:  What are u deathly afraid of…?  Well there’s 2 things… 1) Sweetie 2) my mom’s vaalan (rolling pin)…j/k..lol
