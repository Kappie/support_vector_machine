I was  ONLY  supposed to rob some bank, de-rob some bank, pay some bills and develop some photos. But I just added one more activity,  FOOTWEAR-SHOPPING .   I can't resist it,but my 'goodfriends' at  NODA , my favorite footwear store, seems 'waving-waving-and-calling-calling' me. I love the designs-and-styles of this Japan-origin store, and things I got from there are really comfortable that I over-use-and-wear it. Before to-date, I had 2 bags, 1 slip-in sandals and 1 slip-in slippers from there. And today, I saw one, nice   bronzey  , heel-ed flip-flops. With my member card, I told myself ' Heck-lah ' I can get 10% percent discount from the mere original pricetag of less than 30 bucks. But my roaming eyes simply didn't stop there! I tried on a   bronzey  , strappy flip-flops which cost less than 10 buck after the 10% off! What's all these craze with  bronze  colour man?   Well, I did told hubby sometime ago I want to shoe-shop for a decent pair of working shoes. His idea will be something  Everbest / Renoma -ish. But hey, did I tell you that I wear slippers/sandals most of the time to office? So now I'd just happily left  NODA  not only with the shopping items, but some  NODA  shopping vouchers. Does that mean, some more footwear shopping in very near future?  NO !!!!! In fact these ones, I am temporarily 'hiding' it in the office, and 'gradually' will wear it after one fine office hour. To prevent it from getting too noticeablefrom hubby's eyes.     ~~~   I would have gotten further with my 'spendthrift', if I could not resist myself from the Japanese fair   in Westmall. You know all those  Meiji  stuffs like the  choc -filled biscuits, marshmallows,  candies  etc  . But I am pretty phobiac from one experience of these kind of fairs when I bought, I thought pretty decent cheese-crackers  . Only later I realised it contained beef extracts.  Nauzubillah ..... tu zaman dahulukala, masih jahiliah, entah halal ke haram, main sondol ajer .   So I simply walked myself away slowly from the fair.   ~~~   The self-help photo-develop machine in Westmall is not good. They only offer express 1 hour service or normal 1 day service. They simply one to ' ketuk ' 5 bucks per CD on top of 40 cents per piece. Unlike the one in CP, you have another option to develop your own self and get the photos on the spot. Even if you opt for the express/normal service its 4 bucks per CD. Waste my  current ajer .
