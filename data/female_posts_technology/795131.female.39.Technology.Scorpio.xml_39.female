I moved to Yakima at the age of 2, in 1966.  I attended Nob Hill Elementary school (with its annual field trips to the Snyders Bread Factory), Wilson and Franlin Junior High Schools (now middle schools) and Davis High School. I attended the LDS churches , the one on or near 37th ave and Teiton, and the one farhter north on a street called Edgerton or Edgewood or a street that had the word "Edge" in it somewhere. I left in 1983 at age 18 and have rarely visited since. I used to take the Northern Pacific Rail Road to Tacoma, in the late 60s and possibly the very early 70s. Being so small, however, the main thing I remember is that the attendants always gave my sister and me a paper train-conductor hat to wear, with blue and white pinstripes. I attended the grand opening of the trolley line, in about 1976 or so, my mom sang it the Sweet Adeline's chorus. Seems to me that grand opening was held on or near the Eisenhower school campus. We actually believed that it would make us a tourist attraction! I remember when the downtown Yakima mall opened, and it had a B.Dalton, a Wulitzer organ store, and a gift shop called the "IN Shop". Later it included the Jolly Joker Video arcade (I avoided it, full of juvenile delinquents), and Ron's Coin and Book in the basement (including all your "gaming" needs). I loved hanging out in that mall as a teen ager. I'm sad to hear that it is being neglected now, but my mom says she's working on a project to turn it in to a charter school, which would be a great use of the space! Later, a Prairie State Bank opened downtown, and it had this weird dress code where all the female employees had to dress in pioneer dresses, and the tellers had to stand behind barred windows, as if it were an old-west bank. I wonder if it was embarrassing to work there? I always came home from school and watched Uncle Jimmy's Club House. I think all us kids in my family were on it, for our birthdays, several times! I find that one thing I miss today is the weather! It was mild, compared to here in Minnesota! I also miss the relatively-fresh, and not over-priced crab and shrimp! I get homesick for it.  I feel stupid for not learning Spanish while I was growing up in Yakima. If I'd have paid more attention, I could have picked it up from everyone around me! I honestly belived I'd never need it, and I didn't bother. Now that Spanish is more widely spoken here in MN, I'm kicking myself! Now I'll have to go out and pay for Spanish class, I guess! I stopped by Yakima about 5 years ago and was happy to see that the "Restaruant" (I forget its name) still, at that time, had that rotating hunter sign, with its rifle, shooting up the place. When ever my family took the Tieton Drive bus downtown, I used to duck when we went by that guy! Does anyone still read this Yakima messsage board/ email list? I'll post more fuzzy childhood memories of Yakima as I rememeber them.
