But a few dots are not there. Like a chemical imbalance. Cool Huh? I'm getting ready for my new job. It is 2:28 am amd My Mel just asked me if I was coming back to bed. Ain't he sweet. Funny too. I love him. I had a bad day yesterday. I can't really discuss this stuff with anyone else but the blog, they get scared. What about you Lisa?
