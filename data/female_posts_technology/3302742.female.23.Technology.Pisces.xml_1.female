The police who investigate crime, and the district attorneys who... wait. no, no there I go mixing up real life with  urlLink 'law and order ' again.  As I was saying, two groups.  The first group start every school year/college semester/big meeting/blog  urlLink delire and excira   with the required new-book-smell empty copybooks/refil pad/notebook/first post space, thinking about new starts and how nice and clean and inviting the pages are.  Group 2 on the other hand see how much scribbling/writing/typing they have ahead of them to fill up said pages, and depending on their level of neurosis will feel anything from a general unease to a struck with fear throw-it-out-the-window panic.   Personally, I am as you may have guessed a member of the latter group. (I will leave my level of neurosis for your good selves to measure as you see fit). This is strange, as I'm normally of the  glass half full persuasion.  But I have come to the conclusion that the solitary reason why I'm not a celebrated author of very-intelligent-novels ala  urlLink Monica Ali  is because all the hundreds of blank pages would cause terrible nightmares therefore forcing me to spend all royalties on expensive therapy.  I wonder if there is a name for this phobia? Hmmm.  The fear of paper, ( urlLink Papyrophobia ), doesn't quite cover it.  Well anyway you'll be glad to know I'm working through it.  First by locking myself in the stationary cabinet with all the clean new paper.  This was a step too far, as pointed out to me by my friendly HR representative.  A blog may be more appropriate methinks.  And thus, we are here.
