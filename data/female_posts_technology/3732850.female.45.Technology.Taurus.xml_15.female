I notice that someone is coming towards the bed. Then someone else and then another person. I never can see their faces but they get close enough to steal my blankets from my bed. Once they have taken them, they begin to use them like they are a jumprope. They turn them over and over again. I am laying there freezing to death wondering why they took my blankets. I can not stop shaking and shivering, I am so cold. It is so dark and I don't understand what is happening. I watch them twirling my blankets. All of a sudden I notice that my blankets have actually turned into a rope. The people, or whatever they are, slowly fade into the  dark back round as they continue to twirl the rope or what used to be my blankets. I wake up because I am so cold.   This is a dream that I have had ever since I was a child. It seems that when I am sick with a fever or not feeling well, I will dream this dream. I have gotten to the point that when I am not feeling well, I sometimes worry about "the dream". Even though it is harmless, I still wonder where it comes from.
