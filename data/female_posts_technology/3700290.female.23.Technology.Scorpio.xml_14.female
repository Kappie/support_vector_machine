We had planned to watch SpiderMan 2 initially but I guess she had sensed my disinterest to watch. Therefore, we suggested we go and drink in HV.   After meeting up with my JC gang yesterday, I wondered if we did the right thing by giving the show a miss. They were saying that the graphics are damn nice and cool..I felt a pity to miss the show suddenly. However, action-pacted shows, irregardless of whether it is movie or cartoon, just don't appeal to me.   Adeline T broke the news that she was pregnant for 2 months when we finally caught up yesterday. It turned out some people have really known about it. It was the conversation that we had while they had their dinner in Sushi Tei at Suntec City, do I realise the gap between me and them... I wasn't informed of the latest happenings till the very last moment. This feeling isn't great...  Went to Adeline T's new house after dinner. Well, the fact that this was our first time to her new place, and she, being a non-driver herself, does not help much. We spent nearly an hour on the road figuring out how to go to her house. We reached her house at nearly ten, spent an hour in watching her wedding photos before we left her house to heed home. Her kitchen looked cosy...I liked it the best as it was all PINK! Wooo!                                        ****  Do I have the nerdy and chee-na look? JH and Zec made the same comment that I should change my image. Hmpf...is my image so lousy that I should accept new look? Being a narcisstic person, I was thinking whether it is my character or my image that make them pass such a remark. Though I always smiled and brushed off such comments as if I don't care about them, I could not help but to feel lousy that why am I the only one who is receiving such comments all the time.  Nerdy and poor...what a good combi!  On a more positive note, bro is coming home today. He has lost his hp again and dad decided to check with him whether he has a mobile. If not, I should return his hp to him and my father would give me his 8310 to use. Okie...8310 isn't that new or fantastic but it is better than the 3310. I am aiming to buy 6230 by the end of August so even if I use the 8310 phone, I would return to dad by then.
