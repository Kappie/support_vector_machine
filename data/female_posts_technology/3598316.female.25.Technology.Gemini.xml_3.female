I have determined my ankle and knee injury is a co-workers fault who told me I jog wrong. I tried to correct it and twisted my leg (also almost ran off the treadmill-- was a funny thing to see). Can you sue for that kind of thing?    This is an offical offer to all who read.  If you can sell my car for $7400 dollars Canadian I will give you a whopping $100. I know I am soooo generous. .......... and i just wrote that a man called interested in my car.  CROSS YOUR FINGERS!! WHO KNOWS ..MAYBE HE IS HOT TOO!!??!?
