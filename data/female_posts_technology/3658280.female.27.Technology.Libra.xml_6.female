I would have been on time today, except for the fact that I got a few miles from my house and started to wonder if I closed the sliding door after I let the dog in. I have forgotten to do that before and have come home from work to find the door wide open for all the world to get in. One time I left the garage door open, with the Harley and the side door unlocked. I leave the bathroom light over the shower on all the time. I even left a frozen pizza in the oven, went out to wash my car, and came back in about an hour later wondering what that smell was.  So I tried to replay the events of the morning in my head. Maybe it's because I only get up about 20 minutes before I leave, but I couldn't remember for the life of me if I shut that door or not. So I turned around and went back. The door was shut.   Then I start wondering what my problem is.  Why do I always forget what I did in the morning?  Is it because it's so routine it just isn't a big enough event to be worth remembering?   All I know is that there have been many times at my old house when I would if I shut the garage door, so I'd go back. It would be shut, so I would leave. Then I would wonder if i locked the back door, so i'd go back again. Then, did I put the dog downstairs, shut off the kitchen light, IS THE OVEN STILL ON FROM LAST NIGHT??? Even if I didn't cook anything, which I would have to think about really hard to remember if I did cook or not. (most likely not).  But I'm not kidding. I have turned around and gone back home 3 or 4 times before. A doctor a few years ago half-assed diagnosed me as being obsessive-compulsive and slightly depressed. He tried to put me on Zoloft. I didn't take it. Then my mom sent me to a shrink. (obviously there was a lot more going on here than wondering if i locked my door or not). Anyway, she decided that I was a high strung person (you think?), highly stressed, and I should listen to relaxation tapes. Whatever. I tried that. I would just fall asleep.   So I guess I will just have to accept the fact that I will never remember if I locked the door or turned of the light and just keep turning around to go back and look. I don't think I'm really obsessive compulsive. I think I just know I forget to do things and can't remember if I forgot or not.  At least I never leave the house with no clothes on.    I think....
