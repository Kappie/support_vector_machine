The man who owns this site has an enormous appetite for direct-to-video movies. He must have seen everything Don "the Dragon" Wilson and Lou Diamond Phillips have ever done. I also like the personal pages he has on his site. He's a member of the U.S. Army; his stories of his days in Germany are fascinating to me. Plus any one who rescues a cat and names it "Jet Jaguar" is okay in my book. You have seen  Godzilla Vs. Megalon , haven't you?
