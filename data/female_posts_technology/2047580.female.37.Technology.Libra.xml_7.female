We apologize for the four-day delay in taking off. It was due to bad weather and some overtime I had to put in at the bakery.  This is flight 126 to Tunis. Egypt Air has an excellent record for safety. In fact our safety standards are so high that even the terrorists are afraid to fly with us.  It is with pleasure I announce that starting this year more than 50 percent of our passengers have reached their destination.  If our engines are too noisy for you, on passenger request, we can arrange to turn them off.  To make your free fall to earth pleasant and memorable, we serve complimentary tea and biscuits.  For our not-so-religious passengers, we are the only airline who can help you find out if there really is a God.  We regret to inform you, that today's in-flight movie will not be shown as we forgot to record it from the television. But for our movie buffs, we will be flying next to Air Tunis, where their movie will be visible from the right side of the cabin window.  There is no smoking in this airplane. Any smoke you see in the cabin is only the early warning system on the engines telling us to slow down.  In order to catch important landmarks, we try to fly as close as possible for the best view. If, however, we go a little too close, do let us know.  Kindly be seated, keep your seat in an upright position for take off and fasten your belt.  For those of you who can't find a seat belt, kindly fasten your own belt to the arm of your seat. And for those of you who can't find a seat, do not hesitate to get in touch with a stewardess who will explain how to fasten yourself to your suitcase.
