When I was 8 my sisters and I thought it was big fun to play under the Christmas tree. Shoving, hair pulling, giggling, you know-play. “Girls, get away from the tree” was a jolly holiday chant. Not so much big fun anymore with 2 cats slapping each other, kicking the presents and knocking Elvis ornaments to the floor. Hmmm, I’ll let you know when the kitty pot pies are all cooked up. 3. Remember on Get Smart when Max would be holding a cup of coffee and then look at his watch and pour the coffee down his shirt? Yeah, really  not funny  at all in reality. Especially before 8a.m. And not even if it isn’t coffee but icy cold soda. 4. I found out it rarely snows in the city of Vancouver and the temperature is similar to ours (more rain though). That means when I go in February I can take my 11 inch mini kilt. Excellent! Maybe the Canadians will appreciate that show. ( you  people certainly don’t. you know who you are.)   5. This month there is a hockey game in the Kingdom of Fife between the Fife flyers and the Bracknell bees. Hockey is a sporting event and therefore not interesting but wouldn’t a Bracknell bees sweatshirt be really cool? 6. If the alarm goes off at 7 a.m. and a song is playing that you must know the name of, get up and immediately call the radio station. 2 snooze button slaps later is too late. (6 months in a leaky boat by Split Enz covered recently and brilliantly by….??, sigh, I’ll never know.) 7. I knew that before she slayed vampires Sarah Michelle Gellar chewed the scenery as Kendall Hart on All my Children. What I  didn’t  know was that she won an emmy for it.  Wow . I wonder if the current Kendall could slay a vampire? 8. On AMC, again with that crap, Liza and Mia are sisters. Wha? (Probably half sisters, er, half wits, but  still .) I also learned that Liza pushed Mia out of a 3-story window several years ago. You can’t really blame her though. She had a brain tumor at the time. And it is a soap opera. And Mia has rocks for brains. 9. Suicidal tendencies and Iggy Pop make outstanding “wake up and get ready for work” music. It may sound depressing but it’s really very refreshing.  10. Here where I work we have a room called the hot box. The techs test outdoor modem units (or something) from Arizona and possibly Spain for withstanding high temperatures.   The hot box  is not  a tanning bed  A Barbie would become warped in 4.5 minutes and a puddle of perky goo in 32 minutes  An action figure (say, a new kid on the block) would warp in 9.3 minutes and become a puddle of boy band goo in 49 minutes  Other exciting things that would melt in the tanning bed. Em, hot box. I meant the hot box. Hard cheese, super bouncing balls, peeps, CDs, colored chalk, disposable lighters   Things that will smoke and then explode into flame in the hot box. Barbie’s Malibu swim suit, Barbie’s hair, boxes of rice crispies, boxes of cracker jacks, wigs, fire works that you thought were duds but kept anyway because they were so large and you never know when you might need all that gun powder inside.  Please note that all melting, warping, smoking and exploding times and information are estimations by the techs and now I am never, ever allowed near the hot box unsupervised. Make that never, ever, ever period. Just because I had a few well thought out, specific questions, jeez.
