The guys were not happy about that. LOL Yesterday I spent a ton of time on some more songs. I did not even go to the gym. I will be doing the same thing today when I get home from work except I will be going to the gym today. Talked to Jeremy yesterday after not talking for a while. I think we pretty much got things squared away and layed our opinions and feelings out so we are friends again. That is a good thing cuz despite what he might have thought, I did miss him. Matt called yesterday and he is coming to visit at the end of the month! He has never been to Chicago. I have to make sure he has an amazing time! Matt, if I have not mentioned him b4 is a friend of Mike and Steve's. (Boston) Mike and Steve will be coming real soon too. Yeah! They are such great people. I will post some pics from Boston later when I get home.
