I think that it might be time to introduce ourselves and tell a little bit about why we came to be here; and why we’re sharing our stories.    We must conceal some detail of ourselves and our work in order to protect our own lives and keep our operations safe for the future. The three of us make up the world’s last and best defense against the evils of the world. Revenant vampyres occur all the time. We try to be careful in our breeding and our seeding of humans; however, its not always possible to know beforehand how these things will turn out. Occasionally, we must strike down one of our own kind in order to preserve the natural order of things, and our way of life.     My name is Ireth. I was born a long time ago, under another name, during a time when Egypt was a fairly young land. I was human then, and a priestess, of a goddess who's name has long since been forgotten. She was a Mother, a nurturing presence of the Earth. I have lost much of my old religion, but I do believe in Her still, and I hope she hasn't forgotten me. To go through my entire past would take much more time than the humans who will read this have to live. I will tell you that I have punished myself for my existence far more than anyone else on this earth ever could have. But I no longer believe that I am evil by my very nature. I have learned much over these many years of myself, and the world in which we live.     I have been a priestess, a beggar, a Lady, a singer, a festival performer; I was even a queen, once. Now, I am proud to tell you that I am part of something much larger than myself. We call ourselves Dante's Demons after the fictional character who traveled through Hell. We named ourselves this because the three of us have all journeyed through our own personal hells and come out the other side, not only stronger, but extraordinarily so. I'm very proud to say that where I once spent centuries wandering through time aimlessly, I now have a purpose. My purpose is to protect those weaker than myself and uphold the name of good wherever I can.     Some of you may be wondering... You must have figured out by now that I am a vampyre. I was born more years ago than I can remember. So why, when history has painted my entire species as evil, would I "uphold the name of good"? Ah, because Mara was correct, of course. Not everything is as the stories speak of them. Just as not all humans are good, not all of my kind are evil. Actually, good and evil are relative ideals. Some of my kind even believe that good and evil are myths thought up by the human mind. I, however, believe very much in good. Perhaps that's just because I want to believe. I want to believe I'm good. And I want to believe that when this world is done with me, then I may go home to my Goddess and be content until time and the world end.     I did not mean to spend such time here, but it is cathartic to speak to you all after so much time has passed. I have much to bestow upon the world; but even I cannot do that all at once. Mara, Symone and I have work to do this evening. Perhaps one of us will even tell you about it when we return. Farewell until next time and remember:        Damnant quod non intellegunt.          "They condemn what they do not understand."
