And then everyone is so nice and helpful and I'm just getting crankier and crankier because someone is sitting in my 'normal' workstation. What a nut!   I feel it might be the lack of chocolate, or possibly, cheese in my life.  Clearly, being Mrs Routine is quite limiting.  I should just go with the flow and chill, shouldn't I? Big deal, right? I should take my own advice (which sadly, I never seem to do) and remember what I keep saying to The Nieces; 'Some children have nothing, some children have no shoes'.  Once when I said that to Niece No 2, she said 'But I don't care about those children'.  Their Catholic education has a lot to answer for.  Did I mention that Niece No 1 is currently obsessed with Hilary Duff? She's 7 for heaven's sake! It's creepy. I told my sister not to take her to see 'The Lizzie McGuire' movie, but no, did she listen to me?   Now, she's got a 7 year old going on 17 year old mooning about the house waiting for Christmas so she can get the latest Hilary Duff CD.  I don't think I can forgive my sister for encouraging mainstream cinema and music tastes in her children.  It's just not right.  Finally, I quite like the way I seamlessly diverted this blog from my own shortcomings to those of my family members.
