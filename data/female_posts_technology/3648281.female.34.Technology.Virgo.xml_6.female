So many things spinning in my head today that I can't seem to get a grip on any of them to verbalize it.   I cried last night. Sometimes it helps to cry. My best friend is still moving away. I may cry everyday until he is gone.  I have to send myself emails to remind me of things. Like "send your dad his father's day card". I can't remember a damn thing anymore.  The world is vampire....
