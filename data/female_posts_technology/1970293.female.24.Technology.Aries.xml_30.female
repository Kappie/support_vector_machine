She raised her arms toward the heavens and closed her hazel eyes to recite a spell.    "Brigit, lend your power, At this noon day hour, To protect my abode, From the things I loathe, Change their minds, To give them time, To change their ways, Heed what I say."  Repeating her spell three times, concentration marring her forehead.  Her dark hair whipped faster as the storm moved closer.  Lightning flashed illuminating the features of the house and thunder shook the tower.  Her slender form buffeted by the wind as the litany grew ever louder into a crescendo.  Just as suddenly as it started, it was over.  Her shoulders slumped as she slowly opened her eyes, blinking away the rain.  Glancing down at the ground, moving her eyes slowly towards the town located seven miles away.  Weary, she moved slowly to the stairs and made her way down to the door that led into the attic of the house.  She hoped that would keep her and her family safe for a little while until she can find a better way to do it.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
