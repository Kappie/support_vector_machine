Its amazing to me how I could love someone and feel as loved as I do right now.  He is the most awesomest (is that a word) person that I know.  He always ask me why I love him,  that is the hardest answer to give.. its not one thing in general...its a lot of littlle and not so little reasons why.  But I have to say its his intelligence that attracts me the most.  He has got to be the geekiest ;-)  smartest man I know....makes me wet just thinking about him.  Well He is at work today and I am going to go get the baby from grandmas.   We had the last 2 nights to ourselves..(you would think I would be drained ;-)   , but I just want to start all over again, making love to him).  We use to stay in bed ALL day long never getting out. but I had to go to work ;-(       Well...I just feel like my heart is going to explode with all of this feeling.    I just had to share it .  LOVE IS GRAND!!!!!!!!!!   Oh....and for those who love movies...we went out last night to the movies and seen Bad Boys 2.   IT is the most funniest movie  I had watched in a LONG time!!  333 to everyone!!
