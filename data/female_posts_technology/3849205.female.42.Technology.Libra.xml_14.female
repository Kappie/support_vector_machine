I have made some decisions about this weight loss issue...I am not going to buy anymore weight loss items...that means no more diet pop, no more low carb stuff, no more anything that has aspertame or splenda in it.  I am going to eat low carb, which means meat and lots of salads but no special foods...I really feel that it is detrimental to losing weight.   It is so hot here today and will be the next few days...I dont even feel like eating. Lots of water...I feel so motivated.  I have to get in and get some pics taken so I will have 170 lb pics.  Then I can look forward to the 160 pics and then 150 and then 140 and then 130.
