Today..someone who knows about me...and I dont know.. sent me a message that my husband wasnt happy with me.  Says that I do not make him happy in bed.  (that cut me like a knife..says he is bored with me already).  Told me that he is not happy with the way I keep our home.  I have to admit on this one..I am not happy with that either.  I have been talking to a Dr. explaining to him that I seem to not be able to get anything finished.  He took some blood work, but asked me about the things I have been worried about (I had a huge list) and he said his wife got like that.. we are still waiting on the test results, but he told me to take a breather and relax and stop worrying.(did I say with relaxation and some understanding his wife is better)  Well I am about in tears again and I hate when I do that at work.  See here is where the lie is... I thought my husband was happy with me. So I went along all happily thinking some of my life may suck but I have this husband I thought he understood that its not that I dont care... I care alot... I hate the way  things are kept.  Now what do I do?  Here I am saving up for things to make his office look great.  I have not been eating lunch so I could save money to do this...Now dont I feel stupid.  Cause this person even told me he was upset cause I never finished his office...but I was just waiting on getting pics of the kids and from our wedding and wanting to order the posters and things....Why cant I do anything correct...why cant I make anyone happy??
