I've done alot around the house, mowed the lawn, cleaning the front hall of the house, resealed around the bathtub, and just clean the apartment.  Tomorrow I'm going to go look for material for new curtains in the kitchen then I'm going to repaint it...only it's going to be the same color..lime green with white trim!  It's weird to be actually sitting in my home office/guest room for the first time since I moved in....(chris made me clean out the junk) but at least we now have more room.  I can't wait for chris to be totally moved in, our big step towards our future.
