Also, in ElleGirl she stated that she likes to roll her hair and use her grandma's perfume. We arrived during Beth Waters' set, and everyone was politely seated at the tables set up. There were candles on the tables and Beth Waters was crooning some angelic song about babies or geese or heaven or something. It was the most annoying vanilla atmosphere I'd ever been in and I wanted to retch at every table and snuff out their candles. We looked around and everyone had flat hair and flaccid clothes. It was an invasion of khaki, denim, and understated stud earrings... BORRING! We were on an alien planet where a bongo drum was part of the drumkit. I turned to Abby and apologized profusely for bringing her to a show that had a bongo drum. And Beth Waters didn't help either. She was the epitome of serene vanilla-tude. She doesn't like to fuck, she wants to make vanilla love and make vanilla babies. Beth Waters sounded like the object of sex is to experience the joys of impregnation, gestation, and the female wonder of childbirth. Woman wanted to have babies and be Earth Mother! Unfortunately, her awful bowlcut may discourage potential hetero suitors.    Abby and I shuddered at the awesome lameness of our surroundings and the dull people who'd remark on the awesome bongoing of the bongo drum.  But when Nellie came on, she saved us. We stayed for her whole set because she is spiffy, sarcastic, irreverent, boldly political and entertaining as all hell. And she IS a cross between Doris Day and Eminem. She'll sing a sultry torch song in a rich jazzy voice, but her lyrics will be clever and modern, like, "Give me head/ Or you're dead." Her piano playing is stuff of recital legend, and yes, she had big poufy rolled hair and a vintage-y ensemble. So so charming. She's a clever and talented young lady and despite the gut-wrenchingly disappointing ordinariness of the sterile audience, I had a great time.   Here's a great Nellie quote from a  urlLink fansite :    "I think it's such a shame when people are taken surprise by fame. I think they should just quit then, and leave the playing field open for me. Because I really want it."    Doppelganger Alert :    =   ?
