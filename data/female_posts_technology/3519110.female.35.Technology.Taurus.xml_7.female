As I walked out of my office for the last time, I was a little sad- I had wanted that job soooo badly. And really, I was quite happy there. I wasn't doing as well as I wanted, however I had a great boss who was willing to work on any issues that were identified. I enjoyed it- but the call of motherhood was way too strong. To look at AJ in someone else's arms while he was falling asleep was way too much for me to handle. So, I gave up the great job, great social interaction and MONEY. What a shock- I have worked so hard for so long to get exactly the right working situation that I could retain while raising our child and I just tossed it out the door. Kind of ironic.
