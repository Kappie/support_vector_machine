I would have preferred to buy from something a bit more local than Kay Jewelers (Of the stupid "Every kiss begins with Kay" commercials.), but plain gold bands cost about the same everywhere, it seems, so we might as well buy at a sale. Buck chose a  plain gold band, and I picked one with milgrained edges. We are such exciting people. *grin*  In other wedding shopping news, I'm about to buy a dress. I'm going for the Jordan dress I mentioned a while back. Apparently, if it is in stock in my size, it can be here in about two weeks. If they actually have to make a new one for me, I'll have to pay a small rush fee ($20 or so) to get it in about a month. The shop said to call them today after 3:00 and  they'll let me know what is in stock.
