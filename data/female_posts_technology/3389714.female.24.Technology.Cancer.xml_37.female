I refuse to stick my finger in my mouth and yank it out.. that’s kinda gross and knowing me I’ll make gagging sounds that resemble the mating call of a duckbill platypus… I’m totally frustrated not only at the annoying piece of bagel but also at the fact that ma office is below freaking 50 degrees… it’s so cold in here that I’ve lost my sense of control and my brain is not communicating with my bladder properly.. I constantly feel like I have to pee.. and I get a tingly sensation every so often in my index finer and pinky of ma right hand… and I think my eye lids are shivering…ahhh I need help…does anyone have remedies for my dilemmas??? If you have some insight please leave a comment…
