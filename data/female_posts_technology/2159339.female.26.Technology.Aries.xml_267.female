To those who don't know the thrilling glory of H, imagine Old Navy's prices, but better-looking clothes. The clothes are cut better and involve more details. Nothing is frumpy and everything is cute and smart. It's like Forever 21's older sibling who's dispensed the ho-clothes and gone  with better sizes and sturdier material but stays true to how fun fashion can be. Last year when Green Marble and I went to Europe we went to an H in all three cities we visited. And there was different stock in each one! I eagerly anticipate its long-awaited arrival. There were rumors of an SF H in 2001, but now it's finally true!  In other H news, Karl Lagerfeld will be  urlLink designing  a line for the retailer that will debut this November. I'm skeptical of big names designing for cheap brands because the Isaac Mizrahi line featured at Target is abominable. The inaugural season was filled with ugly oversized sweaters that were hideously clownish in their sherbet-like palette and the second current season filled with "classic" pieces is just plain boring. Now I admit I ordered a pair of his red pointy flats last year, but that was the only item I liked. I really tried to like his stuff but just couldn't. And how is it that the only thing I like of his I had to find online?   Thanks to field reporters Abby and Green Marble.
