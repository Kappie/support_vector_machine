I seamed the beige hat (and even though it's a bit too big, it's still pretty cute), I finished knitting the kitty bed, and I worked on the beaded scarf. Holy crap, that fine yarn is driving me absolutely crazy. This is going to be a slow project.  Today I *really* need to organize my stash. It's just all thrown together in bins, no rhyme or reason.
