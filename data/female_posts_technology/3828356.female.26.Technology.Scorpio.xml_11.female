I had the opportunity of interacting with a gentleman, who had an unfortunate thing happen to him.  This poor lad had been beaten with a baseball bat in a certain area of his anatomy.  Yes, his nuts were beaten to a pulp.  In fact, it was so bad, that this person will most likely have to have surgery, and they will most likely have to remove the injured testicle.   Where's the humanity in this?  I, personally, do not have testicles.  However, I am presuming that they are quite sensitive.  In fact, I KNOW that they are.  You should see the look of agony that crosses my husband's face when one of our cats decides to step on his!  He tends to lurch up and groan, with a look of pain washing over his face.  And then he promptly picks the cat up and places it on the floor.   What's the moral of this story?  Well,  I suppose, if at all possible, protect those little gems, and if you have cats, sit on your couch with a phonebook over your lap. And if you play baseball, keep the bat ABOVE your waist.   That's my pontification for today.  -J.
