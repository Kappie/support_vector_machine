My family moved to a suburb of Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1967.After living in the same house for many ofmy 39 years, I am now here to stay (I think.)My parents passed away, and I was left with our house.    I bet you're thinking, who cares! I just want to know about the title of this blog. I will get into it more over the upcoming days  weeks. For now, I will say that yes, I have OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder.) I was born in 1965, making me a part of generationX (those born between the early 60's  the mid 70's.)And lastly, I am a VERY proud liberal. I am making it my mission to reclaim the word "liberal." Over the last several years, the Republicans have tried to turn being a liberal into being a bad thing.    Here is the definition of liberal from Dictionary.com:    a. Not limited to or by established, traditional, orthodox, or authoritarian attitudes, views, or dogmas; free from bigotry.  b. Favoring proposals for reform, open to new ideas for progress, and tolerant of the ideas and behavior of others; broad-minded.      Now, can someone tell me what's wrong with beingtolerant,broad-minded,  free from bigotry? Ok, I will say this, Iam intolerant of some people...for instance, the ignorant, the unintelligent, and the close-minded among us.        I don't want my blog entries to be too long, so I will close for now.   Have a wonderful Friday, and I'll "talk" with you again soon.        Sincerely, Lizzy
