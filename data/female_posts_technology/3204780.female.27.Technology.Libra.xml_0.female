I’ve never brought it up before because one is usually taught that sexual abuse occurs in the form of a rape or incest where intercourse takes place. Of course there are many variations of sexual abuse that you don’t regularly learn about at that age that don’t have anything to do with intercourse, but in my mind the abuse I received seemed so vague, and at that age confusing, that I was afraid I would be scoffed at if I mentioned it to anyone.        Now I know better and have been outraged for years. Even though I have been left emotionally scarred by what happened I have never able to confront my mom about it. I have always been afraid that she would say I was lying and that none of it ever happened. I was also too disgusted to bring it up.       In the first chapter I brought up the earliest memories I have of this type of abuse. I don’t think the television episode was sexual abuse but I defiantly consider the unveiling of the books to be. The first and only time my mom actually touched me was not long after my Grandmother died.            Up until I was ten or eleven I received my weekly baths on Sunday evening. One night while I had the bath water running and was using the toilet, my mother came screaming into the bathroom holding up the pair of underwear I had just taken off upstairs.      “What is this?”  She held up my panties, which had a dried white discharge on them.       “I don’t know mom!”  I really had no idea.      Both girls and women, at sometime or another, get a clear to whitish discharge. It’s a well-known fact and is quite normal under most circumstances. In fact, most newborn girls have a white discharge, which is normal. Pediatricians advise you not to scrub it clean as it will go away on it’s own. Apparently my mom was left in the dark about this her whole life.       “What have you been doing?”  She put my underwear in front of her face and stared at them some more. She was furious.      “Nothing, mom!”  I was scared and very confused.       My mom kept on yelling at me but I was so shaken that I can’t remember the conversation. She kept waving my panties in the air telling me how disgusting I was. I tried my best to tune her out and then, as if transported to a completely different conversation, I heard, “… and someday some guy is going to stick his finger up you like this…” While saying that she wrapped my dirty underwear around her index finger and shoved it into my vagina. I was ten years old and thoroughly terrified. I felt no pain; I remember going completely numb right before she did that and I had no idea it was coming. She kept talking for a minute or two but I have no idea what she said. This is one of the main reasons I have always hated her so much. I was so naive, weak, stupid and confused back then that that excuse of a woman actually got me to say, “I’m sorry,” over and over while she was doing that horrible thing to me!  Now that I look back she must have thought that discharge meant I was masturbating or something. At that age I didn’t even know how to masturbate. She was either unusually ignorant or just plain sick. That wasn’t the last time my naiveté would lead me down a rotten path       Sometimes when I was little I would become lonely at night and ask my mom if I could sleep with her. One of the last times I did this was right as I was starting to read. While upstairs I yelled down and asked her if I could sleep in her bed. She agreed. When I got into bed my mom was laying on her side facing away from me reading a book. As I often did I sat up for the first couple minutes hoping she would say anything to me. When I looked over she was reading a dark blue and black book that I had never seen before. I tried to read the spine of the book but was having a difficult time with the words. I sounded one out and asked, “What does… kinky mean?”      “It means something weird. Now go to sleep. You shouldn’t be reading over my shoulder anyway.”  I thought, “Okay, kinky means weird,” and went to sleep thinking nothing more of it. It wasn’t until I was much older and had a flashback at school that I understood what happened that evening. When I went home I took a deep breath and went into The Closet and dug through all the filth until I finally found what I was looking for. The book was the same color as the one I remembered seeing and on the cover it had a pencil drawing of a naked lady and the title said something like, “Kinky Stories”. I flipped through real quick and saw stories with sexual illustrations to go with them. This is the book that I eventually burned in the sink.       As the years passed I learned that my mom kept vibrators along with the TV listings in the side pouch of her recliner in the living room. She apparently had one in her bedroom too because I would often hear a vibrating noise coming from her bedroom while I was using the only bathroom in the house which was right next to her. One night I was using the toilet right before bedtime and I heard the unmistakable sound of one of her loud vibrators. To my surprise the vibrating stopped and she asked, “Do you want to sleep with me tonight?”  She would ask me this sometimes when I was much younger. I was appalled and in a disgusted tone of voice I said, “No!” I waited for her to yell at me but the vibrator started right back up again. That was one of those instances I just tuned out of my head for years. I didn’t want to think about it.        One morning after I stepped out of the shower I heard that noise once again and was a little disgusted. For God sakes I heard boys at school joke about stuff like that for years, not to mention the fact that vibrators back then were much louder than the ones today and hers sounded like a jackhammer. She must have known that I could hear her. Just in case she didn’t I was going to make sure she knew I knew. “Are you okay in there?  I hear a weird noise.”  The buzzing stopped and she said in a normal voice, “No I’m fine. Thanks for asking though.”  After a second or two it started going off again.       Now that I’m older I understand that vibrators are a perfectly okay to own and use. It’s not a big deal at all, as long as you don’t go out of your way to let a small child know you use one. To some this may not seem like sexual abuse but to me it was because I was so young when all this happened.        Despite the fact that I had to continually put up everything at home I was still naive when it came to classmates and my knowledge of sexual slang. Sometimes a kid would make fun of me because I didn’t know this word or that term. I didn’t care because I didn’t want to know more than I already knew. I hadn’t even started my period yet let alone know much more than the basics about sex. I was so young that one time I heard two women on television complaining about their periods. I walked away completely confused. All I could picture was a period bouncing up and down at the end of a sentence. Boy was I wrong.       I was about twelve when I first started my period. It was in the middle of winter and I was on a camping trip for the weekend with my Girl Scout troop. When I got home I told my mom about it and she went out to buy me some pads. My mom had a small stash of tampons in a makeup bag behind the toilet but she never used them, she only used pads. Once I asked her why she didn’t use them and she said, “They just don’t fit me. I had a baby you know.”  Once again this didn’t make sense because I knew she had a cesarean section when she had me. What the hell was she talking about?  I knew the difference between a regular birth and a cesarean because my mom told me about it when I saw her scar once. I was so tired of her lies and bullshit.        Somehow I had learned what tampons were used for but I had absolutely no idea how to use them. I would occasionally play with one and rip the cotton part out of the tube. I had no idea that it would come out of the tube if you pushed it. I started unfolding the cotton thinking I was finally getting somewhere. When I unraveled to where it was shaped like a rectangle I was more confused than ever.        A few cycles later I gave up with the pads. They were smelly and embarrassing. After my mom bought me my very first pack she never told me how to use them properly. I had to look at the picture on the package of the figure sticking it onto her panties the first time I wore one. I also seriously had no idea that you had to change them as the day went by. My mom was so big that she used the nighttime ones that were like a foot and a half long and two inches thick. Those were the same ones she bought for me at twelve. I also didn’t know you were supposed to carry a bunch with you throughout the day until the third month I was on the rag when I overflowed and asked one of my female teachers for one.       I knew that my best friend Kari used tampons and had her teach me how to use one. She used her fist as an example and I felt so stupid. She laughed and said, “Don’t worry, I didn’t know either when I first started. Someone had to teach me like this too. This surprised me because she was so close to her mom. The first few times I wore one really hurt but I knew I had to start using them for sanitary reasons. She let me borrow a bunch of hers whenever I needed to.        My mom flat out refused to buy me tampons. She said, “You know you can lose your virginity if you put one in!”      “You can?”  I knew you couldn’t. I had learned this from school.       What was about to come next completely epitomizes what my mom was like when it came to her perversion. Keep in mind that what I’m about to say happened not long after I called her out in the bathroom that one morning about using her vibrator while I was right there in the next room.      “Sure you can. We never had our talk about the birds and the bees, have we?”    I flashed back to the time she told me someday a guy would stick his finger up my “pussy” and proceeded to demonstrate on me. “Uh, no I guess not,” here we go, I thought.      “Well,” My mom started walking forward out of the bathroom and towards the kitchen with a nervously smug look on her face. “A man takes his dick… uh I mean penis, and sticks it into a woman’s pussy… oops, vagina and that’s called fucking…”       All the while she wasn’t really looking at me in the face. She was looking up and off to her left with a half dreamy, half thinking-hard look on her face. I couldn’t take it anymore, “You know what?  That’s okay, I think I heard about it at school already,” and walked away. She never brought up the subject again and neither had I until now. I should have mentioned this to a counselor a long time ago but I was too grossed out to bring it up to a stranger. This and the finger incident bother me to this day. I want a lobotomy.
