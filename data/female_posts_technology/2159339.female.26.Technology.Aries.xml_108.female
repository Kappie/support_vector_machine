She was in her early 40's and had just purchased a house in Hawaii with Jeff, which she excitedly described to me last time I saw her, about two months ago. K called this morning and told me this and since then neither one of us have been able to concentrate on work. The funeral is probably in the next few days, but we will try to go there tomorrow afternoon. Sadly, we knew this might happen sooner or later. She was down to 67 pounds. Kaiser didn't admit her because 'admittable' weight is 60 pounds. Even for a five foot woman. How absurd and ridiculous. Wendy was a culmination of all that is good and just and sincere and her death is shocking as it is heartbreaking. It's just fucking weird and unfair and so so tragic and it puts everything else in perspective. I can't imagine going there and not seeing her.
