BUT ya know..i have learned one thing in life...I will always be ok... so I say its not going to be anything..(positive thinking) ...but I hope they take it off..cause i hate the way it looks.  :-)    Just dyed my hair again..I love it this time... Cant wait for hair to grow longer........   I want some excerise equipment... wanna keep my self in shape. GEE  this is all about me...  I dont normally do that....   But now that I am on that subject...i have been pondering lately.... I listen to the people here at work talk.... men as well as women... and everything they say is "ME ME ME"  and when I ask well what does your wife think or what about your husband...i get this look like I am nuts... one person even responded....  who cares..what he thinks... Maybe it is just me...but I always try to think about what the other person wants/needs/or how they feel.   am I wrong for thinking this??  I think not!  but maybe so.... like I said...just pondering............
