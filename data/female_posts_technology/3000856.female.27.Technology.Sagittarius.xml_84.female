I am tired we have to go to my sister April's tonight, we are also getting pictures and going horse back riding tomorrow and she leaves Thurs. I am upset about that. Who knows when I will see her again. It may be another 18 years. Geeze I hope not! I am already pretty much packed for Boston. Looking at my suitcase you would think I am moving there. I just don't know exactly what is going on the whole time I am there so I need to be prepared! I get my retainer in a few weeks. Oh boy at least it can be removed when I need to. Back to my boring day at work. Laterz :op
