Last night I was up at 3am for a filled filesystem that wouldn't go away, and have mostly been awake since then.  Or at least, interrupted enough to make it feel like I did not sleep at all.  Not much is happening here except work.  The pool is still nice, especially after we shocked it and got some chlorine going.  No more algae at the bottom, which is helpful.  Tons of bugs, but no algae.  We're thinking about taking a quick trip up to Las Vegas for the heck of it.  I need to check into ticket prices and hotel prices.  I got a deal postcard for Bally's and Paris but the weekends are not ones in which we can go up there.  We would only be able to go the weekend of 7/30-8/2 or the weekend of 8/20-8/22.  All other weekends have something happening that prevent us from going until October.  Jessica
