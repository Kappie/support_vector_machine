Broke down and bought the pattern for Rogue. Those cables are so beautiful...and scary.  Balled all the yarn for Charlotte. (Koigu is gorgeous.) I'll start her this weekend.  I think I'm going to put the beaded scarf on hold until cooler weather. I just can't get motivated to work on it.  Hmm, what's next?
