She turned her head for a quick glance behind when her foot suddenly turned and slipped causing her to tumble four feet.   She slowly checked her feet and legs to make sure they weren't broke before standing.  The moment she put her weight upon her foot, she felt a sharp pain arching through her body.  She whimpered quietly as she hobbled across the rock she fell on.  It was a good thing it caught her as she looked down.  Another twenty feet until she would have hit the ground and more than her foot would have hurt mostly she would be unconscious or dead.    She glanced back the way she came again.  She could hear men calling and running above her.  She looked around quickly for a niche or a cave for her to hide.  Ayslynn rubbed her face pushing her long red hair behind her ears as her eyes lighted upon a cave hidden by outcropping rocks.  She slowly hobbled over the rocks to view the cave more closely.  It was very large by the look of the entrance.  She only hoped nothing moved in with claws and big teeth.  Carefully she wiggled her body around the outcropping rock to hop down a few feet to the ground below.  She took one more glance around before stepping into the darkness.
