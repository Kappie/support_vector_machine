We are selling our mobile/wireless platform, our partners are selling their scheduling optimization software.  The salesguy from our partner company believes that one product has no value without the other. To illustrate it he used the following analogy, which I found hilarious:   - "I bought a great car!"  - "Really, which car?"  - "It's a cadilac! It's great, it's got leather seats, a really good sound system, great A/C.. The best!"  - "But you didn't buy any wheels!"  - "Who needs wheels? It's a  CAR ! Check out the sounds system! It's The best of it's kind! See the A/C? How cold the air is? I can just sit here and listen to my tunes, and chill out...it's all top of the line"  - "But you can't drive anywhere!?"  - "So what, it's the best car out there!"
