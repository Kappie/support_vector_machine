Yesterday started out with my son, Riley and his grandpa calling to see if we'd like to come over to pick peas from his garden. Brittany, my daughter, agreed to come with and help so on our way we went to Granpa Everetts' to pick peas.  Meanwhile, a van pulled up in the yard and this was Everett's son, Dale, and his three girls, Heidi, Holly and Ellie Mae. There Mom went to a reunion for the weekend. We enjoyed visiting and then Martha, the grandma, got off work and was home. Everett decided to take us all to Lengby, Minnesota for supper. They served walleye, chicken strips, and chicken drummies with a salad. The kids were pretty good and there was music. Ellie Mae started dancing. She is two years old and they're so cute at that age.  Shortly, after eating,we went to Everetts' where my daughter, Brittany wanted to spend the night. Riley and I went back to our house.  Today, we slept in some and took a bath and he couldn't wait to get back to grandpa's house to play with the girls. They live in Wahpeton so he doesn't get to see them often. Heidi is six years old and Holly is four years old. Ellie Mae, as I mentioned earlier, turned two years old in May.Riley also turned three years old in May and my daughter, Brittany is eleven years old.  While we were out there, I worked on essays I had for class to finish up. Grandpa made Brats on the grill and they were really good. He and Martha went to visit friends who were up here from texas so we decided to go fishing out on the pontoon at pine lake. The kids were all excited. Earlier, they were playing with kittens out on the farm and forgot all about them when pine lake and fishing were mentioned.  Dean and Dale went to get gas for the pontoon. I applied sunscreen to all the kids while waiting for them to return. They bought drinks for the kids and us also. We had three fishing lines going and Heidi caught a sixteen inch walleye that weighed a little over two pounds. We had lots of fun. My daughter enjoyed herself and even got the chance to drive the boat. So did one of Dale's girls, Holly, the four year old.  It turned out to be a beautiful day out on the lake with a fresh breeze just enough blow to hit for the cooling one needed from the sun beating down on us. It felt good. It was nice and relaxing. The kids behaved well for five of them on the pontoon. Roger owned the pontoon and helped get minnows on the hooks for the kids. There also was another couple along and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Riley caught a fish that got away before we got it in the pontoon. Heidi, the six year old, caught a northern that got away also. Scott, another guy, caught a fish that he threw back because he didn't feel like cleaning fish. Dale caught a ting northern, just a baby one that he threw back so the only one who caught something to keep was Heidi. She was very proud but unhappy when roger filleted her fish because she wanted her mom to see it. Good thing I had a camera in my purse since this is the first fish she has caught and has proof to show her fish to her mother.  We went to the lodge to see if grandpa and grandma were there and they were. Riley was getting tired and spilled M's on the floor so I decided to go home with him. He fell asleep about eight thirty. He looked pretty tired.  I decided to get my ceiling in the livingroom painted. I just had white ceiling paint. It still looks like it will need another coat. Since I was painting,I decided to do the walls in Dover White. They also need another coat of paint but at least now the walls are all the same color. What a job it can be. I'm not one for painting so I'll be glad when it is done. I feel there is a lot I accomplished today.   It is now after midnight and I hope to get a good nights' sleep in. I did relax with pop and popcorn for a few minutes when I wrapped up the painting stuff like the brushes and putting the lids back on the paint so I can start again tomorrow.  Brittany stayed the night again at Everetts' with the girls so when I get up, I'll go pick her up or call and see what time Dale is going back to Wahpeton. I just love good days like this with a memory created for the girls in the fun they had and my son, Riley. He was plumb, tuckered out from a fun-filled day. I hope there's more to come of days like this. The perfect day is what I'd call it.
