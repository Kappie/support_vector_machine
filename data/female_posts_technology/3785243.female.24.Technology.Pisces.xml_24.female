I'm just about done with finals for the summer semester!  Saw a beautiful Italian movie this week,  urlLink  Il Postino  .  It was pleasantly bittersweet, and the landscape of rural Italy was breathtaking.  The lead actor, Massimo Troisi, literally gave his life to make the movie, as he passed away 12 hours from severe heart disease after all the shooting was done.  He knew he needed treatment for his heart, but refused to go to the hospital, as he felt the movie was more important.    --  Aeryth
