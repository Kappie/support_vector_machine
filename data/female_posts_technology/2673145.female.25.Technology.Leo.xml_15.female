Then again, I wouldn't complain if I'm out with enjoyable companies.   I was having a YM (yahoo messenger) chat with one of the managers at work. (Not my manager, but he's really friendly) He started asking if I go out drinking and stuff. I said not much and no kaki (friends). We agreed that we need people of the same interest to have 'fun'. I thought it's hard to find people who shares the same interest but he thinks that you'll meet them when you go to the right places. Now, where is that right place? Pub for fellow alcoholics? Cinema theatre for movie buffs? Opera house for theatrical enthusiasts? Maybe he's right but I'm not that friendly to go up and get to know strangers.   During one of the chit chat sessions with 2 of my cubicle-neighbours, they started saying, "Why don't you recommend friends to her?" "Why don't you join SDU and take part in their activities?" Is this a sign? Or is it just the bio-clock? Looking around my company, I'm probably the ONLY SINGLE girl. -_-|||  Alright, enough of blabbling on a bored Friday night.. *yawn*
