I think the most gratifying thing so far in switching from IT to doing this type of therapy is helping people with fibromyalgia. I have one patient who was in so much pain she was popping 4-5 Tylenol 8 hour pills each day. She came to me in tears because her mom suffered horribly before she died, and this woman didn't want to suffer the same way.  Probably one of the most devastating aspects about fibromyalgia is the fact that fibro sufferers often can't sleep, probably because of the pain. Same with this woman, she couldn't sleep, she had restless legs, etc. She would toss and turn all night. That's a real dilemma because sleep helps soft tissue to heal, so the situation quickly devolves into a vicious spiral.  Since I've worked on this woman, her pain has gone from unbearable to between good and uncomfortable. Instead of 4-5 pills a day, she now takes one when she has a flare up and feels she needs the relief. And there are a number of days now when she says "I slept like a log last night!"  I admit, I loved IT but the days I run into situations as gratifying as the one above, I am so grateful I closed my eyes, and took a leap of faith off that cliff back in 2003.
