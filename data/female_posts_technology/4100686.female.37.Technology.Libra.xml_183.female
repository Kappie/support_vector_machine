His blogs URL  is now used by an unrelated site. Thanks  urlLink Fayrouz  for that update.  Meanwhile Sarmad at  urlLink Road of a Nation  has set up a  urlLink forum.  Mission statement;    This site encourages direct communication between Iraqi and American citizens by attempting to bypass media, religious, and political bias. You MUST register (free) to post - after you can set your profile language to English, Kurdish or Arabic.
