You are exactly like your parents;the good AND the bad(Give or take a few traits of course) It's a package deal really....buy one and get it all free.  We hardly need cloning if you leave out the technicalities. You are already a replica of your parents whether you like it or not.Not that that's entirely a bad thing or anything.Infact in most cases it's a good thing.Only point I'm trying to get at are the little things that annoy us,but nevertheless subconciously indulge in ourselves.But maybe it's more nurture than nature  <ponders ;Could it be a case of imitation more than a case of genes?  Anyways there are certain traits that you need to work on regardless of it's origins. Sometimes simply because you know how it feels to be on the recieving end of it.
