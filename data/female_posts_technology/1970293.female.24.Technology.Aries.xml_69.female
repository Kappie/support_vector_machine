"But I am almost finished.  Why must I always interrupt myself just to eat dinner?  All they are going to do is ask questions, not really listen to the answers and eat."  She placed her bookmark in the book and gently placed it down on the stand beside her.  She gracefully stood up and slid her feet in her shoes.  She ran a brush through her hair.  "Do I look presentable enough for dinner, Thor."  "Yes, you look fine.  I am sure your parents will remark on your presentable looks."  Thor said as he glided out the door leading the way to the dining room.  Shari grumbled.  It truely wasn't right that a robot had a sense of humor.  But he was her protector, teacher, and when the case calls for it, her friend.  The name of course was picked as a joke.  In ancient times, Thor was a god of Thunder who lived in Asgard.  In the stories he was always portrayed as a mighty warrior.  So Thor the robot from waist up to head looked like a mighty warrior with muscular arms and chest.    She followed him into the dining room and sat down across from her brother, the brat.  Her mother and father already seated with frowns on their faces.  She sighed.
