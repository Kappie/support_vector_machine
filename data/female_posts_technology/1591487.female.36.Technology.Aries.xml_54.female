Although thinking about it, in theory a fantastic concept, if all the girls borrowing the bags are anything like me, I don't think I'd be too thrilled receiving my borrowed Prada with bits of tissue, a sticky Kool Mint and about $7.25 in loose change stuck in the bottom.  I don't know about you, but my bed-time ritual is getting out of hand.  Honestly, these days I'm having to plan what time I actually want to go to sleep, because the bed-time ritual has suddenly become a bit like a steeplechase.  Without wanting to bore you with the details, there's just seems to be an inordinant amount of cleansing, flossing, eye-makeup removal, hot water bottle filling, teeth brushing etc etc (well, that's pretty much it), and it seems to take fucking ages.  I swear, I'm lucky that I'm asleep by midnight, having decided to go to bed at about 9pm.  Why can't I just be like Courtney Love and fall flat on my face onto the bed in my slutty clothes and smeared mascara?  I'd save a heck of a lot of time.  Today I played Cluedo for the first time in my life.   I don't know what you think about it,  but that game is seriously whacked.   At one point my sister said 'do you think it's appropriate we're playing this game with a six year old?' when we had to explain to my niece what each of the weapons were and what the actual concept of the game was?  Fortunately, she was not conceptualising the premise of the game in terms of the notion of murder and suspects and weapons, as one at one point, after throwing the dice her 'Suggestion' (as opposed to 'Accusation'- I also didn't realise it was a game of fucking semantics) was 'Professor Plum in the kitchen eating vegetables with a knife'.  We then played Uno where I learned a few home truths about members of my family in regards to their incredible lack of sportsmanship and shameless ability to cheat.
