For those of you who haven't discovered it yet, DC and I started a  urlLink Coffee Break  site, which we can all use to exercise our creative skills.  If you want to join let us know and we can make you a member.  Then you can add to our ongoing story.  Or, just visit on occasion and read our story in progress.  You'll have to read from the bottom up though, there is no way to reverse the ordering of the posts.  Sorry, we tried.  Also, no GEMs update this week, we didn't have a meeting last night.
