I was, and suceeded in such until a girl on the other team was injured.  She probably needed stitches.  The other team wanted to continue to play, and lets just say that they were out for blood, I suppose to replace her own. Needless to say we lost.  I was very irritated by the entire game, I was not in the mood to continue after the girl had been injured, and was definitely not ready to meet the players in such an aggresive mood.  We do play in a competitive league... but it still is supposed to be flag football.
