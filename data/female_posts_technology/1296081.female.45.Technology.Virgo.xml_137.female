Found out the son snuck out of the house to meet up with the girlfriend in the wee hours last night.  He's in so much trouble he has no idea.  I will ground his sorry ass so hard it will hurt his whole family.  I just hope that the girlfriend doesn't get grounded from prom after we've forked out so much moolah on the event.  If she is -well, bummer - they have no one to blame but themselves.  I am totally pissed at the kids.  I pity the fools.
