It started off with Kevin calling me at ten am to tell me to get the fuck outta bed. Took me a while after my everyday morning anxiety coughs. But I ended up going to sportsworld no problem with him and amanda. Yay for rides and other good times. But like hell was I gettin into a bathing suit. Not till these babies *points to thighs* get toned.   Afterwards I went to work and spent most of the night going crazy cuz the store was dead and unbelievably clean! It was scary. I decided to bring kai some of our home style asian food cuz he never brings food to work lately. He said it wasn't much different from a cambodian dish they eat often.   Amanda and Kev showed up to pick me up after work but amanda got in trouble and headed back home. IT was halarious, Kevin and I sped around in his car the entire night. We drove kai to fairview mall's bus terminal, drove to fast eddies, drove his brother to a friend in preston and then we drove aroudn the mall and back to my house. how fun was that? I'm startin to think that this kid is WAY too much like me but hey, that means he's trying to make the best of life and trying to be a good friend and make peopel smile. It'sall good!   Tomorrow/Today I'll be able to get my hair cut FINALLY and I'll go to karate and then work. After that I'll be in quebec for a few days. Then...clubbing on sunday with amanda and kevin. Can't wait.   Shane should have his internet back up soon and I can't wait for that so I wont have to wonder where the hell he is or have a hard time gettinga hold of him anymore. Can't wait to get my web site going again. This time it'll be professional cuz I'll have sum help making it flashy (literally). I'm hoping to update this one more often and make it look more professional so that I can display my art there as well.  My stomache is still turning. I jsut want to be able to speak face to face one last time. I still haven't forgotten. Nor have i stopped caring.  -Looking up to the sky  The Lonewolf
