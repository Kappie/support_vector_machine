(* All names have been changed because it amuses me.) Todd treated the experience as if he were a live studio audience at his very favorite sitcom of all time. I often imagined I would enjoy being on a show, what with the narcissism and all but now I’m rethinking that. Maybe it’d still be all right with better scripts.  Todd’s favorite episode of the Valerie show was the one where I pluck my eyebrows. This episode was rerun and both times hit number one in the ratings. Me with my nose pressed against the mirror jabbing a sharp piece of metal at my eyes, yeah that’s sitcom gold. His second favorite episode, shown in variations five or six times, was me yelling at the TV. Maybe Todd thought I was talking to him. If “Greenlee you silly bitch” is your name and you know someone named Kendall whose hair needs pulling then yes Todd, I’m talking to you. I didn’t think the shower episodes were worth showing but I was clearly proven wrong when Todd insisted on sitting as close to the closed bathroom door as possible and barking as if an entire herd of mailmen and questionable people with bicycles were invading the house. The episodes Todd did not enjoy: The ones where the laundry room door remained open for more than five seconds and the ones where I would read a book on the porch.  Everything else though, from feeding Mr. Tickles to talking on the phone, Todd feels is box set worthy. On a very special after school episode, audience participation! Is all attention good attention? Todd knows how to do the high five. I find this entertaining in a third grade way. Maybe it’s because I refuse to give the high five to any humans. Or maybe it’s because I never had a pet. Anyway, Todd was all about the high five game for about six minutes. Then he kept it up for another three minutes but with a look of martyred resignation on his face. For another three minutes he was slow to respond, hoping, I imagine, that I would get tired and go away. Next he started pretending he was hard of hearing and that there was something really interesting behind me that I surely wanted to go see about. That went on for five minutes. Finally he pretended there was a pedestrian outside he needed to go bark at, thus ending the very special episode. I’m still convinced all attention is good attention but Todd’s a dog and stuff so he just doesn’t have the attention span to put up with it. I bet if I wanted to do the high five once an hour for the rest of my life he’d be game. Next week! Hear about poor Paris the kittys’ being forced to endure anorexia by the man! Yes, the man is keeping kitty down. Whatever will she do? Tune in to see!
