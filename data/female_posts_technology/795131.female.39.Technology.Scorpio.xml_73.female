Check all my emails, check Adam Ant's site and Marco's site. It's totally stupid we're still paying for AOL when we don't even have a computer at home, but we are, so we can keep the same AOL email account names when we get a new one. Both my kids got glassses last week. My son keeps looking over the top of his or taking them off. He's only 5, he doesn't know what things are supposed to look like. At a department meeting today our big bosses sat in and described some new products our company has developed and will start marketing, and will arrange demos for us. I was thrilled and decided I like us again (for now). I need a new hair cut. Maybe I should get my ears pierced.
