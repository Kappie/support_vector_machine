Another hard one...  Work toward eliminating injustice and oppression in the world.  Give food to the hungry and shelter and clothes to people who need them.  Don't turn away from your family when they need you.  (Basically do what God wants you to do?)  Then your light will shine through you from the inside out (like the previous verses that talked about this) and you'll be healed (spiritually?).  God will protect you, with your faith (there's that word "righteousness" again...) going ahead of you and God coming behind you to protect you and keep you safe.  When you need help, God will answer and will help you.  The learning Bible made this so much harder than it had to be because it kept going into the historical aspects of whatever was going on at the time and taking the verses literally to apply to the history.  It's a lot easier when you just look at the verses as instructions of how to be a better Christian, and promises from God of what he'll do for you if you do what he asks of you.  I guess it wasn't that hard after all.
