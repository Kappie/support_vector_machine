We wrapped our arms around each other tight, happy to be together, at four in the morning.  Watching the sun rise, over the blue lake, touching each other, not a dream, but reality.  You proposed to me and I said yes. The happiest decision  I'll never forget that one first sight.  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
