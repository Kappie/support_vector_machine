Auwwwww, I am sure be very delighted if my future kids serenade to me this song.    'Our Guide is the Quraan' shook me all teary esp. the part that sings,  "Subhanallah walhamdulillah Allahu Akbar"  It simply brings me to the reminiscence of my tawaf around Baitullah, chanting the same line, everytime crossing the line of Multazam, waving at Baitullah and kissing the palm. I am terribly missing the place, and at a verge of exploding 'buckets'.    Note to  urlLink ayu , me still waiting for Wardah Books to email/contact on their new location. Yu hap annie eye-dear?
