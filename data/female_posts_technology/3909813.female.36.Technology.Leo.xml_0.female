You know how conflict works, you basically try to resolve it and the situation is either resolvable or not.  Well, let me just summarize and say that over the last few years, I have had quite a few situations that were NOT resolvable.  I.e., situations in which the other people involved didn't care that they had been hurtful and I decided that I could not live with the treatment and so it ended.   Well, some of the most toxic people from my past showed up at my house today and confronted me, wanted to know why I stayed away (mind you, I have told them over and over), and so I let them have it and told them all of the things I have said before and many more things that I didn't have the guts to say before, well because they were my parents.  Let me just summarize that it was a very very abusive (abusive in every way, verbal, physical, emotional and sexual) as well as manipulative financially and everyone of them was either an alcoholic, chemically dependent or both.  Well, I feel totally free after finally unleashing and saying once again that I chose not to have a "family" with people that have hurt me and continued to hurt me over and over throughout the years, have spent 15 years of counseling trying to get over it all and I finally spilled it all out again.  I feel sooo free, but at the same time, emotionally drained.  Totally emotionally drained.  I feel that I finally have rid myself of some very very toxic garbage from my body, mind and soul.  WOWOWOO
