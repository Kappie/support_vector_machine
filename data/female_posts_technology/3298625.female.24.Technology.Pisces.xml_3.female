Isn't it ironic that right after I talk about my list I actually think I am falling in love, and the person is so not my type. we are going to 'nip this in the bud'. I think he is right in everyway characterwise however there other stuff. maybe it is the idea of a new person, the discovery of a new mind that I find so overwhelming and perhaps thats what I am confusing with love who knows. Please God I know you are reading this, let it not be love. He has a girlfriend, this will be my chant whnever I see him, whenever we are together, or anything along those lines I will chant that he has a girlfriend over and over so my wandering mind wil not have the opportunity to wander.:) ohh he suprised me today when he remebered that he got me(inside joke) anyways I simply remembered that he got couldn't remember how and he remebered everything. and now for the reality check,.. he has a great memory there is no hidden meaning it is all in your head. that was when I actually noticed him like seriously when he remembered that. SHIT. and then he said he would play if I did, darn it I am in deep shit. I gotta find me a man. any single nice guys out there hear my call and answer.    I don't think he will fit in with my friends, plus we have very different styles of watching movies. He does so in silence, I kinda do but I express myself. okay lets talk about somethng else the more we talk about this guy the more I am going to fall in infatuation with him.   oh well 1 week without seeing him should do it (the logic behind being, out of sight out of mind) hope this stuff works. and when I do see him it will be for short occurances. 10 min tops no chance to impress me with his oh so brilliant mind.   See you in a week, hopefully completely over this guy.:)
