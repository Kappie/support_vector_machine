I was a little nervous because I hadn't cried about it yet but didn't want to do it in public. We brought cookies as way to break the ice. The assistant ladies told us of Wendy's last months there, how she could no longer drive herself to work, how she needed help getting up, how she would take naps/pass out in dental chairs. E got choked up while trying to tell another story and couldn't finish it. Every few minutes K  I looked at each other for moral support. Dr. Bossman came in and invited us to a memorial luncheon next week.
