I am now happily plugging along on the web when I encounter a new voice.   ernie halter.  he's good.   AND he's white...although until I saw a picture I was CONVINCED that he had some flava to savaahh...  Now I normally don't ever expect to find good stuff on daretosing.com...heck even I know that my Bathroom voice should never be heard outside the shower. Nevertheless he has a real talent and musicanship that anyone could appreciate. I gotta give my props since I ducked out of the singing gig and am now exclusively maligned to the Birthday singing and Windows-UP car singing.  so now That I've sufficently plugged...one last one...go to urlLink  erniehalter.com  and download some songs...  that and   I got a new tooooyyyy/bright and shiiinnnnyy new toooyyy and I'm gonna play it till myyyy batteries diiiiieeeee!  *skips away frantically * - aren't YOU Jealous of my new iPod?!?!? Ain't it sexy?!?!?!
