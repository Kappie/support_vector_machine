She is convinced that she will die this week, possibly today, and there's nothing I can do or say to make her think otherwise. This is not unusual, so I stay quiet and let her talk. Every once in a while I tell her to calm the eff down. For fifteen minutes, she cries on the phone to me about wanting to jump off her 13th floor balcony if death doesn't come naturally and soon. Then she composes her voice for long enough to ask if I got her that eyebrow pencil I promised. Then she goes back to sobbing. Very dramatic, my grannie.   Other than G, the only other person who has spent enough time with my crazy family to understand the mess is cam, who happens to be in town this week. Last night over sushi, I tell him the whole story while his 3-year-old stepkid and M eat quietly, ignored by us. I tell him about how for the first time since Japan, I feel removed from the situation and refuse to get involved. Because they have too much of their own crap to worry about to bug me about school or boys or taking vitamins or getting exercise and 8 hours of sleep. He tells me to enjoy it while it lasts.
