It is not as good as Vol.1 but I still enjoy the martial arts, humour, dramatic effects and the story telling. I must say, Quentin Tarantino is really not that bad. (hahaa althou ugly).   The audiences disturb me. They laugh when it's not funny. Just because the movie present the show in a dramatic, oldies-chinese-martial-art-movie way? So what if the high priest can stand on sword? Qing-gong does exist! They just can't appreciate the way the director intend to shoot the movie. It kills my mood, when I'm enjoying the dramatic effects and martial arts. I guess they just can't associate that kind of "chi-na-wu-shu-pugilistic" mannerism with the american ang moh.  I can already tell Vol. 3 is going to suck.
