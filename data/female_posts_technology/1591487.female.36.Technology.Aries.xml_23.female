Although I was informed the other day that 'confession' isn't called that anymore, it's called 'reconciliation'. I didn't know that! I feel quite guilty about it actually, not keeping up with the changes in the church, so to speak. Well, there seems to be so few of them, so who can blame me?  I guess it's easy to go on and on about work, when really I should be grateful I have a relatively well-paid job, it can get stressful, but not so much that it infringes on other areas of my life, I don't need to work late, or have horrible managers who harass me about things.   On the whole, I'm fortunate, and outside of my current work area there are good people I deal with. However, (and there is always a however), it's the insidious little cultural things that annoy me the most.  So basically,yeah, today, I am going to go on about work - but just for a little bit.  For example the undercurrent of misogyny I feel have to deal with on a daily basis - it's not overt, however, it is there, in the comments and discussions.   Maybe I'm being over-sensitive, and perhaps in an all-male group dynamic there's no buffer zone as such, so they feel that they can say anything in the name of 'humour'.  But there is a distinct scent of tarring all women with the same brush ie. gold diggers.  Of course, I'm not sure all of the male co-workers feel that way, and again, it might be the group dynamic, however, it's there and it's unsettling at times. I feel have to bite my lip (such an old-fashioned saying, but it's accurate), all in the name of a harmonious work environment.  Weird.   Anyway, no great shakes, I suppose, they can help themselves, and I can always go home at the end of the day, can't I?
