Today I discovered FunHi.  www.funhi.com It's this gangsta dating site.  Pretty funny.  You buy virtual gifts for people.  Someone bought me a g-string!  Of course, it's just a picture of one, but that's the beauty of the business model.  Someone was willing to plop down $0.10 to give me a picture of a g-string.  These guys are making tons of money.
