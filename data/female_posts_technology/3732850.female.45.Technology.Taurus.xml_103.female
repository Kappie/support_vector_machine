That got Judy thinking how she wants a different wife.  One that will do everything a wife is suppoes to do while the husband is out making a living for the family. Well the reason that Judy wants a new wife is because she is doing everything including the man's job and that is not easy. In this essay I think that Brandy teaches you that the women should not have to do everything at home. But in many cases this is just the case. Well both parents may be working outside the home. The mother is mainly responsible for taking care of everything at home. It is not like women can't do anything that men can't but many think the "Leave it to Beaver" way. Where the mother is at home and may work outside the home occassional. While it is the fathers responsiblity to earn the living for the family. Leaving all the household duties to mom. I don't think this is right just because we have been classified as the more materinal gender. It would not kill a man to help out around the house. After all he lives there to. Even everyone in awhile take care of the inner family needs like making sure the kids are taken care of, appointments are scheduled, and even the housework is done. Many Women would apperciate this.
