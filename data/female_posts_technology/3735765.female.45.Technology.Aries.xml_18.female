I will be sharing these posts with you on the upcoming posts.  I hope that you will enjoy and share the excitement that I felt as I embarked upon this new journey! :))    It is a few days before our "orientation" meeting to meet the others in the group.  We've received more notices about what to bring and what not to bring.  My mind is racing with excitement and some jitters of heading into unknown territory for me -- out of my comfort zone, working and living in the States.  I wish [my daughter] could be going with us but everything got so confusing as to whether or not she would be having her wisdom teeth out at the same time.  I pray that things will be going well for her while I'm in Guatemala.
