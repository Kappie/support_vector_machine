Be a good worker, one who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly explains the word of truth."  I am not perfect by any means; if anyone claims that he/she is, they are not being truthful either to themselves or to those who are around them.    My approach to life has been to empower others.  Empower.  I love that word because it implies of great strength.  As such, I try to instill strength in others through boosting their own esteems as well as providing them guidance to finding the resources that they need to succeed in their lives.  To me, there is no greater fulfillment than to see others being empowered to achieve their successes and for them to actually achieve the successes that they were empowered to do.
