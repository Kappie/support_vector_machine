So, all of my profound thoughts will have to be jam packed into this blog tonight.  The weekend was fairly good, except for this stupid hot weather, which, if you've read any of my other posts, you'll know that I hate it! HATE it!!!!  We did some packing, which is turning out to be a bit frightening...we thought that we didn't have much stuff left to pack. Boy, were we wrong!!!   We went to our friends house (Jeff and Dawn) for supper on Saturday, which was really nice.  My brother and his wife were in town from Calgary this afternoon. They were at an anniversary celebration for her grandparents this past weekend. It was held in a town about an hour from Saskatoon, and so they came and spent the afternoon with us, and brought us a new china cabinet!!  And tonight, Dave went to work, and I'm sitting here, sweating. The house just doesn't cool off. At least our new house is cooler! Thank goodness!  But, my profound thought is this: I am truly thankful for all of the good people in our lives. God has blessed Dave and I with an awesome marriage and really wonderful family and friends. It's so nice to know that a support network is in place if we need it, and even if we don't. A true friend doesn't care if you pop in on them, or if they pop in on you and your house is a disaster. You can sit and chat about anything and everything, and when the visit is over, you feel refreshed and just really good about yourself. So, to all of our friends and family, we love you and we cherish you! Thanks for all of the support during our big purchase and move!  Good night and talk to you FROM OUR NEW HOUSE!!!!  -J.
