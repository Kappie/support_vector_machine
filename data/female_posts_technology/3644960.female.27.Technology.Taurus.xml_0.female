The 'Icewind Dale Trilogy' will have to wait until August and it looks like "The Jane Austen Book Club" might be put off indefinitely. I just can't get motivated about this book and I've had one too many friends tell me that it was an absolutely boring read!   urlLink Le Mariage  by Diane Johnson  Because I enjoyed Johnson's previous book 'Le Divorce' so much, I assumed that I'd find this one at least amusing - not so. While I enjoyed the glimpse of Americans living in France, the surrounding story and attempt at a suspenseful plot did nothing for me. Murder, Ancient Manuscript Theft, Love Affairs - this book could have been so promising, yet the storyline never delivered. Save yourself some time and read 'Le Divorce' instead (although don't rent the movie, even Kate Hudson couldn't save that one!)    urlLink Morality for Beautiful Girls  (Book #3 in the No.1 Ladies Detective Agency series) by Alexander McCall Smith  The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency books never disappoint! The third book in the series focuses on the relationship between Mma Ramotswe (if anyone knows the pronunciation of Mma I'd love to know!) and Mr J.L.B. Matekoni. It's full of the colorful characters, conversations, and unusual going ons of daily Botswana life that I so thoroughly enjoy.    urlLink The Jane Austen Book Club  by Karen J Fowler  I'm glad I ran out of time and didn't get a chance to read this book, after hearing my bookclub's review it's definitely not on my must read list any longer.   "A sublime comedy of contemporary manners, this is the novel Jane Austen might well have written had she lived in twenty-first- century California.  Six Californians join to discuss Jane Austen's novels. Over the six months they meet, marriages are tested, affairs begin, unsuitable arrangements become suitable, and love happens. With her finely sighted eye for the frailties of human behavior and her finely tuned ear for the absurdities of social intercourse, Fowler has never been wittier nor her characters more appealing. The result is a delicious dissection of modern relationships."  - Book Description
