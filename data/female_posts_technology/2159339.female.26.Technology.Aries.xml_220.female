I say with a big sadistic smile, because to my own surprise, I am actually going through with it. It was fun for a while, but now, I had decided, it's time to end things. When we get upstairs and inside my room, I verbally diarrhea every thought that has been going through my head for the past two weeks. I generally suck at breaking up. Talking about 'our relationship' with my S.O. has never come naturally, so for this, I had gone through some serious mental preparations while engaging in the following activities: hour-long drives up and down Golden Gate Park, midnight cigarettes on our faux-balcony, solitary lunches on the roof garden (yes, I am at my emoest). At 26, and after years of therapy, I still lack the ability to communicate in ways that are not passive-aggressive. Of course I thought he would anticipate this because I hadn’t spoken to him all weekend, piled all of his 'forgotten' belongings in the middle of my room, refused sex, repeatedly told him that he’s unlovable. Strangely, he didn't. And more strangely, this is much easier than I thought. I thought I would be a mumbling, crying mess. But instead I'm composed, articulate, and deliver every sentence like I'm reading a children's book to a group of 5-year-olds.  Sitting on my bed in a sweater that makes him look less anorexic and thus slightly handsome, he looks confused for a few seconds but soon agrees with my assessment that our level of cruelty has crossed the line. “However,” he points out in a tone reserved for solving a math equation, “with our heightened levels of sarcasm, treating each other with respect and kindness may never be our thing. Besides, I didn’t know this was making you unhappy.” “Well, now you do”. We sit there for a while, waiting for the asnwer to drop down from the ceiling. I page through a magazine, he bites his nails. "Ok, now that you know all this, I guess the most diplomatic thing to do is to wait another week and re-evaluate things next Tuesday. If we can't change our dynamics, we’ll just be friends," I say..."That sounds good". Because after all, break-ups are all about diplomacy.   When we go to bed, he tries to be nice as I've instructed him to. He asks about my day, strokes my hair, shows me the cool new things his Mac can do, tells me about his press awards ceremony. It's sweet but seemingly contrived. I try not to make any decisions one way or the other. I guess we'll do that at the end of the judgment week (= last guaranteed-to-get-laid week).
