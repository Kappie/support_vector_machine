I know that back home, it's very common to hear your friends say 'Tumataba ah,' or hear your sister say 'Antaba mo na.' In the US., however, people take offense when you tell them 'Hey, you've gotten bigger,' or worse, 'You've gotten fat.' I asked my friend what was the most unoffensive way to casually talk about weight.  Kasi di ba sa 'Pinas naman, mostly kebs lang tayo pag sinabihan na mataba ka noh.   Apparently, you should say something like 'You seemt o be gaining a  little  weight,' or 'You looked a bit on the heavy side in these pictures.'  Duh. Duh. Duh.  Hahaha.   It's all so funny.   People around the world are dying, and all we can think to be defensive about is the way people tell us we spend too much time with food...   What about when people think we spend too much money on shoes? or bags? or --- God forbid --- on whitening products, whilst small kids are forced into prostitution for lack of food?  Still laughing?  Worse yet, still offended?
