He got to see his bestfriend meagan, who he hasn't seen in a while. Her mom use to babysit him and Madison, but she had a baby and can't watch them anymore. He was so excited when he seen her. It made my whole day just to see the look on his face when he seen her. I told Jen, her mom, that we would have to get together over the summer and take the kids to the pool or something. The kids played in the playclimber and play a whole bunch of games. After the party Madison had to going bowling with her sparks group at the same place as dylan's party so that was cool. We went for supper while she bowled and then came back and bowled a string well we waited for her to finish.   On Monday Dylan and I met Madison's class at the Clay cafe. It is a place were you go to paint pottrey. Dylan I think expected something more cause when we left he said he didn't have any fun all he did was paint. lol. When Duane got home from work we went to the soccer field to get the kids their soccer shirts. duane is coaching both of their soccer teams, Dylan's team is the kangaroos and Madison's is the Pythons. The play ever monday night in Douglas. After that we went to DQ for some ice cream and some misty's. The kids love those.   On sunday our new babysitter called and said her grandmother died. I felt so bad for her. All she kept saying is how bad she felt for not being able to babysit. I told her not to worry about and to go be with her family. So she couldn't watch the kids on tuesday, today. I had to call Nevin, my teamleader and tell him I couldn't work on tuesday. I don't think he was too happy about it but there was nothing else I could do. so my team in going without an Oracle person today because Darlene's husband is in the hospital with a compressed disk in his back and can't move so she isn't working at the moment either. But I said I would be on call all day to work from home.
