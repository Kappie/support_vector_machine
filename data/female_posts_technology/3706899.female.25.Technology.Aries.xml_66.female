When I first started knitting, I became addicted to eBay and pretty pretty pretty Kureyon.  Not to mention the piles of Fun Fur.  I think tonight I'll try to sort through what I have, see what I absolutely must keep, and start listing the rest on eBay.  I could use the money more than the yarn anyway.  *reminds self, it's just yarn, they make more every day*
