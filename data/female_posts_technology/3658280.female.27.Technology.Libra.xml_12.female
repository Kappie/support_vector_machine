It's like I get upset about something, and can't just leave well enough alone, and the next thing I know I've caused an argument and I'm muttering to myself what a freaking idiot I am.   I did that last night. And the worst part is, I couldn't even do it at a rational hour. Oh no, I have to wait until after midnight to show someone how ridiculous I can be. And now it's taking all I have to not call and say "Hey, I'm sorry I'm an asshole, please forgive me. Again." Becaue men don't want to hear you say that. They want to forget about the whole thing, like it never happened. Just like they don't want to hear about your problem in the first place, because the problem is you, not them, and why the hell can't you just get over it? So I'm hoping if I blog about it, it will make me feel better and I can just get over it and move on like nothing happened.  Last night the ex called. Not mine, but his. Fortunately I am not tied to mine with children so I never have to deal with that fucker again. Not so fortunate with her. And she can't call and be nice. She has to call and freak out. (More irrational than I am, believe it or not) She's upset because she doesn't have enough money to buy their youngest whatever she wanted for her birthday and to have a good birthday party. Quite frankly, I don't know what the woman does with her money. Between her paychecks, the child support and alimony, she really shouldn't be that broke. But based on the debts I'm told they had when they were married, apparently her spending habits have not changed.  I could handle the phone calls if she would only call about normal things to do with the children. But every damn time it's her freaking out about money. She never seemed too upset that the marriage ended, but sure does miss her meal ticket. So then he feels bad because he really thinks the poor kid isn't going to have a good birthday from her. So I said, "well, then give her money to get her something." (course, he'd have to wait until payday, because contrary to her belief, we aren't exactly living high on the hog.) He says, "I KNEW you were going to say that." Well, what do you want me to say? I wasn't trying be a snot, I was saying if she really doesn't have the money (which I DON'T believe) he can't let her not get the girl anything for her birthday.   Well then it turns into a discussion about alimony, taxes, and his pension (which she will be entitled to half of). That has always burned me.  I didn't get shit when my husband left me. I actually had to pay him $5000 and pay off his stupid jap-bike loan. He kept the bike. Of course, he was a bit of a loser, and my money did buy our property and put the downpayment on the house I kept... But I digress.  All night, I am thinking about this in the back of my head. And as I have indicated before, if there is something stuck in my head, I can't get it out no matter what I try. Which can affect my performance at work. And in the bedroom. So this is when all hell breaks loose. I will spare details, but basically, I just needed a little more to get my motor running than just a couple quick kisses. This turns into him asking what's wrong. Oh shit. He doesn't really want to know. And I really don't want to say. So after the 50 hundredth time of him asking I finally tell him I'm upset about that. He doesn't believe me and says there must be something else because that shouldn't keep me from getting... uh... you know... But no. That's honestly it. He says just forget about it. Hey thanks, I hadn't thought of that. Hello!!!!! If I could just quit thinking about it we wouldn't have a problem here. I think he thinks I was using that as an excuse to not have sex. I was not. I would have been fine, I just needed a little more,  *ahem*,  attention, before the train could roll into the tunnel, ya know? So why didn't I say so? Good question. Because with all I was thinking, that was part of it, and it was right on the tip of my tongue, and I couldn't. I couldn't express what I needed. As if what I needed was not important enough and I felt I should just be raring to go everytime and as quickly as he is.   A lot of ladies out there understand this I am sure. There are times when I can hardly get my clothes off in time without feelin like I'm going to explode. But sometimes, PARTICULARLY when something is bothering me, I can't FOCUS. And if I can't focus, I ain't gonna get the juices flowing. I swear I'm not making this shit up. And I've done enough reading about the subject to know that I am not alone.   Well, then it turns into how we don't have sex enough, and so I'm starting to panic about him not being happy in the relationship, and then I get really stupid and say shit like "good like finding a girl who's gonna give it up 3 times a day." I try to go sleep on the couch so I'll just leave him the fuck alone because I know I won't quit spewing at the mouth and he stomps out and tells me to get in bed and go to sleep. I can't fucking sleep now. I'm wide awake. Arguing does that too me. (it also aroused me - but I believe that is just because of the stress, faster heartbeat, increase in blood flow...) So then I leave to calm down and come back and he's asleep. I wanted so badly to wake him up and talk. But I didn't. That's the last thing he wanted. And I knew I had kept him up too late already. So now it's all left hanging and I don't understand how I could have possibly screwed up this bad when all I had to say was, "just do this for a little while".   I am an asshole. Maybe someday I'll learn not to do shit like that. Hopefully before it's too late.
