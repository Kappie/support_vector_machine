It's the sports kind, where there is a 5K run, a 1500 meter swim, and a moderate length bike ride.  He works out six days a week, two on each sport.  Last night we went running together at Memorial Park, and as I had suspected, I couldn't keep his pace.  He says he's doing this in order to keep active after our MS 150 ride, and it makes good sense to me to do that.   Even though I know he'll never read this, I just wanted to share that I'm very proud of him - even if he comes in last, which he won't.  He was always the one pulling me through on the MS 150 training, encouraging me along the way.  Wayne is the kind of person that is very capable of accomplishing things when he sets out to do them, and he doesn't settle for less than his best effort.  I'm looking forward to cheering him across the finish line in his first Tri.    He has also inspired me to do something in the off season to challenge myself athletically.  This may be interesting with all of the teeth problems I've had lately and how little I've been working out.  The first weekend in July I'll be joining Houston Fit for their Half-Marathon training program.  I trained for the full marathon three years ago and because of a poor shoe fit ended up having problems with my right knee.  I got up to the point where we ran 13 miles on one long training run and then I couldn't run any longer.  This time I'm being smarter about it, starting with getting the right shoes, and setting a more attainable goal in the half marathon.  Maybe next year I'll go for the full 26.2 miles.    Wayne is supportive as always, right behind me in anything I decide to do.  This is one of my favorite things about our relationship.   Tomorrow (actually, today) we will celebrate the two year anniversary of our first date.  Don't expect any blog posts on Monday night, as I will have much better things to do.
