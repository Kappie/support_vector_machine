I had heard they were buds but I caught Todd giving her dirty looks when she would plop down in places he couldn’t go. Paris the anorexic kitty is either A) very, very clever thinking that if she’s stubbornly consistent then some day, somehow, some human will forget they fed her and feed her again. Or B) she’s like that guy in that Memento movie and her short-term memory is only three minutes long.  Paris: Hey, what’s that?! That’s candy! I want candy. Gimmie, I’m starving! Me: It’s nail polish you little monkey! And I just fed you. Paris: Candy! Give it! Say, what’s  that?  I could eat that. Me: It’s a comic book. And while technically it is edible its collectible value far outweighs its nutritional value. Paris: Mr. Tickles! Hey, Mr. Tickles wants to come out of that glass box and play with me! Me: Sorry Paris, I specifically ask Veronica this- if Mr. Tickles was to expire from three hams then would I be allowed to turn him over to you for playtime. And she said…well, I’m not allowed to use  those  kinds of words in front of you so lets just go with no. Paris: (throws herself to the floor in a disgusted, angst-ridden heap.) Todd: God, what a drama queen. High five?
