I felt like I had a real physical presence in the world.  It's strange how different  people can feel.  I wonder what causes it.  Sometimes I think it's whatever music I'm listening too.  In both cases, I was in the car when I felt these ways.  Today I bought myself 4 pink roses.  They're beautiful.  They almost look like wildflowers, the way they're arranged.  Such simple, elegant beauty to brighten up my day.  I think everyone should buy themself flowers every once in a while.  I love bright, colorful flowers.  That's why it's great that the spring is here.
