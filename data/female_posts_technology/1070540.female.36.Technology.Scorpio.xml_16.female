We had friends coming over and I got up after a rough night of not sleeping and worring, and cleaned the house and wanted to make everthing look perfect for our friends and my husband.  I had a whole 2 hours of sleep.  Well they got here, and now look at me...I am at home again.  Everytime we get a chance to go out I get stuck at home. Last time I could not go because we have no sitter.  The time before that we did actually leave the house, His Aunt started acting up,we went home.  She went back out, he went to his friends house and guess what I stayed home and cleaned.  This time noone wanted to wait for the sitter.  You have no idea how I felt when I was told that I have to stay here. Sometimes I feel like such an outsider.
