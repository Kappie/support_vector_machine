He seems to be involved with Ambassador Negroponte's first out of town trip and offers some behind the scenes info on Bremers last, er, out of town trip (which appears to have been surprise scheduled in advance. That is to say, the surprise party was planned but nobody apparently knew about it except for Bremer)...;   The plan had been that we would have 24 hour notice, and give the press about 8 hours notice before the inauguration. What actually happened was that I came down from the studio at 0900 to find Greg outside Bremer's office wearing a suit. Alarm bells immediately started going off in my mind and my worst fears were realized...  urlLink (read more...)    (btw that site seems to take a while to load, it keeps waiting to connect to some other guy called www.georgewbush.com...)
