I was supposed to visit the hospital for a checkup, but was informed that the concerned doctor was coming in late, so it would be postponed.  But then, to my shock, the doctor called my grandpa and informed him that he had sent some tablets for me to consume for a month,and that he would do the evaluation based on the results, after a month.  This seriously ticked me off, coz no one is telling me really where the problem is, and instead just making me pump in more and more tablets.  Now the numbers are upto 9 tablets a day!  I hate tablets, its quite a painful thing to swallow so many of them!  Got a call at 6:30pm, from an old friend of mine, Vinay now working at Mphasis BFL, HR guy, sweet fellow.  Had completely lost touch with him for over 2.5 years, and was pleasantly surprised by his call.  He had got my numbers from a common friend of ours, working at Wipro, was quite surprised that that guy actually had my numbers..hahaha...Spoke to him for about 15-20 minutes, about work, relationships,singlehood, parties, studies, was quite nice.  Then suddenly towards the end of the conversation, he was, "Harini, there is a friend of my boss who wants to talk to you, have given him your numbers, and probably he will be catching up with you at 7pm, he's a really nice guy, so dont rip him up!"  I was quite confused over what he said, and asked him, "hey, dude what are u upto? "And his reply, "your single and available right?"  I was like, "huh? what do u mean by that", and all he said was," be patient...talk to you tomorrow...adios !"  The next 10 minutes waiting for this guys' called made me a complete nervous wreck, was left wonder what the hell was going on.  Then, at the sharp stroke of 7pm, he gave me a call, interesting deep voice,must say.  This chat happend over 3 breaks really, 7 to 8:15, 8:30 to 9:10, and then 9:20 to 10:10pm.   The first phase of the chat was a very general one, where he gave me an insight into work he does, hes' a HR person too, but refused to tell me where he worked.  Just said, will tell you about that later.  I was like,hmm...okay fine.  Then had a chat about my work, bosses or shall I say the lack them completely, work related problems in HR, etc.  The second phase was mainly on a person level, about my hobbies, his love for expensive suits, and then  the movie  HUM TUM, had a 15 minutes discussion about that movie, was quite interesting...then had this chat about European markets, the lifestyle, did a comparision to the indian markets, was quite an intellectual discussion for a change!  Quite a funny thing in this was that he was trying to sell Blore as a great city to me, which was where he was, the bazaars, the best of the hangouts, cosmopolitian life, etc.  The third phase was where things suddenly change, he began to ask me questions about my sensitive areas, my relationships, belief in relationships, relations at work, my weaknesses, etc.  This is where I suddenly became acutely aware that the discussion was heading in a very different direction.  So, up went my antennas' and began to carefully answer each of the questions from there on.   It was kindof getting late too, and at about 10am, I kindof drew the confidence from god only knows where, and asked him, so why you interviewing me....? He then replied, " hmm, smart girl, thought I'd be able to get most of the information out of you and then drop the bomb.  Was a pleasure having a nice intellectual discussion with someone after ages, and with someone as talented as you, was especially a lot of fun."  I then was quite shocked, and said, " okay, so which firm do you work at?"  And then came the big one, " Oh, me, I work for IBM at Blore.  We just happen to be hunting for a HR person and Vinay kindof gave you a very strong recommendation. Was quite curious to know why he was strongly recommending you, so decided hey, lets give you a call and check you out.  Was kindof in a good mood, so decided to first get to know you and then try to gather inputs on you. "  I was absolutely taken aback, coz I didnt know whether to be angry for being put on a wild goose chase like this, or give vinay a call and scream my guts at him...or thank this guy for the opportunity!  Was an absolutely hilarious situation to be in!  Best part of the entire deal was that, I never mentioned to anyone that I was thinking of a change, coz I really aint at this moment, too many commitments at home to comply with...god only know where such things come and fall on my lap!  Anyway, finally I thanked him for a seriously interesting and different interview...hahaha..man, will never forget this.  I then gave vinay a call, spoke to him for about 20 minutes, had a good laugh over stuff...and asked then headed to bed with memories of a seriously different day in my life flying across my mind!
