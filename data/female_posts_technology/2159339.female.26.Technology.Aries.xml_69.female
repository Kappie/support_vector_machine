He let me eat from his plate and didn't complain when I asked him point-blank over dinner, "Is your mother dead?" He knew that in my bluntness I was asking him why he doesn't mention her; he laughed and said, "Is it because I only talk about my dad and my sisters?" I nodded. He told me his mother is alive and alone in Minnesota.   He looked very handsome and during the night after I drank a lot of wine, I found him talking to a co-worker and I playfully spanked his butt and he was like, "Hey!" He liked it.  He wants more, I just know it.  It was fun hanging out with him, but boy, can XX talk. He is a nonstop chatterbox, which I am wary of. I once dated someone who couldn't control his motormouth and late at night when I was trying to sleep I would have to plead with him, "Please, please, stop talking, please. Can you please stop talking? Please?" When one of my office friends asked me how my "date" was going, I mentioned XX's constant talking, and she said, "Well, that's good, because you're quiet."  I thought about this and have to disagree. It's  not  good. Just because I'm quiet doesn't mean I want someone else's chatter to invade the still. I don't seek constant noise and stimulus. I like to be alone. I do things by myself. I want my head to be a tranquil and calm lake. I seek friends that are talkative, but in a potential boyfriend that I will be spending a lot of time with, too much talking is a dealbreaker.  I said pointedly to XX, "Are you EVER quiet?" and he said, "Of course. I mean, I like to read books." And I said, "Right, you probably read them out loud!" and he was a little hurt by this. While we were driving, he was being quiet, and I was thinking, "Ah, this is more like it" and I turned to look at him and he was grinning and mouthing, "See? I'm being quiet now!"   We stayed at the party until it was over, then we went to a bar with some friends until the bar closed, then he drove me home. I told him about this John Waters DVD I had that I'd been meaning to watch, "Pink Flamingos", and he said casually, "You should bring it over some time and we can watch it together." And I said, "How about tonight?" He fidgeted and drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and looked out at the pouring rain and harsh stormy weather. It was 2:20am and he was still on Eastern time. "Alright," he said.  We picked up the DVD and drove to his house. The rain was a monsoon. It was so torrential that the windshield was like shower door rippled glass: transparent but blindingly distorting. The wipers were ineffective against the driving heavy downpour. "Isn't this crazy?" he remarked. "Can you see at all through the rain?" He looked over at me for a reaction but I was serene and indifferent to the weather. Rain is stupid. Weather is inconsequential. I was in his warm dry car and I was on the way to his house to watch a John Waters movie with him. Life couldn't be any sweeter.
