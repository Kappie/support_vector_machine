I just haven't been able to bring myself to buy a dress just yet. (Which is very bad, since these things require an insane lead time.) It's all well and good to play dress-up, but do actually pick one and put my money down, well! I'm a horrid shopper for everyday clothing, so this is even worse.  Oh, well. I'll live.
