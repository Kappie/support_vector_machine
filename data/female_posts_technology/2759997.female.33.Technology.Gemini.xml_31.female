This week's gotten off to a bad start.  Well, not bad - slow.  My sinuses are killing me (again) because the pollen is out of control.  And when I've actually been at work (pulled a big 3-hour day Monday), this CMS project has me buried.    I think that's coming to an end, though.  Not the project, but the buried part.  Once I complete my templates, I'll only have to do my actual job, instead of my actual job AND the templates.   Should free up some time...    ...and I figure I can find plenty more trouble to get into if I only had more free time.  ;)
