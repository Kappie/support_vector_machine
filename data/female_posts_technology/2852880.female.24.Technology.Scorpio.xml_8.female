We had to cut the game short because we had to leave for the airport.  On Saturday, he only beat me by 1 pt.  What a grueling game!!  B is the best!  I got the coolest valentine...  I might go to the robin tonight again with cj and some of the other work folks.  Need need NEED to start painting again soon.
