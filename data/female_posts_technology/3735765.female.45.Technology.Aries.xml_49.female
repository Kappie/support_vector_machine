A friend of mine called yesterday to tell me that he FINALLY went to the doctor's office yesterday, reporting that, not only did he have bronchitis and a severe kidney infection, he nearly was put in the hospital for more than a month!!  I have been telling him for months to go see the doctor...  My late husband refused to go to the doctor's office too...and, look where that got him.  Actually, his excuse was that he was waiting for the insurance to kick in, which he was only about 2 weeks from the insurance kicking in.  So sad.  That doesn't really say a lot for our medical insurance programs.  The affordability of the health insurance programs has been just insane (along with, of course, the costs of auto insurance programs).  Don't get me wrong.  I am not for socialized medicine at all; however, there should be a happy medium somewhere in between that the health insurance program becomes more affordable for all  not just those few that can afford it.  Who are the underwriters of the insurance policies to choose between who can have a quality of life and those who can't?  It seems strange to me that they act like Gods and create most of the policies way beyond the reach of the typical, average American individual.  Can you tell that this is one of my pet peeves? Well, enough of my soapbox -- well, for the day!! :)
