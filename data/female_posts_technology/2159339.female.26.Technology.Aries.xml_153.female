When she galloped around on stage, she looked like a Comanche warrior rarin to scalp some settlers. When she stood still, it looked like a limp pelt. Abby goes, "Looks like some animal died on her head." Indeed.  It was awestriking because 5 people could stand around her, and each person would come away with a different perception. With each angle, she is squaw, brave, princess, warrior, Karen. Mad props for originality though. In an age where old know-it-all hipsters deride new bands for being unoriginal, I will counter with,"Oh yeah? How bout Karen O.'s hair? Where's that from, huh?" And they will walk away, defeated.  Her hair is an entity of itself and by itself. It is like The Phoenix, it destroys itself and is born anew every few months. It's not irony, it's just ugly; but like a trainwreck, you just can't look away.  Doppelganger alert:     =   ?
