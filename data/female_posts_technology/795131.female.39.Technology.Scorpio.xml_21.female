They're a band I didn't think much of, by their albums, but they grew on me, live, and I loved their show. Very mesmerizing and  hypnotic music. I loved being in downtown Minnapolis and seeing so many familiar places. I loved being there after dark! I didn't like having to pay a babysitter $30 so I could go , though!  Back to work at Software tomorrow. The work load is so much, my neck is stiffening ,  just from the mental stress of it. I'm glad I quit Sam's Club, although I miss the extra money.
