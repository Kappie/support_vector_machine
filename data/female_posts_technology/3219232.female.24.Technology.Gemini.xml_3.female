I’m nearing the quarter of my life, although I don’t think I’ll reach the age of a hundred. I’ll probably reach the age of 50 then die. Have you ever had a gut feeling that you wont grow old? I have. I don’t know if it’s because of a sickness like cancer or something because of the way I’ve treated my body (I’m trying to take care of it now by the way-trying to keep a balanced diet everyday with all the food groups and stuff and trying to get myself to exercise). I don’t know if it’ll be an accident-getting run over by a car or I’d die a hero because I’ve saved someone’s life. Who knows?  I’m 24 and I’m thinking about death or rather, abotu dying young. Death is such a dark subject to some people. Morbid and very negative. But then there are philosophers that think it’s not. It’s the end. So what do you do? Live like you’ve never lived before. People have trouble understanding that previous sentence. I mean, how do you really live? SHould you take this in a literal sense? Well, I'm not being literal. How you live really depends on your own beliefs, what you’ve been taught and the choices that you make in your life. I don’t think there’s anyone who can really tell you how to live and anyone who can judge and criticize how you’ve lived. All the things you've learned are there to guide and not to dictate. Your life is your own-not theirs. It’s only sad that some people or perhaps a lot who aren’t aware of this fact.  I’m only glad that I’ve been blessed with a mind that is open to understanding, though limited, it still tries it’s best. And I’m also glad that I’ve been exposed to people, books, and experiences. Experiences that in certain instances were troubling, sad, peaceful, wonderful, sweet and mad (insane). Altogether, they are enlightening and very entertaining. I mean it’s not common to experience a death threat at the age of 16 from your own stepfather now is it? It’s also not common to discover that your physically blind best friend can see more about life than those who have their perfect eyesight now is it? And the list goes on…So many and yet there’s more to come. I feel like so much has happened already. But even if so much has happened, I can never say "been there, done that" the same way that I can't say that I know everything that there is to know about life. I've learned so much and there's more! So what’s in store in the age of 24? Hmmm…we shall see…
