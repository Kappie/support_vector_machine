He is bossy, smarmy, jerky, creepy, lecherous, and most of all the tannest phony baloney ever on television. He is so retardedly fake that I wanted to snap off his Ken-doll head and replace it with a plum... natural, juicy, and sometimes sweet. And in the contest between Jonathan and a plum, the plum would win because plums aren't high on themselves.  And... he's STRAIGHT! The worst part about this show is he's packaged like a metrosexual, snappy and fey, but his cheesy oversexed gaze and his objectification of women is absurd. He looks gay, but acts like a fratboy. His appearance suggests sophistication and suavity, but his behaviour is sophomoric cheeseball. He hit on this Barbie-doll girl by saying something ridiculous like, "The book's not closed on you and me..." then he ogled her as she walked away, then chuckled. What a slimey scuzzoid! And, she fell for his inane lines! She was like, "Okay...." If this is how people communicate in Beverly Hills, I demand a civil war in California. We must seccede from the South!     Besides Jonathan himself, the unsympathetic stylist, the show is rife with flaws: 1. He has no foil. No one tempers him because it's his salon and everyone else on the show is his employee. Any opposition is met with a dull confrontation where he basically says, "It's my salon" and the antagonist will tensely nod their head. This exchange is supposed to equal resolution, but it only equals lifeless (i.e. frustrating) TV.  2. The show is too long. It's boring in its length. There was no actual haircutting til 40 minutes in. Just Jonathan talking about himself and saying insipid narcissistic things like, "I can't hire a guy in my salon who's taller than me." More haircuts! More analysis of technique. More secrets of the biz! LESS Jonathan! Shut his mouth! Since Jonathan is detestable, make the show watchable by censoring him! Censor him and force him to actually cut hair! Please!  3. He has no redeeming qualities. He's all hubris. Where's the humanity? The sad irony? The complexity and compassion? The layers? The depth?   4. This is clearly a "Queer Eye" knockoff: Take an expert in the field of makeover/transformation and follow them around because they're bound to be fabulous, right? WRONG. The difference between Blowout and Queer Eye, is that the Queer Guys are likable. They're affable and sincerely want to help their shmoes. They're generous, patient, and down with the peeps. They exude effortless charm. Jonathan is arrogant and doesn't even cut that much hair on the show. Where's the love, Jonathan? Do you even like what you do? What are you in it for? He's like a Beverly Hills podperson - empty, insipid, and overtanned. And he's got machismo problems. He can't get along with other guys as he's constantly trying to affirm his alpha-male status:  1. He fires a contractor who's his friend.  2. He's a real ass to his "difficult" male employee.  3. He won't hire the taller guy.   I spent an hour of my precious evening with this insensitive humorless poohead and I feel used. Jonathan turned my brain into jelly. Tasteless low-carb Splenda-sweetened jelly. This show is only a primer for those who are jerks-in-training. You want to be a dunderhead fratboy in metrosexual clothing? You want to brown-nose your own rear? Watch this show. As for the rest of America's couch potatoes, I think I speak for all us sedentary spuds when I say: Turn the channel! We work hard for our money to pay for cable! Who the heck wants to spend an hour each week with a jerk?!
