If you would like to post items on this blog, please contact:  angie.jeter [at] gmail dot com (I didn't list the actual email address to prevent spam, but sound it out).  Even though I'm not thirtysomething nor really in the single crowd anymore, I can't wait to see what kind of wild stories get posted up here.   Have fun and happy blogging!
