Oh its not much more than getting him up and dropping him off at school but I like the morning interaction and I love the kid.  Je's middle son and I get along great and I think I am going to enjoy the one on one time with him.    Had lunch with Dad on Monday and he is going to subject himself to my cooking Thursday for dinner.  Work is going well, things are just status quo as of now.  :)
