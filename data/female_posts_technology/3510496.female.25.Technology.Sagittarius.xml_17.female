After the beefy dinner, I 'stripped' my beddings, change to fresh ones, and send the dirty ones to the washing machine, which usually I do ONLY on weekends.   While waiting for the washing to be done, I still have the  semangat  to do potato wedges from scratch (RE-READ: from scratch).   Well, it's not that I grow the potatoes myself or what. Actually thanks to  urlLink kak ann  for sharing my cousin's (her dh) favorite potato recipe in one of her entries that day. Well not exactly outcome like hers, because I lack some of the ingredients, and add-on my own ingredients.   My Potato Wedges     5 russet potatoes, cleanse, cut wedge-like (leave the skin), cleanse some more. Pour onto the wedges: - 2 tbsp of olive oil - 1 tbsp of dill weed  - 1 tbsp of seasoned salt - 2 tbsp of blackpepper powder (put more if prefer spicier) - 1 tsp of white pepper powder - 2 dried basil leaves (kak ann, yours using chopped ones is it?)  FYI, all the above ingredients, except for potatoes and olive oil I errrm...  kapur  from my company. Muahahahaha....  Mix all ingredients well. Pre-heat conventional oven around 5 minutes before hand to 225 degree celcius. A tip, before putting your wedges on the baking sheet. Lay aluminium foil on it, to avoid overworking on the grease later. So lay your wedges neatly on it, and send it off to bake for like 30 minutes or so. Perhaps, different ovens may vary in temperature and cooking time.  So half-way through The Apprentice   last night, hubby and I were gayly enjoying the nice home-made, from-the-scratch wedges. Today, hubby intend to grab 2 bags of russet potatoes and ask me to do it to bring to PIL tomorrow. WARGGGHHHHH!
