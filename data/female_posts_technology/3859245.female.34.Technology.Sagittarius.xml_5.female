The McCarthy like Patriot Act is steaming forward threatening the civil liberties of all of us. Be careful what you check out from the library or buy from your local book seller... You might be monitored for your selections.  I am trying to picture a scenario... One that I am making up for the sake of argument and not out of paranoia... Let's say I write a letter to President Cheney or the meat stick with a head that talks for him, George Bush. If on the odd chance someone gets that letter and reads it and does not like it, perhaps considers it a threat to the ideology the administration holds near and dear. If my letter rubs someone the wrong way, it is possible that a small investigation could be launched... Small because I really am not important to anyone outside a small group of friends and family in the western US. So let's take this pretend investigation to it's potential end... Satan Ashcroft gets a call to find out what books this highly subversive single mom customer service manager may have read in the past couple of years. Well I am busted aren't I? First there are the dozens of Buddhism books I have purchased... What? She is not a Christian? Strike One. Holy Crap, she bought some books by the self described eco terrorist Edward Abby... The Monkey Wrench Gang? Is she saying by this purchase that it would be okay to go to Alaska and mess with the equipment there to halt any efforts in oil exploration? Would she really put carpet tacks in the roads in front of logging equipment to disable them?  Well, had I the energy and resources... No seriously, this strike two on my reading habits would simply show that at some point I bought my then husband Kent a gift by one of his favorite authors. Wow, check this out, not only is she not a Christian, but she bought some Harry Potter books, yikes she is a Satanist. (Ashcroft would know LOL). Then there are the Al Franken books, the House of Bush House of Saud, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton books. I am so screwed.  Now I get a knock at my door, it is some scary dude in a dark suit and one of those ear things that allow him to listen to some dark figure somewhere. I am under arrest... But not really arrest, as I am not read my rights. I am hauled off to some cell somewhere unable to make a call, see a lawyer.   America, what a country.   Of course this is not going to happen to me. I am no one really.  I am so no one I am even off my own radar. I write this thing that only I read, but it makes me feel better.
