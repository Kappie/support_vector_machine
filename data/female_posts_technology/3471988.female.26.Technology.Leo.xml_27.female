I ask the women in my team if they knew what kind of music this was. And one of them says "rap". I thought to myself, okay, she won't know who Paul Van Dyke is then. But later, more electronic sounds were coming from a different ballroom at the Club. I quickly run to the soothing sounds to find a couple of Indian guys setting up music for a party. I ask one of them what this music was and he says trance! I said "YES!!! Tell me more!" And well, they told me where the clubs that play progressive house/trance. We exchanged cards, they are from Oracle and they know how to party. (I hope.) Let's see how its done Indian style!
