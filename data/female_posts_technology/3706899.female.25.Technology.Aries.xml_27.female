I didn't even use up both skeins of eyelash like it says to in the instructions in SnB (had to throw away some tangled bits), and the scarf was only SUPPOSED to come out to 4 feet. Hrm. Pictures will have to wait, b/c it's almost 12:30 and I should really be in bed and asleep by now.  Yarn shopping in Portland in a couple days, woohoo!
