First of all at the beginning of this essay I couldn't decide if this author was male or female it really was a confusing idea. The idea of this essay was wanting a wife because of what duties a wife has or takes on in her role as a wife. I think that the author to this essay was basically bringing out the sterotypes put on wives. I am a wife and I don't do all those things all the time. My husband shares the responsibility or we take turns. This essay sounds like it's froma males perspective who wants to be free and wants a mother not a wife someone to wait on him hand and foot so he can take credit for the wife's hard work while he just looks important. This was not a good essay I feel because he makes it sound like the old days when the wife used to do it all and that is the way it is now. Well it's not. It takes two to run a household and the household shares all the responsibility of running the house.
