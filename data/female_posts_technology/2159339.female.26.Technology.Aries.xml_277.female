I'm really into  urlLink Teena Marie 's new album, La Dona, which has got some crazy-soulful songs that remind me of Destiny's Child and sweet-sounding Mary J. Blige. Teena's vibrato is wiggly and weird, but I really like it. She's been around for ages, since 1979, but this is the first I've heard of her. "La Dona" is her first release in ten years! Unfortunately for me, your show ho, she's only doing a 5-city tour which does not include the Bay Area. If she does an extensive tour, though, I am so there. Teena, my Vietnamese face is so so there.  Also, with the comeback of Teena, I think it's great that older artists are garnering some mainstream attention. This includes Loretta Lynn and her Jack White-produced album,  urlLink Van Lear Rose , and, and, okay I can't think of anyone else. But two is better than zero. Besides Madonna, career longevity in pop music is non-existent. So if I ever score a #1 hit, I am friggin saving my buckaroos! It's so sad to see  urlLink artists  make a $1,000,000  urlLink video , then promptly declare bankruptcy. If I had a million dollars, I'd say screw the video and buy a house in San Francisco. Or, half a house. Ok, scratch that. If I had TWO million dollars, I'd buy me a house in San Francisco.   In other R news, TJ Maxx told me to buy  urlLink Janet Jackson 's "Damita Jo" which I've already listened to twice through. It's okay so far, but it doesn't compare to "Janet." my all-time favorite JJ album. In return I forced him to buy "La Dona" which he thinks is off the chain.
