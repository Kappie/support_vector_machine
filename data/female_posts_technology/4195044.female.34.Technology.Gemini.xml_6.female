My superior, the Sales Director gave me the go signal (approved by upper management) for our Philippines business trip!  So the next days, in fact the whole week, I will be religiously devoting my time in refining our trip agenda. I desperately need to concretize my ROI justifications - yup per client with at least a 6 month to 1 year forecasted plan on total sales and profit. Am pretty sure, like in most corporate reality drama - these   wolves   will run after you, in this case  ME . They will be behind my back at all times after having invested much (*eybrows raised*) just like a crazed wolf stealthily watching the sheep.... yes this will happen after the business trip!!!  The   wolves   want results, results, results. The sheep nods and say: "no problem, I give it to you baby!",  BUT  the main ticker here is... how polished are the sheeps support tools so this poor little sheep can produce foxy-enough results for these   werewolves  ?  Rhetorical question?  A  not-so  friendly reminder ---   A wolf can easily devour a sheep for lunch!     Uh-oh.... I don't think I would taste good for a lunch snack? Would I?
