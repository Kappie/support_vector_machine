I was gonna make an appearance at the V90 show Fri night since they are playing w/ Acoustically Challenged and pretty much all of my friends would be there, until..... I found out Shannon was going and she made it clear she would not go if I would be there. So w/ out being asked directly I was asked to not come in a round about way.  Man these are people I have been friends w/ for a while and I talk to on a regular basis and this little girl (and she is a little girl) who disappears and does not return people's phone calls at all (not including mine) all of a sudden shows her face again after 3 or so months and I have to fucking make sacrifices! What ever. The person who told me about it is the only person in our group who knows the situation so I am curious to know what will be said.  I should not go anyway w/ the way I have been feeling. It would only make things worse. Nothing good would come out of that, I am sure. Man, I make one fucking bad decision and I can already see I am gonna be paying for it 4-ever! Ok need to go to the other campus so I can leave early to bring Collen to the Dr. I need to focus on my show anyway and get the rest of the bullshit out of my head.
