I know I can knit fairly well, but would something like that make me better or merely frustrate me?  I guess what it comes down to is, non-knitters think I can knit well.  I don't know enough knitters, but I got compliments on my tank top in the yarn store on Friday from people sitting there knitting (and people who work there).  Do I just want validation from people who are good-good-good knitters?  Or would I rather not have them judging me right now?  Would it take the fun away from it, or add more fun as it improves my skill?  Hmm.
