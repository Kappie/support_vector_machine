A story of 2 men becoming women, a woman to a man and a man who injuired his manhood and having it fixed. They met at a sex change medical center somewhere in Indonesia (bintan?)  and became friends. One man->woman even started developing feelings for the man-with-fixed-dick. However, it did manage to put in the issues that transsexuals face in a society in S'pore. It may open up some eyes/opinions of some, but not much since homosexuality are more open now.  So that's the simple story. The Straits Times did a very good review about it. The story seems flaccid. Too long/many pauses between scenes. Lousy actors except for the men-turn-women. I liked the stage artwork but I also agreed with the critic that it doesn't quite show the distinction of different scenes.  What I liked about the play is the opening and closing dance/sing performance by 3 macho transverstites. They are really good, even on those 4-inches heels.
