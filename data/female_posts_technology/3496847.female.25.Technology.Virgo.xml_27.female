Since I'm a little low on cash lately, I've decided to do without the Net at home for a few months. It might be 3-6 months before I get it back, so my posts will only be once a week or so. I'm at a caf√© right now.  Running is still going - but I'm stuck at Week 3. I will move on next week, but I may repeat it once or twice. I'm happy going slowly. I'd hate to be sidelined by an injury again.
