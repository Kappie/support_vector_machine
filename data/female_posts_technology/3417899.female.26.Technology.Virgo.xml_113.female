       
      Sometime last year, I was invited to a "Pleasure Party" by a friend. I'd never been to one, and wasn't very sure of what they were.  It ended up being a "sales" meeting, where an acquaintance was selling different "pleasure products" (yes, sex toys, vibrators, creams, and products of the like) in a home setting. Very similar to the "pyramid marketing" scenarios, where women sell  urlLink Tupperware . I went there, saw some demonstrations of the toys, and yes - even bought some who served me faithfully until they broke (!!), and made a few friends (who luckily lasted longer than my purchases).   That is why I was surprised to read  urlLink this , today.   Here we are, in the land of the freedom... and selling sexual toys can be considered a "criminal obscenity"? What's next - being charged for possession of these toys? Oh well, at least the charges were dropped.
