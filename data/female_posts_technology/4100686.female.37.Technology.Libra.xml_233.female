You can download the streams  (on Sunday at 12.00)  from their site  urlLink here  and enter the Streamtime Jingle Contest  urlLink here.   Streamtime say their website is not a blog, but the site is laid out in blog-like format with regular posts giving program details, transmission times, and links to the streams. So i guess this raises the next question; if broadcasters can blog, then can bloggers broadcast? Probably time to see if those el cheapo old speakers still work.
