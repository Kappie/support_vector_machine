I got told I looked nice before leaving the house, there were retirement celebrations at work (i.e. free cake), and I found out that I would get to move into a new cubicle.  This is a wonderful thing since the cubicle I was in, sat right in front of the door of the room we are in.  Traffic grand central.  Very distracting.   The evening was basically uneventful.  I've been doing the online personals thing this week, so I had a few e-mails to swap.  That takes so much work and energy.  It's not really worth it, it's just something I do when I'm feeling really lonely.  Thursday was a most excellent day.  We got some project work done at work, and then the cubicle moves began!   I spent the afternoon helping others move, and then moving into my new space.  I had gone to Walmart on Wednesday night, and bought some cheap fabric to put on the walls.  I got some red, purple, and yellow.  I love it!!  It just brightens my cube up.  I want to get a cool picture to hang on the wall over the cube.  I'm definitely in a happy cozy place.  Here's a look......      Oh yeah.....funny quote of the day......"don't you mean bald-moment instead of blonde-moment!?!"  :o)  So that's what you get when a bald guy does a funny.  It works for me.  The best part of Thursday was the evening.  It's official, I have a big crush on my roommate.  He's just too cute!  We hung around the house and drank again.  Of course this time I was introducing my roomie to the fine art of online dating.  We set him up with an ID and posted an ad.  Took a few pictures.  Look out babes of Nashville!  It was a very entertaining evening.  And I was pretty jealous of him when I had to get up this morning and get ready for work.  I'll get even next week when I'm on vacation.  :o)  We did see the coolest thing on the way to the liquor store though.  Check this out.....    It was gorgeous.  This bright, beautiful, perfect rainbow.  I haven't seen one in years.  It felt like a really good sign of things to come.    I'm looking forward to my holiday weekend and vacation.  There's just no telling what will happen and what fun will be had.
