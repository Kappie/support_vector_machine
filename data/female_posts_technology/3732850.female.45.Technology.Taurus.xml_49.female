At first, I think it was hard for all of us and this class, to me, requires more of a thinking process so I have seen all of us improve on that.      I like that we share our opinions because  it is amazing to me of how we can read the same essay and still see things different.  I find the sharing helps me to see another angle or focus that i hadn't before.      I like this class but i feel pressed for time.  I'm glad I have only this one left for the summer.
