Hubby has given me the green light to shop around for a new one. I was thinking of building my own, but hubby nixed the idea. He wants something with a warranty and in-home service.    Happy girl, is me!  I'm probably gonna go with a Dell, as our company uses them and I do have to say they are superb machines. Their tech support leaves a lot to be desired, from what I've heard from people who have worked there and have called in to them.  We also have a company discount with them. Does anybody have any other suggestions?  The downside part is, I did not backup the contents of my hard drive! What kind of a tech am I, you ask? Obviously one that performed a big oversight. But I'll have no problem taking our hard drive and sticking it into one of our boxes at work or at a friend's house and extracting the files I need.  Wish I had done it sooner. Kicking myself right.....now! Ow!  Edited to add:   My bubble is pricked. Why? Why is my hubby so stubborn? We need a new PC! Now he wants to backpedal and just replace the motherboard. Why me? Ahuhuhuhu!
