I am immediately irritated, cynical, and hate that the two females are close enough friends to attend movies together.  Hate that they are sitting so close that their hair is touching.  Hate it all.  Hmmm, why?  Because I wish I had that.  I wish I had a sister, a mother or someone I could do that with.  I sit and think about being happy and I always go back to the same answer, lose weight, become acceptable to all.  Be a good role model for my children, be thin enough to feel good about myself and confident enough to actually not fear meeting others, or even simple interactions.    I wonder who I am, I remember who I was, I fear that because of all that I have been through, I am driving my children away by being the distant, angry mother that I am and that they don't deserve.    When will I be the woman I so admire?  When will I be the woman I know I can be instead of hiding from the world in my mind, house and soul?  When will I be the mother and wife that wants to bring their friends around to meet me?  I don't know.  Maybe it is not as bad as it seems, maybe I am that woman and continue to beat myself up because of the tragedy.    What can I do to get over the tragedy?  What can I do so that it does not own me?  I feel that every day I awake and kind of dread the day because I know that my overall feeling will be sad.  If I could only be thinner, smarter, prettier, if I could only be all of the things my former friends found acceptable, my former employers found acceptable?    I don't know the answers to these questions, I know I want to be all I can be, but how?  Maybe I just do it to quote another slogan.   Maybe I just do it.
