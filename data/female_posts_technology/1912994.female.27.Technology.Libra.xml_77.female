"American Marines targeted from mosques"   then he continues ... "Today's L.A. Times headline : US Targeting mosques "   Added Note : insurgents have been targeting Marines from the steeples of mosques which is the reason the mosques where attacked.  kind of makes you wonder whose side the media is really on... ours or the terrorists? anyone...
