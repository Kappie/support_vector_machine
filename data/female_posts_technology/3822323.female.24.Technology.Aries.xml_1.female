I spent a considerable amount of time going around the Sales and was totally dis-heartened to return with only one item! I battled the crowds and I rummaged with the best of them but dissapointment was my only purchase.   This poor display of sales techniques questioned my feminimity. What happened to that savy woman of not so long ago? Well I set out this lunch time to find her and find her I did. Horray!   There were bargains to be had and by golly I bought them all. Whether the items will inevitably be worth the financial heart ache is not a question we should ponder on too heavily. Besides a bargain is a bargain and I have not met a red blooded woman that can resist the draw of those bright red Sale signs!  Now before the wave of shoppers guilt envelopes me and resentment towards these new additions to my wardrobe consumes me, I would briefly like to pay hommage to my favourite items:  1) The tan suede shoes - may you forever reside by my heel. 2) The brown silky halterneck - always will you be my sexy little friend. 3) The cardigan too big for me - may you shrink in the wash.  With that over with I would like to make a plea to the man in my life (Hi Lover!)....don't berate me for my frivolity. When the monetary burden strikes down on me, don't dismiss me, hold me and help by filling this gaping hole in my my wallet. That is all I ask!  Until the next shopping trip....happy shopping!
