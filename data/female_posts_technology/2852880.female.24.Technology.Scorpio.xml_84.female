       
      Ever feel like a stranger in your own world?  Half the day is over and I have had no human interaction.  I walked down the street, went to the bank, used an ATM.  I came to work, went to lunch, looked around and realized I knew nobody.  Sat by myself in a vast expanse of table eating my white rice quietly.  I imagine I looked pensive as I contemplated the strangeness of it all.  Where was everybody?  Is there some secret party I wasn't invited to?  I'm not feeling bad about it - I'm just fascinated.  How does such a thing come to be.  It's an exercise in probability.  I imagine this will happen a lot once I move to Boston.  I didn't expect it to happen before I left.
