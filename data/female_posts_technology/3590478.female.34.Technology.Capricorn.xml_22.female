But be warned it probably falls under the category of “way more amusing while it was actually taking place than here, now, in print.” Or maybe it’s the “It seemed like a good idea at the time” category which happens to be a specialty of mine. In Vancouver (oh god just when we thought she’d finally tired of her Kingdom of Fife stories she up and visits yet another country for a whole new batch of wacky, foreign high jinks.) liquor stores are, apparently, places of great worth not to be strewn about 17 to a block like, say, a starbucks.  They are special, secret places that need to be kept out of the reach of boozehounds, tourists, Americans…wait, those are all the same. Let’s just go with “undesirables”.  I saw three the entire time I was there and I was  really searching . And one of those was something called a “wine cellar” which nobody cares about so that doesn’t even count bringing the total down to two. Lots of the pubs and bars sell six packs of beer known as “off license” or some such crap. On Sunday we decided this was our best option for procuring beer and I was dragged along to be the procuree as the role(s) of driver and amused passengers had already been filled. And also, mostly, because I was the one yelling about how five beers were certainly not enough for any self-respecting American boozehound tourist which is all we had left from our traumatizing search for a liquor store. So, a fist full of cash is shoved at me and I’m booted out the car. “What  kind  of beer should I get”, I whine. “Just get some and hurry the hell up, we’ll be parked down the block, with the motor running!” they grunt (or giggle, depending).  I’m not sure I can describe how truly bizarre this place, this off license pub was, but here goes. Imagine the bingo room at the local VFW circa 1956, crossed with the demon bar on Buffy sans the pool tables. Lots of cheesy, fake wood paneled walls and industrial carpeting soaked in beer every night for the last 200 years, (which, I believe, is how long this place has been in business.) Oddest of all is a giant room, in the middle of the room, made all of glass. In it are 3 or 4 couples doing nothing more exciting than drinking beer. There’s no smoking allowed in doors so neither the people in the glass room nor the people in the bar are smoking and clearly everyone in the place has been a regular since 1981 at the latest. I’m  still  trying to figure the glass room out.  I stagger up to the bar and ask the fine (and by fine I mean surly as hell) French bartender for beers. As he reaches for a glass I tell him I need beers to go and ask if this is where I can get them. He grunts in the affirmative. “Uhhhhh, what beers do you have? You know, to go.” I say. (Great, now I’m Forrest Gump) As his eyes roll back so far in his head that I can no longer see the pupils, he snatches open the door to a mini fridge behind the bar. I can see four kinds of beer, all in cans with one choice being Budweiser. I’ve no idea what the other three are so to buy time while I’m making this important decision I say, “Uhhhhh, where’s the bottled beers?” (Great, now I’m Bevis)   “That’s all we got” snarls Pierre, still sans pupils. Luckily there’s a waitress standing there enjoying my idiocy and she finally speaks up with, “Are you from the states honey?” (Because I so  very clearly  am.) “Well them two beers is a malted beverage and it’s really an acquired taste (malt liquor, check. No, don‘t want that) and if you don’t want the Bud I’d suggest you take the Kokonee.” “I’ll take it!” I squeal to Pierre who is now using the opened mini fridge door to prop up his bored, vitamin deficient carcass.  I pay, grab my wacky beer and haul ass back to the car where I share this story to the gleeful, snickering delight of the rest of the party. I’ve never been in an opium den but I imagine if you changed the word opium to beer, it would be exactly like this experience. The beer tasted like Coors light, which is still better than malt liquor.  Vicky is in California and Deb has to work so I don’t think I can be bothered to go to Twains tonight. If any of you wants to hang out with me specifically, you know how to reach me. Otherwise there is an All my children marathon calling my name. (Sure, I’m pathetic. Why don’t you just call me up and tell me that, smarty pants)                Oh yeah, A Broad, we drank the alcoholic tang you left the other night and we are really sorry we mocked you now because it was very tasty. You will still be mocked in the future (you all will so don’t be acting all smug like A Broad is the only one to suffer the mocking) but for things other than drinking alcoholic tang.
