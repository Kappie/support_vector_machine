I was heavily bandaged when I left however, they were irritating so I took them off and put on smaller ones that are less irritating...for now.  The one on my head was particularly nasty.  YACK!   I lost my legs again... Dr. Frankenstein said that might happen but it doesn't make any easier to deal with.  I have a big weekend and now without my legs, its looking even bigger.    But you all know me...always a smile.  I have to believe that I meant to take this path and overcome these odds as a means of higher living...better living.    I leave you with my song of the day, Jill Scott's  GOLDEN :   Ok (ay) Oh (oh) Hey (ay-yay) yeah..... Oh..  yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.....  I'm taking my freedom pulling it off the shelf puttin' it on my chain wearing it 'round my neck I'm taking my freedom puttin' it in my car wherever i choose to go It will take me far  I'm living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden (golden) living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden (golden)  I'm taking my own freedom puttin' it in my song singing loud and strong proving all day long I'm takin' my freedom puttin' it in my stroll I'll be hop-steppin' y'all lettin' the joy unfold  I'm living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden (golden) living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden (golden)  I'm holdin' on to my freedom 'Can take it from me I was born in-to it, it comes naturally I'm strumming my own freedom playing the god in me representing his glory hope he's proud of me...  I'm living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden (golden) living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden living my life like it's golden (golden)  hope he's proud of me...  living my life like it's  golden, golden, golden, golden, golden, golden, living my life like it's  golden, golden, golden, golden, golden, golden, living my life like it's  golden, golden, golden.....
