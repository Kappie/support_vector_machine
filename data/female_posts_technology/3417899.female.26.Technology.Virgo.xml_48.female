The four daughters were also killed: 11 year old, 9 year old, 7 year old and the 2 year old baby girl.   You won't read about it on the fornt page of the CNN site. Because it's such a "small" and mudane occurance in our country. "Only" 5 dead - even if it's a pregnant woman and four little girls....  And still - it IS home. It's STILL home.
