So I already don't shop at WalMart, now I'm going to stop giving my money to Tim Hortons. My story starts with the fact that I'm broke, and when I say broke I mean I've even spent my overdraft! So with half a tank of gas and NO money in my pocket I take Jasmin to Tim Hortons. I don't drink coffee myself but I have a lot of friends and coworkers that do; during the "roll up the rim" contest they gave Jasmin several winning rims for free cookies and donuts. Jasmin happened to find one of the winning rim pieces today and REALLY wanted a donut. So I take her into town and we go inside, I was sure she was going to pick double-chocolate but instead she decided on the vanilla dip with sprinkles. Smiling, I held up the little torn piece of coffee cup and asked for my free donut.  Cashier: "I'm sorry, we only take those during the contest".  Me: "But there's no expiry date mentioned here" Cashier: "It's written on the contest cups" At which point I had to turn around to my eight-year-old daughter and tell her she wasn't able to get the donut after all and we had to go home now. I can't beleive that, I could understand if I tried to cash in a coupon that was three years old, but not this. I never liked that contest anyway, always thought it probably had worse odds than the lottery.
