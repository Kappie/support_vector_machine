But now,  Roger is out of the picture and a guy named Bryon is in the picture.  He has got to be confused cause I know I am.   I know the only reason why he goes to see his mom is because she had him a little brother.    I  have always wanted a baby by Ken, one of his, to show him how much I love him.  My heart really hurts at times when I think that I wont ever have a baby by the man that I love so much.  But now, its going to hurt worse, because I am not going to give the kids (Biran,Kimberly and austin wants me to have a baby) what they want.    Thats ok, life goes on and so does my love, but I just need to find another reason for our children to want to stay.  One day they will realize how much Dad (Ken) and I love them.
