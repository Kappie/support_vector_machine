Dave busied himself with tearing up the carpet in the living room, pulling off baseboards, and lifting up all of the carpet tacking around the room.  I, on the other hand, began the mortal combat with the fricking wallpaper.  Sheesh, I hate that stuff.  For the most part, it peeled off really nicely, but, these people, before layering on the latest pattern of paper, didn't properly remove the old stuff.  So, we now have little brown flecks of dried on paper underneath the current paper.  What a mess that is for me!  Also, we are going to have to do a TON of plastering in the bedroom. (This is the room that has been violated with the hideous aforementioned crap.)  Not too mention that these people were smokers.  Now, if you do smoke, I'm not pointing the finger.  We all have our addictions.  But, really, if you smoke in the house, you wouldn't believe how it stains the walls and ceiling.  It was so gross.  Well, tomorrow my battle with the enemey shall continue.  And, I WILL prevail.  Die, wallpaper...DIE!  -J.
