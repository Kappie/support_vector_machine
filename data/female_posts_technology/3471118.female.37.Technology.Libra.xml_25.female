Giving things you can easily afford to give isn't sacrificing anything.  When you give of yourself, or give things that are costly to you, that means more than a gift you have no problem affording.  This is hard for me because I don't agree with tithing to a church or giving huge amounts of money.  I much prefer to give in ways that make a difference, like volunteering or taking on some role that is helpful to people.  Giving of my time and energy, of my abilities and talents, of my internal resources, of my intellect, are more of a sacrifice to me because I value my time and privacy so much.  Giving monetarily is okay, and I like to give to charities, and I like to contribute to the church.  But giving so much that it hurts our ability to live and eat, as I'm assuming the woman in this passage did, isn't something that agrees with me.  I don't have the constitution for it.  I don't know if that's wrong, but it's how I feel.
