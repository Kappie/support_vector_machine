I had always been told by my sisters that it's a dangerous place to cycle. Rough terrains for a so-so cyclist like me. Well, that was a couple of years ago. The island had went thru some 'upgrading' since then. And I've come to realise that as long as you are not speeding, you can maneuver between the rocks, roots and wild animal poo. Just like driving; it gives you time to react.   Going through the roads and trails, taking in the fresh air, fighting the bugs *scratch scratch*, avoiding the rocks and poos, there's still time to think about life philosophy.   Uphill is tiring and dreadful. But I had to keep going cos I want to ride the downhill. Wind in the hair, feeling the thrill as the speed picks up, almost wanted to lift up the arms and close my eyes. But I didn't want to crash and die.   The trails required concentration (for me ie.). When you focused on the every rocks and bumps to avoid, you missed the beautiful things worth seeing. But it was for my arse and I don't want to fall. Does that reflect how I journey my life?  I brought my APS camera along, an attempt to use up my expired film. I wonder how it'll turn out. (You'll see it if it's good.)  After some bites and brusies, I head home for a quick shower and went to Fort Canning for Starlight Movies. It was a great night. We had food, wine, great laugh and sobs. Lucky for us, it wasn't too humid that night. I had blogged in more details at  urlLink BHG blog .
