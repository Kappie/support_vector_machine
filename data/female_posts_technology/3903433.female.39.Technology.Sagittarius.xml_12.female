We really dodged a bullet.  This jarred me (although I suspect, nowhere near as much as it jarred Punta Gorda) - we'd all been expecting a cat 2 or 3 hurricane hitting Tampa Bay. Instead, Charley intensified shortly before landfall into a cat 4, possibly borderline cat 5. For about a half an hour to an hour, we sat slackjawed in front of the TV, feeling a bit like deer in the headlights. Frank made the comment it reminded him of the Uncertainty Principle - the more precisely the POSITION is determined, the less precisely the MOMENTUM is known... Amen to that.  Looking at the live footage from Punta Gorda - few had prepared for the hurricane and they evacuated possibly hours before the hurricane hit. I realize it is far better to feel sheepish because you prepared and never got hit, than to not prepare and get walloped.  Not that I would ever want for this to happen (I'm not the type to say: bring it on!) but I would love to see, in the midst of such devastation, a lone dome home sitting intact and unharmed. Such evidence would make people realize that alternative types of homes - homes that are more energy efficient, more hurricane/tornado proof, etc. are really the ideal way to go, especially all along coasts in hurricane-risk areas.  And, while I am a little, private practice with few resources to waste, I admit even I FTP'ed my critical files to Globat which hosts my website. We may not have the resources to have an extensive backup and recovery process in place, but even something as silly as creating your own Yahoo group private to yourself, and uploading your files, would be better than doing nothing or using a backup/recovery process that is location-dependent. I have everything on my laptop, currently, but it's nice to know if I lost that laptop, that I could still pick up somewhat where I left off.
