(These things have been published in this journal as they ahppened as well.)  In the last 2 months alone my life has flipped yet another 180 degrees. It all started after finding out Freedom need surgery.  I set up a website hoping to raise even just $100.  Five days later I had raised almost $800.    Three weeks later I got into a pretty bad car accident, and while I walked away pretty much unharmed, my car didn't.  For 2 weeks I went back and forth with the insurance company and body shop trying to get it fixed. The day I got a call saying it was to be totaled, I got a phone call from M.A. saying it was time to go car shopping and it was his gift to me.  I got a 1994 Explorer the next day.  A vehicle I have wanted for years and never thought I would own.  I was still stressed out about the difference between what I owed on my totaled car and what the insurance company would give me but at least I had wheels now and knew no one could take them from me.  A week later I got the call from the insurance company I had been dreading.  It was time to discuss the figures for my car.  To my amazement, they were paying me $1500 more than the most I thought I would get.  I called the finance company to set up a payment schedule for the balance.  Once again, I was being taken care of.  The difference between what I owed and the pay out from my insurance company was only $134. Not the $2000 I feared.    During that same week I got a call from a recruiter for a job I hadn't even applied for.  He simply saw my resume on  urlLink Monster.com  and called.  3 days and 2 interviews after his initial call, I now have a job back in the technology field.  My only requests were that this job let me have Sunday morning free for church and that it pay at least $12 an hour so I could keep my financial obligations and still move out.  This job is weekends off and well over that rate of pay.  Freedom had his surgery and is doing wonderfully.  He was back to his old self within a couple of days.   I won't go into all the horrible things that happened at the beginning of the year because they don't matter. Sure, they still hurt and I definitely still feel the sting from some of them, but the wonderful ways I have been taken care of this last couple months more than make up for that.  Sometimes you have to walk through the fire to come out alive. The things written about here are just some of the things that have happened, just some of the gifts I have been given.  There isn't enough time this morning to explain the inside changes that have begun to happen.    I haven't done anything to deserve the gifts I have gotten.  I haven't even begun to write about the all the gifts that have come simply by being sober.  The only thing I continued to do was keep on keepin' on and to stay sober.  I cried, I threw temper tantrums, I wailed against fate, people and God, I surrendered and took it back but I kept on going.  That is the only thing I did right.  Everything else wasn't me doing it.  I guess the moral of this story is no matter what happens its going to be ok.... eventually and that God does take care of us but sometimes it takes a bigger smack upside the head for some of us.  A lot of human will was involved in all these things, but I believe it was God using them to help me.  I want to be able to be of that same service some day.
