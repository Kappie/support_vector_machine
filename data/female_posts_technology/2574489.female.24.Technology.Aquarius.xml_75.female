The only productive thing I will deign to do is go see my tax guy.    This week's Friday Five:   1. What's the most daring thing you've ever done?   I've gone skinny-dipping ;b   2. What one thing would you like to try that your mother/friend/significant other would never approve of?   My mother would never approve of me moving to another state (Hawaii--i would love it)   3. On a scale of 1-10, what's your risk factor? (1=never take risks, 10=it's a lifestyle)   I think my risk factor's pretty low right now.  I'd say a 4.  I hope to change that though.   4. What's the best thing that's ever happened to you as a result of being bold/risky?   Errr...because I hardly take risks, I am not qualified to answer this question.   5. ... and what's the worst?   Okay, I have done one thing in my life that I'm not proud of but could be chalked up to boldness, riskiness.  I won't say what I did, but I had to pay $900 for it.   And with that, I bid you all adieu.    ***  Check out party pics again.  It seemed my changes did not save to make it public.  Rhy, MIchael and Samantha, the little boy and girl in the middle is the the cuties I'd mentioned before.  Mom's mexican and dad's american.
