The bad thing - I was bored at certain points of the movie. The story/plot is expected. Well, it can get kinda drama but then again, it should be expected out of such movie. I was looking for more climax but since it was expectable that the good won't die, I wasn't too excited when the good guys were in danger.   The good thing about it thou, is the graphics. Really cool and fun to watch. And of course, Hugh is nice to look at, Kate too of course. It's worth, 3/5 stars.  Friend went to Eng Wah Suntec and reported bad sound system. The sound can go mute at the exciting part. I went to GV Plaza and the sound system also sux. One side of the speakers go mute and back on minutes later. I guess Orchard Cineleisure is still the best, although it can be deafening. You can do what I did, plug in ear phones. Hahah.
