Okay, so, to recap for all of my many faithful blog readers (of course, this is said tongue in cheek), Dave and I are just wrapping up the whole first home purchase thing.  We had an appointment with the lawyer at 0700h, which surprised me, but what surprised me even more, was the fact that we were already his third appointment of the day.  Apparently, he's an early lawyer-worm...first appointment was at 0500h!!  So, we're standing outside the building, and we're early, both of us incredibly nervous.  And, the door is locked.  We both look at each other...what are we going to do?  "Do you have the cellphone?" "yeah..?" "Do you know his number?" "No...".  Then, this freaky security/janitor dude comes and lets us in..wow, he was some weird!  He told us to wait right there and the lawyer would come and get us.  Well, 10 minutes later, and 8 people have come and gone.  And we're still standing in the lobby, waiting for the lawyer to come and get us.  Long story short, we were supposed to go on up, because the entire building opens at 0700h, anyways.  And the lawyer came and found us, because someone had told him that there were two people standing downstairs, looking completely lost. That, of course, being us.  What can I say?  I was raised on a farm, and I listen to what people tell me to do!  This security guard could have been capable of opening up a can of whoop-ass on me, for all I knew!  However, I digress.  We have officially signed the papers.  The monies are in place, we've got our house, and the possession date has been moved up to July 12.  And strangely, we both felt really sick after we left the office.  It was kind of a "Oh shit...what have we DONE???" sort of feeling.  In fact, I made Dave run me home quick before he dropped me off at work, but I could feel my anxious bowels working overtime.  Yuck!  Well, that's enough for today.  This kind of sucked, but I didn't really have any "witty" thoughts today.  Stay tuned.... -J.
