However, if you do, please make sure you're made aware of the fact before you A) get in your car to drive to work rather than be bemused by the hideous smell for a whole 20 minute drive , B) spend a whole morning  dealing with people while the aroma of cat shit permeates your particular section of the office C)  realise that yes, that hideous smell is coming from you.  All I can say is bless lovely Mrs Cleaner who opened her heart and her storerooom to me to use all manner of industrial strength cleaning products to help me out of a particularly nasty catshit jam.  You know, even the thought of that smell is making me gag. I won't bring it up again.  I was Ms Hardass consumer today, my computer broke (after 8 years, it's had a good innings, I'll miss it), so  I need a replacement, I waltzed into the computer shop, stated my budget, what I needed, when could I have it? Mr Computer Shop person was slightly bemused and said 'okay' to all of my demands for a new computing system.   If only I could be as assertive in other areas of my life.     Oh dear, one of my 'alternative colleagues' ie. from job no 2 thinks my name is something other than my real name.   While this isn't a global problem on a universal scale, seeing as I deal with him for no more than two minutes each week to hand him a piece of paper, I can't help thinking that I should have nipped this misunderstanding in the bud earlier on in the piece.  What happens, if, during the two minutes I need to deal with him,  I collapse in a heap or other untoward event and he has to ring an ambulance and he'll say it's for 'Lisa', 'Lisa's collapsed', and then, while they're treating me, they're calling "Lisa, Lisa can you hear us?" and I don't respond and they think I'm dead? Or I wake up say my name is not Lisa it's Gossy and they think that I've got amnesia and give me inappropriate drugs?     It's a minefield, I tell you.  Should I tell him? It's been nearly four years.   I don't know about this Miss Universe thing.  I mean good luck to Miss Australia and all, but really, in 2004 is it still relevant? Oh hang on, chicks in bikinis strutting around a stage while people judge them purely on physical proportions and ability to walk in killer heels without looking down? What am I thinking? Relevant? Damn straight.
