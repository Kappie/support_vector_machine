(Mom? *grin*)  Other than that, I don't really have much else knitting-related to talk about.  I need to start something new, as everything else I'm working on will take a while to finish, and I don't want the whole boredom thing kicking me.  Poll:  Like I said a couple entries ago, I need to destash.  Question is, should I post what I'm getting rid of in my blog first and give my loyal readers first crack, or should I go with the eBay?  Of course, I'm not sure how many people read this thing, but it's worth asking.  Leave a comment with your opinion!  (In case you're wondering, I've got a Metric Butt-Ton of Kureyon, much of it in discontinued colors, some novelty yarns, a batch of Cascade Sierra, and possibly some Iro and some completely unrelated-in-color Wool-Ease.  What I've got might influence decisions here *wink*)
