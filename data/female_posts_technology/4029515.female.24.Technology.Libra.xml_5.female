So I checked out some other stuff I can study but am now feeling lazy to sacrifice my weekend for that. Classic case of cake. I guess I'm one of those ppl that just cannot sit still for a minute and then complain I have no time for myself!  The Wait to see where my career is headed is killing me. Hate being in the dark. Forced to hang in there till September to decide on what I want to be doing for the next bit of my life. Want to do so many things, but my hands are tied. Sigh.
