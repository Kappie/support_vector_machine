I collect Holly Hobbie stuff, I like to write, I sew, I knit, I crochet (but nothing that requires me to crochet circles - I can't do circles),I have developed a liking for patchwork, I like to garden, I collect Jackie annuals and magazines from the 60s, 70s and early 80s, I like to cross stitch...in fact a whole load of hobbies that make me sound like a mad old pensioner. Yet conversely I have a very technical job, involving telecomms and networking and internet related things and all kinds of weird and wonderful goings on. Therefore I am a paradox.Or is it quixotic? Or a paradigm? I think I will be all three.... And what do YOU do in your spare time?
