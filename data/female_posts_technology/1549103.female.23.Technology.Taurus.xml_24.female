Going off of my dating experience, I figured that three weeks without a call back was probably a bad sign, so when they did call me yesterday I was pretty shocked.  In all truthfulness, I wish they hadn't called back, because then I wouldn't be faced with this dilemma.  It's a great job, working with great people, with a great company...in the shittiest town known to man.  Even my other shitty-town prospect is better than this one, since The Boy will potentially be in that Shitty Town.  And I know the whole point of keeping The Thing with The Boy low key was to keep me nice and independent so I could go wherever I want...but that freedom was supposed to allow me to go to Seattle or San Francisco or Berlin, not Shittiest-Town-Known-To-Man, USA.  Surely I like him more than that.  
 I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to do.  Yesterday I was going to turn them down, today I'm thinking of accepting, so who knows what I'll say on Friday when they need an answer.
