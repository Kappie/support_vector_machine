Althou there isn't many climax in the show, I wasn't thinking about the time and enjoyed the movie. Maybe it's just the protrayal of "macho man" that got me 'enjoying' the show. I'd say 3 stars out of 5, the kind can watch, can don't watch, or watch during wkday sort.  Next, Kill Bill 2, Taking Lives, Starsky and Hutch, 50 First Dates.
