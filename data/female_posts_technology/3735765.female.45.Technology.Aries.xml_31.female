I thought I was uptodate on everything in the computer world; this only goes to serve that I definately have no clue about the truer scope of the technological world.  I had thought myself to be very computer savvy.  While there remains a great vastness of people out there that are still far less computer savvy than myself, I am slowly discovering a new world out there when exploring a way to access the new Beta of the GMail being produced by Google.  In an absorbed exploration mode, I discovered that there are as vast a number of blogs created as varied as the bloggers are themselves.  Some are extremly creative in their blogging; while others utilize it to do their daily journaling.  I have passed along the information about how to build a blog page to several of my friends yesterday and one of them has reported back to me that he has created his own.  As soon as I get his exact blog URL, I will certainly share it with you all as well.  UPDATE:  This is  Anton's URL  -- check it out.  He just started it today!!  If you are still unsure of whether or not you would want to blog, I suggest that you go for it -- after all, what do you have to lose? You certainly have much more to gain from it - a venue to demonstrate your creativity; a venue to meet others with the same interests as yours; a venue for you to share what is on your mind; a venue to post things that may be of interest to others; a venue to brush up on your writing skills ... the list could go on for-ever!  I hope that you all become happy bloggers!!  If you do choose to have this as one of your missions in life, I hope that you will share your URL with me as well.  Looking forward to seeing more happy bloggers....
