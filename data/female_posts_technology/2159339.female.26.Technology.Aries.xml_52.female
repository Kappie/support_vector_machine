Who cares that you don't work out and you're pale and pasty? Dance, Dance! People are cool when they release their demons of self-consciousness and just are who they are.   I once met this guy named Forest and my friend Gina and I hung out in his cramped studio before a show. On the way to his house, we passed by a Thai restaurant and he told us to look at this picture in the window. He said it was the coolest thing, and it was: the picture was a candid unflattering photo of Keanu Reeves eating dinner there. When we got to his apartment he gave us beer and was really excited to show us all his new rubber stamps that just arrived in the mail. Then he played us all these cool songs from his record collection. Scattered around his studio were all these random kitchen utensils, because he was attending the culinary institute. I asked about that and he told us about how he once rang his neighbor's doorbell to try to give them 2 lbs of cookies he'd baked in class.   When I feel weird and odd among the squares and bores in my office, I think of this grown man's impressive array of funny rubber stamps ("Look, it's a gun!") and I feel alright. I feel okay. Life isn't bad and I even laugh a little... on the inside.
