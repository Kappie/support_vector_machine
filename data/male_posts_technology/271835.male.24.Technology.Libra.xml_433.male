I don't know what it looks like yet as I'm still downloading it but the article has claims of it being better than a PS2. In your hand. /drools...     EDIT:  Considering it's a grainy encode of a camcorder video shot off a screen this looks surprisingly good. Nintendo are going to have to make sure the DS is even better! Ooh a console in each hand.     link (indirectly) via  urlLink 0xDECAFBAD .
