And I have to say that after  urlLink reading  three of her  urlLink articles  published  urlLink till date , I thought that she sounds very superficial and clichéd... perhaps even vacuous. And this is not the quality of content I expect from BBC. Perhaps, Preity could start her own blog to publish her thoughts.  But at least she writes!
