I've gotten hard drives, a sound card, a DVD+-RW, and a case. All that's left is Mobo, CPU, RAM and a video card. I can't pull the trigger, and I don't really care right now. I'd much rather spend the 500 bucks on friends and good times than on a computer I don't need. I was playing games last night and realized that I was enjoying myself. If I can enjoy my games without upgrading and spending the extra dough, then why should I?  So I'll be upgrading my fashion sense instead. I have never spent much money on the packaging of Tim. I will now be buying a new wardrobe to go with the new slender Tim. Well, I need to go deposit the paycheck.   Catch you later-
