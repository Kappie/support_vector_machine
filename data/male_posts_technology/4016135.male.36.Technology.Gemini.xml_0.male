His name is Willie Williams and he is an entering freshman at the University of Miami. He's also a convicted criminal. The details can be found  urlLink here.   So this guy has been arrested  10  times in the past 5 years and was on probation when he was recruited to Miami. Okay, so maybe he's paid his dues to society and has learned his lesson. Everyone deserves a second chance, or in his case, an 11th chance, right? Well, incredible as it may sound, while he was at the University of Florida on a recruiting visit, he had THREE complaints filed against him. One for hitting a man in a bar, another for hugging a woman without her consent, and another for setting off three fire extinguishers in a hotel. And this guy was just admitted to the University of Miami.  Am I the only one who sees the ridiculousness of this?? So he's one of the top high school football players in the country. Because of this, the University of Miami is willing to ignore his considerably shady past so that he can play football for them. Never mind that he's got a rap sheet that equals his football talent. Never mind that he caused all sorts of trouble on his recruiting visit. Hell, he can tackle people better than anyone else so screw all that other stuff. The U of M administration has got to have their heads up their asses if they think that this guy will suddenly become a model citizen just because they felt it in their hearts to give him a chance. Oh, and it's all gravy that he can play football. The university says that they will be watching him closely and will hold him to a higher academic standard than anyone else. Wow, how noble of them.  Here's what's going to happen. The guy is going to end up in trouble with the law again. Whether it's for burglary, for assaulting someone, or worse, for rape, it's going to happen and it's only a matter of time. He'll probably get suspended for some games, then go right back playing football while his court case is pending. Then at some point, the university will be forced to kick him off the football team and take away his scholarship. But just before that happens, he's going to declare himself eligible for the NFL draft and some sucker of a team is going to draft him in the hopes that he can be a stud linebacker for them and keep out of trouble.   The tragedy of all this is that a) letting this guy into the university denies a spot to a student-athlete who truly deserves to go based not only on athletic talent, but also on character, and b) Williams is not going to learn his lesson. Why? Because he's going to play football. Everyone is going to tell him how great he is. He's going to have his posse all around him influencing him more than any teacher, coach or counselor will. In other words, he's going to be "big man on campus" and have no incentive whatsoever to learn anything from his past and try to be a better person. The guy is a train wreck waiting to happen. As a father, it would scare the hell out of me to send my daughter to a place where someone like that could run into her at some party. Does that sound too extreme? Well don't discount it because it happens with more and more frequency these days. Think about it. How many times have we seen news stories about young women at colleges getting drunk, being slipped a drug that knocks them out, and getting raped. And the reality is that many incidents like this never get reported, so don't think this is some isolated phenomenon.  So Willie Williams, congratulations for being admitted into the University of Miami. I'm sure you'll be a stud out on the football field. Maybe you'll prove me wrong and stay out of trouble during your time there. My bet is that you won't. You'll get into trouble again because you're too too stupid and too much of a thug to know otherwise and you'll surround yourself with homies that will suck up to you and teach you all the wrong things. The university will ultimately ditch you like yesterday's meat scraps because that's what you are to them. A piece of meat. They'll kick you to the curb and move on to the next talented but troubled recruit because the pressure to win and remain a premiere college football institution is too great for them to care about what happens to a delinquent like you.  Welcome to the glitz and glamour of bigtime college football.
