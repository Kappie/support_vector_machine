Why isn't there public military honors for dead soldiers returning home? Is it to avoid depressing pictures on the nightly news?   "The scene so familiar to older Americans -- of the military honor guard in white gloves, respectfully accompanying from the aircraft to the waiting loved ones the remains of the fallen warrior in the coffin covered by Old Glory, often with a military band offering an appropriately solemn piece -- was simply banned."   Then the author draws a correlation to Viet Nam:   One of the most enduring criticisms from Bush's fellow conservatives of those Americans, especially liberals, who opposed the U.S. war in Vietnam was that, as a consequence of that vocal opposition, no parades or bands or celebrations were held to honor and welcome American veterans returning from that war.   To have conservatives blame the war critics for the lack of military honors shows what a warped view of the world they have.  I predict this "military honors" issue is going to become a bigger and bigger thorn in Bush's side as time goes on.
