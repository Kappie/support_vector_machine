Here's a question... how long before you know someone, do you tell them about your blog? I mean obviously there are people you can never tell. (*mothers/pastors/children*)  Should you let your friends know your personal thoughts? You online diary?   Should you hide it and not let anyone else know? Should you be up front about it, and let them decide if you are worthy of being a good friend by giving them a full picture? Or do you let them only see who you are now?   People change. Obviously. But I AM still the man who thinks that cahlen should have said  urlLink fuck   Wow, my history in a nutshell... put on display for the whole world to read. My friends don't write here anymore. But, I'm not really surprised. We've all moved on, basically.  I'm living in an entirely new house, but Cahlen is living downstairs now. Some people that have blogged here, I don't even know anymore.  I'm sure as my life moves on... this, too, shall pass.  Perhaps I will fall madly in love with someone. Maybe falling madly in love only happens in the movies. :)  We'll see, I'll try and keep you posted as the adventure continues... Peace-
