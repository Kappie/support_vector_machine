I spammed everyone on my phone with a open invite to come down to THE bar after work and get bladdered, but due to crapness on behalf of JT I don't think everyone got the messages. Anyway, a fair few people turned up. We ran over to Chicago and saw Donna (Toasterfillette) is now working behind the bar, complete with blonde hair and glasses. Hello Donna. Anyway, so cut to a few hours later, Baity, Scott, Captain Kirk and myself had worked our way through most of the cocktail list and our now severely pissed. I remember having several drunk one-sided conversations and generally acting the goat. I remember kind of being in Liquid, kind of almost getting into a fight because I was chatting to some girl I know from work and her bloke was taking exception to it, I remember my nice Seiko watch dropping to the floor after I wacked my wrist on the metal bar (Custard, can you fix it please? The little pin bit.. er.. broke. Thanks)  Anyway,  if we carry on drinking at this pace I think we'll need to start going out about eleven to ever see 2am closing time.  Oh yeah, that dream I had about Grist... er.. all the Toaster Files crew were on a bus heading along Viccy Avenue, and there was all these modified Japanese cars like out of Fast and Furious racing along behind us. So we are all looking to see who's winning,  and it's Grist - but he's on a rickity old bicycle. He's in front of the pack, weaving between the cars and we give him a big cheer when he passes the coach and wins the race. Is that not the most bizarre dream ever? Nurse!
