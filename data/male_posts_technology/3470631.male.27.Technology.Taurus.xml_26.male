That said, when you step back and think about it, it hurts!   You can't sit around dwelling on it though, noooooooooooooooo! You gotta get your ass out there and take care of that FUCKING DOG!   If anyone feels like being my big brother figure and giving me advice - please let me know. I need a mentor on multiple levels -- job, personal, etc.   Does the saying - He who dies with the most toys - still dies -- have any relevance? Is this even related to anything I've written today? Does this blog ever make sense?   I'm toying with the idea of making this blog into a Single Guy in the City type deal -- chronicling my SEXCAPADES with young underage coeds and older cougars alike.   That would be the stuff of fiction though, since I've got a good story maybe MAYBE once a month. And that is generous. MORE LATER
