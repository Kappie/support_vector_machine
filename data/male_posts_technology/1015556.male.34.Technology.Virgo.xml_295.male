Up until now, I've read a lot of their blogs, but never commented or such.  But I started last night.  I guess it will be ok.  I'm not sure why I was hesitant to do it, and am still a little... but just not sure why.  But I think with each comment I add, I will start it with "I'm not stalking you but..." haha that's funny, I like it.
