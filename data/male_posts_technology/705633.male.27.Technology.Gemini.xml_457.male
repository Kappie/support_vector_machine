This is the contents of my head at the moment:   - Going to see Jackass in a bit  - Maybe I can get in another quick Splinter Cell session before I go  - Arn't relationships just one big cliche?   - My god, Custard has posted stuff.. !  - I am a geek, but a nice, happy geek.  - I haven't been out for ages, Saturday night is going to be a bender  - Sun beds are not the work of the devil  - Will Grist come out Saturday  - Has Andy arrived yet, and is she actually talking to me?
