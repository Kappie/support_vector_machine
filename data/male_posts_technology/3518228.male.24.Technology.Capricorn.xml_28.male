This would be well and good if I were motivated enough to come up with my own content management system.  I am not.  So I went and found  urlLink blogmax , which is a system to maintain a weblog using everyone's favorite editor, EMACS.  It works fairly well.  However it seems geared toward someone who uses a single machine most of the time.  I do not.  Now, I share my home directory and most of my files across my machines using CVS.  This is really a nice thing, but it doesn't play well with the kind of structure that blogmax likes to use for storing files.  Also, the longer I thought about it, the less sense it makes to store a weblog as flat text files.  Something like blogger (do I really need to link that), where they store the entries in a database and use some dynamic voodoo to generate indexes does make a lot more sense.  So I'm switching.  And I'll be honest, it's mostly because I'm lazy.  There's nothing wrong with the system I was using before, it just requires more motivation than I have.  The project for later tonight: see if I can transfer my old entries from the flat text files they live in now over to blogger.  Shouldn't be hard, provided that I am allowed to create blog entries that predate my creation of this blog.  We'll see.  :-)
