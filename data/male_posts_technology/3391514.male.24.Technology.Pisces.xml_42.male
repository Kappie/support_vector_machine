NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO    Derek Smart, of the infamously bad  Battlecruiser  series, has apparently got his hands / is looking into getting his hands on the  Freespace  licence. For the uneducated, Freespace is the best space combat sim EVER, bar none.  I say "Good luck", and hopefully something good will come of this.  Otherwise... damn him.  Moving along... not much has happened today. I managed to miss an RPG thanks to misinformation (and then the bastards had the audacity to not even bother to confirm things were on), and so had the session compressed into about 20 minutes.   It involved me wearing a jellyfish on my head.  I also got to play some  UFO: Aftermath  (which was as exciting as usual), and completed  Unreal Tournament 2003 , to an utterly underwhelming 'ending'. The last character for my upcoming  Mage  game was finished, and it may well be starting on Monday... oh dear.  Following that, watched some vintage  Transformers  and now I'm typing this.  Whoo.
