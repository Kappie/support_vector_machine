This is due to a major server upgrade to the most important software package at work (gotta upgrade the only NT server to Service Pack  6a, then install a JVM for EJB).  Since I usually wake up around 11, breakfast is more a lunch issue.  Today, I decide to eat the remaining packets of Quaker Instant Oatmeal.  Open the package, what do I find?   Larvae!  The package was completely infested in some sort of insect.  Jamie almost puked, and I decided I wasn't so hungry anymore.
