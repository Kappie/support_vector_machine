She remembered the pool and asked me about it when I told her I was out working in the yard.  She even told Jeremey that her daddy was getting a pool he remarked that it was just a little kids pool.  Karissa then said shutup Jeremey it is a big pool.  It was pretty funny.  I told her about the best circus on earth coming to town the Ringling Bros. circus and how daddy went to it with his Grandpa when he was a little boy.  She then told everyone how the circus was coming to Houston.    I did have one moment of set back that really infuriated me, at one point Karissa went to ask me a question and said "Uhm Jon I mean Daddy"  That just made me really mad and very jealous but I went on as though nothing had occured.  I have to admit I felt a little guilty as I had to cut down Karissa's swing set today the wood is just getting too rotted and old to let her play on so I figured if I can get rid of it before she comes then she will not remember.  Of course I could be wrong :)  She then asked me to tell her a story.  I started with Once upon a time (Karissa said I have to start that way) there was an evil witch.  I stopped there and said I can't think of anymore but if you have been reading this you know that I had a lot more but could not tell her.  I asked her to tell me a story and she told me about an elephant that was bigger then clifford the big red dog.  She also told me a story about giant bees that would come and eat you.  I added a part about Super Rissa Roo in her pink cape flying down to help me.    She said oh look walkie talkie and pressed the button on the nextel phone and I lost her.  I am half tempted to get a nextel phone just to talk to her with that feature.  I also spent a good portion of the day working outside it was hot but nice as well.  I hung out with Manly from next door.  Manly and his wife Kandy are good people.  Manly and I hung out and had a cook out and BS'ed.   I ran into one of   SFW's   friends at Wal-mart.  She said I looked good with the weight loss and all.  In fact her exact phrase was "where did all of you go?"  It felt good to hear that but I know I am not where I need to be.  She told me how she does not talk to Sarah (another of   SFW's   friends) much and that she felt what Lisa did to me was wrong.  I told her she would get no argument out of me on that.  I saw her new baby something   SFW   can't say and I am sure if she knew she would be pissed off about it.    All in all a relaxing day but a good one as well.
