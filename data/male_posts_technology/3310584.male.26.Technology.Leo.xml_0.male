While this is easily done with windows XP, you have to be careful using the My File and My Documents folders.                 Unlike Linux, Windows was originally designed as a single user system and keeping your personal files personal takes a little extra thought. In Linux, your My Files or Home folder is inaccessible by anyone but the owner and the computer administrator. In Windows, you must save your sensitive documents under your profile (  usually c:/Documents and Settings/"your login here"  ), in order to be safe from prying eyes. Trying to store files anywhere else on the hard drive will leave them open to anyone who logs onto the computer.
