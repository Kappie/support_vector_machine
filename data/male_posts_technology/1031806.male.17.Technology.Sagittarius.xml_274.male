There's almost no perceivable user support base, and the free version only allows you to post five posts with no archiving, worse, without informing you, it deletes the oldest post to make way for the newest. Because of this, I lost 7 links without realizing it. Here are the ones left and I'm removing my Sideblog account:   The largest diamond ever discovered  (10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 carats)  Just in time for Valentine's day:  'The science of love'  (Are we "literally addicted to love" or is that just the prairie voles?)    Media Engine  (The front end to the in-car computer that I'm hoping to install soon)    Sudhian goes Linux  (You know, all those tiny PCs?)    "No message please" iPod engraving  (great, now you're forced to personalize your illegal mp3 player...)   Video:  Why the Mars Rover Failed  ("the rover went like, [wildly swinging his arm around in a circle] and the wheel came off!" -a 4yr old boy)   Guys make the world run smoothly  (Arise leafblowers, and take back the Canadian border with a tactical nuke!)
