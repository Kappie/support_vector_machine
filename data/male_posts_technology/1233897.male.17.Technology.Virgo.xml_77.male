Not much happened at school, but afterward, my mom and I drove all over the retarted city trying to find this one airsoft handgun that everyone carried, but no one had in stock.  It was bugging me that we weren't finding it, but I had kinda suspected that I would have to order it online anyway.  Then that night, right before youthgroup, my parents and I had a big blowup - resulting in my not being able to attend yg.  [may elaborate later ... currently too tired]  This morning, I left school for 2 hours after 2nd period for an orthadontist appointment.  The actual time in the othadontist's office was realitively short, but I didn't really feel like going directly back to school, and my mom didn't care, so we spent a while in an army surplus store checking out different swords and handguns n'stuff.  I was opporating really weirdly when I got back, losing my notebook, and overcoat twice in two hours...  I guess I need more sleep or something...  Oh well, I'm off to do juss that.   O, I am really enjoying cable modem. :)  I downloaded more than 150 songs and music vids in the past week.  I've developed an interesting liking to Good Charlotte, Taking Back Sunday, and AFI.  Currently watching: Days of the Phoenix - AFI
