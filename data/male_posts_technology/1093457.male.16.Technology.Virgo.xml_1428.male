No idea why Tom hasn't blogged so could you blog please Tom? Thanks :)  I've been helping out with the production for the Tempest, I've been doing costumes and set and stuff so wheeeeeeeeeeeee! Yay :) The show is looking great, really good acting with some great sounds and lighting in it so come and see! tickets on sale from the box office at break times. Students are £4.00. It rocks.   Andy when is Brazil Night? That would be helpful for you to say.. lol.
