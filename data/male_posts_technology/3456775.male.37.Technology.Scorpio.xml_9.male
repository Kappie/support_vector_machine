The burn was even, the draw was easy but not loose (I punched mine). I got it down to just under 2" before I had to say G'Night. At that point the draw was heating up and what was unsmoked was fairly mushy.   I did get that 'perfumy' hint a couple of times after hitting the 3" mark. I have experienced this across a number of cigars. I'm not sure what that's all about.  Another plus was very little cigar taste this morning. I hate strong "night-before" cigar taste when I wake up.  If you like Don Diego and other mild cigars, try the Primo del Cristo Corona. I can't speak for their other sizes but from other reviews I have read they're all pretty mild.
