I used to think it is one bunch of anachronistic people who dont keep up with time. And our culture is not as old as we think it is. The thought that Bharatanatyam took a proper shape after the Britishers made strong in-roads is shocking news to me. We have very very very little documentation on Pre-British India. Or Pre-British south india rather. Whatever we have there are few who can understand and translate to readable forms. This is the state of documentation, what about performing arts ? It has to be practised with all the traditional values intact, piety, grammar and creativity. The question now is:   Can a culture, an ethos be recreated in a modern setting?  -V.R.Devika    There is going to be a lecture demonstration in Bangalore tomorrow(26/6/2004) at Wilson Garden. If there is anyone interested in bharatanatyam, its tradition,etc.. and residing in bangalore or ready to make a trip at such a short notice for such a cause, here's the address: Attakalari - Center for movement arts No. 24-04, BTS Bus Depot Road (Behind Mandovi Motors Ltd.,) Wilson Garden, Bangalore - 560 027.  I wish I were there tomorrow.
