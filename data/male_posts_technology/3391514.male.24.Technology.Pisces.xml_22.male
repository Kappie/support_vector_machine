The special effects were generally excellent, the soundtrack was typical but listenable, and the plot was believable enough.  I don't have any major gripes about it, so it rates 8.5 / 10.  I reckon I'll be off to get the soundtrack soon enough.  I also managed to finish the latest edition of my PBeM and send it on its merry way.  I'm interested to see what the players reactions will be...  Watched  "Half-Life in an Hour"  this morning... some of the tricks have to be seen to be believed.  Truly awesome stuff.
