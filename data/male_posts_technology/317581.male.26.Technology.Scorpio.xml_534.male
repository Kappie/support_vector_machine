But I AM trying. I know sometimes it seems like we're back at square 1. Sometimes I think I have left my feelings for her in the past.  I do want to find someone who will fall in love with me, but I'm having trouble. I think I don't have time for a relationship right now. I just need to make my priorities.  Anyway, I wanted to let everyone know that I AM trying.  Peace- T
