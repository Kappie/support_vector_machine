Is it enough to breath? Somebody rip my heart out And leave me here to bleed Is it enough to die? Somebody save my life I'd rather be anything but ordinary please  To walk within the lines Would make my life so boring I want to know that I Have been to the extreme So knock me off my feet Come on now give it to me Anything to make me feel alive  Is it enough to love? Is it enough to breath? Somebody rip my heart out And leave me here to bleed Is it enough to die? Somebody save my life I'd rather be anything but ordinary please I'd rahter be anything but ordinary please.  Let down your defences Use no common sense If you look you will see that this world is this beautiful accident turbulent suculent I'm feeling permanent No way I won't taste it Dont wanna waste it away  Sometimes I get so weird I even freak myself out I laugh my self to sleep It's my lullaby  Is it enough? Is it enough? Is it enough to love? Is it enough to breath? Somebody rip my heart out And leave me here to bleed Is it enough to die? Somebody save my life I'd rather be anything but ordinary please  Is it enough? Is it enough to die? Somebody save my life I'd rather be anything but ordinary please I'd rather be anything but ordinary please.   Avril Lavigne, Anything But Ordinary
