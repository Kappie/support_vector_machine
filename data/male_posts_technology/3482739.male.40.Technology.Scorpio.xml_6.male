Mrs. Beavis is going to head down to Anderson Island to hang with friends and I'm getting to go to the Dead shows in Portland and the Gorge!  Well, ok, actually, I may not get to go to Portland cuz my friend thats miracleing me (is that a word? heh.) can't find me a ride from Seattle.  And, truth be told, a ride to the Gorge is still not confirmed.  Still, this mega Kind friend of mine is actually SENDING ME THE MONEY to go to the Irvine show down here in Cali a week from today!  You just can't say enough about people like my pal Iggy.  He's an amazing person.  Period.
