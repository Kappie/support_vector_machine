    
       Last weekend Baity and myself joined eight others in a V8 muscle car odyssey, driving up from Bournemouth to Santa Pod raceway near Milton Keynes. We were heading to the MOPAR euro-nationals. MOPAR combined name for all cars produced by Plymouth, Chrysler, Dodge and another company I have forgot the name of.  We camped next to the drag strip, saw some stupidly over-powered cars and generally had a damn good time.  I would write about it in more detail, but I’ve had a killer migraine all day and I’m heading back to bed..  urlLink so here's the pictures.
