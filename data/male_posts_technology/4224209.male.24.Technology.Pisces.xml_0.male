They're a true BUDGET network what I mean by this is that only a small population of the country are really that poor that they just have no choice but to go with T-Mobile.      Allow me to explain. I called T-Mobile last night for the 5th time to try to get access to my voicemail, a trivial task for many other networks but not for these guys! When you call T-Mobile there is no option to actually talk to a human being. If the electronic voice prompts don't cater for your needs you are supposed to just hang up but I found a way around this, press the button to report your phone stolen and you get straight through to someone. Orange, Vodafone and O2 have options to talk to someone but not T-Mobile!      I spoke to someone at 9PM last night. He informed me there was nothing he could do for me. He couldn't even access my account details because the system was being upgraded. I asked if there was anyone else that could help me but there wasn't, EVERYONE'S SYSTEM WAS BEING UPGRADED. I didn't believe him so I diligently hung up and called back and got through to someone else but lo' and behold I got the same answer. I would have to call back after 7am to get Customer Services. After complaining for a bit the T-Mobile representative informed me that I was "paying for the network and not for the customer service".      So when T-Mobile systems are being upgraded there is no provision to cater for any customers that may have a problem. I used to work at a small company when I was 16 which had an employee base of 23. I remember one day the coffee machine was being fixed and while they were doing this they had temporarily installed another coffee machine for people to use.
