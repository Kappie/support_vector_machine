Work takes a lot out of me, by the time it's Friday I just feel so wasted - the commuting to and from Penrith sure takes it's toll. Good thing I've moved to Mascot as of today. :)  In any case, so much has been happening I haven't had the time to actually reflect and write something meaningful in my blog, so I guess I shall just recap my last week as best I remember...   Friday  Went out for drinks after work with one of my colleagues (well, he's actually a client because he works for one of the business units that we are servicing in the project) at MINC across the road and after 4 beers I'm totally gone despite many requests to stay I leave because I would have collapsed from exhaustion and alcohol induced drowsiness very soon.   Saturday  I slept. Not enough, though.   Sunday  The dojo had a little exhibition at Coogee Randwick RSL - despite 3000 brochures being distributed around the area, the attendance was pretty poor. I should also say the organisation wasn't great and it was rather last minute so I guess it was to be expected.  I had a short exhibition match and I did alright, though it really highlighted my lack of fitness - everyone was commenting how I ran out of gas in the bout. Well, 5 weeks of not training and 4kg of extra weight will do that to you.   Monday  A VERY long day, work was alright but due to the usual crap that sometimes crops up, I had to stay later than normal and fix up some workstations on short notice - only problem was that I was going to see Steve Vai at the Enmore Theatre! I made it with plenty of time to spare, but not having dinner and having to queue up in the rain didn't do much for my mood.  Pity it turned out that way, I would have enjoyed the show a lot more if I had enough rest to actually stand the whole time! (Yes I had to sit down even though I didn't want to because I was just so tired...) Vai was awesome and so was his band - all top notch musicians. A bit self-indulgent at times, but hey no one was there to see Steve and band play pop songs! The sound was bad though, I think the theatre's got some acoustical issues that totally destroyed Brett Garsed's opening set - totally turned me off even though the music was great. They really pushed the PA as well, things got so loud during Vai's set I heard distortion from the speakers! *sigh* It frustrates me more because it's supposed to be my "thing". Good thing I had my earplugs or my ears would have been fried - I can only imagine how loud it was up next to the stage. Poor bastards...  I ended up getting home at 1am, which wasn't really a big deal - however I hadn't packed because I was off to Tasmania the next day. Oh god.   Tuesday  Felt totally shithouse because I slept a total of 2 hours after getting home late from the Vai show and trying to pack up my stuff for the Tassie work trip. We get to the airport around 2pm and have a bit of a bumpy flight into Hobart - I swear the plane landed on one side first, I thought the wingtip was going to scrape the ground for a second!  We arrived in Hobart after 4pm so we basically couldn't do anything but check into the hotel and start work the next day. It was good though because my colleague and I got to have a good long chat with our supervisor about work and stuff in general. We seriously have not had a decent conversation together with her since we started at the beginning of June.   Wednesday - Friday  Basically capturing data from Hobart and Launceston sites, with a 2½ hour drive to Launceston. Tasmania is very sparsely populated - 6km out from the city areas and you're in the bush already, no kidding! I'm in a better mood after having decent sleeps in hotel rooms without having to commute - all the nice hotel food helped as well. :Þ  Despite our getting back to Sydney after 8pm, there was a huge queue for taxis and I ended up getting home around 10pm. My fare back to Penrith was cheaper this time because we weren't stuck in traffic because the driver didn't go via the city - only by $15 though. I will say this again, thank god for CabCharges!   Saturday  Tried to sort out through my stuff, unsuccessfully. Ended up bludging and sleeping most of the time.   Sunday  Panicked in the morning and just started throwing stuff into bags (which is what I should have done in the first place) and hauled my ass (and all my crap) down to Mascot. After that, I drove my dad's friend up to West Ryde to his sister's place and had lunch with them. Finally sorted out my stuff and put my computer back together (pretty obvious from this post!) and my new room looks absolutely fabulous - hurray for built-in wardrobes! :)  Oh, and my new address is... um, probably shouldn't put it on the net. Just ask me next time you talk to/chat with /see me.
