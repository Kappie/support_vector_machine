But hey its worth the fight right?   as3367: There's not much else that's worth that kind of effort. Its the key to being happy in life, and being able to get through whatever it throws our way.      I think that I have been feeling a little macobb recently because I lost sight of what I wanted out of life and what really motivates me. I spent almost three years in Kentucky trying to find that out. I though I had at one point. I knew that I was comfortable with my self and had things going prity well to. I just need to find that rhythm again and learn to dance a new step.
