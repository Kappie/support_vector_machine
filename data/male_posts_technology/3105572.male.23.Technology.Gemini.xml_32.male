It's so easy to think sometimes that we're beyond hope, or that God doesn't hear our prayers. The truth though is that no matter how much we sin and how short we fall of God's glory, he is always standing by ready to forgive and accept us back There is nothing we could ever do that is so bad that God would not be able to forgive us. He loved us so much, that he sent his one and only son to pay the price once and for all. Even if you were the only one alive, Jesus still would have died on the cross for you. Jesus said that no man has a greater love than this: that he lay down his life for his friend. That's exactly what Jesus did for us when he died on the cross. Most of us will probably never have to sacrifice our lives, but we must be willing to sacrifice our way of life. When we become a Christian, we must put our old ways to death and daily take up our cross and follow Jesus. I encourage everyone to daily seek God and to do everything for his glory.
