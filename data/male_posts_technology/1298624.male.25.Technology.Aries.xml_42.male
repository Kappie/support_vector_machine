Of course, I feel fine now. I'm trying to sort out all the things I have to do in my head. I have to get my credit card payment out. It's due on the 29th and today is the 23rd. I also have to move my car from the direct sunlight. That thing can get severely hot with all the heat. I have to clean around my room, make a file for 21st Century Insurance stuff.   Damn I forgot, I also have that Jury Duty notice. I hate Jury Duty. Now that they's making it mandatory (or rather THREATENING people with fines for not replying), I really think it's not fair for the public to endure wasting a whole day of their lives, waiting for their number to be called. I wouldn't want ANY government to take one day out of my life, possibly wasting my time (more than likely), without my consent. Forcing people to do something does not bring adequately suitable people for a task as serious as being in a jury. I don't want to do it. I don't want to be responsible for a decision the government should do.   end rant.
