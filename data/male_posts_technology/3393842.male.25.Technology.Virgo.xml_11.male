    
       Every introduction starts with this simple two letter word. So here is mine. I intend to share a piece of my mind on music, technology, philosophy and general things of interest (pretty much covers the universe doesnt it!! ;) ...).   I intend to keep this blog free from copy-pasted stuff, instead provide links to the sources, am absolutely new to HTML,scripting, et al., and dont hope to learn much. Hope blogger.com lets me continue to share my thoughts inspite of that.  My favorite blog used to be  urlLink Anya's . Yeah used to be cos she's stopped that blog (probably continuing under another nick and blog). Now I restrict to a couple of techie weblogs  urlLink Joel's  and  urlLink KC's .   See ya all blogbudds at the end of the day. Got some serious keyboardhitting and neuronfiring to do.
