Every person I meet has a tale of a bunny-boiling ex that they had to get a restraining order on. Why is this? Is there something in the milk that causes people to go around the twist? It's apparently nowhere near as bad off the rock. I know that Jersey has high rates of alcoholics and people with real mental health problems, but I postulate that there's thousands more, just ebbing beneath the surface of insanity, waiting to go batty.  Increasing seems to be younger people too, certainly I've met some girls under 25 that have scared me silly. Women complain that it's the guys that are nuts, either out for a one-night shag, stalkers, sexual deviants or subscribes to  Pigeon Fanciers Monthly . There must be some kind of ripple effect going on. Bob goes out with Mary, but Mary doesn't know that Bob secretly has a sexual leaning towards covering himself in Vaseline. They break up. Months later, Mary strip searches her new date, Colin, for Vaseline before they leave her flat. Colin think's she's a raving nutcase and this vows to carry pepper spray with him on all future dates. You see where I'm going with this?  There must be a pocket of normal guys and girls somewhere, that just want to go out together, have dinner, have a few laughs, see if the chemistry is right and then have some (safe) sex. Facts of life - people get together, have a relationship, sometimes it doesn't work and they break up. Sometimes hearts are broken and that's sad. But get over it people, don't a few bad dates turn you into a emotional cripple that's jilted for life. Dust yourself down, leave the pepper spray at home and go have some fun.  I thank you.
