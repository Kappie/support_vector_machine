           
      Well I finally did it.  I put something in the russellminer.com root.  I am sure several of you who have meandered to this site in the past year or so have been befuddled at the apparent lack of a website.  In truth, I have developed a fan website for a game i play, World War II Online, at  urlLink http://www.russellminer.com/acec , as well as use the website to host random tidbits I work on from time to time.  This includes projects that fall under my part time passion to become a games developer ( urlLink http://www.infinitemonkeystudios.com ) and assorted other goodies that stem from my full time passion of being a games player :) .  I hope that through this web log (blog), i will actually make this site something friends, family, and random folks may enjoy popping in on and knowing whats up in the life of Russell Miner.
