I'm trying to link quantum physics with existentialism. In other non school related thoughts I keep getting freaked out by this country I live in. What is the deal with people who are around me I can't find an intellegent conversation to save my life. Do people really watch those realty tv shows? What kind of thought process is running through peoples minds when they want to go to war in iraq and now syria. Do people think that the privates in the army went into the armed forces to serve the US or to escape their oppresive economic situation. Does the majority of americans think that the us goverment doesn't abuse it's power or that Bush actually has their best intrests in mind? Please people don't let me loose my faith in humanity.
