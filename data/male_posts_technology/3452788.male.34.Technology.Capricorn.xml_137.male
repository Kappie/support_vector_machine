I am mostly honest with her, but I am also on my good behavior, the listening, understanding, agreeing me. Underneath, I am thinking " she's trying to psyche me ", " what a load of mind-bender shit ", " what you say is nice here, but not in the   real   world ", or " my friends are better therapists that you ".  Yesterday at the end of the hour, I accidentally let that facade slip a little. She said "see you next week", and I flippantly said "yeah, if you want me to come back...". That got her attention, and she said "what does that mean?" I said that I wasn't sure, it just popped out, and she said maybe I should say what I really was thinking. I said "OK, I'll be here next week if *I* want to come back," which really is what I was thinking, but trying to disguise it in a perceived rejection from her.  After all the talk about not mind reading or assuming the other person's feelings, I still think she was a little taken aback at that exchange, because I think it totally surprised her - she could not hide it. I wasn't too surprised, because I have always been prone to saying exactly what I think, with brutal honesty, at the least appropriate moment, and damn the consequences.  Why am I thinking this way? Have I set her up as an authority or an expert, and now I'm looking for ways to tear her down?  Maybe, I always distrust the "experts" . Have I entered a self-destructive phase where I don't want help?  I don't think so . I really think I have just grown tired of letting someone look at my life who doesn't really understand me, who has some good answers and valid viewpoints, but nothing I could not reach with a little help from friends, or fellow blockers with similar problems.  I guess what I mean to say is that the talk therapy has about reached the end of its rope with me, at least on a weekly basis. I have read a lot, educated myself, and given myself better tools to deal with these issues on my own, with limited assistance.  If you think I'm full of shit, please tell me, and I will be happy to listen.
