You might as well tatoo "Enter Here" instead of that cool little butterfly design that you thought was edgy.   Now as far as I can tell there are only 2 reasons why a girl would get the tatoo there: 1) it seemed like a really cool and rebellious thing to do when I was 16, and my personal favorite reason: 2) I'm a dirty slut.  I once "dated" a girl in the second category, and sure enough she had a tatoo on the small of her back - it never fails.   Don't get me wrong - I've got nothing wrong with a girl who sports this badge of courage - but if you're gonna party with me you can check your emotional "daddy didn't love me" baggage and your HIV test at the door.
