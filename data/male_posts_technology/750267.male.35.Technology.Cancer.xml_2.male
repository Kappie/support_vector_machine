I have been split between Heather and Dorothy for the last half of the season, finally settling on Heather.   Dorothy could not possibly be the mole if you think about it - she won a number of games at the last minute (car/greenhouse,  the mind puzzles). Moles do not win games at the last minute - they would be better off barely losing games. I also felt like Heather could not be the mole. She hadn't apparently sabotaged any games, and she physically looked too much like last season's mole, Katherine. So why, after eliminating these two in my mind, didn't I pick Bill??? That is the question...  I never, ever suspected Bill. One thing I decided early on was that people who were 'too nice' or were 'trying too hard' to win, for lack of a better term, could not possibly be the Mole. This eliminated Al, Bill, Lisa, Katie, Myra, Darwin, Patrick, and Rob. Whoops. I guess the mole can indeed be 'too nice'.
