Peeler can be valuable in deeper leagues that count 3 pt. percent and/or 3 pointers made. Of course, he'll be playing with Gilbert Arenas, Steve Blake, Larry Hughes, and Juan Dixon at the other guard positions. I can't see him raising his 18+ mpg, 5.8 ppg, and 2 apg. He might keep up with his nealy 1 3-pointer/game, though... And he does look like a thugged-out baller in his league photo.        Count it.
