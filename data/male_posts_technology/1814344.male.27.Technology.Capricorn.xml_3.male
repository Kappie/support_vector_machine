Most of my younger years were spent in La Mirada. When I got into High school I spit my time between La Mirada, La Crescenta, Montrose, and Santa Clarita where I live now.  I am 27 and have a six year old son. My religious beliefs are not the norm I would say. I am single, 5'8", have been in committed relationships but have never been married, green eyes, pack some extra weight as I almost always have, and am straight edge. Straight edge for the most part that is. I do not drink at all...Anymore.   I like computers and technology, my kid, my job (kind of), and studying. I do not like religion, WWF or anything like it, religion, dancing, clubbing, and religion. Guess there is more that I do not like huh.    Matt
