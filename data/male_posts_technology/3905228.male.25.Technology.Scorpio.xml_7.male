Not the part that experiences and enjoys life,   as a form of some sort, but the immortal soul that travels the universe.    Although our time may not be very long in this life, I am happy beyond compare to be able to share with you this time of happiness and joy.   I am grateful to you for always being there,     for loving me and allowing me to love you .   No matter what happens during the time we are here, wandering life's many paths, each time I think abt U,  It brings my heart new hope and cheer.   I want you to know that I love you for Always.
