You can either draw it freehand and scan it, or use one of the various Paint or Photoshop programs, or any other way you can think of. Then send it to me at boz48730@hotmail.com and I will make a photo page of some sort where we can check out our blogmates in all their splendor. Ability isn't important, but participation is.  I will post the portraits as they come in, but the deadline will be Wednesday 10PM EST, 9PM CST, 8PM MST, 7PM PST, and Thursday 8AM in the Philippines.
