Hammond is more famous for the song  It Never Rains in Southern California   and being daddy to one of the Strokes.    I found this song along with other weird stuff on a newsgroup.  It was with the rest of the 1974 and 1976 Dutch Top 40.  The Dutch liked some weird stuff.  The less said about the Al Martino's disco version of  Volare  the better.    I'm also now the owner of some George Baker Selection tracks other than  Little Green Bag  all of which suck.  How could a song called  (Fly Away) Little Paraquayo   not suck?  The sole gem of the bunch is The Walker Brothers  No Regrets .  That song is just amazing. sigh...
