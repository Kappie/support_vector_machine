She shows lots of personality and you can really tell what mood she is in, compared to earlier pictures.  She is adorable.  So glad that she won't have to have those nasty eye exams anymore.  I had several retina exams and know how miserable and painful they are.  Must be even worse for a little baby.  The good thing is, her eyes are O.K.    Can't wait to get more pictures and soon I don't have to look for pictures, just take look in person.  Gina, give our love to your Mom.  I know she will enjoy being with all of you.  Love CO Mom and Luke
