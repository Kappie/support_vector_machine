Katherine has graciously offered living with her for a short while until I find someone else to room with.  I am going to move the majority of my stuff into a storage unit and move the necessities over to her townhome.  Actually, I've already moved most of my hanged clothes and shoes.  Over the weekend, I hope to pack up everything so that I can get a mover next week to bring it all to a storage unit.  No way am I going to try to move my couch, queen bed, bookshelves et cetera by myself.  

The real kicker here is that I didn't give my apartment enough notice that I was leaving.  When I went from the year lease to a month-to-month lease, they never said anything about a "twenty day notice".  On a month-to-month, that's a huge amount of notice!  I wanted to move out at the end of July but they are so graciously allowing me to pay $1470 for all of August.  They said that if someone moves into the apartment, they will pro-rate the amount and pay me back.  I somehow doubt that is going to happen!  Sigh.
