By a funny coincidence, the Democratic National Convention is   also   in Boston, and its URL is boston04.com. The inevitable confusion is quite humorous -- the organisers of the WorldCon have compiled a list of ways in which the WorldCon is unlike the DNC:     # We're not $10 million over budget. We don't even have a $10 million budget.  # Our promises for the future are supposed to be fiction. # You don't have to donate thousands of dollars to us (though we wouldn't complain)â€”we'll give you a high-level appointment to work for us for free!  # The media will not outnumber the attendees.  # Thoats and banthas are more interesting animals than donkeys and elephants.  # The folks wandering around with walkie-talkies are likely to be helpful and friendly.  # The slogans on our buttons are actually funny, and many of them are about cats.  # No one will be kissing babies except their immediate families and friends.  # When we talk about "skull and bones" it's probably in a discussion about paleontology.  # When we sling mud, it's probably in a workshop on making alien pottery.      urlLink Read the whole list . Come back for updates.
