Funny how I can just refer to my coworkers by their game names. It works, but it's kinda weird. Especially at Red Robin, it seemed a bit wierd.  Anyway, Church group was good last night. Met some people finally. As you may or may not know, I'm only an outgoing person when I want to be. And if I'm comfortable, I may not be as friendly as I should be. So anyway, it was good to be more friendly and get to know people-ish.  I'm going to see "FOTR" again on saturday. Did I mention that I LOVE that movie? :)  Also, Houck is coming up this weekend, and we're going to go to a comic book exchange on sunday. YAY:)  Anyway, for more excitement check  urlLink this  out.  Ciao- T
