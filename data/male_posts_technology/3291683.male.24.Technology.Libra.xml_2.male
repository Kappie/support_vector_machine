I've been futzing around with side-projects (like I've written about half of a system to re-prioritize jobs on the job queue in an intelligent way), but none of it assigned.  But he's done even less than me over the last 72 hours, which is...  Reassuring.  Makes me feel like less of a hanger-on.  Still don't have anything really useful to do today, though.  They want to put a fourth person into our office, though.  I'm not particularly thrilled about the thought.  It's already one of the highest-traffic offices in the building (yay being support for the production systems...), and adding another person can only make it worse.  Of course, the rumour is that they're considering bricking (well, probably dry-walling) up the inner doorway (to my boss's office) and putting a door through from her office directly to the outer area, so people going to see her won't have to go through our office.  The only thing I'm afraid of then is the thermostat; it's in her office, and when the door's close, it becomes oven-like and unpleasant outside her office.  Opening the door stops it, but it'll be worse if they move the doorway.  Either way, a fourth person in here will start getting crowded.  We'll have to remove a bookshelf and two filing cabinets, and move the network printer, for the most likely position.  I voted for removing the random desk under the coatrack and putting the fourth one there between the two guys with windows (not me, of course), but I got a lot of "What were you THINKING?!?" glares when I suggested it.  It's not MY fault it's the most convenient place to put a desk, that involves the least rearrangement and removal of furniture, whether or not they want to share their wall.  There's enough room; they just don't want the company.  Or to give up their windows and move closer, so they won't have to talk across the fourth person.  When it comes down to it, though, our entire department is outgrowing our area.  The upstairs here (we're on the "second floor", because even though the first floor is double-height, there's nowhere where the second floor is anything more than a stairwell) has Tech, XICS, Internet, IT, Editorial, Special Projects, Quality Assurance, Graphic Design... And - just to top things off - the CEO/Co-Owner.  Lots of people spread between...  I think four actual departments, with lots of sub-groups.  There are a couple of empty cubes, but no empty offices, and we have two people in-coming, plus hiring calls out for at least one more position.  To even handle those three I know of, we're probably going to need to take an entire group and move them...  Though to where, I'm not sure.  Well, it's not really my problem.  I'm just a lowly entry-level programmer, at least technically.  Most of the time, we can really use the manpower; we really needed two more programmers than we had, back in November.  Silly cyclical project schedules...  So my poor wife had to come in early today, because of the time she missed yesterday afternoon with the cat.  Got up at 5:00 AM, after four hours or so of sleep.  I feel bad for her.  She was somewhat bitter about my getting to sleep in.  Of course, the cats got her revenge for her...  One was cuddling me while I was half asleep at 6:00 AM, and then suddenly bit me for reasons I'm still not certain of.  I think he just doesn't like to have his belly rubbed, but both other cats do, so I was confused.  Either way, it woke me up...  A full two hours before normal.  I wasn't particularly amused.  But it was nice anyway, because he's been so unhappy-seeming and non-cuddly recently.  It's nice that he's finally back in a somewhat cuddly mood.  I've missed it, even if it did often mean being woken up at an unfortunate hour in the morning.  Like this morning.  This morning also had an interesting and disturbing first-time event for contacts: when putting in my left one, it managed to fold in half and go entirely under my lower eyelid.  It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out where it had gone.  I felt like SOMETHING was in my eye, but I couldn't see it, and I couldn't find it in the sink or on the counter...  Highly disconcerting, let me tell you.  :)  In other (non-me-oriented) news, there's a  urlLink commentary  here about Star Wars Episode III.  While it's kinda cruel to Lucas, I do hope he manages to pull it together some for this movie.  The Anakin Skywalker from Ep. II has nothing in common with the dark, planet-shattering malevolence of Darth Vader.  At least Yoda had an interesting personality in the first two.  The word on the "final battle" (after all, don't ALL the Star Wars movies have a big important final battle?) scene sounds...  Gimmicky.  Anakin and Obi-Wan dueling while surfing on hover-boards over lava?  Ummm...  Well, I suppose that's one way to get put on life support.  Ah, well.  Back to the grind of...  Errr...  Well, doing nothing.
