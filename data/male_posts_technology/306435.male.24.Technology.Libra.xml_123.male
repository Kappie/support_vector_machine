Monday I went to work and then Marissa gave me a ride to the airport. There I met up with the lovely Ann and we flew to West Palm Beach airport.  It was a nice flight and we made it to the airport a little early.  The next five days was filled with beaches, pools, sun and fun.  I think Ann had a good time.  My Aunt Betty has a very beautiful condo and the weather was warm with a little rain.  My dad, brothers, and Ann all went golfing twice.  It was fun.  I have not been golfing in a while and Ann had never been at all.  She made Matt's day by letting him drive the cart one hole.  Got back from Florida and went to work for a few days and was asked to work desktop support for a week or two.  I am still working desktop support as opposed to the help desk.  It is good because I get to go to people's desks and build computers.  Then Ann came in on Wednesday.  She was kaming her way around the country before she heads out to Montana at the end of the month.  We went out for Indian food twice, went to the E (a bar in Hyde Park), bowling, and hung out with a ton of people including the likes of K$, Marissa, Bethy, Susan, Rob, some guy named Jeff, and Chris Hatch.  Sunday, Ann was happy because she got to attend the second Team General victory.  We defeated Elmaer Dessens' brother Omar 13-6.  I went 3-5 and had 4 RBIs.  General no showed again and there is a rumor he has been transfered and moved to Birmingham, Alabama.  We played the game 8 on 8.  At first, it was embarasing when 5 minutes before game time we had four players.  Then when the other team only had 8 I didn't feel as bad.  Anyway that is my last two weeks. Ann left today for Washington, D.C. and is going to be there until her new niece's baptism next weekend.  Until I have more to write...
