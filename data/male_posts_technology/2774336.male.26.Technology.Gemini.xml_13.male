 So the peanut MM's are definately a cause of trouble for me.  My diet today was basicly the same as yesterday, except for more sandwiches and less MM's.  I had too many MM's again at around 7:30-8:00 and I'm paying for it now at 9:42.  My lower abdomen, below my belly button but just above my belt (I wear my jeans low) is gurgling and I'm belching and passing gas.  One thing I've been noticing with this the past few weeks is that I can't stop salivating when I'm having these issues.  I bet its related. 

 I'm tending to think that the problem with digesting these candies lies more with the nuts than the chocolate.  Other chocolates don't bother me like this, but I have a hard time with mixed nuts.  Is it the protein?
