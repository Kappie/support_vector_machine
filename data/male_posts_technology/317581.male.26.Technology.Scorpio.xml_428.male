Last december I started getting thirsty and would aften end up peeing about 8 times during the night. Cindy made me promise to go see a doctor as I was also losing weight w/o even trying. I promised her that if I ever hit 200 lbs that I would get insurance and go see the doctor. In may I hit 200 lbs (a whole 60 lbs less than I had been in november, and about the weight I was when I entered college) and I went and got health insurance. June 2nd I went to see the doctor. He told me that I had probably diabetes, but he wouldn't rule out cancer. So I pee'd in a cup and came back tuesday morning for my blood work to be drawn.  Friday it was confirmed that I had diabetes. About that time I went on a low/no carb diet. That lasted about 2 weeks. Now I'm on a limited carb diet. A diebetic nurse thinks I'm in my honeymoon period. No one wants to say it, but I'll probably be insulin dependent in the year. That is where you give yourself a shot of insulin before every meal.  I started working out there for a while. That's one way I can control my sugar. My buddy, Cindy, moved to idaho and I lost interest in working out. I forced my bosses to find low carb supplements for when they ordered dinner for our team while I was working. I have come to deal diabetes. When the time comes for insulin shots, I will be ready for that as well.  Now I'm on my break. Cahlen and Karla are moved into our free rooms. (see cindy and sean moving out) Peter and Dan are in love with my friends that I've asked to move in. We had a house party last friday night. It wasn't as rowdy as some of the previous parties, but it was good.  I think you're now mostly all up to date. Signing off as your diabetic friend-
