Read the comment I posted http://stupendoussteve.blogspot.com/2004/07/on-today-and-possibly-tomorrow-and.html#comments   The email I sent you was "delayed", stupid Hotmail.    My Mom gave me a list of things to do and then you  could  come over, I won't be able to get them done by tomorrow, but maybe you can come out here next weekened. That'd be cool :)
