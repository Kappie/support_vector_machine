I'm a bit of a Lawrence fan (even though I'm THE incarnate avatar of Whiteness), ever since Bad Boys and his sterling performance in Nothing to Lose (one of the best comedies I have ever seen.). But Black Knight is such an example of mass-produced Hollywood  shit , that it will take quite some doing to restore my faith in Mr Lawrence. He should have his agent shot. What with being  black  and all, he could just have him 'hit' in a driveby. Obviously Mr Lawrence is content to live within the stereotype, as is evident in Black Knight, so why the hell not?
