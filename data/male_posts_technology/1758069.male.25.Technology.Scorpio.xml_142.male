"this bush is no more.....it has ceased to be!"    my parents are flying in tomorrow evening.  hopefully i can wrangle some new clothes out of mother.  she loves to bribe me for my attention.  and if anyone else wants to do the same, i shan't complain.  actually my cousin is getting married in new orleans saturday, and when you think about it the whole wedding concept is just one big bribe - we bribe the couple for free food and drink by showing up, and in some cases giving gifts (and giving it six months), and they bribe use with food and wine so that their half of the church fills out and they don't look like losers.  how sentimental am i.  the only thing i'm looking forward to is drinking to the happy couple.  i'm feeling so generous i may drink to several happy (or unhappy) couples.  especially those recent ones in massachussetts.  it makes my heart smile to see jerry fallwell squirm.    album du jour:   urlLink   medicine        the mechanical forces of love    urlLink   medicine's  new singer, shannon lee, is the daughter of bruce lee.  and their original singer, annette zalinskas, was a member of the bangles way back when.  i'm a useless fact monger.
