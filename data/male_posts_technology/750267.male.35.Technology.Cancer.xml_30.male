Flat panel  urlLink LCD monitor . Bigger the better. Good, 17" LCD.  2.  urlLink Digital camera . One of those $600 4-megapixel puppies.  3. Wireless network. Not only do the devices  urlLink look awesome , I could get rid of this ugly bright blue CAT-5 cabling to goes from my office to my living room.  4. Ultra-light laptop. My 10-lb laptop is killing me -- I would love one of those  urlLink 2.5-lb babies .  5.  urlLink Sony Cliï¿½ . Listen to music, take pictures, PDA... gorgeous and practical all in one.  6. A new cell phone.  7. A  urlLink DVD-RW drive  - 4GB data storage.  8. XBox, Playstation 2, Nintendo GameCube - any one, doesn't matter.  9. Those gorgeous  urlLink plasma TV's  that you can hang on the wall or the ceiling. Mmmm....  10. A Caribbean vacation! (Well, I can afford the plane ticket, but I can't afford to take the time off work!)
