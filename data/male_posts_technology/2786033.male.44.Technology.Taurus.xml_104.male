Some of their more histrionic new neighbors have been harassing the club in courts for years.    Didn't those newcomers notice that they were building their yuppie palaces near a shooting range? Didn't they wonder why the land was so cheap?  Perhaps they should be suing their realtors?  In the latest round of litigation,  12 of Eugene's wise citizens have awarded the neighbors 28-grand in damages, because the nearby creek  might be polluted with lead.    EVEN THOUGH NO FEDERAL, STATE, OR PRIVATE AGENCY HAS EVER FOUND ANY!!!   The Neighbor's claims have NO BASIS in science or fact.  I do hope that the club will persist through to the state level.  I am confident that they will get the judgment overturned.  Maybe they'll even recover their legal fees.  In a perfect world, one particular ambulance chaser would be disbarred.   Another way the left is undermining the second amendment is by litigating against any business that helps an ordinary citizen gain the necessary proficiency to bear arms.  We see lawsuits against manufacturers,  impossible zoning requirements for gun shops, and all sorts of bogus noise and pollution complaints against ranges.    I wonder who's next?
