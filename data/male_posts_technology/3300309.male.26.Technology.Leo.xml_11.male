Our resident Symbian  smartphone guru and all round Scottish member of our blog has a rather cool  article on the contents of his gadget bag. Ewan truly shows that it's not  what you have, but what you use it all for.          I have to admit, a tear came to my eye when he  writes about the netBook and the NeoGeo Pocket.          Here's the link:           http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/whats-in-your-gadget-bag-ewan-016234.php           You can also view Ewan's community site  http://www.allaboutsymbian.com           Best wishes          Jody
