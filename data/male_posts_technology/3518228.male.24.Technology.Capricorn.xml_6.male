Anyone you list on the BCC field will get a copy of your email, but will not be listed as a recipient.  BCC is the  only  polite way to send mass email, short of a mailing list.  I understand that when you're moving, it's simpler to dash off a quick email to everyone in your address book than it is to deal with us all one at a time.  However any mail where the To: field is nearly as long as the body of the message is inherently rude.  So please, people, be polite to the people you correspond with.  If you're going to send mail to more than one or two people, just bcc us all, and leave the To: field blank.
