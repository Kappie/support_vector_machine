Fuck that Nancy with a cherry on top. Of course this means I'm too early to catch Super Cheap Autos, so I trudge home and wait till 8:30 so I can book an appointment with the doctor to get the A-OK for excercising. Cunts. Anyway the doctor can only see me if I can make it there in about 20 minutes, so I scrape the bottom of the barrel and taxi in with nothing bigger than a 50c piece, see the doctor, weigh in at exactly what the home scales say -phew- and blood pressure checks out fine, she signs the form, and off I go.. oh wait I've got 70c .. bugger.. its about 5km home, Arse. Or about an hour if you want to put it in them there terms :D So I get home at about 12:30 wanting to grab some change for the bus, and get back into town for my business meeting at 1pm.. hmm.. nope, that aint gunna happen, so I ring and bail, and commiserate with some hot chips. Nearly stand in dog poop getting the laundry in, cant get Doom3 to write to cd's because I've never come across .cue files before, and sometime during dinner prep I get another, stonking migraine. Thanks :D That said, it was a gorgeous day, and within seconds of starting to talk to ol' shorty I'm a bag of smiles, o/~ I get by with a little help from my friends o/~ Adios :D
