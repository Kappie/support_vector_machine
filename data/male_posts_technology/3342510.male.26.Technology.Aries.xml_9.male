Missed the tournament i was hoping to watch (warhammer rogue trader), didn't get to see any of the movies i wanted to see (Van Helsing or Troy), painted a bit of my warhammer models (i should put a picture up some day) and had a staff meeting (somebody please shoot me, being the only guy in a room full of insane females is not fun)  Oh and now that the weekend is over.... back to work.
