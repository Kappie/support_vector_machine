Something like: - culture game - study on Romans 12 (different gifts, etc.) - Myers Briggs test, including charting the people on your team for where they are - the Hardy Personality - study on Phil 2 maybe - everyone's status on fund raising - the 8 great questions (taken from the Short Term Missions Workbook)  I hope it goes well.  I'm going to have my mountain climber, Applachian Trail hiker friend G come for Prep #4 and he is going to do some serious team building initiatives.  So we talk about it this time and next time, whoa that is going to be hott.
