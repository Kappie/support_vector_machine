Everything was set up for a blast - no wrinklies (we'd call our folks 'wrinklies' back then. Yup, childishness and immaturity was order of the day...), just us, a boatload of booze and hemp and the beauty of untamed nature. Not that we were bothered with nature. We spent most of our free time playing pool (they had a pool table, yay) and listening to music while under the influence/stoned. Like I said, young and stupid.  Anyway, on the way there, the hostess started getting touchy-feely with me, holding hands and giving me the old batty-eyes routine. I won't say I wasnt interested, but she just wasn't really my type. In retrospect, I should have persued a possible relationship - she was outspoken and vocal as opposed to my timid and shy - a perfect medium to extract me from my shell, but when you're 17 and a geek, fear is all you know.  Through the weekend she , at first, did everything short of strip naked to show me her intent of dragging me into the sack with her. Later on though, it seemed mindgames and playing hard-to-get became more appropriate - just as I started showing interest. My frustration began mounting. Inner turmoil and a desire to just take advantage of the situation mingled with my own insecuirity complex and fear of rejection produced a roiling thunderhead of conflicting emotions which pretty much paralysed me. Before I knew it, 2 days had passed and it was time to go home. Nothing had happened. I could almost  smell  her dissapointment - I could certainly feel my own gnawing away at me. Our lift arrived to return us to the capital, and we began our unfomfortable trip home. Somewhere along the dirt road, the pickup broke down. We had to walk a few kilo's to the main road. And as we were walking along quietly, I realised just what a waste the trip had been - how I had fucked it up. Our chirpy hostess made some comment which I can't even remember - I think she mocked us for walking slowly or something - and I snapped. At the wrong person. I called her a lousy hostess. I shat her out for such a lousy weekend. I ranted I wanted nothing to do with her, and stormed off. Funny how you can do and say exactly the  wrong  thing, and so spectacularly, when you are young and stupid. The lift fixed his truck, picked us up, and we returned home in one of those really long uncomfortable silences that you remember for your whole life. I could have said sorry then. Stubbornly, I chose to hold onto selfish anger. Thereafter we saw little of each other. I met her the last time about a year or so ago, and she had really flowered into a beautiful, mature friendly  married  young woman. We talked a short while, but I could see a glint of vehemence behind her eyes. Like me, she still remembers that weekend.  At least we have something in common.  Both of us hate me. ---
