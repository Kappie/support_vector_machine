Apparently she will likely be linking to it soon, so I'd like to extend a warm welcome to all of her friends, friends of friends, relatives, and others that may wander on in.  Hopefully this won't change the nature of my writing, nor my relationship with my blog.  I was thinking about talking about what my blog name means to me, but I think I'd rather let people figure that one out. Those who know me intimately, may have a shot, a long shot, of figuring it all out.
