I figured what the heck since it's probably historically significant, and I should know what it is expressing for the sake of conversation at least.I asked my friend, Jenica joined us. She came over early and brought over some music Ithink ispretty cool including   Alan and Jenica at Loew's Theater     She's a democrat, too... we drove over to meet Alan together. All in all, it was pretty lame. It was all about Bush and why he sucks as president (according to Michael Moore). But how many presidents have we had that haven't had similar issues surrounding them? I mean, people get to be president for a reason. I like the way everything is going now, and I think putting such an opposite as Kerry in office right now would be very damaging to the economy and our country. Fuck that. Please don't take this as an argument in support of Bush... I don't have the time for that.  Then we went to Bar Louieon the Waterfrontand had some drinks and conversation about the movie, etc...I'm waiting on some pics from Alan from last night. I'll post them when I get them.  -Ryan Riehle
