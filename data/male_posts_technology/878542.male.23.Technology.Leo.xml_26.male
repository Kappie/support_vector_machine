Both annoyed by my responsibility to the government, and happy to be using the internet, which seems like a freedom enhancing thing to me.  It's like talking to your oppressor over PGP or something, a mixing of metaphors and associations that isn't quite unpleasant, but not good either. coffee that's just been poured over ice cubes, and it's both hot and cold.  but, I also get a tax return soon :-)
