More than I ever had before. I literally enjoyed every minute of it. Even when she fussed. I know that the 2 things that My Father in heaven has allowed in    my immediate life are my daughter and my realtionship to God. These are suffice to bring anyone through.      Today was an offset of Saturday. I have left that behind looking to see what awaits my future. I am looking for that open door. I know there is a purpose and a plan and I am not ignorant to it. I just have to stay tuned into it.   I don't exspect anyone not even my own family to understand me right now. This is why my realtionship with Jesus is so very important. In difficult times family and even friends will shut you off .  There is only so much people can deal with. It is 6am monday morning and for whatever reason this Blog has taken 1 and 1/2 nights to write. I sleepy all day after having one of the greatest fathers day dinners I have ever had cooked by my father. I enjoyed my time with my father. I wish he would have spent a little more time with me. He trys his very best. It is difficult for him to show feeling so under his hustle and bustle of gettting things done his heart is in the right place usually. Sometimes his pain. pains me. For some reason there is something very great missing in his life. He trys to fill it up with other things. My heart is that one day he will find what this is.
