Didn't even have time to eat the bread that I bought from Carrefour yesterday night. It was really mind boggling to play scrabble so early into the morning when your brain juices ain't functioning at optimum levels. Remind me never to do that again ...  Had to rush home after lunch as the painters were coming by to paint the front door of my house. Ended up spending the afternoon watching LOTR III at home. As it was a three hour plus movie, by the time it ended, I had to go with my family to Hougang Mall for dinner with my extended family.  Oh if you did not know, we had been doing this for the last couple of years already ..Dinner at Hougang Mall on Sunday evenings. It is becoming sort of a family tradition. I had a bowl of homemade noodles and I was lucky as the noodles were pipping hot when it was served. At least it managed to keep me warm, as I was sitting right under the airconditioner. Darn cold ...  Came back with a new padlock for our gate, as the old one was starting to give us problems .. Mum also bought a new tshirt and before long we were back at home again ...hopefully tomorrow would be more eventful ...  DiLloN
