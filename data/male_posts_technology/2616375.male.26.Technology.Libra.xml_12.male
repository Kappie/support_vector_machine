    
       RSS feed for this blog is available now at: http://feeds.feedburner.com/WhenTechnologyIsOnlyAPartOfTheWhole  The service is provided by  urlLink Feedburner . The above URLs make sense to people who would like to consume my blog's feed as RSS rather than Atom (myself included)..  RSS Syndication was on my mind for long. Tejas had created a RSS service for me and sent me a mail on how i can enable the RSS feed for my blog. He had proposed a service from  urlLink Feedster.com .  I browsed through the offerings from both services. The one service that Feedburner has is it's ability to provide statistics of people subscribing to my feed. This was missing in feedster.  There were no modifications required on the blog's template for feedburner unlike feedster. Finally, feedburner is supporting all the RSS versions while feedster supports only RSS 2.0.  So, I am settling for  urlLink Feedburner  as it was offering more services than feedster.  I remember where it all started from -  urlLink Tejas . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.
