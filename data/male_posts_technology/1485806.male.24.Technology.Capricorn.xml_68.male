Selepas tu saya pula bawa kereta dengan selamba menuju ke TTDI Bukit Kiara. Dlm perjalanan, Dewgem, seperti di pagi yang lain , sentiasa bersenyap and cuba seupayanya untuk menutup matanya seketika untuk mengambil masa yg dihilangkan semasa menungguku......  account from Kayanbutter while driving.  As we arrived at that place, we proceeded unto stretching ourselves...with the monkeys by the same common name of AuYong Wai - **** , proceeded to the strecthing pole as well as the monkey bar . Dewgem, seems to be in her standby mode strolled along the path and tried to sleep while standing .  Me? I am just stretching out with no hard effort and accept the reality that i am just overweight and no little stretching would do much good.  But we had a good time with AuYongs leaving me and Dewgem in the dust ..running along the path as though there is a chun chick up for grabs....and me ..well just strolling with a consistent pace , a common technique called walking but improved with faster pace...  Dewgem and I talked a lot on Christian stuff and schools..ministry...speaking in tongues...and did not realize that we have walked 2 rounds...and then we literally bumped into James and suprisingly Angela.. As we waited for Auyong monkeys to come back after their 3 round, we hang out near the lake where terrapins and fishes swam in that murky water which we can hardly see.  It is good to know that our influence in blogs as well as this healthy culture start to spread to particular penangites. to see them in the morning is a miracle and indeed their fellowship are a blessing to our group.  We had breakfast later....and of course..hopefully James would come back and join us in our quest to a healthy lifestyle....  On the next blog, watch out for the review of the 2nd chapter of Not Even A Hint : Ps Joshua Harris. by me  In the meantime go to www.joshharris.com and His Blog as well : joshharris.blogspot.com for more info on the book.  My first impression is "Look no further, Wait no more,..the answer to our common struggle is here"  Lust , masturbation, sexual immorality, pornography, recent rape cases, sexual temptation, homosexuality, sodomy ...you name it all...it is covered in here...  Know your enemy, Identify and relate with it .....Break Free and be victorious over it with Jesus.
