But other songs (like the dream ones) will only work on the ethereal or celestial plane.  So, yes, you can ethereally zap Tom.  You succeed, btw.  You've got 3 minutes of rational thought.  He doesn't lower the gun, though.  "No it didn't have to be this way.  But it is now.  You interfeared.  You stuck your nose in and you shouldn't have.  And now we're leaving."  He starts to get up from his seat, trying to get Zara to come up with him.
