Thought this one was neat.    urlLink Jeff Buckley :  urlLink  Lilac Wine     I lost myself on a cool damp night Gave myself in that misty light Was hypnotized by a strange delight Under a lilac tree I made wine from the lilac tree Put my heart in its recipe It makes me see what I want to see and be what I want to be When I think more than I want to think Do things I never should do I drink much more that I ought to drink Because (it) brings me back you...  Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love Listen to me... I cannot see clearly Isn't that she coming to me nearly here?  Lilac wine is sweet and heady where's my love? Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?  Listen to me, why is everything so hazy? Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?  Lilac Wine, I feel unready for my love...  Inspired by Nina Simone's rendition.   Where did my Blog's title come from?  urlLink Futurama .  Fry and Amy hook up in an episode, and there's a line where they're talking, and Fry says something to the effect of "I feel like I can talk about all sorts of stuff and, you know, junk with you."  or something like that.  Exact quotes can't be recalled, deal.   Nina Simone-alikes Mentioned Nina Simone to my co-worker and she started in with "Booy, if you like you some Nina then you just might like..."  and started to name people like  urlLink Nat King Cole ,  urlLink Miles Davis , urlLink Harry Belafonte ,  urlLink Lena Horne , and others.  I'll have to get myself a sampling of some of this.   Dark Materia  urlLink Dark Materia's   urlLink Audio  section: The Picard Song.  It's just wow.  Of relevance, maybe, Materia was the name of various power stones in Final Fantasy VII that could be implanted into weapons or armor and imbue new abilities and teach the bearer magic or skills.  Not sure if this is the source of Dark Materia's name, but, hey, hearsay and guesstimation is just as good as truth in today's world.   Post title:   rand()  , the  urlLink C++ function  to generate a random number.  Yeah, I think thats enough for now.
