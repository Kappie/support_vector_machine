My mum didnt cook, called hy and she need to do OT, called ganjie whose suppose to be at clementi but in the end she not going anymore, justin going home, so no khaki to eat dinner. Asked my mum to da bao something for me instead and went home early. In the bus on the way home, saw lots of ppl joggin and excercising and thought that how nice it would be to start excercising again like in NS. Now i know y thomas can get so unhappy when he dun get to exercise. Had a nice 40mins jog to Bishan park and back and surprisingly, i dun feel tired at all and my stamina is still intact cos i never stop thruout the run. And i feel so wonderful and fulfilling after the run. So was thinking of trying to do that every evening before dinner. Make it a Before Dinner Run.....The run totally destress me and i feel so good after sweating so much. One Word "SHIOK".  Wanted to watch Private Parts opening on 28th july at the esplanade but ant find khaki also.....looked thru sistic website last nite and wanted to actually buy the tics online so smsed hy to ask her if she will be free on sat nite. She never reply so i called her and she also never answer.....so in the end i didnt buy cos scared wait buy liow wat if she couldnt make it, who am i suppose to find someone to go wif? Cos she mentioned to me before that she wanted to watch it so maybe do something lor but in the end, she smsed me last nite ard 2 and told me that she had already bought the tics and she will be watching it wif vive.....and she had also bought tics to the moscow circus.....:( was so disappointed that she actually bought the tics. not that she not going wif me lah but its jus that she also never ask me anything bout whether i want to watch or anything..... :'( y??? i dont know leh.....well i cant blame her lah...vive her best fren leh.....so i cant be jealous jus becos of that if not i will look totally like a chabo. wonder who she is going to the circus.....well i guess its vive again lor.....hehe.....well at least she's not going wif another guy rite??
