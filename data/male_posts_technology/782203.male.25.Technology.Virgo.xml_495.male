I seriously have no idea if I would have been able to make it through all those months if he wasn't around.  Ok maybe I would but I would have probably been miserable the whole time. Which I definitely was before he came.   A lot of people just don't understand who I am or what I am about, eventhough they known me for a long time. But I only known this guy for 6 months, and he totally got me.  Have fun in Thailand dude, wish I could have gone with ya! And I will definitely come down to Germany and visit you some time.
