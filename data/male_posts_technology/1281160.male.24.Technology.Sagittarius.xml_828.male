Her elder sister Kowsalya said "Look Rama, ur child is only one and half year old. At the bar age of 33, will you be able to work? by staying away from your child and husband  for more than 500 Kms". Rama wholeheartedly said "I want to give my child good education, Infact my hubby's dream is also that! We want to put our child in top of the charts, we want to give him the best in the world"  Rama finally signed her appointment order. She joined as a clerical assistant in Housing development corporation India on 1st April 1977. To tell more about Rama, she was the last child of Sri.Ramasamy and Lakshmi ammal. In Hindu mythology,it is believed that the fifth girl child of any family will be a curse in the forecoming days. Rama was not an exception to that.  When she was 7, her father's printing press was ransacked. The family lost Sri.Ramasamy and also its wealth and prestige. The elder brother-in-law of Rama, has got authentication from Rama's mother from unsigned papers and become the power of attorney of the family. Rama and his brother Srinivasan, Lakshmi ammal was caught by the death trap of poverty.  The IInd brother in law is a dumb folded guy. While, the 3rd sister is about to get married. Rama's brother Srinivasan is on his way to acquire his IIIrd grade form in High school. Rama's elder brother-in-law threatened to suspend Rama's education. Lakshmi ammal, a lady of vision,  supported her children in their education by pledging her jewels.  Days passed by, Rama completed her PUC and his Brother Srinivasan got married to the Pattukottai Highness daughter Alamaermangai. Alamaermangai was brought up with a golden spoon. Rama had a additional burden to her education by washing Alamermangai clothes and assisting old Lakshmi ammal in her daily activities.  Rama completed her BA, and she registered herself in the employment exchange of Madras. Rama's brother Srinivasan became the key of Alamermangai and he started scolding Rama and old mother. Rama and her mother lived seperately following the behavioural change of Srinivasan.  The auscipious moment in Rama's life also took place. She tied her nuptial know with Parthasarthy. Parthasarthy failed in his PUC, passed his ITI and was working as a mechanic in a private company. The parenthood in Rama came by means of Sreevatsan. When Sreevatsan was one and half years old Rama took the decision to get into a job. Parthasarthy and her mother supported her decision.  Rama was first posted in Muttam a small village in Kannyakumari district. Sreevatsan stayed with Parthasarthy, since Muttam did not have the facility to support Sreevatsan in his education. Sreevatsan was longing for his mother during his childhood days. The memories of Sreevatsan struck Rama in her work. Rama came to her hometown, to meet Sreevatsan once in a month. Sreevatsan grew in the midst care of his Grandmas.   Parthasarthy and Rama, gave the best to Sreevatsan in all his academic activities. He was given best school education, good food, clothes, toys and kimps everything. When Sreevatsan was in 8th standard, Rama moved to her home town by getting transfer.  When she came to hometown, she noticed a lot of change in Sreevatsan's behaviour! Sreevatsan spoke to Rama only a little. He was happy with Parthasarathy and his Grandmas.   Rama could not accept the change in Sreevatsan. Parthasarathy assured her that things will be smooth in the fore-coming days. But everything went topsy-turvy for Rama in Sreevatsan's case.   Days passed by, Sreevatsan completed his studies in IIT Rourkee, and he was appointed as Quality Control Engineer in HAL, Bangalore. He loved and married Ambika, who was his collegemate in IIT Rourkee. Ambika got selected as Maintenance Engineer in BHEL, Trichy. Ambika decided to stick to the job. But Rama opposed their decision. When Sreevatsan questioned her she said "Son I was the victim of my son's love , But you 2 don't be a victim of your lovehoods"  Has Rama taken the Right decision?  Is her case applicable in today's reality?
