You can also leave your comments in any of the other threads or trackback and I'll check out your blog.  Just because a site has the name "GMail" in it doesn't mean it has anything to do with GMail. If you are submitting another site that isn't yours for the list, please tell me if you didn't check it out.  I noticed that somebody already has gmail.blogspot.com but that person hasn't updated their blog since March 2002 and it doesn't have anything to do with GMail. Instead it is described as "A newsletter for those that want to learn about the web and computers. Lots of entertaining sites, and answers to common frequently asked questions."  I am working on the screenshots for GMail ... I have taken dozens of them and will be publishing them soon, so keep your eyes peeled and GMail Talk in your favorites!
