I don't know about other people, but to me one of the great pleasures of manhood is doing your business on a pristine, untouched, virgin toilet.  OK, I realize this may be a little weird, but I think the guys know what I'm talking about.  The men's room is one of the last places on earth where the sanctity of male relaxation is still firmly in place.  I have a few bathroom phobias anyway, not sure why.  I don't like multi-user bathrooms.  Not only do I like being in a bathroom by myself, but I like having TWO locked doors between me and the outside world.  Even better, a private bathroom with two locked doors surrounded by a locked gate in the middle of the woods.  I don't allow any family members in the bathroom with me.  The paper has to be OVER the roll, not under.  Whoever invented the little napkin-size square paper dispensers should be forced to use them forever.    There was an episode of Scrubs where there was a toilet on the roof.  If the door could be locked, I would go for it.  If there are any psychologists here, I'm sure that you can identify several Freudian theories about the obsession with the bathroom, so leave me a reference I can find.  I already know I'm messed up, but it would be interesting reading.  ===  OK, I have to do the boss' homework for his business class now.  I guess I am still the geeky kid from 4th through 10th grade who did stuff for people in a misguided attempt to gain approval, but now I get paid lots of money for the task.  Nyaaahhhh.
