Not enough killing!! Muahahaa!! I think my favourite part was still free practice for the 1st kyu grading.  But I'm still happy for those who had taken their grading that day. Hope they excel even further in the days to come.  Yuishinkai's seminar will be starting this Thurs. Having applied for a full day's leave for Thurs, I'll be attending the afternoon session from 2-5pm. My friend had suggested that I drop down for the morning session for a look even if I'm not training in that slot. It's a good idea but I'm not sure I can wake up on time. I'm also planning to go down to Sim Lim to buy my PCI firewire card for my PC. It's high time I started burning some of my videos from UK and the grading on Sun into CDs. Hope I can finish this fast instead of procrastinating.
