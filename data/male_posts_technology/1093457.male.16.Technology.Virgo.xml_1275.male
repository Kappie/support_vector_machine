As yet I have done no school work, which means tongiht and tomorrow I have an awful lot of work to do. I have three peices of coursework to be done and numerious peices of homework. I have done no revision or even looked at any of my work.   I feel that I may be retaking my exams... the fact is, I have no urge to do any work. To me it is boring and I always find better things to do, such as habboforum.  The holidays have been quite good, Been to Thorpe park, Brighton and the cinema, But thats about it. I would of liked to go to the cinema  again, but most people either can't be bothered to come, have no money, or they have too much work to do.  One last thing, I have now recieved my skirt for work, so I am now wearing a skirt, If you wish to laugh go ahead. Fortuantly i may be allowed to wear trousers as we had a little talk about equal opportunities and equal rights... :D  So this is my blog, I may not blog much for the rest of the week as I will be extreemly busy finishing off coursework and doing homework. Goodbye.
