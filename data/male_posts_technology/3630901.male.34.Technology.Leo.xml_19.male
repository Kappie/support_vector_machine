I thought, "cool, they're going to deliver it to my house - now that's convenient!"  That makes the 'destination charge' make sense.  But no, I go to the dealership to pick it up.  It's supposed to be there tonight, but I got Yoga tonight, watching the kids tomorrow night, saturday is the hiking/kayak trip, sunday they're closed.  So it look like monday.  Which is fine.  But in order to do the down payment, they can't take a personal check - they need a bank check.  So I deposited funds from my brokerage account, and the bank said the funds would be available after 3 business days -- Tuesday!  Well that doesn't work so well.    Then, Wednesday and Thursday next week I'll be in Philadelphia.  So what, Tuesday -- I don't know if Tuesday works for me.  I could put the down payment on the credit card - up to $3k, they said.  Maybe I'll do that, and transfer the brokerage funds somewhere else.  I also had to call the insurance company and get the new vehicle on my insurance.  Plus the dealership does credit check on me to determine what percentage I can get on the loan -- probably 4.5%.  If I'd moved faster, and bought in April, they still had the 1.9% deals going ... but then no 05.  Whaddayagonna do?  I also talked to E-trade yesterday, to extend my HELOC -- I'll close on that in about two weeks -- they bumped my limit up to $100k.  Crazy numbers, really.  But I can use that credit line to help pay off L's portion of our marital assets.  I just imagine the house will be a great investment that will really pay off in 5 years.  Much better than I could do in the stock market!  Last night's hike was good.  It was just me and another guy, Darren.  We talked a lot about relationships, work, camping, hiking, and religion.  It was exhausting and my left boot was causing me a blister again.  Maybe I'll buy new boots.  I've thought that before the divorce is finalized, I should spend money needed to fix up aspects of the house -- that's fair, right?  Fix the garage door, the trim outside the garage door, haul away all the crap the previous owners left behind (maybe rent a small dumpster for a week), get the water softener fixed, get the furnace checked out.  I've also thought about buying a dish and flatware set that I like, and maybe a new pot/pan set.  That way L can take all the old stuff.  At swimming on Tuesday, I had trouble concentrating on the lessons, because I kept trying to think of a way to ask the instructor out to dinner.  Is it too soon?  Is she really involved with someone else, or is that just something to put guys off?  It could just be a friendly dinner.  I am attracted to her, and it's also partly that I want to have a date, or appear to have a date -- I don't know why -- to affect L in some way.
