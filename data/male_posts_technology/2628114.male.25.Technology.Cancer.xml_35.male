Either way, I have been able to continue running and working out, just not posting.  Since my last update I have gone 4 times which I will discuss below beginning with the most recent first.  3/1/04 I went with Consuelo to the Rec Center at UC to do stairs and rowing machine.  Apparently this is not what these not-so-bright individuals had in mind for me.  Instead of completing 45 minutes on the stairclimber and 15 on the rower, I completed 15 minutes on the stair climber, had a weight set dropped on my ankle/foot, and completed 30 more minutes on the stair climber.  That's right, I said I had a weight set dropped on me!  Right as I got to the 15 minute mark I heard a weird sound then a sharp pain on the outside of my right ankle and foot.  The not-so-bright individuals responsible for this were standing behind me wide-eyed and apologetic for their "not-so-brightness."  One of them was still holding the stupid pin from the the equipment that hit me!  Fortunately, I was hardly hit by this piece of metal and I was able to continue my workout on a machine far from the "Not-So-brightest."  I actually didn't even bleed as a result of the accident but I was still a little perturbed.  Good workout overall though.  Consuelo and I decided to run back from the Rec Center at a faster than normal pace which really did test us both.  It was a lot of fun though to run across UC and through some of the buildings.  (Don't worry, the rest of the posts for won't be quite as long.  I just had to explain the "Not-So-Brights")  2/28/04 I completed a 40-50 minute run tonight.  I had a goal that I wanted to make it to the river from my house.  I set out through Eden Park, down and through Mt. Adams, and all the way to the P Pavilion.  The run was great and something that could be extended for anyone interested in a longer run from here and through downtown and all.  As long as whoever that is has a healthy respect for hills.  My run was moderately hilly in the first and last quarter, but ridiculously downhilly (that's a word) the second quarter, and treacherously uphilly the third quarter.  The temperature was flat out perfect.  I set out right at sunset at approximately 55 degrees.  By the time I finished running, it had dropped to about 48 degrees which was perfect for me.  My body felt great and was overjoyed to be done with those hills in Mt. Adams.  2/27/04 I completed 40-50 minutes tonight with the self-proclaimed slow runner Brad.  We actually ran outside this time through the lovely town of Mayberry, err...  Loveland.  We ran down the hill to some part of downtown Loveland and partially on the bike trail.  Tonight was my first night running any significant distance in shoes other than my running shoes.  Since Brad has run so long, he has like 43 pairs of running shoes with insoles to fit any foot's need.  Brad let me keep the shoes in which I ran, including the Betty Crocker insoles (just bake 'em at 200 for 3 minutes!) for which I am greatly appreciative.  They will make wonderful backup shoes in case (similar to tonight) I don't have my primary running stuff with me and I want to run.  2/26/04 (Seriously, last one for today!) I went back to the Rec Center tonight in order to border my long run (or two medium runs) with cross training.  It is very obvious that spring break is coming soon based on the amount of makeup and lack of sweat present at the Rec.  I completed 45 minutes on the stair climber, level 14, 292 floors, and who knows how many "miles."  I then finished on the rowing machine for 15 hard minutes where I kept the rhythm right at 30 rows/minute.  Very intense which forced a break midway.  My body felt great and ready for the weekend run(s).
