Anyways, I made my way down today for Kickboxing at 6pm and still experiencing pain in my shins from skipping, I didn't really have a chance to ask Doc yesterday but the discomfort's nothing too bad, just hoping I'm not compounding any sort of injury that might lead to a fracture... (Obviously, Sensei Rosie's broken shin from Japan is still on my mind!)  Well, the highlight for today was when Tony was demonstrating how to do a proper low kick and ended up hurting John (not our "Uchi Deshi" or live-in student John, but this other guy) through the pad. Tony delivered a standard Muay Thai shin kick to the pad - the result of which was John clutching his thigh in pain and falling over! I dunno, I guess it was one of those "freak" or "sweetspot" kicks that do a lot of damage even though they're not THAT hard.  Tony (jokingly or not jokingly) said it's my fault since I was John's pad partner for the class so I'd already thrown some 200 kicks at him - he merely delivered the one that crumpled him. Oh well. Poor John.
