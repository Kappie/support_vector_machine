Baset was around, visited our new house, and had dinner with us yesterday. Long time no see. Long time no hear. There were lots of things we talked about. Forget the old days. Welcome dawn.  Today's story: Lina and Unie, both are in Penang today but I wasn't able to see them. Lina called around 1.40pm. Too,  late. Otherwise, I might be able to make twists to my timetable today. It's okay gals. Next time okay.  A collegue of mine, Chan Shing Yu has been admitted to hopital. No, he's not infected by SARS. I went to the hospital to visit him just now. Wow! What a beauty! Tak sangka ada nurse cun giler kat Penang Adventist Hospital, the place I went just now. It's now 8.08pm and there're still a lot students who hasn't arrived yet. The situation is getting worse.
