There are few people whom i cherished and during the years of studying, we have given a part of our lives to each other...sharing wonderful moments in God and in life. These people are as follows; 1) Jessie Teh wan Sin , one sister whom i cherished very much , whom have given me sound advice when needed to and have brighten the days of JOshua Tan. This young , beautiful spunky girl have given her best when it comes to friends in terms of a listening ear as well as good advice and good friendship.  I miss her very much. Currently working in Citibank in JB.  2) Keith Tay Wen Chang , my former sheperd whose life have spoken so much into my life, speaking on life and Christ. One who also have given his best to serve God and in everything he does and say , comes to pass. Currently a great man of God serving with Pastor Kevin Loo planting the church, City Harvest Outreach Malaysia.  3) Bernard Janz , Tan Hung Teong and Warren Wong - best housemates you could ever hope for , who supports you morally and in everything else best friends.....  Hung Teong accepted the Lord after graduation and now he attends Eagles Point Covenant Fellowship. Bernard Janz used to be my Christian Fellowship president who happens to one of the most annointed tambourine dancer .   4) Chang Le Churn - One of the best friends that God have blessed me with. Started out together as classmates and then roomates in the college hostel, then housemates and also best friends. He Accepted the Lord in his second year at Inti College Malaysia. Happens to be one of the coolest guy in college with most of his friends which happens to be of the opposite sex. Currently stay  5) Last but not least Lum Tjer-hann - one of the hansem guys around who also happens to be my life buddies besides Hung Teong and Le Churn. Tjer-hann grows up with me spiritually and mentally,..one of those best friends given the right to rebuke me whenever i stepped out of line. Tjer-hann and me served Christian Fellowship with Jessie Teh and Keith Tay Wen Chang , as pioneers of CHristian Fellowship in Inti College Malaysia Nilai.
