I knew japan and Enlgand were having a friendly match.  I thought I might have a quiet wager at ladbrokes.  Ladbrokes were offering odds of 4/9 on England winning.  Not great odds but that was because England were very much expected to smash Japan.  I did my research for who was playing and injuries.  All was looking peechy keen.  I made a hefty sized bet at ladbrokes and then proceeded to watch Japan draw with England in what was a thoroughly dull match.  Did I lose a little bit?  Well, I've never bet so much money in my life.  Going on recent prices in australia provided by my mother, I could buy over 160 hours in the David Jones car park with it.  And I managed to piss it up against the wall.  Oh well.  Nothing ventured nothing gained.  I think there was the start AND the end to my career as a professional gambler.  But you've got to give it a wirl at least once in your life right?  To top that off I found out that the company I ordered a computer game off, a month and a half ago, has decided to shut up shop and not be contactable.    Brilliant.  I'm waiting for the third bad thing to happen.  I'm picking up my sister tonight who has been travelling for the last couple of months.  I'm very much looking forward to her coming.  I saw her two months ago when I was in australia, but I haven't seen her for three years prior to that.  Pretty scary to think about.  We have a WHOLE lot to catch up on.  Should be brilliant.  I'm sure I'll have a reasonably amount to write about after she leaves.  It should be great fun!!!  I will be taking tomorrow off to show her some of the locaaaaaal sites around here. [queue the archers them music]  She is NOT the third bad thing to happen to me.  I'm sure it will happen before now and this afternoon.  [sigh]  Bring on the good times.
