Stop changing the  ENTIRE FUCKING SITE  and then expect me to change my grading plan without additional time or money! Thanks for keeping up until  3 o'fucking clock  last night, all of it wasted. Stop writing in that  pretentious  so-called architect font that no one can read and  everyone hates !!! Stop wasting  my FUCKING tax money  on overdesigned, overblown monuments to yourselves, for a fucking  dog pound  or for other county buildings. Stop thinking you are  so FUCKING special  and that our lives would be shit without you!!!!  Bee-yatch!  (ok, rant over, back to work) (if you are an architect, nothing personal, but if the shoe fits...)
