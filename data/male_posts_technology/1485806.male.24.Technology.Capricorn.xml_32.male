The pictures are in a support site ...kayanbutter.fcpages.com which can be viewed in a Flash Application I developed to view these photos. Instruction as to use this application to use is quite easy ...in fact in steps like this. 1) Select the folder in the shooting drop down menu and select the times of photos ie Simply United Cell time 2) Then later you will see some photos ...small ones...loading at the bottom. 3) Drag the picture you want to view unto the box which have a faded box that says drag images here.  You can also use some options like to zoom in and out , do a slide show ,print it out or saved into your computer...Have fun ...any comments please comment this posting ....by clicking the comments.
