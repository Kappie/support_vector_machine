That is to say, I have been told that I kind of induce a calming effect on my friends when I hang out around them. My general relaxed attitude seems to help people relax themselves. I think this is true for many people. A general relaxed state (or one of being easygoing) will be contagious to others around you if they are being receptive to it. I have observed it many times. Unfortunately, it can have a vortex effect if you also have easygoing friends. This goes for friends like mine who used to do a lot of pot (and especially while high), where once people start becoming mellow the whole group can sometimes mellow out. This unfortunately turns into one of those situations where   nobody does anything!   So, you get a bunch of people sitting around watching the television who are happy and don't want to do anything in particular, except watch more television. This of course, helps if there is something like... urlLink Weird Science  on TV. Strangely enough I have mostly the opposite effect on my roommate who I seem to just confuse and frustrate. This seems to be some weird science indeed, for the person with whom I live does not get the calming effect. In fact, most of the time our personalities clash. I think he lives with me because I can tolerate him and I am not really that messy. He likes to entertain himself so when he is bored,  look out!  But when he is trying to entertain himself, I also am being mellow and don't really... play along... and this will therefore derive him of his entertainment and hence frustration and confusion. Although, he is one of my friends from college and I have lived with him for about four years (if you count dorm rooms and stuff), so we know each other too well or we are used to it. At least we don't want to kill each other. Because that takes effort, and we are totally against effort. I mean, we are both computer science tech people, and nothing defines us as a people more than "Hey, I am pretty sure that a computer would rather be doing this 'insert manual labor example here' for me". In fact, if we felt like we could invent some electronic killing machine that kills and cleans up after and makes an alibi for the user... then we would be dead already. Or at least my  urlLink bird  would be ;-P.Computers just make everything too easy for me not to be lazy. This is why the US has an obesity problem! Not me, of course, the computer unfortunately does not make my naked body look good in the mirror so I have to go to the gym. Not that I obsess about my self image, I just wanna look good naked. Just like the dad in American Beauty. Ugh... back to work, and that stupid paper.
