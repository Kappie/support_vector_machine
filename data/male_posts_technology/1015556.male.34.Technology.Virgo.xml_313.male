She wants her own CD walkman and the other day her grandparents took her shopping and they bought her a CD, her first CD that she has ever picked out... Scary.... It's scary because I think music has a profound influence on our culture.  And at the age of 6, I think we as parents have to be super careful. For Mustard Seeds, we are going to bring an MP3 player for the plane ride.  And I got a double headphone jack.  And, of course, I picked out our music.  It's going to be fun to be able to listen to the same music... Here are some of the tracks:  Ashton, Becker, Dente - Angels Ashton, Becker, Dente - Song of Reconciliation Ashton, Becker, Dente - No Other Chris Tomlin - Enough Chris Tomlin - Not to Us FFH - Fly Away Hillsongs - Angels Hillsongs - Glory Hillsongs Kids - Every Move I Make Mosaic - Closer Than Breathing Mosaic - If I Step Mosaic - No One Above You Mosaic - What You See Mosaic - Invisible Mosaic - I Live For You Mosaic - Nothing is Better Chris Tomlin / Crowder, David Band / Hall, Charlie Band - Famous One Crowder, David Band / Hall, Charlie Band / Tomlin, Chris Band - Prepare the Way Rebecca St James - Lamb of God Rebecca St James - Blessed Be Your Name Steven Curtis Chapman - Live Out Loud Steven Curtis Chapman - Jesus Is Life Steven Curtis Chapman - Magnificent Obsession Third Day - Come Together Bebo Norman / Caedmons Call / City On A Hill / Sing Alleluia - Holy Is Your Name Newsboys - Joy dc Talk - Between You and Me dc Talk - Colored People Keith Green - You are the One  PS - Funny thing, K is a huge Keith Green fan....
