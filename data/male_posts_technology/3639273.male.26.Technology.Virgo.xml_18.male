Just recently while having a Potluck. I saw the body come together. Each of us with our own agenda However God made it his agenda for us to be there. Time was spent. Breakthrough and ultimately fellowship came. We sometimes think we can turn and turn off what God has given us when ultimately he is the Lord andhas appointed us to live our lives free but slaves to his will. I said yes. When I said yes I say yes to all things. Not just to what pleases me. When the Body meets we meet. When the lord says go to the nations we go. Like a child looking to their father. We must learn to be obedient to his voice as well as his plan. Though we may not know his plan following his voice will ultimatly lead us to his plan.
