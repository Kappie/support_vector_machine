I’m going to spend all of your hard earned currency. I’m going to start a military conflict between a number of nations or political groups. I’m going to start a military conflict between a number of nations or political groups that will acuminate in an escalation into weapons of mass destruction, possibly of the elemental fusion type  I know this one failed, But my lyrics for Westlife have been used for most of their hits!
