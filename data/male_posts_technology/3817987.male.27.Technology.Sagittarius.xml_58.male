After watching some  World Series of Poker  and  Celebrity Poker  over the weekend, we gathered last night to out our skills and I learned that I completely suck.  I am definitely not an undiscovered  urlLink Johnny Chan  or something.  I bet aggressively on shitty cards and quickly busted out.  I have had success in the past betting on horses and college football but I clearly folded in the heat of the moment.  Still I really had fun and I'm looking forward to playing again next month.  Maybe with time I won't suck and just be handing my money away to others.  Hmm but maybe instead of following the tenets of Kenny Rogers  The Gambler  I should use The Clash's  The Card Cheat  as my guide.  Actually, on second thought after reviewing the  urlLink lyrics  that is really not such a good idea.  "The gambler is seized and forced to his knees and shot dead."  Nope I don't want that in my future! :-)
