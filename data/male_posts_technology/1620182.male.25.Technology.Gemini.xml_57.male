My landlord told me that he could not run Internet access into my apartment today.  If you didn't know, I live in a basement apartment.  Aparently, my landlord's cable modem access is paid for by his company and they said no to the idea.  This is quite a bummer.  I was hoping to get my home PC back online so I can chat and read e-mail...maybe even surf the web for movie times or something.  I also wanted to install Linux and setup a web server on "Old Reliable," my Gateway PII 233MHz computer I bought before going to study at  urlLink The University .  I thought I could get my own domain name, set up my blog, put up a wiki for brain storming, maybe host my photos a little better than  urlLink Ofoto  can.  Alas, my dreams are dashed.  
 
 As I see it, I have three means of recourse.  First, I can use dial-up.  How 1995 can we get?  Plus I would need to get a phone line in my apartment, which costs $.  Second, I can try to get DSL.  Again, I believe this would require a phone line first, which costs even more $.  Third, and I hope I can pull this off, I can try to get another Cable Modem set up in the house.  I can have my landlord tell the cable company that he wants to set up a second cable modem for his own personal use...not sure if this will work.  No matter the scenario, this is going to cost me money that I don't want to pay.  I'm going to have to suck it up if I want access at home, though.
 
 In the meantime, I've located two nearby  urlLink Starbucks  where I will be going to drink coffee and surf the web as necessary.  I'm going to need it if I want to research anything outside of work.  Bummer...maybe.
