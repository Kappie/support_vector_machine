It is my last monday morning where I will have to get up and drag myself into work YAY, now Sunday nights will not present the same dread that they always have - that whole need to drag out the last couple of hours of your weekend until you are faced with a whole five days until the next little holiday!  But I am being miserable and depressing so I will stop and focus on the fact that I am going to be irresponsible and unemployed in less than a week (Friday afternoon doesn't count as it consists of - long leaving lunch, team meeting, then drinks YAY).  So anyway, I have to say that this whole going overseas things has hit me in small doses up until now but I think this weekend reality definitely hit.  I am very excited but also very scared, scared that it will not live up to 17 years worth of dreaming.  But still all will be well because Gede will be there to see it with me, which will make the world of difference.  Right - I had better go and do some work and stop boring you all with my inane drivvel.  Four weeks and counting.  Kai xoxo
