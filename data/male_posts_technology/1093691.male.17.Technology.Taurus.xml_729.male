    
       On Thursday, Friday and today I've been doing Jo's job which is lots of fun. Still haven't quite got the hang of which order the garden pots go outside yet. I can take in the broom trolley without it going on the road. Tomorrow I'm doing my job (doing the afternoon shift, thank goodness). So I'm very tired, but I've just had a Reef on an empty stomach and seeing things in a new light, hehehe. Beep.
