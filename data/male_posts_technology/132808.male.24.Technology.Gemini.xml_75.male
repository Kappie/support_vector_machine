This puts Khari against Matty, TJ Rubley, Troy Kopp, Kevin McDougal, Kerwin Bell, Kent Austin, Sammy Garza, Tom Clements and Sean Salisbury.  And he's better than all but one.  Remember, he's done everything Dunigan's done for us, too.  Matty never won us a title either.  Anyway, Nex, I'm in the process of picking up NFL Sunday Ticket.  You should come by for a couple of beers when the season starts.  I just picked up a new toy for the apartment: a 50 gallon fish tank.  I'm going to be collecting African Cichlids.  I'll toss some pictures of some sweet Cichlids I've seen online so you can get an idea of what I want for my tank.  Shitty thing is, that's all I can have in there, because the pH level has to be so high for them, it would kill any other fish I'd put in there.  What do y'all think of the new setup?  Simple, but different, I guess.  Change is always good.  I've been super lazy to do any reviews for Movie-Vault.com lately.  This is the second straight set of days off where I didn't write a review.  It's probably because it's summer now, or was until we got that retarded snowfall this week.  WTF!?!  Why is it that EVERY year since I bought those stupid rollerblades that less than 48 hours after the first time I pull them out it friggin snows?  Next year, I'm pulling those assholes out in January.
