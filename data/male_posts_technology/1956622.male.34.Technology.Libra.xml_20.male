For 2 days now I have been unable to really talk to her because she puts the phone on the speaker and then just lets it play.  I tried to tell her I liked her singing but daddy did not call to listen to the computer.  But that does not matter.  Plus the   X   does nothing to help the cause by asking her to put it up and talk to me.    Some days I wonder what is the point.  I know Karissa is 4 but it makes me feel like I am less important then an electronic keyboard, in this case, when it was not the keyboard it was something else.  The   X   calls and says you don't have any record of paying your child support so my attorney says you have to talk to your attorney.  I said I have already done that provided all paperwork necessary so if your attorney cannot find it from there then that is not my issue.  Man I tell you the   X   has some nerve she calls here telling me to not give out thier home number.  I am like you know what when collectors call here they get your number if you don't like it pay your bills.  I will hand out the number to anyone trying to get a hold of you.  She says well I don't appreciate the things you do...I said well I don't appreciate the things you do either so we are even.    That is the end of this discussion!  ****the line goes dead****
