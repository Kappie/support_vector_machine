It's funny but I think I might have made shit even more confusing. Alright, for the non-videogame industry savvy, QA is just a fancy word for game tester and 'localization' is basically making sure a game produced in a foreign country (in this case, Japan) translates well into English.  We'd really like to avoid any of   urlLink  this    happening. Hehe.  By the way, I work at Visual Concepts Inc. which is now known as   urlLink  ESPN Videogames   . They make produce titles that compete with (and usually best)   urlLink  Electronic Arts'   .  Needless to say, this job opportunity would be perfect for me right now as I'm trying to sort out going back to school for a second degree. First off, it's much closer than San Rafael. Secondly, I would be working 'normal' hours as opposed to my current jacked up schedule (going from 5:30 pm - 1:30 am, Saturday to Wednesday...nuts, I know). Thirdly, localization work seems like something that would come naturally to me. I have a keen eye for grammatical errors, syntax shit, and typos as a result of my English background. Oh and to top off the list of positives, it pays more!  Anyways, the interview went really well. My recruiter was very nice. Disarmingly nice even. It was the first interview I've had that seemed like a friendly chat if nothing else. The grammar test she administered was pretty easy as well. Dude, the situation described in the test dialogue was two guys with gay porn names (John Michaels and John Stevens) fighting over who owned a duck. Go figure.  After chatting with her, I discovered that the company I'd be working for would be   urlLink  Sega   , which is ironic as fuck. See, Visual Concepts is a developer for Sega. Oh well- I guess there would be no love lost between the two parties since I'm basically working for the same company. Now I'm slated to meet with the Sega hiring dude on Wednesday. Wish me luck!
