She is incredibly intelligent and has a City and Guilds in Laundry studies from Highlands College.  Home is in St Ouen  with her Mum and Dad (who also happens to be her Grandad, what a close family!). She says her best feature is her slightly damp, hairy top lip which “drives men wild!”. Maria’s favourite position is 69 “I like a man who takes his time down there” she says.     Christine (23 from St Martins) is a fox and she knows it. She loved to dance dirty with men on the dance floor at “The Hotel de France” and whip them into a frenzy of sexual desire. “I know I am a bit of a tease but look like me, you know I have the pick of the best!” She says that what drives her wild is men kissing her armpits and playing with her lovely hair.     Beth (25) is always popular with both the guys and girls of Jersey, she is a resident of St Brelade living in a 2-bed maisonette with both her parents and her Mum’s parents.  With her natural good looks Beth pulls every time.  “I have never been left until the end of the evening” she says. Beth is an accomplished typist, having six fingers on each hand.  She says it helps her in bed “ I love to fondle a mans bits while I kiss him deep and long and slow.”     Pamela (19) is a classic Jersey Beauty from St Helier and always has men chasing after her. Pamela is always on the dance floor surrounded by men after her affection. “I love to show off my ass” says Pamela tossing her gorgeous brunette locks, “I think it is my best feature so I always wear a G string and tight lycra leggings.  Sometimes if I am feeling really cheeky I like to let a little bit of my underwear show when I bend over!”     Kate (18) always likes to look her best as a modelling job means that she has to be ready for that big break and the chance move away from her home in Grouville.  “I do like to pamper myself and think nothing of spending £70 on my hair.  Men notice too and they love to run their fingers through it when I snog them” “I was offered a part in Bay Watch but turned it down as I did not just want to be known for my good looks.”     Sara (24) loves to sing loves songs at karaoke.  “I will pick the best looking guy in the room and sing to him.  I don’t care if he has a girlfriend, he will be leaving with me!”  Sara is a sexual predator from Trinity and will eat you up.  “I can satisfy any man in bed but prefer it up against a car or somewhere with a hint of danger” “My best feature is my face cos when you look like me you know I don’t need makeup to be beautiful”.     Kylie (20) is a St John beauty and always gets confused with the Australian soap star. “Men always ask me for my autograph.” she says, “It is not just my face but my body too” “People can’t believe I come from St John – “I thought they were all ugly in-breeds over there but you are gorgeous.” They say to me.  It makes me laugh knowing they all want to get into my pants!”     Donna (21) lives in St Saviour and feels it holds her back “ I don’t like to tell a guy where I live in case it ruins my chances so I normally say I live in St Mary.”  With only 7 kids Donna is a real catch and she knows it. “I love to get all my kids involved when I bring a man back home (which is most weekends).
