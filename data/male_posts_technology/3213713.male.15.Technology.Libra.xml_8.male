Neways... i changed and played with her for some time. I also took some pics of her... here are 2 of those.     . Bohot cute he. Till bout 12, i played with her. Then, I sat on the pc and chatted for some time.  Had lunch. Then, I went online again. Chatted some more. See... ive got nothing else to do :p. Neways... phir mujhe yaad aaya keh... i had to do some work on the site too. So, I did that work and went to the office. I discussed the site with the office guy and wrote down any changed left to make. Then, I went for jogging. Came back. Did some exercies. Went online again. Chatted for some time. Had dinner. Chatted some more... damn, i think im addicted!! :p. Meanwhile, i went to the forum and posted there. Mama got furious and told me to get off the pc or she'll smash tha monitor... so, i had to get off :p. Had some mangoes. Watched some TV. Mom gave me an hour long lecture about you-know-what. She just wont understand!! Neways...  i sat on the pc again. I chatted more. Worked on the site. Posted at the forum. Went to Neowin. I saw the link to a topic that said, Funny pics. Damn funny they were. I saved many on my pc. Then, at bout 1:30... Farazeh came. I showed her those pics. Lol. Then, I went to the forum again, posted some more. And then I went to sleep. But, I couldnt sleep at all and just lay there on my bed. Thinking and thinking. Hmmm.... that sums up that day.
