Then followed a friend out to his house in the woodlands.  Or augusta pines anyway.  She had a great time with his son and his older daughter.  They played in the pool.  Had dinner together, played with is boxer named Henry, and just ran herself ragged.  I too had a good time and it helped take some of the stress I am starting to feel with the upcoming mediation and court hearing with   SFW    In addition   SFW   said the reason I could not keep Karissa until Aug 6th was because Karissa had to be home for her brothers birthday party! Well considering her brother is in Washington with his dad until Aug 21st I would say that once again she has been giant liar!   The more things change the more they stay the same!  A leaopard can't change it's spots!  You can't teach and old dog new tricks!   If you get my meaning!!
