The reason I hate it is not that it shields people from something they would rather not be exposed to but that it forces that shielding upon everyone, no exceptions. With that in mind I totally (heart) the ratings guides.  The ratings: G, PG, PG-13, NC-17, R, et al... as well as the entire video game ratings from the ESRB and such. Great idea, I love them. The question remains tho, why do we need censorship when we have ratings? I'll tell you my take on this.  Parents do not want the job of parenting. There is the summed up bulk of it all right there. Noone wants responsability. It's always someone elses fault that their kid is screwed up, never their own. Granted, there are exceptions as there are for many rules, but to blame a generation of fuckups problems on TV, video games and movies... that is absurd.  According to the First Amendment of the United States  urlLink Bill of Rights :    Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.    Now according to the  urlLink FCC :   The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. possessions.    OK, so we find out that the FCC is established by the  urlLink Communications Act of 1934 . You can read that yourself, it's in PDF format and I didn't feel like typing a bunch of stuff.  The point is, nowhere in any of these documents have I been able to find information granting the FCC the power to censor what is broadcasted. From my understanding, and please I want someone to prove me wrong, the FCC is only in charge of regulating fair use and charges associated with the different forms of telecomunications.  My view on censorship is basically, if you are easily offended, stay away from the stuff that offends you or learn to deal with it. The world is full of offensive stuff and having someone shield you from it does nothing to help you other than to help you hide from the world. To tie the ratings system in, if everythign was "rated" and everyone could find out before hand the "rating" on something they could choose not to watch it. If, with the rating in place and censorship out of the picture, the program/broadcast somehow exceedes its rating, at that point it should be fined based on severity alone.  Anyway, I'm done typing now. bye.    -intX    guns don't kill people, they just shoot hot projectiles at them
