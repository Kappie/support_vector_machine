It has been established now with LOTR that what appears in the theater is not the film, but a conscious abridgement.  It is not the finished work.  Take a moment and think about that:  the artist first publishes/presents a conscious abridgement of the actual work, agreed upon by all parties involved, who know and accept that what was really completed will be released in a different format in a few months.  Not a Director's Cut, not Lost Chapters, not a reassessment now that time has passed.  A conscious, fully intended abridgement.  Released first.
