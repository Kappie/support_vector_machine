It's very-2 diffrent from a student in engineering group, they got a student too, she from a famous univ in jakarta, this girl is come to right place, she's majoring a petroleum and gas industry,and she's learning about gas process in here. usualy when we go for lunch, she's always a sit in a same table with me, and when we back to offce by busm she's seat next to me... she's a very kind girl, very polite , she reminds me with someone.....kikikikkkiki.(blush)  hmmm....I dont know if am a good mentor or not,  long long time ago..(i hate when to said "long-2 time ago), i was an mentor, i teach, make and lead a bunch of young man to their best..., i never fail train them to be the best as they could....
