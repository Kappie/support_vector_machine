Now we got some jack-off senator aiming to toss another monkey-wrench in the gears of innovation and personal freedom.  A hardy 'fuck you sir' goes out to  urlLink Sen. Orrin Hatch  (R-UT) for his wonderfull work toward a safer world full of lawsuits over meaningless crap. Way to clog the system buddy.  Well, now that I have that out of my system I think I can enjoy my weekend calculating how long we have until Skynet or Big Brother come in to the picture.  Have a good weekend you mindless dumbfucks.   -intX    Omnia mutandur nos et mutamur in illis
