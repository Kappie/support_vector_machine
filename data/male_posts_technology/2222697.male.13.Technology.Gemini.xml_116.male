The concept of that game is very simple, go thru 10 levels all huge with a 3d look to them but still keep the 2d sidescrolling idea alive. I love sidescolling games because of this game. It has addicting and fun gameplay with an extremely simple idea of a game. A sequel is going to be released on the GCN and the PS2.  Sadly I don't own very many shirts. I have worn a Diety shirt since 5th grade when I bought it at eisenbergs. So my mom took me to the mall to get 4 videogame related shirts. I just love the Nintendo shirts that they have.  The comic store in tyler is really cool.  urlLink Ground Zero Comics  has a big collection of fine literature and games. They hold magic, heroclix, and Dbz tournaments and I could go to all of them. I am still waiting to be accepted on their message boards. I am looking for some people to play  urlLink GO  in Tyler and the comic store would be a good place, but I am also looking at the library, the Barnes and Noble, and my garage.  Time for another donut...
