 Sparta (March 15th @ State Theater)

 Rocket From The Crypt (March 17th @ Magic Stick)

 Kodo (March 24th @ Michigan Theater)

 Sahara Hotnights (March 31st @ The Shelter)

 Adult. (April 4th @ Institute of Art)

 The White Stripes (April 15th @ Masonic Temple)

 The White Stripes (April 16th @ Masonic Temple)

 Adult. (May 17th @ Magic Stick)
