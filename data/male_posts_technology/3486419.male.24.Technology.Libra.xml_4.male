One of my project members was skiving off... knn... During project discussions, he doesn't talk a lot. I think I can use my brain and manually do a word count of the things he say and my brain is not that fantastic.  That comes to my topic: Commitment.  Different people have different levels of commitment they can put in. Throwing in some adverse conditions such as sleepiness, lectures the following day, and commitment levels will plummet.  Its something I discover the hard-way. Something I will endeavor.
