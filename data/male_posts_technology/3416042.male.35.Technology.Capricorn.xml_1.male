As you enter airport security, you begin to be broken down into separate components.  Your shoes come off, your carry-on items are removed, belts, change, keys are all separated from your person.  Laptops get broken out further into their own area of categorization.  Then, all these separate parts get put through a machine that analyzes their contents and delivers the component parts to the far end.  Finally, all those pieces are reassembled at the far end as a complete traveler.  Viola!  Teleportation!  The only real difference is how much the traveler is broken down and how quickly the material is transferred.  At least, that's my theory.
