The dentist herself starts heaving i was like ^____^ then im walking through town with a totally numb tongue, gums, nose, throat, and half of my face. As you can imagine talking was very funny. "Mphhhwwblll" so im at home all drugged up wondering when ill finally get all the feeling back in my face atm :D.
