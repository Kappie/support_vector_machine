I just couldn't take on aggressive players.  They had a field day with me.  It was very discouraging.  After a few weeks of not winning much, a few 2nd and 3rd places, I was about to give up.  Then one night I decided to play a limit game.  I thought this might be a good change.  It would help me to keep the aggressive players at bay a little.   I started to play a little different style, conservative in the early rounds, aggressive with good hands, but not much bluffing.  It earned me a 2nd place spot and it felt good.  In fact so good, I played another one.  I took 2nd again.  I found my niche.  My calling.  Limit holdem' poker.   I continued to place in the top three spots seven games in a row.  I couldn't believe it.  I was on a winning streak.  I was playing $10-1 games and was doing great.  I took an $8 dollar bankroll and turned it into $150.   Now I had the confidence to start playing the $20-$2 tournaments.  It took a week of a few losses, mostly 4th place finishes.  I hate 4th place.  One away from a money spot and you're sent packing.  That sucks.  But I eventually started winning 2nd and 3rd spots.  Things were looking good. My game was working for me.  I was playing good hands, making few mistakes and working the pots.  And then......  Indiana Slim
