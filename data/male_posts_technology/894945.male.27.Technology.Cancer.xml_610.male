I want to welcome my old mate Damo to TF  Yes I'm still alive was just looking back and realised that I havent posted anything since last June Oops so I will do a quick recap of what I have been up to!!  Toaster Left me to work on my own (Bastard!) at RBSI I started playing alot of golf and it rules!!! I was rushed in to Hospital with a Grumbling Appendix "was the most painful experiance ever" Myself and Kate bought a new car "Peugeot 206cc" I bought a new Motorbike "Honda Varedero 125" I have given up smoking for 11 weeks now and have never felt better!!! I tried to gouge my own eye out in my sleep last night Owwww!!! (What page is that on!!)  and to add to Baity's post about the social night round Toasters new flat I give the flat a 10 out of 10 good work mate   Trivial Pursuit  The Girls team consisted of :- Kate (Literary Genius) Joe + Debbie (Science Nerds) Kirk "Honarary Girl" (Sports Nut)  The Boys team consisted of :- Toaster (Leet speech, Computer security, Drinking, Classical Education????) Dougle (Drinking) Baity (Plants, Lord of the Rings, HGV Driving, Drinking, Projectile Vomiting) Damian (Sport, Drinking, other general Trivia)  Some of the Questions were :- In Shakespare what line preceeds the phrase, "And all the men and women merely players"? In WW2, who was referred to as a 'Rear-End Charlie'?  Luckily for the Guys we where ok on the first question thanks to Toaster when he answered Quote Life is just a Play - "and that is what a classical education does for you" in case you don't know the answer was "All the world's a stage" (Hahaha from Kate)   Pictionary  The Highlight of this game was when we looked at some of the pads round Joe and Toaster's flat to see that they had been practising this the night before??? (how quickly you have fallen down the Ladder of Fun and Drinking Toaster)  Was a great night though and thank you for the invite!!  I promise I will try and post more in the New Year!!
