It's been a fortnight, since I had a fresh laugh, It's been a fortnight, since I felt content in my heart, It's been a fortnight, since I went home on time and talked to mom for hours, It's been a fortnight, since I chatted with u all for long, It's been a fortnight, since I posted mails u all seperately, It's been a fortnight, since I sat besides my favorite tree and smoked for 2 long hours alone, It's been a fortnight, since I met her with joy in my heart, It's been a fortnight, since I read Newspaper for anything other than horoscope, It's been a fortnight, since I picked up a book from my library, It's been a fortnight, since I replied back to yr mails, It's been a fortnight, since I smiled without effort, It's been a fortnight, since I lived...    It's been such a long fortnight...
