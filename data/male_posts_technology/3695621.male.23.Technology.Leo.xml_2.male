We had a great class that week, and were able to end things a little bit early.  I managed to make it to skydive chicago and get 2 jumps in after class!  The first jump was just a solo sit-fly attempt.  I didn't do that well sitting, but it was great to be back in the air.  I also downsized to a Sabre2 150 from a Steletto 170.  I'll be trying a Steletto 150 next weekend if I can find some cash.  Quite the speedy landings from a 150 with my body weight.  The second dive, I did another sit-fly attempt this time with Dawn.  We didn't stay together for more than a few seconds, but since we were the last ones out, we got some free stills from Rook on the way down.  One of those stills made it to the SDC Photo Gallery  urlLink here .    Saturday - 7/26/2004    After an early friday night, I was up bright and early, and ready to jump.  I signed up for the "New Way" boogie that was going on.  I ended up in a group with TJ our coach, my friend Jim Bloomingdale, and Chuck on camera.  5 dives were made, all 3 way attempts.  We nailed 3 out of the 5 exits, but Jim seemed to backslide as soon as we broke.  There was some great video that I may have time to digitize soon.  I did 5 jumps with Jim and TJ, then did 2 solo jumps as well.  The second was especially neat.  Scott Miller was doing his canopy course, so we dropped quite a few people on a bad spot 2 miles out.  Only a 4 way and I remained to full altitude.  The 4 way exited first, and I gave them 10 seconds before I exited with my normal flipping routine.  I transitioned to a solid sit, and actually caught up to the 4 way pretty fast.  I was even with them by 7000 feet, and flipped onto my belly to watch.  What an absolutly amazing dive.  Rook gave me some advice about sitting up straight, and it helped considerably.  The night was quite a party.  Jack Daniels is bad....  Lets just leave it at that.  This was my last day skydiving for the weekend, so the entry ends here as well.
