These words are so interesting, yesterday "keep reminding them of these things" and today, "only few will find the path"  What do they mean by few and how often is keep reminding them??? compared to todays' numbers (http://www.ibiblio.org/lunarbin/worldpop) a few would be what???? Some statistics put Christians in the world @ 2 billion, almost 30%...Is that a few??? It challenges me more and more to raise the bar and flee from evil desires and fleshly lusts which wage ware against the soul, 1 Peter 2:11...I was talking with one of my friends from the small group I attend and he said, "If somebody would have told me that becoming a Christian would make things harder. I wouldn't have!" As I read yesterday in 2 Timothy 2:19, we have a responsibility once we step into salvation to progress in our spiritual lives...Romans 12 also spells it out for us! I am encouraged to live this out, and I encourage you to live it with me! All the best my friends!
