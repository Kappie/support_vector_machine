As usual you wake up on Monday morning and it feels so cold, you find yourself wishing you could just lay in bed and go back to sleep (god that would be nice, I'm bloody tired!). Next thing you know the alarm clock goes off at 06:20am! Yep thats right, you thought you you had turned it off, only to find out that you had hit the snooze button by mistake!! With that first sigh of the many that will follow during the rest of the day, you do your best to roll onto your side and fall out of bed.  Well thank god I had a good weekend, or else this would all be too much. Yep it was a good weekend!  On Friday, Sandy, Al, and Michael (PK's Mom, sister and cousin) arrived in Jersey after much anticipation. I have got on swell with all of them and it's really cool to have made a few more good friends! So anyway, once they had settled we all ordered pizza and chilled out and everyone got acquainted, and then after food the majority of us went out on the piss. Started off at Chicago Rock and moved to Liquid later on (I cannot believe that I got in again without any hassle!). We all went back to Chateaux PKB and crashed out on the floor hehe! What was to ensue between Danger, Milkybar Kid, and myself will hence forth be known as 'The Great Blanket Robbery!', suffice to say that I ended up waking up and going to get my ski jacket, then curling up like a fetus on the little couch!  Got up on Saturday and soon left the Chateaux in order to do lots of things that kept me rushed off my feet for the morning. In the afternoon Toaster and I went and watched Dare Devil, which I though was a good film. Later on everybody met up again and we all went out for dinner to Pizza Express down in St.Brelade' Bay. We all ended up back at the Chateaux watching DVD's and talking, in fact it was nice to have a reasonably quiet Saturday night for a change.  Toaster and I were busy on Sunday until the evening. I ended up at Chateaux PKB again and I chilled out there until about 1:45am!  So that was a good weekend and it was with great regret that I then had to then wake up to the usual Monday saga! Ah well, probably going up again tonight, Danger has offered a good curry, which should be fun.  Well that is it for now, Baity signing off......
