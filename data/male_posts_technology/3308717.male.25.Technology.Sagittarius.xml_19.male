Since I have fond thoughts of this 'future' thing, I thought it appropriate that I should mention  urlLink this article . Give it a quick scan over, maybe read some bits here and there then come back here and finish up with what I am babbling on about.  Imagine if you will, the ability to switch your vision to the infrared light spectrum at will. Viewing over-lay diagrams of something you are working on, perhaps your cars engine. Maybe you wish to have notes for your presentation lightly scrolled in your periphrial vision. This is all  urlLink a lot closer  than most people would think. In the link right back there it talks about head mounted 'glasses' which reflect low-powered lasers onto the users retina displaying virtually any image provided to it.  With enhanced vision not too far off we are that much closer to my robotic future, but we need something more. We need strength enhancements,  urlLink no problem , this is being worked on already. I haven't quite decided if I would get a couple limbs lopped off yet, but I would abso-fucking-lutly go for an exo-skeleton type frame connected directly to my brain.  I can imagine, however, that with all these robotic implants it would make air travel a little more irritating. I wonder if there would be any exceptions or special planes that cyborgs would fly... Shit, i may just get rocket boosters attached to my mechanical body and fly myself wherever the hell I wanted to go.  Of course this would, more than likely, lead to a war between the humans and the cyborgs. The humans would start it by trying to revoke our freedoms and rights claiming that we were no longer self-aware or that we were a threat. In the end the cyborgs would crush the human opposition and we would expand to other planets and travel the galaxy waging wars with any who stand in our way.  I guess that's it for now, just something I was thinking about.   -intX    ...and your point is?
