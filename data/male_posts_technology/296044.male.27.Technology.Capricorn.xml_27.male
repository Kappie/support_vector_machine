It does't usually bother me if I'm only there once in a great while; but three days in a row... that's enough.  So today I'm taking a break from the smell.  When I'm there I feel like it's all an act.  I feel surrounded by automatons.  Sometimes someone comes in that's human or has some feeling, but they're few and far between.  Even though there are so many other people there with you, it can be a very lonely place.  They try to make everything clean, but it feels unnatural.  I wonder, if my house doesn't smell like a hospital, does that mean it's not clean?
