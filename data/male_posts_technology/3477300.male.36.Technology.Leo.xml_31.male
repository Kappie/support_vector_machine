It's like someone typed the message in on an old Olivetti then scanned it with a fax machine. Presumably to  avoid the Basian SPAM filters.        But I ask you, how retarded would you  need to be to reply to this one!       Now, what's also very worrying is the open redirector that the phisher found at        http //citibank.com/domain/redirect/citi.com/global_nav/pands.htm
