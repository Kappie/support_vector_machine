Mostly Iam just happy that the pen for my Wacom tablet survived its trip through the washing machine, so I felt the need to do something with it. How it got mixed in with my clothes, I'm not quite sure. At any rate, it emerged from the washing machine much cleaner, but completely dead to the world as far as the Wacom tablet was concerned. On the bright side, at least it wasn't regular pen (this time).   Anyway,lastnight I tried the ruined pen one last time, and now that it's dry inside, it is good as new.  BTW, if you have artistic kids old enough to use a computer, I highly recommendone of these - even an engineering geek like me who never took an art classpast grade school can make some pretty cool stuff. In the hands of an artisticsecond grader, its downright dangerous.
