As an example, Thin Lizzy - Live & Dangerous - £9.95 on Napster, £7.99 for the CD at Amazon.co.uk.     You can pretty much play a CD on any damn CD player you choose, you can't do the same for your DRM protected download.     The quality of music from a CD is better because the downloaded music is compressed using a lossy algorithm.     You can - usually - rip your CD to mp3, wma, ogg or whatever you fancy and again play the non-DRM'd rip wherever you please.    After my experience with Napster, (I was unable to restore music I had purchased because it was no longer available on their catalogue) I shall never ever again purchase downloadable music, instead I shall always buy the CD at least for as long as they continue making them.
