I always stop what I'm doing, pick him up, and have some one on one time with him. Usually we read about Dora the Explorer. Tonight he toddled in holding his  Precious Moments  Bible, saying Daddy, Daddy, unna wead da book! He sat on my knee, content as could be while I read Genesis 1 to him, then we went and got some chocolate milk. What a privelege!
