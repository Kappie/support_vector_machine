I'll explain.  About two weeks ago the first "Night of Terror" began, where my PC suffered all kinds of horrible mishaps and I was up until 3am fixing it.  This recent one wasn't as terrifying, merely extremely annoying.  Essentially, sleep was denied me until about 7am, which is a first for me I believe.  Add to this my WoD game on Monday night coupled with multiplayer Diablo II, this lead to me arriving home too late and too knackered to look at anything computer related.  At least I've found out the Necromancer rocks...    The WoD game was amusing, but the arrival of two new players and unexpected departure of one (no doubt due to third-paty meddling or sheer laziness) threw the existing group dynamic into chaos.  Sadly, one player is stroppy and petulant, and another simply "doesn't get it", and it simply doesn't make for a good experience.  In other roleplaying news, my online PBeM is not going very well.  Following a suggestion to have "floating returns" the entire system has broken down.  It seems structure needs to be enforced for things to work.  Also, my home GURPS game is going very badly... when one player can make it, the other manifests an excuse not to attend.  I'm sure they're in cahoots to drive me mad, the bastards.  It celebrates its 10th year in the next 3 months...  In short, at the moment, everything is a bit crap.
