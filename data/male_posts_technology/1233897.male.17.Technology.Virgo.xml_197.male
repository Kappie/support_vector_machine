I'm reather unhappy about some of the scores I've been getting in subjects at school, particularly Spanish and AP Calc. I got flippin' 48% on my last Spanish test! 'Course it doesn't help that I didn't study anywhere near enough for it (lol). Oh, and I've already gotten ISS (In School Suspension) for tardies this early into the year. I drop my sister off at her school before I get to mine almost every morning, but her school's really weird about their closed campus policies. They won't even let her get out of the car until one of the staff opens the door for her. It's sooo stupid and it's costing my my GPA (ISS means less time in the class, which means less time learning).   Oh well, I'd better head over to Portline. See yah'all later~
