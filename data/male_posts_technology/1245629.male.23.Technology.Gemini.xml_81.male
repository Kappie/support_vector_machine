A customer using Java-condo complained to Sun that the  condom doesn't fit correctly. Sun replied: "Wait till we get the ISO  standard". They boasted that it will fit to any size irrespective of  underlying structure.  Well, the customer switched to CondomiX and  found that by the time he finshes reading the instructions, given along with  CondomiX, his wife was sleeping and he himself forgetting why he is  using CondomiX.  Finally he swiched to MS-Condome.To his surprise  it was so good...and comfortable!. He used it happily. Six months  later he found that his wife was pregnant. He got angry and complained to  Micrsoft. He got his reply from  Microsoft:  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---   ---  A  PATCH IS COMING SOON...!
