Since they are not supposed to call more then once a day (they are averaging 3-4) and have the information to get in touch with my ex, I may just start keeping track and put a trace on the line and then sue them for the inconvenience. Might as well get a couple of bucks out of them.  Called Karissa today and had my Aunt on the phone Karissa really likes talking to Aunt.  She talked for a bit then she accidently hung up the phone but it was OK I had to go to work and Aunt (Karissa's name for her) had to go to a dinner function.  I called her back to tell her how much I miss her and love her.  She told me how her and her brothers were out catching worms and she had hundreds and she named them all Arial.  She was eating cake and Ice cream my ex's Birthday is this week and they were celebrating it today. She is going to use them to go fishing.    I got to hear a hello from Jimmy and Jeremey as well.  It was good to at least hear them.  I miss them too but I am not supposed to care about them they are not my concern...thank Lisa for that one.
