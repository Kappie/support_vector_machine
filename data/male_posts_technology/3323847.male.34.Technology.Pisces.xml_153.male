It makes little difference if you are a hard-core gamer, or consider the PC an over-priced calculator, Doom 3 is taking the world by storm.  This is a good read for those of you who would like to know what this whole thing is about, but are tired of slogging through techno-jargon that wouldn't make any more sense than Mandarin Chinese to an American.  This article hits the major points as well as providing a little insight as to what this whole Doom thing is about.  I've personally been waiting for Half-Life 2, but from what I've read about Doom 3, I may just have to pick up a copy of it first.  If the visuals are half as good as they are saying, it'll be a good purchase.
