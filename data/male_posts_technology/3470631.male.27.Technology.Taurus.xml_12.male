So close that a kid 3 seats down from us got nailed in the arm with a broken bat. Good times. His dad was so excited that he caught the bat that he failed to notive his son sitting there bleeding profusely from the arm. Pretty rich!  After the game dkl;asfj and after a 5 watery Miller Lights, the Qdog and I rendezvoused with a couple of young ladies from the Red Sox legal department. The jury is still out, but the Qdog did no one any favors by belligerently yelling at passerby's to "Get a haircut" and "lose some weight." He was inspired. There were some rich stories exchanged though and times were good. Good up ntil the 20 minute walk home where the Qdog repeatedly offered passing girls donuts from our recent purchase at Store 24. Most people aren't friendly at 1230am - don't know what their problems is, but the Qdog was really in fine form.   On a sidenote - I am getting harrassed by someone who claims that I hit his car -- when I was at work with my car. I might need legal services shortly if he keeps badgering me. As if white paint on the bumper is enough to incriminate!? I have hit cars klj;sdf but not his! CHRIST. Lucky for me I now know a couple good lawyers alk;dfj  Other than that, the summer is in full swing in the Back Bay. I'm exhausted and probably going to sleep at 730pm tonight. I can't take it anymore.  I'm washed up.   mjwern
