I don't have to get up until nine, and I don't have to go to work until I feel like it, or when I get a security/system audit email from Allnutt's server. God, nothing like IT. At least I'm not help desk...  Ben: Ok, ok, calm down, Christine. CH: Ok. Ben: Now, tell me again, very slowly, how many floppy disks you put in the drive. CH: Two. Ben: Two. CH: Two. Ben:... Ben: PEBKAC. CH: What? Ben: You have an ID-ten-T error. (WRITE IT OUT, YOU NON HELPDESK/IT PEOPLE.) CH: Oh. Thanks. Bye!  Helpdesk sucks.
