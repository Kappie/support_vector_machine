Ever since my Mom died suddenly back in January, I've made a great effort to spend more time with my Dad. Maybe this is selfish on my part, but he and I have never been really close, and I'm at least making an effort to change that. In recent weeks, my friend Mark has been coming along with us, adding a lot more hilarity to the outings. Several times we've gotten together with my Father-in-law and Brother-in-law(s) for group movie viewings. Those are always good, even if the movies are not.  Tonight, we're headed to Skyline Chili for some coneys, then back to Mark's to watch the 2 hour finale of Last Comic Standing 2. It'll be greeeaattt!
