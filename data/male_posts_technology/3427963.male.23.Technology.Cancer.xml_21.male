Was doing it for the past few days also lah and today, when i was jus suppose to step out of my void deck, it started to rain realli heavily. So LL, went back up home and got a small foldable umbrella ( wat to do? if not sure wet one and have to reach there on time. although i reached there a bit late lah ) and the stupid thing is i so BIG size and carries such big bag and the stupid umbrella so small..... but never realli got wet lah..my bag did haha!!  Reached SMU and ard 10 plus to 11, started to have runny nose. feel like a flu coming up lor and after that, feel damn sick for the whole day. used up all my tissue and still have to stay inside aircon room and have to run up and down and got a bit wet.  like that how not to get sick??.  after that feel sick for the whole day lor and still have to work late.....been working late since Monday lor...getting tired and sick of working man....haha so fast...jus started two months ago onli.  Visited thomas's blog again and found out he realli so free that he can go jogging, go bank, go look for his mardder and some more go orchard road jalan jalan. envy him so much...how i wish i have all that time. Then read my ganjie's blog also and hers was a damn long blog explaining wat true love is.....well, quite tru lah but dont know lah. cos i had been trying so hard and nothing seems to work for me lah.....(YoU cAn'T mAkE sOmEoNe LuV yOu, aLl YoU cAn Do Is Be SoMeOnE wHo CaN bE lOvEd, ThE rEsT iS uP tO tHe PeRsOn To ReAlIzE yOuR wOrTh~)-->last sentence from my ganjie's blog. How long will it take her to realize my worth?? maybe she will never find out lor.....it really feels so fucked up to love someone so much and not get anything back lah seriously. but i never expected anything back also lah.....Well, i never had a GF before and was never realli been in a relationship b4, and i realli want her to be my first..(Pathetic rite?? so old liow still no gf yet) maybe i am realli a person so unlovable bah.
