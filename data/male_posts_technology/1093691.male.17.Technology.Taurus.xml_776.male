We got so near the front you could practically see the sweat dripping off Busted, Misteeq and those strange Big Brova people in VERY small dresses. Hey ho, I really enjoyed it, even if one side of my face is bright red from being in the sun all day. Hey ho, that's the price you pay for entertainment i guess, by the beeb's standards. But yes twas good. Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Very nice seeing you Tom and Nicki! I have to meet Jenny, she sounds lovelly. Sounds perfect girlfriend material. Tom. *wink wink* *nudge nudge*
