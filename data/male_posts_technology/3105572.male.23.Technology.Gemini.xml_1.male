All The Israelites had to do was stand firm. God is great.  It would be nice if God would come out and talk to us, telling us exactly what to do.  Unfortunately, people still wouldn't listen.  Don't you think that if God was talking directly to his people that they would listen and not do the stupid stuff like sex shrines and all that babble? I've never seen the writing on the wall or the signs and wonders.  I've never heard the calling.  But somehow I know God is there.  I know he is watching over me and taking care of me.  I think that I know I am in God's Will when things are happening that are for the good of God's kingdom. It's just like when I went to my last church.  I knew that I was where God wanted me to be because I got involved in the music ministry.  Everywhere I've went it has seems as if God has sent me there, even though he didn't give me a vision or write a message on the wall or anything.  For Now I'll just keep on Trusting. Keep on believing that God has put me where he wants me and that I'm going to do good for him whereever it is that he puts me.  Pray.
