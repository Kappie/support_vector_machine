I wonder if the real difference between the DSLs discussed in MDA circles, and 4GLs, is really just a political, trying to avoid the perceived failure of 4GLs to pervasively revolutionise computing as much as 2GLs and 3GLs did. Of course, MDA is more than this, but perhaps the most significant difference is the use of model (or language) transformation, rather than the use of models. Many people would probably point to the perceived status of UML within MDA, but I don't subscribe to that perception. Having a common definitional basis, MOF, is probably also significant.
