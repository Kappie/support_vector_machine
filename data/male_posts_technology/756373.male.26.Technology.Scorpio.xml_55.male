I was amazed, that he'd think my lame site portraying my lame attempt at sketchwork, was important enough to have it's link page updated to reflect the correct URL. It was all I could do to stammer out a reply , trying not to sound like a rabid fan. We make our own celebs, I guess, and for our own reasons. Millions might adore some no-talent no-skill pop idol for whatever obscure reason, but I admire artists like  urlLink Catt . And, I guess, for the same reason that millions adore those pop stars and good looking actors out there - they want to be like them. Personally, I've never cared what  I  look like, but really appreciate beauty in artwork of the female form. Playboy centrefolds and porn doesnt interest me so much as the work of Catt, Royo, Vajello. And it isn't exposed flesh that excites me so much as the  seductivity  portrayed in such art. Seeing something I sketch come to life and look me in the face is unparralleled - especially on those rare occasions when what I sketch doesnt resemble gutter trash.  I guess we all need someone to look up to.  /*disclaimer - the work of T.Catt is quite adult in nature and may contain nudity and more... he has a section for non-erotica, so if you don't like admiring art of nekkid wimmen, be sure to at least check out the 'softcore' section.*/
