I was hoping to release a new version of my software this past weekend, but the changes we made are having problems working together after performing a merge. We're using  urlLink Subversion  for source and version control. It's been working great considering that everyone is working remotely on this project... once we finally got it installed which was quite tricky.  Anyway this release has been tricky - hopefully we can get it out by tomorrow night.  Everyone's working hard, so I'm hopeful.  Toward the end of the day I realized that I have to be at a party in the area next Sunday.  I would have decided to just stay in NJ for the week, but this time I brought a girl I'm dating out with me so she could visit friends in NY.  I don't think she's going to want to stay until Monday with me, so I guess I'll have to go out to Pittsburgh and come back this weekend again  -  shrug  - So looks like lots of driving for me this week (again). Oh well.  One of my friends is organizing an all night golfing outing at a local golf club. That sounds exciting...  My friends and I area also throwing a party on July 10.  We rented out a nice bar and have Malibou Run coming it to perform a promotion for their new Pineapple and Mango flavors.  We had our first one in March of last year.. urlLink  Here are some of the pictures . They're providing everything for a tiki theme and some free booze.  I'm psyched!  ...so yeah, there's a lot to look forward to right now, too.
