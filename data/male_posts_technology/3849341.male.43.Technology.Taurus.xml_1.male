Well what is the criteria that should be used to determine the worth or value of something. Does the criteria change each time (subjective), or is there a set criteria (an absolute)that should be used. In the natural, common sense would say it is subjective, depending on the people involved, the item, and various other circumstances that could come into play. One example would be, in the middle of a drought, the value of water will increase subjectively because of supply and demand issues.It would seem, at least in dealing, with property that the owner willhave the final say in determining the value of the property(Oh BTW Iborrowed theowner concept from my friendProfessor Karl Golemo) even though there maybe many variables that influence this decision, it is still the ownersdecision to make.   So, can this logic be used across the board to determine the worth or value of everything to include "Human life"? It would seem no matter if you answered YES or NO the reality isin fact people have always use these subjective variables to place a value on Human Life. One titled giventhis subjective thinking has been called is "utilitarianism". Let me site a few examples to supportmy statement that this practice of subjectivity, placing value on human life, has existed throughout the ages. You can go back to the early Bedouin societies were femaleswere looked to as a burden when they were born. In societies like these, whichby the way still exist in third worldcountries even today, even India still practices forms of this Utiliarianism,it would not be uncommon for the parents to kill a female baby because they saw the child as a liability, just another mouth to feed. Whereas, a male child was looked upon as being of much greater value becausethe male child, in the future, would be able to work the fields, hunt, or physical tasks that may not be as easy for females to do.   If the biblical history is correct, it was not uncommon for Kings to devalue human life for their own varied purposes. The Pharaoh in Moses time feared the Nation of Israel growing to big and overthrowing his reign. Thus he ordered all first born males to be killed. At the time of the birth of Jesus, The king of that region feared the birth of a supposed Messiah whom he had been told would be born soon. The King, again, ordered that all male child's two years or less to be killed.   A more recent, but none the less bloody, was the reign of Hitler's Third Reich in the 1930-40's. Instantly, you would think of the mass killing of the Jewish people, and you would be correct. Yet,Hitler started much earlier and much more subtly than how he ended up his campaign. Hitler's political party actually started by devaluing the elderly, the infirmed, and handicapped. Inthe early thirties Hitler's political party setup boards of doctors, and other officials who were used to help placevalue on human life that was deemed to be a burden to society. Euthanasia would be too mild of a term to place on the atrocities performed on the weak of society. It wasn't a very far jump to the wholesale slaughter of million of Jews. You see, you must remember it was for the common good of everyone that Hitler killed the weak off, at least that washis subjective criteria to justify killing innocent people.  Much of the same subjective reasoning is use today to justify abortion. The burden the unwanted pregnancy will place on the parents is just to great. There is one unique argument in the subjective arguments concerning abortion. That is that the mother created the child and since the child is part of "Her Body" she has the right, as long as the child is still inside of her to terminate the life.   I think my friend is right, it comes down to ownership. Who owns or who created the item or person. If there is a God, and he did create man, then he is the only one who can place a true value on a human life. At this point searching out the world religions to see what value their holy writingsshow their God Places on Human life would be the next logical step. And this is were I must plead much ignorance. I could not speak intelligently concerning most world religions. But, I would like to express my opinion of what my belief system, Christianity, says concerningwhat value God places on Human life.   In my unlearned understanding of Christianity, I see a God whomfrom the very beginning placed extreme value on human life and interactingwith his creation. In Genesis, it says God made man in his own image. Hmmmm,if you take that statement to be true,it would be difficult to use any subjective reasoning to devalue life. Even more than the fact he made us in his image, is something much more profound. God the father placed so much value on life, that when his creation had been alienated by sin and was out of fellowship with him, he determined to bringhis creation back into fellowship through the act of his son becoming a man, just like youand me, and having his sonpay the price of sin by allowing him to suffer and die a humiliating deathon the cross that we might be able to regain the fellowship that was lost with God. To me, I can't think of anyway to place a higher value on life than to give your own life for that oflife you had created. Who is this God that loves us enough that he would die that we might live. I want to know a God that would do that. Not a mean angry God, but a God moved with love for his creation, a God who would stop at nothing to reunite with his creation to himself.
