However, today was probably as different a day from my normal routine as you'd get because I actually decided to skip training (hey, i felt crook when i woke up) and since it's Thursday, go SHOPPING! (Skipping training for shopping? God, what's next..?)  I actually spotted some nice shirts on sale at Westfield yesterday so I decided to run down to Parramatta to grab them and basically have a break for today - my body appreciates the fact I actually had some proper sleep this morning. Still more to catch up on, though. I had a chicken fillet subway sandwich on the way to parramatta and I realised that something in it leaves an aftertaste like cigarettes... Any clues anyone? I'm remember experiencing it before, so it definitely wasn't a case of someone leaving ashes in the ingredients while smoking on duty!  I remember now why I don't frequent shopping centres - they are dangerous to my wallet! Let's just say I bought more than just the shirts I saw yesterday. I rounded off my day by going grocery shopping at Coles in Penrith - now that doesn't really count as shopping twice in a day does it?  But anyways Shihan gave me a buzz to make sure I was alright because I didn't come into training today and mentioned that he ran the class into the ground today - sounds like I wouldn't have survived the class! Good timing on my part I guess...    Joel's random quote of the day:  "Don't be frustrated when you're surrounded by idiots - it makes it easier for people to recognise that you stand out from the crowd."
