I think tomorrow I will bring a book, I need something to take up my time when I'm not working on anything. Today we got to RMA (IE: send in a return) a huge monitor, the box weighed like 50 pounds. Stupid ViewSonic is so cheap that they make us pay shipping even on the returns (wish they were like gateway). Ah well, I guess I can't expect everyone to be perfect. It amazes me how people in the "real world" act. This whole summer I've been surrounded by the real world, during the day at least. The people swear when things happen, they don't have a problem with it... and yeah... hmm, I guess that's really all they do. Oh yeah, they do one more thing. The term "get a life" doesn't apply to these people, as their job is their life. I guess in other words, it's their carreer. I guess you really do want to make sure you love whatever you decide to do as a career.    Oh yeah, Armaan got his ear pierced. Crazy kid.
