 I've been mixing it up tonight.  I guess the steady diet of the same thing all day has made me crave variety.  I had a tiny piece of brownie (getting old brownie) and some licorice as well as a third dose of cirtrucel.  After this my gut is starting to react.  Gurgling and beching are back at low levels, and the back of my throat is tight or tired.  I don't know what of the three are causing it, but all contain some type of sugar.  Oh, and the headache is still around.  I haven't had enough water today for sure. 

 I'm actually kind of hungry.  I miss the feeling of being satisfactoraly full.  Not bloated - I get that feeling often enough - but full. I would try some of that soy yogurt tonight, but its already 10:40 pm and I do enjoy sleeping.
