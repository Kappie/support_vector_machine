Vey true in my opinion. Most of us are and will be working for the better part of our lives just to have the money to buy the stuff we want. Sometimes I wonder what it is like to be rich and be able to afford everything you want. Yes I know ENVY is one of the 7 sins.   On a brighter note , I am having loads of fun exchanging daily emails with a new net friend of mine; I used to do that with another net friend not a while back but we got into a silly argument and it just stopped after that. Of cos it prob wouldnt last but its gonna be fun while it does.
