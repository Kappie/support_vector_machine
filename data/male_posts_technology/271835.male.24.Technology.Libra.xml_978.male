In order to perpetuate this pointless exercise, I've decided to inflict it upon our visitors too.  So, here's the very first "Aks Newlinks" -- in honour of a nameless aquaintance of ILN.  Since most (all?) of us are using Firebird, which Firebird extensions do you use? (And if you're feeling loquacious, why?)  I use:    Adblock -- zap any ad. A must.  Web Developer -- Some nice context-menu extras for web page work.  Tabbrowser Extensions -- Save and load tab sessions, undo close, general managment. Nifty.  Image Zoom -- For those times you just want to "make it bigger". The picture, the picture!  IE View -- For the broken sites.  EditCSS -- Edit CSS on the fly.  Bug Me Not -- For those with You-Must-Register site blues.    I was also running FlashBlock on older versions, but last I heard it didn't work on the latest Firefox. But right now, for me, nor does flash. I must get around to fixing that...
