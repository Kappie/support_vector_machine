Oru valiya yenga annan blog pannitanga...athunala yennoda virathatha  ithudan mudithu kolgiren..... my pc was having fun with some virus ...so its was behaving in a crazy manner. Ranjini....yevalo thairiyam irunda u did not turn when my anna called you...iru iru unna pathukaren! I am not sure whether i fit into those voracious readers category....anyway thanx for that....the book i enjoyed the most was ' Contagion ' by Robin Cook....i have read most of Sidney Sheldon's books...looking forward to his latest ' The other side of Midnight ' - is that right Xavier.....lately started reading James Patterson's...recently read ' Silence of the Lambs ' and currently reading ' Hannibal '. BTW Xavier please collect your books from Vinod.  Towards late October and early November there were fireworks all over Uk...i thought perhaps English are celebrating Diwali as well...no..it was for something they call as 'Bonfire Night'...i didnt have a clue about it.So when I asked one of my English friend, this was the reply i got...  "In England, we like to be a little different from the rest of the world.Take fireworks festivals, for example. In every other country they are heldin summer. That's obviously the best time: warm weather to enjoy, and clearskies to see the fireworks.Not here. We have our Fireworks Night on 5 November, when it is damp, cold,and misty. Other countries use fireworks to celebrate success: sporting victories,musical events, weddings.Not here. We don't find success very interesting. We prefer heroic failure. Fireworks Night celebrates an attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliamentin 1605 that went wrong - the 'Gunpowder Plot'. On 5 November that year,Catholic terrorists smuggled 36 barrels of gunpowder into a cellar there.They hoped to bring down the government. However, they were caught just intime, and executed in a very slow and grisly manner.  So we celebrate this day every year with fireworks. Some of us celebratethe fact that they failed. Others celebrate the fact that they nearly succeeded. Here is something else very English. Fireworks Night is also called 'GuyFawkes Night'. Guy (or Guido) Fawkes was only a minor member of theterrorist group, the man who was going to light the fuse; the leader was called Robert Catesby. But Robert Catesby is a boring name. It sounds like an estate agent or a solicitor. Guy Fawkes is an intriguing, mysterious-sounding secret agent's name, so we remember him instead. "  Welcome Sri....perhaps a bit late one from me though! Mahendra...naya pathi yellam research panra pola?  Hmmmmmmm Valli....India poriya???
