See story with Worf, my friggen chicken.  He asked me last Thursday if he could borrow my truck for the weekend and I could use his car.  I said hell yes.  On Friday, I asked, out of curiosity what he was going to do with my truck, not that it mattered.  I bought it 15 years ago at a scratch and dent sale in Charleston SC after Hurricane Hugo whacked us with 138 mph sustained winds.    So, I am nostalgic about my hurricane truck.  The only vehicle left on the parking lot after the storm.  The corvettes were safely parked inside the dealership, unfortunately, the roof caved in on them.  My truck took the storm like a man, even though I refer to my truck as "her".  She has been places jeeps would have problems negotiating.  (I keep a shovel in the back at all times to dig her out...and a pitchfork, but that is another story...)    Jun found my truck has qualities that his car doesn't possess.  1. Nobody would park next to him at his apartment.  I think they are scared.  I must admit, I got a little crazy buying those fake, stick on bullet holes and put them all over my truck.  You would think I did a tour in southern Iraq with an American flag waving off of my antenna.  2. You get respect in this truck.  Nobody wants to cut you off, give you the bird, etc.  See above statement on possible reasons nobody will park next to my truck.  3. The passenger side door will come wide open when making a left turn.  I can't count the items I have lost from my passenger seat when this happens.  Luckily, all Jun lost was a bag of groceries.  I almost lost my cat, "agent orange" and a couple of my southern buddies got a well deserved scare.  He brought my truck back with some mud on the tires...I was proud.  I was hoping that he would get it stuck in the Everglades somewhere.  I love to dig my truck out of private property.  I take pride in doing this.  Well, here is his story.  I have to go home and watch Enterprise and keep my Amazon wife filled with wine.    John, how's my ride? As for me, I'm already having fun with the truck. Here's how it went.   Jun: *Loading up the old truck with groceries and stuff *   Professional beggar at walmart parking lot in nice suit and tie: Hello sir, I ran out of gas. Could you possibly help me out a bit?   Jun: *looks at gas station inside the walmart parking lot, 900 feet away* Which car is it? (wouldn't mind pushing this guy's car)   PBWPLNST: This one, the FORD SENTRA   Jun: *YA. RIGHT, Ford makes Sentra. Uh-huh. And it's a Toyota Collora* I guess I can push the car for you?   PBWPLNST: No, my car is right here and can't even make it to the gas station. Can you spare a few bucks so I can go home?    Jun: um, I don't have any on me, but if your car can make it to the gas station, I can give you a gallon - that'll get you home. (I don't carry cash later in the evening, but I had a card on me) Do you want me to push?  *I go behind the collora, err, Ford Sentra*   PBWPLNST: *PANICS* Ah, sir, please don't touch the car, the alerm will go off.   Jun: It's YOUR car, right? (playing game on this guy at this point)   PBWPLNST: *His face says BEEP! EXCEPTION OCCURRED - my logic blew up* Oh Man, just give me a few bucks, will ya? *executing the catch-all code*   Jun: SO...what?? Do you do this all day long in here? See, I don't know how much you are making but you're in nice suit, and just look at MY TRUCK. I can't even afford to fix this stupid window. *demonstrates the driver's side window behavior* Try that guy squeezing stuff in his Benz convertible. See, you don't have the eyes to choose the right client for your....*starts to lecture this guy for fun of it*   PBWPLNST: *Goes straight to the benz*   Jun: *I AM VICTORIOUS!* *Finds a whole new value in the old truck*
