Would it be:       * The car with the most horsepower?       * The car with the fastest top speed and acceleration?       * The most expensive car?   At the moment, the Bugatti Veyron appears to have it all:       * A W-16 engine that can produce 1,001 horsepower       * A top speed of 250+ mph (400+ kph)       * A zero-to-60 time of three seconds       * A zero-to-180 time of 14 seconds       * A price tag somewhere in the $1 million range. |  urlLink via  | An interesting read on the  urlLink Bugatti Veyron  in  urlLink How Stuff Works .
