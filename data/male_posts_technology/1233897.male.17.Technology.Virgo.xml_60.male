Armaan left I believe yesterday for his vacation to Six Flags, and I believe they're down in San Francisco at the moment. From the audiopost on his blog it sounds like an interesting trip so far... not really too fun though. Man I wish I could go on cool vacations... i havent in like... a long long time.  I'm really really really really hoping Sarah's parents will let her come over next Saturday. I'm doing lots of work at home so my mom will be ok with it, and I've got a lot of stuff planned (like... the whole day), in the end it just depends on if they'll let her come. I don't know that they're liking me too much anymore... I'm not sure... it'd be sad if they didn't :( Well, I don't think her Dad has a problem with me, but her Mom is (I think) starting to want me not to be around her very much. Oh well, we'll get older and that won't be a problem, and I can hope that it isn't true.  I was talking to this guy today about retirement trusts... they actually sound like  really really good idea. You can stick $1350 in a trust and wait 5 years, then retire and you get $87,000, and then a check for $9,300 a Month for the rest of your life. Is that crazy or what? I might put the money into it next year assuming I get another job, that would be so cool to retire right out of college (LOL), and only have to work because I want to rather than because it's a requirement.... like... I could be a developer or something! Neato dorrito.  Humm, what else... School starts on the 7th or 8th of September, after that no more work for me. It's bittersweet in many ways, I will like the break that school will be (it takes less time out of the day), but I will have homework. On top of that I will not have income again, and I probably won't get to see Sarah as often. I want to get into at least seeing her every two weeks... I really need my license.
