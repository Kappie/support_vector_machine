In just one of those galaxies there is known to be a solar system, which itself is made up of planets and stars.  One of these planets, as we know, is called Earth.  This is hard to comprehend, and the concept of time is incomprehensible on this scale.  Just measuring distance between points requires an understanding of millions of light years.  So it is all just there, a great energy in space.  Somehow within all of this, our Earth maintains a balance of life.  This in itself is quite difficult to grasp, knowing that it is all just spinning in a massive and empty space.  When you consider these statements, life itself seems quite miraculous.  Then entire human existance is really not even a speck in the total of the universe.  And a single lifetime is insignificant compared to that speck.  But to people, time is relative.  We've been put here and given something that most creatures don't have; the ability to understand, speculate, contemplate, and have conscious thought.  It's all quite hard to fathom.  It seems that for the most part, the majority of society doesn't take advantage of this.  Lives are judged by unnatural standards; financial success, consumption, and material possessions.  We push the limits of the natural world, and in the process it seems as though we are destined to destroy it.  We are the only species that seems motivated by these desires.  Other species simply exist, as they are innately programmed to do.  They have a naturalness to their lives, and their existance is exactly that.  As humans, we have some extraordinary abilities, but it sometimes seems that they will drive us to a breaking point.  Of course, there have been many discoveries, achievements, and successes in the history of mankind, and as part of our existence, curiousity of the new and unknown seems natural.  But at the core of life, we are really just another species on this planet, and we should try to accept this.  It's good to step back every now and then.  To ponder the universe is exciting, as there is plenty to be amazed about.  It gives a feeling of connectedness to our surroundings and the world we live in.  Success is often judged by how much, how big, how far things have come or gone.  It seems that we should learn to enjoy this life we have rather than invent ways to destroy it.
