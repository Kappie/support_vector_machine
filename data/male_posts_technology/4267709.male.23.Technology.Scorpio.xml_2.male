You have to be friggin kidding me.  If you can't take the heat, Senator, get out of the kitchen. In case you've been asleep for the last 6 months, Bush had to contend with Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11  and didn't resort to whining and threatening legal action...give it a rest and maybe just shut up (like Bush did) if you're not going to address the accusations directly. You don't have to, if that's your prerogative.
