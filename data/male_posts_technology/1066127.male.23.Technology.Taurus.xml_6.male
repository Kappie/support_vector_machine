I'm going to see STOMP tomorrow night, with some tickets I got through work. Should be interesting, and I'm excited since I've heard a lot of good things about the show. Ben Stein wrote an editorial about  urlLink How to Ruin American Enterprise  where he rants on about the decline of the American work ethic and willingness to take responsibility for our actions. I quite agree.
