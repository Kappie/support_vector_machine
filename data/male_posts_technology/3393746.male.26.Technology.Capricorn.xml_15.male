They are free within the ocean and unafraid of its size. They are untouched and unruly and at the same time untamed and passionate. They go up and down...never stoping and never ending...just there in the vast ocean...trying to reach somewhere...no one knows where they start and where they end...but they keep moving...  These waves give ocean a life...they make the journey through the ocean interesting, captivating and enthralling...after all who would like to sail in a dead sea...the challenge for the sailer is nothing but these very waves which could even bring his or her downfall but then harnessing, taming and finally riding them would give him the ultimate satisfaction and the ultimate achievement...  Ocean waves actually hit the reality in the form of sea shore...the rocks on the sea shore are like society, environment, system anything and everything that is static...for the wave they are static...they dont move and dont go anywhere...they are just there to give the ocean its form and shape...  if i think in this way, i realized...dreams like waves have to strike on the rocks to give them shapes...and change themselves too in the process...if they dont change and hit the rock in the same way they would make in roads into the rocks but would be able to shape them....  thats what i see we also have to do...make ours dreams strike the our day to day life...make them conflict with our work, our relationships and our environment, if we start doing then gradually the dreams would become more realistic...similar to the waves the dreams would also undergo a change in order to give shape to life, to our environment and to our society....so when u test them with realty the dreams would strike a balance and offcourse raise the bar for u as a person but a realistic raise...moreover it would make it easy to define the aim out of the dream...so the aspiration would become aim and once it becomes an aim it would definitely be achievable....  thats i guess would be way to achieve one's dreams...not sure how much makes sense...i myself have to do it to get them into a realistic form...
