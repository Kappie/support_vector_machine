I had to go to Croydon to get some fabric which I have been putting off for ages. met up with amy who I haven't seen for four months. We went to The George and I was drinking JD and coke and now I feel a bit funny cos I had a few. Apaprently you can get drunk on JD quickly so, er, I think I am bit tipsy? I wil be back tomorrow, shouldn't be cos I'm still ill but i can't afford anymore days off.
