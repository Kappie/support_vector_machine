The tool is designed for a wide range of users, including Software Engineers, System Analysts, Business Analysts, System Architects alike, who are interested in building large scale software systems reliably through the use of the Object-Oriented approach. VP-UML supports the latest standards of Java and UML notations and provides the industry's full round-trip code generation and code reverse engineering support for Java.
