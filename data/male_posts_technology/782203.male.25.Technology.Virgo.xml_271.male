There is also a DVD release featuring some of their concerts which I am definitely gonna get...first I need to buy DVD player.   But I have to say this, if you consider yourself a serious rock fan then you NEED to go listen to Led Zeppelin, cos they were basically the blueprint that most rock bands  base their music on. And they sound even more amazing live, you can check out the 2-CD set Led Zeppelin: BBC Sessions to see what I am talking about.
