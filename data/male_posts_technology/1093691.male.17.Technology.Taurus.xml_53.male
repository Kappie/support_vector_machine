That is the best I can do unless you want dates for half term? I leave on the Sunday come back on the Friday. Happy now?  And for anyone in the blog or anyone who reads the blog and thinks that the war on Iraq won't happen I will now quote George Best who I think has put this extremly well:  I wish all these people who are dithering about whether or not we should invade Iraq would stop wasting valuable oxygen. We  will  be going to war against Saddam Hussein, it's as simple as that. It's pretty obvious that the Americans have already made up their minds, and I'm glad they have the guts to do it.  And it goes on from there. And also please keep in mind that  you cannot prepare and prevent war at the same time .  [EDIT]I FOUND THE PICTURE! Its a picture of Ryan Merriman an dtis alien kid he tries to save for episode 4 of Taken, he gets killed, they both get killed, in a fire:  urlLink HERE .
