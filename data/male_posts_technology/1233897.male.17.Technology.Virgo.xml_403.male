I *ahem* only found out that it was a party for  both of them  after I got there, so I only got Darren a present. (Sorry Jon, yours is coming - lol) Darren’s birthday was today, Jon's is this Sat.  Btw, I'm operating like yesterday is actually 'today' again on account of my not having slept yet, so Darren's b-day is actually on the 8th.  I didn't get any pictures or anything because my mom has the camera at the moment... and I just found out today that my dad's taking our camcorder with him on his month-long trip to Iran in a week; a fact that I'm none to pleased about and that has me working like mad dumping footage onto my computer and editing it before he takes it.  Whatever... I've got summer school tomorrow morning and I've slept though it every other day this week so I'd better get off and at least try to get to sleep.  G'night world~
