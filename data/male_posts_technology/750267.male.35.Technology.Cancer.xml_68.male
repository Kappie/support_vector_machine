A quote from the Austrailian web site The Age:   Seventeen months later, such confidence looks grimly ironic. For most Afghans, "liberation" has meant the return of rival warlords, harsh repression, rampant lawlessness, widespread torture and Taliban-style policing of women. Meanwhile, guerilla attacks are mounting on United States troops, and the likelihood of credible elections next year appears to be close to zero.  Yes, what the U.S. has promised to undertake in Iraq is not going to be easy. I wish them the best of luck -- I really do. I've always said, if what the Americans appear to want to do actually works, Mr. Bush's and Mr. Blair's risky gamble will have paid off handsomely. The same way betting your house on a 45-1 long-shot at the racetrack will pay off handsomely. It's just not wise.
