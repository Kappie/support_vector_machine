Bastard. Then, when I thought he'd finally given in and gone to sleep, he got a kind of confused and frowning expression on his face, followed by what can only be described as a unholy stench filtering out of his nappy, filling the cabin. Eugh.  So I'm completely knackered and making my way towards customs. I have sprinted down the arrivals corridor to get there quickly as I know from experience that you do NOT want to be the last person queuing behind the contents of a 747 at Australian Immigration control. I get through really easily, the guy even cracks a joke with me and I head towards the baggage reclaim. When what appears to be a 12 year old customs official steps out and wants to ask me a few questions.   Actually, my entire life's history and my inside leg measurement would be more accurate.  "So.. You're an I.T. contractor. Do you need and qualifications for that?" "Well, there's lots of lights and stuff.."  That went down like a lead balloon. After twenty hours in a steel tube with a screaming French baby and some really dire movies, I wasn't in the mood to fuck around.  After checking I wasn't smuggling in anything more illicit than a couple of jars of marmite, I was free to go. Michael was kind enough to feed me scotch and coke for a few hours, which ensured that when I did go to bed at a sensible hour I was well and truly out of the game.  Quiet day today to get over the jet lag, then some shopping tomorrow in Chatswood's "fucking huge" shopping centres.  I'll keep you posted.
