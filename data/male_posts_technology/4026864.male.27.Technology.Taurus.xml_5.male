I'm dying to pay for it now.  So hand me the rocks To help weigh me down And tether my legs with a cord tightly bound to the End of an anchor Thrown in to the sound And test me to see If I Will rise Against The worst That it  Can get.  I wasn't well for a while I savor the things that I knew Were sure to destroy me And that seemed to hold me That seemed to carry me where I couldn't go On the strength of my own But I should've known That that gets me nowhere I've learned that now I swear  I earlier days They'd persecute people They'd carry them off And hobble their legs For lesser offences Than how I have harmed you But still you allow me To walk free of pain Though I punish myself I will never settle The debts I've incurred For scorning the face Of absolute beauty And measureless grace And though I once mocked you I'm dying to pay for it now. I'm dying to pay for it now Now Now  So hand me the rocks To help weigh me down And tether my legs with a cord tightly bound To the end of an anchor Thrown in to the sound And test me to see If I Will rise Against The worst That it Can get.  Well I wasn't sure that I could Well I wasn't sure that I could Well I wasn't sure that I could But I can.
