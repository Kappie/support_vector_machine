It was amazing the way the community came together and showed their support, just the entire island participated in this food drive in one way or another for the most part, really cool.  Last Sunday I ran another biathlon.  This one was a 2.8 mile run and a 800m swim.  I convinced a Level III technician that I work with to race against me so that was fun.  Actually, he told me that he could beat me, so it was more like a made him race me.  But it was fun, we got the office to bet money on us and the winner ended up getting like 50 bucks.  I won the race and this lady Mary at work won the pool.  It was cool though, pictures are up for that already.  Not much else been going on.  Been getting to the beach a fair amount again.  Weather is getting hot again now too.  Heather is coming in a few weeks, and Andy comes in late June and is gonng be here for at least 2 months, got his ticket out here officialy now, gonna be pretty damn sweet.
