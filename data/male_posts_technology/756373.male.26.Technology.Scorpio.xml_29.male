Specifically, I am referring to the recent MapHack doing the rounds on Battle.Net/Warcraft3. The argument(s) being thrown my way indicate that "you don't play a lot of ladder so stfu!". Personally, I find that a rather stupid, childish and downright "I got a bigger wingwong than you" attitude. So, Mr "Speak no evil" : merely because I play Warcraft 3 casually instead of professionally, I am supposed to sit there, eat humble pie, and say   nothing   when some punk uses a maphack against me? What exactly is your problem? Are you scared that, by me voicing my opinion, I may 'scare' away a potential Warcraft3 community in our fair section of the world? Newsflash. They WILL hear about this elsewhere. Me shutting my piehole certainly isn't going to change things. As for my views that perhaps it would be wiser to lay off playing online until a patch arrives, it is merely that, my opinion. I am sure other people can actually make up their own minds. In fact, I am sick to fucking  death  of the train of thought doing the rounds on the PH Forums , that people are not allowed to air their views or opinions anymore. There's an ideal out there that helped eradicate this kind of oppression : It's called freedom of fucking speech! It's what the free world is based on you fucking dimwits! It's ridiculous - I get flamed by the webmaster for shitting on some n00b about said n00b dragging up and reflogging an already-dead horse, I get flamed for pointing out the obvious about huntresses being fucked (Dis must be the only guy on the web that thinks otherwise), I get crapped on for innocently making a small statement regarding the maphack, I get blamed for standing up to some female who comes in with a PMS streak a mile-wide and the single motive to flame every male on the forums because we are being 'sexist' (it's not alright for us to poke fun at anorexics, but it's okay for her to make jokes about penis size and obesity?). And then said new member chickens out and leaves the PH community, and fingers get pointed at me. I am  THIS  fucking close to giving the whole PH community the proverbial finger. Never, while there, have I denied someone the right to express their views, no matter how ridiculous. Sure I've judged, sure I've flamed, but not  once  have I accused them of being wrong for AIRING their views! Or denied them their right to speak out! It's infinitely worse(and easier) to just shut the fuck up and ignore a problem, than to say something about it and maybe create some awareness. All I have to say to those propogating the notion that perhaps it's better to say nothing, is this old cliche : "Ignorance is bliss".  The more I think about it, the more I get the feeling that it's a case of 'because you said it, we will fight you on it". Maphacking  is  a serious problem. Blizzard  themselves  are in an uproar about it. With that in mind, to casually dismiss it as 'not that serious' and flame me for advocating a no-play policy until a patch is released is really.fucking.stupid.
