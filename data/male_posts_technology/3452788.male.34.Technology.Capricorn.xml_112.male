Anne’s parents are turning into old people, sometimes funny old people, but definitely not healthy old people.    I have the bad feeling that there will be some sad times ahead for Anne as her family gets older.    Her grandma is 83 and in relatively good shape after losing Grandpa 18 months ago;    her dad is 60, and essentially subsists on crackers, ice cream, and coffee; her mom is 57, overweight, high blood pressure, and sometimes looks very ill (although none will admit it, being from stubborn, hardy stock Midwest families); her aunt and uncle appear healthy but at ages 54 and 63 (I’m guessing there) have their own problems.    Our brother-in-law, who is on dialysis and needs a transplant, could turn serious very quickly.    I’m afraid that in the next 5 to 10 years there will be lots of health problems and possibly deaths in her family.       How will this affect me?    Since I really have no family, these people are my extended family as well.    I have no one to care for as they age, so I will do whatever I can for her parents.    I will need to be strong for Anne, because it will hit her very hard.    I know I can be strong and support her, but at the same time it will hurt me also.           I realize this is a depressive thought train, worrying about and anticipating sad events before they even happen.    Hopefully I can avoid dwelling on this idea.
