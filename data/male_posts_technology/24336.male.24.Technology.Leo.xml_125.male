When I read that  urlLink Famke Janssen was learning to lap dance  for a new film, I didn't pay much attention.  Later in the day when I realized that  urlLink Janssen  played Dr. Jean Grey in the X Men movie, my thoughts fully changed.  She is one of under 5 women in the public eye (read: celebrities) that I find attractive.  The others include Natalie Portman and Christy Turlington.
