I went in there tonight for a few games of pool with Dougal and Lady Kate, and the place is MINGING.  I asked for a coke and took it upstairs, after I took a swig I noticed that the glass had been used, there were bits of something all over the rim. It looked like somebody had given birth into it. I gagged and took it back to the bar. I asked for a clean glass and the barmaid looked at me like a pubic hair in a bowl of soup. She went to pour the coke from the scum bucket glass into a new one, and I said i'll have a new coke as well thanks..  Also the furniture has stains and fag holes all over it.  And it smells of wee.  Eugh.
