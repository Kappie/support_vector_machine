The point being that being comfortable with who you are, and respecting yourself will make you attractive to others(love wise anyway)  Sometimes I think I am a total asshole that nobody would like (work has a way of turning you into the enemy when you'd just as happily surf the internet like your compatriots) or a "nice" guy that nobody wants to sleep with.   I know that I'm a nice guy, but I have a tendency to at least try to hit rock bottom as Chuck would say. I'm torn between the slacker that I could be and the responsible man/boy that I am.  I know that I'm cute, but I never come off as overly confident when talking to women, which I KNOW is not a turn on. It's the great mystery. Wanting sex, but playing at that you don't want it.  I do miss sex. Masturbation just isn't the same as getting it on. I know that not all of you might realize this, but I have lost that sacred virginity thing a while ago :O   Anyway, it's not like I'm looking at just wanting sex. It's the whole relationship that would be nice. I want to be desired and fulfill that desire in someone else.  Please note: In case you can't tell I'm still working 70/hr work weeks and have NO time to pursue a full on relationship. As I thought of it tonight, my life is a big canvas of grey, where I have no need to leave work, but I see the rainbow at the end of the tunnel and long for that day when I'll have my accrued earnings and no job:)  Here's to new friends and old enemies- Peace- The T
