I had a brilliant day, I felt like I was wired on caffiene or something stronger the whole day.. bursting with energy, people even commented.. I was acting like a nut. I think maybe I was high on life. I decided to stop waiting for my friend Jon to start doing the davinci sleep patterns, and to just do it.. hell I'd started jogging today, why not do the sleep pattern thing too.. and I've picked my 4hrly schedule to be 8am midday 4pm 8pm midnight , picked because it most closely fits in with what a normal work day would be, and seems logical to me at least. By 8am I'd alread accomplised all the computer work I had to do today, so I climbed into bed for my first 20 minute nap, fully expecting as per the experiences of others, to be unable to sleep.. apparently it takes a couple of weeks before your body adjusts. Within minutes I was out like a light, only to wake up not at all groggy, 20 minutes later. Brilliant, beginners luck! I talked briefly to Jon online about my experiences , and we reasoned I'm probably not getting the quality REM sleep that I later will get... seems logical, although I havent ruled out my body being particularly tuned to this sort of sleep behaviour yet.. I can sleep at the stock cars, and in the weirdest places. Anyway, between 8:20 and midday, I find several funny movies on the net including a star wars rap, and george bush and kerry singing 'this land is our land' before heading off to the Gym 4-5 km down the road, on foot, to inquire about prices. I return by 11pm having already signed up membership starts next week. Bugger. Now I need trackpants and other fitness accessories. Ahh well. What price is too much for my own wellbeing? Anyway. Sorted. Davinici sleep patterns, saving 6hrs a day, over the average life span of 100 odd years, will add up to 25years of 'bonus' time, that I wouldnt have otherwise had... that's a lot of time... hard to look at those figures and go 'meh, not worth it' Gradually over the last few weeks a hint of a cough/cold/sore throat has sneaked in.. tonight its noticeably hard to swallow, maybe its off to the Doc for mr Chris. Anyway.. 8pm nap coming up. TTFN
