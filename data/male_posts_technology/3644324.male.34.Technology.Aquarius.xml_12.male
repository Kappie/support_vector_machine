If only I wasn't a complete klutz I wouldn't have fallen flat on my positively ponderous posterior for no apparent reason, foregoing an easy point - and I think demoralizing the other team to the extent that they would have conceded.      If only I wasn't made of matchsticks and plasticine my achilles\calf wouldn't have exploded early in the first game and I could have contributed in a more meaningful way than keeping my lawn chair securely rooted to the ground. Though keeping the chair from running ontothe field was integral to at least three of our points.      If only we could all be more like Peter we'd have scored on 26 exciting hucks into the endzone.       If only "I totally contest" was a valid argument.      If only The Main served Johnny Cakes then all would not have been for naught.      If only we'd had a ninja of our own...then we would have been Kung fu fighting....those cats were fast as lightening...in fact it was a little bit frightening...      And in conclusion...that was a great effort by everyone last night. Not to toot our horn too much (carpal horn syndrome you know)but I think we could have won either or both of those games last night with a little luck. We are completely deserving of our "Kings of Ultimate" moniker and I foresee many glorious victories in Division 1 for us. Well done all of you!! Huzzah!       Carry on.
