Should people keep looking at WSE 1.0 and 2.0 and 3.0 and ..... or wait for Indigo architecture? Here is a great resource to tackle that question. http://msdn.microsoft.com/theshow/episode040/default.asp It's a John Shewchuk show on the .NET show talking about Indigo: when it started, what the roadmap is, why/how the relationship with IBM and also how WSE gradually will 'evolve' into Indigo.  Given the SOA is the architecture of the future, this will be a very interesting development to watch!! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.
