I'd quote a few Scriptures and throw them into the mix. We've had much opinion and what not, but God's Word is what counts, so I'll present it here.   1Pe 3:7  Ye husbands, in like manner, dwell with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered.  In this verse, husbands are told to give honour to their wives because they are the weaker vessel, and are (equally) heirs of grace. The greek word behind this translation of honour is timeÌ„. This word indicates an honour that is shown because of the status of the object of the honour. We should honour our wives, because the role that God has given them makes them vulnerable to 'exploitation'.    Col 3:19  Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.  In this passage men are commanded to love their wives. The Bible asks men to love their wives in most passages I have looked up on wives and husbands, indicating that it is an important instruction, and it is something men seem to find hard to do. Pay it heed!   Eph 5:25  Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it;  Eph 5:26  that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,  Eph 5:27  that he might present the church to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.  Eph 5:28  Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself:   Another passage that emphasizes the depth of love that a man must have for his wife. His concern is to b for his wife's physical and spiritual state. He is to love her like he cares for his own body. It is a sacrificial love, a love of servant leadership. If a man does not love his wife in this way, he is a slack reflection of Christ.   Tit 2:4  that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,  Tit 2:5  to be sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed:   And to the women. They too must love their husbands, and their children (it is assumed that it is natural for a marriage to produce children). They must be 'in subjection' to their husbands, so that God's Word may not be blasphemed. The Greek word that is translated to subjection here is from hupotasso, which means to be subordinate, to obey, be subject to, and to submit oneself to. If a wife does not do this, it is not her husband she sins against, but God she blasphemes against.   1Pe 3:1  In like manner, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be gained by the behavior of their wives;  Again the Greek word hupotasso, is used here. In this case, the woman who is married has an unbelieving husband. he may be a slack or harsh leader, but by her very actions of submitting to him, she can win him to Christ. What a glorious thought!    Eph 5:22  Wives, be in subjection unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.  Eph 5:23  For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the church, being himself the saviour of the body.  Eph 5:24  But as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their husbands in everything. Once again hupotasso is used.  Marriage again is seen to reflect Christ's relationship to the church. Jut as the church submits to Christ in all things, so the wife must submit to the husband in all things. This submission should occur in the same way as submission to the Lord occurs.   Eph 5:33  Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she fear her husband.   Here the husband again is told to love his wife AS himself. Tough stuff guys. Specially if you love yourselves lots hehe. And the wife must fear her husband. This comes from the Greek word phobeo. It can mean to fear, to be in awe of, or to revere.   And lastly a word to the guys:-   1Ti 3:12  Let deacons be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.  If we want to be a leaders in God's church, we must be leaders ub our family.   A lot of tough stuff in there for both sexes, but it is the Word of God. Isn't it funny that God's word picks out the things that each sex has the most difficulty with and hones in on it. Men can be very callous and unloving, and they are commanded to have a  the  most sacrificial love. Women find it easier to love, but difficult to come under the submission of their husbands.   The muddied waters of secular education   (from Maxim Institute's Real issues newsletter  The Ministry of Education has funded the building of a mosque at Hagley Community College in Christchurch. With 120 Muslim migrant students, Hagley will provide the country's first purpose-built mosque in a public school.   Is it reasonable to use taxpayer's money to invest in a place of worship for a particular religion? To do so would appear to contravene the 'secular' basis of state schooling going back to the 1877 Education Act. There are of course, options for parents seeking religious schooling. The Integration Act of 1975 provides for special (religious) character schools to receive state funding for operations and teacher salaries; and there are private or independent schools, most of which are linked to Christian churches and specific denominations.   In the interests of preserving a clear separation of all churches and religious expressions from the state, the secular clause makes sense, especially when there are the options of integration, independent schools, and an amount of local discretion eg. ('Bible in School' programmes). Funding the Hagley mosque goes beyond these options though, and muddies the waters of an important constitutional separation.
