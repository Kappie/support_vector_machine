Artists consistently impress me, stupid people consistently stupify me, and bloggers always interest me... (well usually anyway)  This one time I read this one blog(I don't really remember it) but then I was like "who are these people and what are they talking about" and then I was like I dunno and now I've forgotten about em except how I wrote this blog about them.
