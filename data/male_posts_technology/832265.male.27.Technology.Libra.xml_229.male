Bonnell wants to call games "interactive entertainment": this is a common rhetorical strategy, but it always gets up my nose ...  You can see this strategy everywhere: It's gaming, not gambling. It's erotica, not porn. It's speculative fiction, not sci fi. To which the only honest response is: Bullshit.
