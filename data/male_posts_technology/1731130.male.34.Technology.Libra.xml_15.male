I'd like to see more of what I like to call "technology in reverse", that is, taking some usefull technology and use it to achieve something with as least point as possible. In other words, get the gadget and work out what you need it for afterwards.  Take this example. A Global Positioning System (GPS) might be a very useful bit of kit, but consider the possibilities if you put it to pointless use. By switching it on, keeping a running bead on where you went, you could drive around in such a way as to create line art. That's what's happening here. These guys turn on the GPS and drive around. Some of the results are amazing.  Completely pointless, but amazing.  Link:  GPSDrawing.com
