I have one lesson this morning and that is geology and that consists of watching the fifth element which at the moment I still stand by as being a bad film but then again only 1 hour into it, roughly.  I am going Croydon tonight to get Jackie a pressie :) I know you said you didn't want any by Jackie you know I am gonna get you summit.   You have just won one million dollars:    1. Who do you call first?  Family then Paul.  2. What is the first thing you buy for yourself?  A new life. No sorry I dunno. There isn't anythingI desparatly want. Perhaps driving lessons then a car or something I dunno.  3. What is the first thing you buy for someone else?  Whatever Paul wants.   4. Do you give any away?  I'd give to the company or organisation that looks after the war graves. I am sure there must be a donation area somewhere and I shall donate. 5.  Do you invest any? If so, how?  Put some away in one of those accounts where if you don't touch it for like six years you get double or something silly like that. Put some away for uni and let interest gather.
