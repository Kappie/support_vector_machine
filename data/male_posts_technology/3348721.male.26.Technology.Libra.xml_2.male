The new wembley stadium looks like a giant Asda, that's all i could say when i saw it. "it's just another bloody Asda building". why they couldn't knock down the arena as well is beyond me, But then i suppose they use it for ice hockey as well as shit gigs. I'd forgotten how grim it is up there. Again, it's another place i get to work in where there is nothing to do at lunch so you might as well work through it. At least there wasn't so many chavvy type people about which is what i've been used to. The people in Wembley just look genuinely put out and hard done by. The Sad thing about my excursion today was that i decided it was best to go into Kings Cross first, which was way off course but i assumed this would be the only place i would get a decent, large coffee before work. I'm proud to say i was right. I also got home in record time tonight which was another nice little bonus to the day.  I bought the new  urlLink Morrisey  album yesterday. It's good! the first few songs, i felt were growers but the Moz of old seems to kick in when it gets to 'the world is full of crashing bores'. 'how can anyone...', 'first of the gang to die' and 'i like you' are typical anthemic Morrisey tunes. I wont harp on about it as i'm sure this Album wont appeal to a lot of people but i recommend it to anyone who has dabbled in the black arts of 'Mozza' before.  I've had to hide the Shins new album as it's in danger of being overplayed and it would be such a shame for this to happen. i'm gonna try and give it a couple of months now.  Someone informed me today that Keane had got to number 1 in the album charts. Can someone please bloody explain how this happened? i read in an NME recently that they considered  urlLink 'Aphex twin'  to be a big influence on the act.. huh? who tells them to say this shit?? another band in a long line that spurt on about influential artists that they blatantly have nothing in common with. Is anyone safe from the oily brush of PR? Probably not.   i've promised myself that i'm going to do some music tonight, the 'new' band is now making a lot of progress and i'm hoping we'll have at least 3 songs for people to chin stroke, ponder and slowly shake their heads at very soon.  I finally got round to seeing Donnie Darko too on Sunday albeit on a poorly lit laptop and the sound wasn't that hot either. Shame really as it was a good film. Not as great as I was told it would be but their were some nice touches, fairly easy to take in, interesting plot but i wasn't left with anything to think about at the end of the film which i think that's what it wanted (it *was* one of those films, wasn't it?) but at least there was no shit A.I or other form of drawn out Hollywood ending which i feared may happen.   ok, enough of this for now. Things need to be done.
