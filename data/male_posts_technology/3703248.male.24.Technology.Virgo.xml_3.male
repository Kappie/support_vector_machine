During the past year I have gone from a person who couldn’t run 1/8th mile, to someone who could run at my highest 10 miles.  Currently I am able to run 2 miles, but my goal is 26.2 miles, so I have gone in reverse far as my training.  Losing weight is hard for me, but gaining it is easy.  I don’t have a fast metabolism, but running helps make up for my cursed genetics.  My goal is to lose the 55.5 pounds extra by Christmas, but doing that will fairly be difficult.  Everyone’s body is different.  It is this fact that no diet will work for everyone.  I enjoy carbohydrates too much to punish myself by eating the Atkins diet.  My method of dieting is to rapidly try things and adapt to what works.  Sometimes it is successful, sometimes it is not, but the body seems to change so what works now, may not work in two or three weeks.  Damn.
