And they're releasing a warmed-over re-released song album ('greatest? hits'). Am I the only one who's not excited at all about this? I'm sorry, but there was only one Van Halen, and it ended sometime in 1984 (with a brief reprise when DLR contributed to a couple of newer songs for Greatest Hits, Vol. 1). They were good songs, and there were many of us fans who have too much time on our hands that were hoping for a more permanent reunion. Oh, well... Didn't happen. I still have DLR's CD's. Some were better than others, but you gotta hand it to the guy: he doesn't ever friggin' stop rockin'.  Or does he? Where is he now? I thought I hear on NPR last week that he is training to be a paramedic in NYC. I can't find his web site, either.  So is David gone from the music biz? Was the last CD ("Diamond Dave" a.k.a. "DLR Does Better Covers than Originals") his last?
