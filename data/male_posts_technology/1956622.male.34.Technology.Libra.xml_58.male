She told me about it and I tried to comfort her as much as possible over the phone but lets me honest the phone is never as good as a hug or a kiss to make it better.  She then wanted to watch cartoons and had no use for me any longer and hung up.  I bought her birthday present today, at least the one I am taking to MI anyway, it is a cat that you put batteries in and it meows and purrs and stuff.  Knowing how much Karissa loves cats I thought she would like it.  So I am not sure what is going on lately.  I am driving along and next thing you know I am thinking about   SFW   I am not sure why I just am.  I don't know if it is my upcoming trip or what but I have dreams about her and think about her and stuff and I don't understand why.      SFW   deserves none of my thoughts, time, or anything else!  I have always been very logical and analytical about most things but this makes no sense to me.
