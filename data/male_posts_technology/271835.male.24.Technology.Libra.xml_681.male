So you should be able to:  Sign up and get your GMail address + 2 invites  Go to  urlLink GMailSwap   Profit  We'll have none of those ????? steps to profit on New Links! And I didn't say 'Google announces GMail' once. Bugger.  And in other news that Merg may be interested in - I've fixed the Javascript so it works in  urlLink Mozilla  now. It did work before I added the new template but when I put the code into the new template I just assumed it would work. Silly me. I fixed it at the weekend with the help of Firefox's cool Javascript console so you should now have a new comment count, clickable date links to  urlLink Wikipedia  and the icon changing code for cut  paste icon goodness.  I think that's worth a picture of Times Square! ;)
