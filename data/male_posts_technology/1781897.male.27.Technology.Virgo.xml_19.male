I find myself in a situation where I will make consessions, bend over backwards, dismiss my agneda, and in the end, I still will have failed.  Why do I allow this type of situation to exist?  How do I not see it coming?  Why do I do nothing to avoid it?   My life as a tour guide  Starring Ben Dover and Phil MaCavity
