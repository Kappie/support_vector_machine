I think some of Jacko's music is ok, even good but as a person he is very very strange.  Bush has gone home today. Hope he enjoyed his pub lunch. Media have been attacked in Baghdad. Wopee. The war is upon us again.  I'm still feeling ill. Headache and stuffy nose now. I didn't leave school until 3pm which was pretty dumb seeing as we had an early closure and I had fourth free so I could've gone home at 1.30. Oh well. Work at 9am tomorrow. Yay.
