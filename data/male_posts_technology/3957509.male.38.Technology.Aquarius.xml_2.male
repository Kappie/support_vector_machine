Well, today has been of those days for me.  When I woke up this morning, I had a strange feeling (no, it wasn't Colm doing something naughty, hehe). I couldn't quite put my finger on it; then it hit me! I felt safe and secure. What an awesome feeling! I thought about where I was personally in January of this year: things were good, but I was alone. Then, March happened - meeting Colm, starting a new relationship with him, and eventually making one of the more difficult decisions for a couple - moving in together. When I picked Colm up from the airport last Friday  my heart was singing, my pulse racing - this was it, ready, steady, go! The unreality of things, you may ask? Maybe not so much unreal, but surreal - life passing by, being connected, yet not; loving, and being loved. I sometimes think that I will wake from my dream state...but Colm assures me that this not a dream. He is a great man, and I love him with all my being.  Clarity attained? As I have as one of my favourite quotes by James Baldwin (an author that, as of May 2004, I did not know): "Love him and let him love you. Do you think anything else under heaven really matters?" This is my life. Thanks for your being a part of it!  Peace!
