I didn't used to like meat and didn't eat steak for years, but now I like it for some reason.  Maybe my body is lacking something.  The people in my department decided to walk back to work instead of take the train.  It was only 5 blocks - not too far, but I am hot now.  I want to have a cigarette and then take a nap, but alas, I am here at my desk ... not working.
