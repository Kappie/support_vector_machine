She was born on April 26th, a day before my birthday :D I've got a million pictures so if you'd like to see her post a comment, send an email or come hang out :)  She is scared of the dark so I've been sleeping (or trying to) with the light on.  I've got a horrible cold... you can imagine a sleeping kittens reaction to *AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO* in the middle of the night... took me an hour to get her out from under my bed.. poor girl.  I went to the Om festival this year... was a great time.  BLA had great set after great set... and there is another Music Festival coming up next weekend... I just have to figure out if I'm all partied out or not... my feet have almost healed - who knew dancing for hours in new sandles was a bad idea?  youch...   Concerts continued.. I went to The Tragically Hip last night with Sean and Erin... was a GREAT time!  :)  They played a lot of new stuff from their album that JUST came out 2 days ago.. i haven't had a chance to pick it up yet.  Speaking of new Albums - The Streets has an amazing new album out called "a grand dont come for free" --Mike Skinner is 'The Streets', an urban poet with skill that is jaw dropping.  If I've never exposed you to them before - go download Dry your Eyes... a crushing stroy about lost love.  If you like what you hear I'd suggest downloading the album, lyrics and listening to it from start to finish... its a concept album... it tells a story and from start to finish you can identify with his world... ok. enough.  Movies?  I guess I've seen a few... Harry Potter 3 - blah.  It wasnt bad but professor dumbldor (the new one) lost his magic... in the first two he had a magestic nature like santa clause... the new actor is hurried and unconvincing.  I saw Michael Moore's new "documentry" and was impressed.  Though cut-editing was obvious he really made some great points.  See the film and choose your stance somewhere between the conspiricy theroies, trusting the govn't, and grass roots movements.    Name that quote: "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed people can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."  iiiight ;) I'm sick and am ging to take a nap. thanks for reading,  Jer
