My X-Men: Evolution fanfic -- still in shuffling-research-notes-stasis mode, but hopeful the birthing contractions for the long-anticipated (well, at least *I've* been anticipating its arrival) Chapter Five will start to kick in earnest soon... my 8-part 'modern classical' piano piece -- yes, long-time readers, that damn thing *still* hasn't reached final draft status (so I suppose I'll have to mark it as something like 'copyright 2002,2004'?) -- I'll scan a page in sometime soon... Add to all of the above a new jazz tune that I (literally) dreamed up the algorithmic composition programming logic for a couple of days ago, another jazz tune (this one in 7/4) that I've been tinkering with (both in my head and in fragmentary MIDI form) since sometime in   1993   (!!!), and the long-deferred goals of cutting a CD of original music and forming a new band -- and still procrastination continues to have its strange and oddly compelling, almost hypnotic, inertial appeal...
