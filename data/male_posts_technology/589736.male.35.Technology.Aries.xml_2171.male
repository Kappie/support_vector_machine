If every single vote cast for Nader had been cast for Gore, which is of course extremely arrogant supposition, then yes, Al Gore would be the president of the United States (shudder),  But, it would not have turned into the landslide that Ms. Randi seems to think it would.  Here's a big surprise (tic).  The areas with the most Nader support were areas that Gore won handily.  The only states in which there would have been a different outcome are Florida and New Hampshire.  The revised total would have been 295-242, the closest since Carter-Ford in 1976 (297-240).  That's a far cry from Nixon-McGovern in 1972 (520-17), Reagan-Carter (489-49), Reagan-Mondale (525-13), Bush-Dukakis (426-111), Clinton-Bush (370-168), or Clinton-Dole in 1996 (379-159).  Some interesting tidbits in reviewing the results- Some states do not allow write in candidtates for president (HI, LA, NE, NV, NM, OK, SC, SD) 3,315 people in Nevada cast a vote for "None of these candidates" 1 Electoral College member from DC abstained instead of casting his vote for Gore as tradition calls for.  I am guessing that it was some kind of protest statement.
