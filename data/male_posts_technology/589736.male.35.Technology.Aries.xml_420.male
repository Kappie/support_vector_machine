It keeps him awake at nights, crying himself to sleep, wishing for the day when he could have feasibly worked at KMFD.  He yearns for the smelly polo shirts and the khakis and the white shoes.  He aches for the smell of garbage behind Inferno Funnelcake.  Please, God, just don't talk about it anymore!  It's tearing us both apart!! *sob*
