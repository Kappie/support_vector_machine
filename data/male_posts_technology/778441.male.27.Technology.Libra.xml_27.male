Absolutely bullshit... it was! ...dunno why I even attended it  (I had a sneaking suspicion that it was gonna be a crappy session!) . Then I went to the gym... and just returned from there!  While on the topic of working out... It seems I just overdid a few exercises a wee bit yesterday. It being my first visit to the gym after a gap of 2 months, my whole body started aching in the night. And I woke up this morning like an egyptian mummy... totally stiff in all the joints!!  *LOL*   You know... I couldn't even raise my hand to my mouth to brush my teeth ... I had to raise my arm halfway and then lowered my head a little so that my teeth and the brush met midway... and my teeth got cleaned.  But things improved during the day... and by the evening, I could dare to go back to the gym and have another session of workout! ;-)  Well, as I said yesterday, its been a great day for me... with  urlLink Tristorm.org  elevating me to  Star Site  and even  urlLink Amrita  dedicating her blog to me. I'm getting to be quite the popular guy.  *LMAO*   By the way... Congrats to Amrita for passing her driving test. Now, Mumbai has one more qualified driver! ... ;-)   Anyways, I got my look-alike  (well, at least to some extent, he looks like me... but some people might not agree!)  done at  urlLink stor.co.uk . You can see it to the right   ======>    Ok... I guess thats it for now... bye!  cheers!
