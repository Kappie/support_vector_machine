I found this quote from a commentator on ASmallVictory, quite insightful :  "The drooling glee with which the American Left has embraced these abuses is positively pornographic. They don't care that the rule of law and military justice was on the case, that investigations, even punishments were already being handed out. That it happened at all is enough. They just moved it to the top on their Bushiephobia list, along with causing 9/11, the jailing of anyone who "dissents", and any number of imaginings now presented as "fact."" -darleen  Sadly, it ain't just the American Left, darleen. Virtually every freedom-endorsing newspaper (ie, the same papers who routinely ignore human rights abuses such as  urlLink this ), and every second liberal outside of the US is choking at the bit at these pictures. Anyone advocating taking the situation with just a  pinch  of salt is accused of attempting to justify this situation - by the exact same people who justified the Fallujah butchering of those contractors. Hell, Iraqi hostage-takers execute an Italian on tape and no-one in the 'meaningful media' bats an eyelid. Shot. In the head. Ho hum. Par for the course. But have some murdering bastards parade around naked, and the world has an aneurysm. Or so the media would have us believe. The only reason I can think of is that it's  great  for certain people to have some real ammunition, finally. No-one could make the missing WMD allegations really  stick , nobody seriously bought the "It's All About The Oil!" conspiracy myth..but  this ..well.. there's pictures!  I mean, it's terrible what happened, sure - but am I the only one thinking that perhaps this is being blown  way  out of proportion?  And again - what media bias?  urlLink Islam assasinates  the Chechen president, and the media emits hardly a peep. Some sadistic genocidal twit in a wheelchair gets it and he's painted as a bonafide  saint  to this day by the media?  I mean, what.
