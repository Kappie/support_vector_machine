I got there half and hour early (and half an hour late - since I was supposed to be there an hour early for setup). The sound booth was... nonexistent - we had to set it up entirely from scratch. The worship was interesting - tons of tech errors and bugs, and we stopped within ten minutes of starting, cause the worship leader thought God was calling us to pray, instead. So, we got into small groups and prayed for quite a while, and later, broke off into Junior High and Senior High. Almost no sooner than I sat down, I had to get back up again and spend like, 20 minutes tearing the entire control booth down again because Eric (a head techie) needed to set up some huge strobes and spotlights.  I just finally got a scan that I like of the picture of Gwen and me at the winter banquet, and will post it tomorrow night, when I'm coherent enough to remember where I saved it. (lol)
