And so far, probably 95% of my blogs are from this desk as well.  I've chatted with so many people from here.  I'll miss this beautiful 19" HP OEM Monitor...  Well... that's the end.  Nothing worthwhile to celebrate.  This serves merely as the last of my footprint at HP, for now, or forever.  Goodbye, HP.
