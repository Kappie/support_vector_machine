"Additionally, all employees will be required to pass a drug screening and background check for continued emloyment."  now i'm not actually in danger of losing my job over this but when we were hired to our original company, we never agreed to anything like this, and now we have to get tested before oct 1st and if we fail we lose our jobs?  this might be the end all be all for some people at this company especially since most people don't even read those packets.  this is sort of like a hiring process eventhough we are already hired.  also, whats with the background check?  if they find out someone got arrested they are going to fire them?  is this a way to downsize without layoffs?  this "merger" (heh, we were aquired) is just more stress that i dont need.
