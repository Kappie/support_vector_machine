Retail for these guys on the market is usually $80 (Visual Arts in Condado has them for $75 and you can't get them on eBay for no less than $62, when available). I got these for $28.95 (plus $15.00 S/H) at  urlLink Anime Icon . This is the five disk set that includes the entire series from episode 1 to episode 51 (in Japanese with English subtitles). Haven't tested these puppies out yet, but I'm sure I am going to have a hell of a time doing it tonight. It's no secrete how much I like this series, since it's one of my favorite anime mecha series from my childhood (well, no. Mazinger G is, but this one is pretty close).   I love old giant robot anime. My exposure to this series was as part of the "Festival de Robots" anime block that included Grendizer (another of my favorites). This block, better known to the US as Force Five, was a big hit here in Puerto Rico. Actually helped open the doors for the current interest in the genre of Japanese animation. Same can be said for anime fans in the States.   The Getter Robot series was called "Starvengers" in America. Only 39 episodes where dubbed into English. These episodes are from a series which I believe follows the Getter Robo G series (which is the one I have). This dub was done by Jim Terry Productions, who later re-cut the entire series into an excellent two hour movie (of which I've managed to acquire the Spanish version and will be getting the English dub soon).   There are actually about four different series of Getter Robot (one of which is currently playing in Japan). There are also several OVAs ("Direct To Video Animation") and movies (mostly team ups with Mazinger Z, Great Mazinger and Grendizer). This is because Mazinger Z, Great Mazinger, Grendizer and Getter Robo were created by the same genius, Nagai Go, and the operate closely in the same "universe". Nagai Go is also the creator of the Cutey Honey, DevilMan, Kekko kamen and Violence Jack mangas.
