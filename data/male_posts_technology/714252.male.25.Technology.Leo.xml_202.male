My sisters have gone to somewhere sunny for the week (lucky bitches) and I am feelin' a little bit lost at the moment..  The very idea of relationships aer still very confusing for me at the moment.. Don't really know what I want or how to figure out what I want or anything even vaguely like that.. (I know that sentence makes no sense but the whole thing makes no sense if you ask me..)  hmmm.. I'm just going to wander off in this direction now.
