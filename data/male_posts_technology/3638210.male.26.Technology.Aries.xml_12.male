The original plan was to fly up Wednesday night, take in scenic Vermont on Thursday, pick up and pack up the U-Haul on Friday (it had already been "reserved"), drive to Philly on Saturday as we tow her car then unpack, and a nice evening followed by Sunday morning in Philly when I would fly back.  Well, we get a message on Thursday that "Equipment returns are running behind" and there would be a delay. My friend called back and they offered no additional information besides they would call when one was available... whenever that was. Apparently when you "reserve" a U-Haul online, you are reserving the right to drive one... eventually. Like it's the waiting list for a heart transplant or something.  So we wait... come up with contingency plans, each one worse than the last... and wait some more. During this time I get a sunburn and a tension headache or two, but nothing to cry about. Friday comes and goes. Errands are run, but nothing from U-Haul.  Follow up calls with U-Haul on Saturday. What we need is still not available... IN THE ENTIRE STATE. Other companies are called, but apparently people only want to move TO Vermont and rarely need to move out so our options were slim.  Remember that ulcer that was hardly worth mentioning? Well, I was chewing and swallowing awkwardly to avoid the pain and lo and behold the process made my throat sore and irritated. Okay so now I'm starting to get annoyed with my ulcered, sunburned, headached, sore throated body, but whatever.  We decide on Saturday that the worse case scenario would be to load up the essentials in her car and drive to Philly early Sunday if we hadn't heard anything by then. Regardless of U-Haul, I had to catch my return flight, but that would suck for the both of us.  Late Saturday (when we were supposed to have already been to Philly and unpacked), we hear from U-Haul that they may have something close by and would contact us. They finally did, we drove to a nearby city to pick it up (a story all its own), and started loading the truck around 7pm.  At 10:30 we were ready to go... just load the car on the car dolly and go. Everything was carefully secured and aligned and oh wait, the dolly socket popped off the trailer hitch when she drove up the ramp. Many minutes of slowly backing the car down to try and lower the dolly back down to the hitch commenced. It was like some bizarro commercial spot for Saturn as a family vehicle where the gimmick is the Saturn is on one side of a see-saw and your family is on the other, except instead of your family it was just me, and I don't think your family could have potentially lost any digits in that commercial nor would they have cussed as much, because that would probably rub consumers the wrong way.  Well, we get it back down and aligned and tighten the hell out of the hitch. One more go and--yeah this night sucks.  It's 11pm now. We're both physically if not emotionally exhausted and there is zero interest in trying the dolly again. Our solution, ditch the dolly and drive the 8 hours separately. Getting a good rest beforehand wasn't an option as she was officially out of her apartment, and we were just ready to be gone.  So we make the drive, my only partners being a slew of late night DJs and a quart of some generic Welch's Berry juice which I will gladly be the spokesman for after that trip. We arrive in Philly and are met by a slight FLASH FLOOD. Finding her new apartment wasn't too difficult thanks to the grid system, but getting the mattress out to sleep--which is all we wanted to do at this point--was pretty impossible until the rain let up.  So we lay in her newly painted apartment, on her newly stripped, sanded, and revarnished floors, in some semblance of rest. I may have dozed off for 15 minutes but I was fairly congested from all the fumes and couldn't sleep. Plus I had been soaked in the short sprints from U-Haul to apartment.  The rain finally lets up, a friend that was coming up from DC to help was delayed due to the flooding so we just decided to start unpacking. Help did come, but I believe I have done more than enough set up to accurately diagnose my current physical condition.  Ulcer, sunburn, headache, sore throat, heavy lifting, fatigue, drenching, not too mention one helluva sprint to catch my connecting flight on the way back... I hate complainers, but man I felt pathetic.  So as far as endings go, my friend is now somewhat-successfully living in Philadelphia and I am back in Atlanta, also somewhat-successfully living. I learned that I hate U-Haul, I love Vermont food, and I can never relocate again.
