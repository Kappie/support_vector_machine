I don't think you're shallow.  I think that some things are just trite and esoteric and hidden under a veil of prententious pseudo-intelligence and exist for the sole purpose of making truly shallow people feel sophisticated for owning them...they never actually read them, and if they do, they don't get it either.  But they pretend to and have all these quasi-deep, intellectual-masturbation-filled conversations about them with their other shallow friends.  These are people who use words like "paradigm" in everyday conversation.  I personally find it boring.  I'd rather watch "The Golden Girls."
