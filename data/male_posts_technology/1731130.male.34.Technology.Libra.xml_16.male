Anyway, my dad and I spent two weekends building the best, most palacial and high-tech pidgeon-coop ever constucted in Lincolnshire and after a further  two months  of training Benny the Homing Pidgeon was ready for his first flight off into the unknown. One fine Saturday morning we got up early and release him.  He never came back.  Imagine my delight, twenty-eight years later, when I came across this: You buy a bag of birdseed with a special web address on it. You then go and feed it to a near-by and obliging pidgeon. What the bird doesn't know is that the seed also includes a handful of RFID chips (before you ring the RSPCA, this is not detrimental to the pidgeon). Said bird now flies around doing it's own birdy thing until it settles in front of specially positioned cameras which detect the RFID chips inside it and upload video of the bird onto the website quoted on the bag!  If only we had this back in 1977. Benny the Pidgeon would probably still not have come back, but at least I'd have known he was having a good time.
