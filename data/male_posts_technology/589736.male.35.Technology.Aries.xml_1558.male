For those that do not know me well, this is a huge accomplishment following years of burnt and horrible food.  As for books. . . here are the last four politcal books that that I've read.  -Rogue State (It's kind of like a history book of U.S. fuck ups) -Weapons of Mass Deception (This was fantastic. You all must read it!  Now!) -Stupid White Men (yeah. . .I finally got around to it) -The Best Democracy Money Can Buy (This blew my mind.  Excellent chapters on the Florida election crisis and the World Bank.)  Okay...hope you guys are enjoying not having power, which probably means that you won't read this until you do have power again.  (Yes, I definitely got the brains in our family.)  -Eva
