As the Blog Title says it all, this is more an open slate where I can post updates about subjects like collaboration, technology, travel and other stuffs that will be of my interest and the readers who are most welcome to comment.  Please feel free to let me know your suggestions to improve this journal to make it more user-rich and content rich.
