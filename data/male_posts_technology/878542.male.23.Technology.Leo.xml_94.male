It's a measure of how chaotic the world is that even a seemingly stable situation like the market for computer hardware can surprise you like this.   Raise your hand if you would have thought five years ago that not only would Apple be using open source software, not only would IBM be making their chips, not only would they be making geek headlines, but that they would produce the third fastest supercomputer on the planet, and that it would be one of the cheapest computer hardware solutions in the history of supercomputers?  Apple? supercomputers? cheap? Unix-based? what? Macintosh = price-competitive? I don't.. yaa.
