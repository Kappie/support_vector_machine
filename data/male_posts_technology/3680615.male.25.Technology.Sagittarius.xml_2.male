That dr. from GMA will be happy that I am getting rest of my life :) Had pretty wierd dreams thought, so wierd that I don't even wanna think about them forget about bloggin them! Well, it's new day and fine morning. Life goes on. Oh and found my favorite item I thought was lost forever.. life after all doesn't suck that all!
