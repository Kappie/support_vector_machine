Did you know that out of all the congressmen only one has a son in military service in Iraq?  This explains why they don’t think it’s a bad thing.  They have nothing to risk.  They have the money and the pull to keep their children out of harms way.  For poor America there is no such luxury and many sign up for the benefits of training because they are so poor it’s the only way for them to get out.  This is especially true for young black men. There have been web sites that have been pulled down because they were drawing negative publicity.  There is a copy of one here:  urlLink http://www.thememoryhole.org/mil/defendamerica-draftboards.htm . As stated on the site they are looking for volunteers “If a military draft becomes necessary.” There are also two bills in the Senate (S.89) and House (H.R. 136) that would require military service for all men and women between the ages of 18 and 25 for a period of two years, but at the discretion of the President the period of military service may be extended. S.89 right in the first paragraph it states “…defense by requiring that all young persons in the United States, including women, perform a period of military service or a period of civilian service in furtherance of national defense…” S.89 requires anyone between the ages of 18 and 26 perform a period of national service.  “Service” refers to one of two things: 1. “as a member of an active or reserve component of the uniformed services” 2. “in a civilian capacity that, as determined by the President, promotes the national defense, including national community service and homeland security” Selection for military service is based on the needs of the uniformed services and states “the President shall—“ 1. “determine the number of person covered by subsection (a) (referring to the age) whose services is to be performed as a member of an active or reserve component of the uniformed services…” 2. “select the individuals among those persons who are to be inducted for military service under this Act.” For civilian service “Persons covered by subsection (a) (again referring to age) who are not selected for military service under subsection (d) (see the above 1 and 2) shall perform their national service obligation under this Act in a civilian capacity pursuant to subsection (b)(2) (referring to the form of national service; civilian or uniformed)” H.R. 136 is pretty much identical in content.
