While Dave was taking her home, she was expressing a strong desire to go straight home to sleep.  On the way, she started "twitching".  The twitching got more animated, and she returned a little of the dinner from the night before, and fell asleep in the car.  Upon arrival home, Dave couldn't wake her up to go inside, so he took her to the emergency room, where they hooked her up to an IV and the usual array of monitoring devices, where she got a little sleep, and gradually felt a lot better.    A number of tests were run, including a CAT scan, none of which indicated any problems.  We've been recommended to a Neurologist, and will go as soon as we can get an appointment, but it's not an emergency.  Concensus is that we'll find nothing.  The doctor at the hospital declined to start her on any drugs, citing that 50% of people who have a seizure never have another one, and recommended that we just equip people with whom she'll share time with what to do if it happens again.  The net for the moment is this:  She's just to take it easy and try to get a regular food and sleep schedule.  During the seizure, she pulled a muscle in her back (sore, but not too bad), bit her tongue (kinda nasty), and is sore on her arm where the IV was.  I'll let you know more as we get information from the neurologist.
