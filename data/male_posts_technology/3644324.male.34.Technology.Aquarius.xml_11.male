After visiting the doctor I have been assured that the injury to my left leg will in no way prevent me from sitting on the couch and consuming all manner of fine foods and beverages delivered by the lovely and talented Ms Sauer. I've also been given the green light to walk gingerly on virtually any flat surface, and to partake of any sport so long as it doesn't involve movement or changes in speed or direction. Seemingly this could be interpreted to mean that Ulitmate is a go for me - given my talent for just standing around and yelling at everyone else - but the doctor used the words "leg could just fall right off below the knee" to describe the possible ramifications so I think I'll sit this week out.   Sadly this will leave swarm without 2/3 of its Speed ChallengedAnti-Thin Men (SCATM)on Thursday as both Roger and I will be unavailable. And although I'm sure Peter (no offense)is up to the task of carrying the SCATM Flashlight (we used to have a Torch to carry but forgot it at Kentuck Fried Chicken one day) by himself, we may want to enlist some male help this week. I suggest finding someone old, slow, talentless, ugly and really annoying so that getting Roger and I back next week will seem like a good thing ;-)   Please weigh in with your opinion on a replacement bug or to tell me, for the love of god, to stop sending email to your work acccounts.    Buzz, buzz, and other swarmy sound,   Glenn "Score Peon!" Karlsen
