I wonder what she have for me?! heh    Last night was terrible! I wanted to go out so bad, and so i checked with my friends, i made some phone calls,but none of them wanted to go anywhere... Maroon (M.F) was not in the mood! Roni (M.F) claimed that he has some arrangements... I wonder what arrangements... Isam (M.F), this guy is a  phenomenon , he bought a car some years ago, and since then i've never seen him driving it! He always have  argument s, a  crybaby... sometimes it's the test, the insurance, the  mechanics! son of bitch.   I had to spend my time by the computer, chatting or whatever.. Maisam is cool.. But It was  FRIDAY NIGHT  for god sake!!   p.s: M.F stands for Mother Fucker!
