It was a EXCELLENT turn out, so I feel obliged to mention everyone that came down - Custard, Baity, Alain Le M, Captain Kirk, Dougal, Lady Kate, Grist, Simon (aka Shrek), Tim (aka Conan), PK.. sorry for anyone i've missed but the Singapore Slings, The Long Island Iced Teas and the Sex on the Beach had me me very merry, very fast. We really have to STOP laying that cigerette pack game. It's a one way ticket to Pissedville, USA.  We ran up to Liquid and did some star jumps on the dancefloor, distressing lots of girls... and that's about all I remember at the moment. :D  I've created a  urlLink new photo album  so we can upload all our crazy pictures from our spiffy Nokia camera phones. Hoorah! Go check it out for pictures of last night. If your a loyal TF reader you'll probably find your face on there!    Michael says: Get me another scotch and coke. Is it here yet?  Lastly, find out which Simpsons Character you are, with this quick  urlLink personality test.  I am Lisa apparently.. but i'd have prefered Sideshow Bob.
