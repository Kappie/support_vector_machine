The temperature was much better even though the humidity was not.  Everything in my body was telling me to not go running, but to drive home and sleep.  The run was setting up to be another unenjoyable after-meal run where I was tired and cramping up.  I sucked it up anyway and took off with Brad.  A storm just happened to rolling in at that time so for most of the run, we had a spectacular light show from the approaching lightning.  Since the storm was coming, it helped to bring the temperature down which made running quite enjoyable.  I didn't experience any pain or discomfort like I thought I would and actually felt downright good on the run.  All the joints and muscles and ligaments and sinews felt pretty good.  The slight discomfort in my knees was still present in some of the later inclines but the pain, in general, seems to be receding.  Truly the best part of the run, though, was easily the last 5 minutes.  Sprinkles of rain began to fall about a mile out which didn't bother me one bit since it was still pretty hot.  The rain increased and we increased our pace along with it.  By the time we reached H's house, it was downright pouring and we were flying.  I didn't care about getting soaked for a brief minute.  It was absolutely spectacular to run through the torrential rain and lightning and thunder.  It was almost surreal for about 12 seconds before we reached the door.  I can't wait for more summer storms in which to run.  For those in Cincinnati, if you see the sky clouding up or a storm rolling in, don't be surprised to think that I may be lacing up my running shoes to go and enjoy a run in it.    I get back to my mid-week runs tonight with 3 4-mile runs in a row.  I have decided that the NYC plan I was going to follow has just too many miles for the long runs.  I am not running to break any records or beat any personal bests (it's a little hard to have personal bests when you haven't even been running a year).  The NYC is the marathon that inspired me to start running and I am going to enjoy it with Brad no matter if we run a 7 hour marathon.  With all of that said, I am scaling back my long runs by two miles which doesn't mean much to any of you, but it means a tremendous amount to me with regard to wear and tear and time on the road.    Okay, how about a final thought for today? Beautiful You are to me, beautiful the raging sea.  Have a great week!
