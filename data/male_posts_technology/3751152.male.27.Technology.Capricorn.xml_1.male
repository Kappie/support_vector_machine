The daily flights are limited as they need to see the mountains in order to land.  These are all on Air Canada.  Once Northern Hawk Air releases their fall schedule to Trail, I will post them as well.  Here they are:   VANCOUVER-Intl - YVR to CASTLEGAR (BC) - YCG   Departure Times : 8:15 am, 11:45 am  3:30 pm    CASTLEGAR (BC) - YCG to VANCOUVER-Intl   Departure Times :  9:55 am, 3:30 pm  5:10 pm	   If you are planning to come on a weekend, it is likely that the early morning flight is not available.  Please keep in mind that these are DH1 and DH3 type aircrafts as well :)   In addition, unless you are flying Air Canada from Europe and are booking all the way through to Castlegar, you will have to go through International Customs at Vancouver and collect your baggage.  Then you will have to go to domestic departures and check-in again.  I've done this MANY times before with only an hour to spare so it is definitely possible. Typically, I will use YVR's  urlLink Express Check-in  kiosks and then hand over my baggage.  Alternatively, if you don't want to rush, you can either hang out in Vancouver for a night and fly to Castlegar the following day *OR* look at doing an overnight bus ride on  urlLink Greyhound .  Honestly, though, the cost of the flight vs. the cost of the bus is almost the same.
