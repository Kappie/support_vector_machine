The movie is about a guy who finds a clinic (I don't really know if it's a real clinic considering the people who work there seem like a bunch of pothead retards who know a thing or two of the procedure because of repetitive actions) which offers a service that can erase specific memories from a person's mind (thus the title).  I like how Dr. Mierzwiak explained the procedure, "Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on par with a night of heavy drinking.  Nothing you'll miss."  I thought that was pretty funny.  Joel (Jim Carey) wants to erase his memories with Clementine (Kate Winslet), his girlfriend.  What a sci-fi premise of being able to delete one's memories but at the same time it was very believable.  There were some good visuals (real or CGI) all through out the film.  I mean from the beginning of the movie and then the movie starts out again and you can't figure out what time in the relationship it is, that was great!  How it all comes together later in the movie, that was great as well.  The colors of her hair to serve as some sort of marker for the time.  The "spotlight/flashlight" effect as Meghan showed me.  The way the memories were being erased.  How he looked when he was going back to his memories to being a little child.  The house where they met was getting erased.  How her name was Clementine (remember the song Clementine?   Oh my darlin' Oh my darlin' Oh my darlin' Clementine.  Thou are lost and gone forever, dreadful sorry Clementine ).  How store fronts, signs, books everything were losing their letters as the scenes go on.  How people lose their faces.  How everything else when Joel and Clementine were together, things were getting blurry.  I also like how he could hear the people that were in the real world and not his memories.  The beach.  Man, I really want to see the movie again.  So much more to see and see again.  The movie was about that, loss (we'll get into that a little more later).  He didn't want the anguish of knowing that he lost the only person that he loved.  So he would go to that extreme to erase that part of his life.  Memories of their time spent together we beautiful.  The time when they went to the frozen lake, when they were just fucking around at his apartment, the time when they were at the Chinese restaurant.  Everything was so real and in tune with relationships.  It made me think of my previous relationships.  I followed the movie on how to think of the most recent memories of the relationship and the go backwards.  So I started out with the bad times and then the good times.  It didn't make me yearn for what was once there.  It made me think of how much I have grown since then and how that really helped me have a better idea of who I am.  I wouldn't dare erase these memories because they serve as some form of reminder of who I once was and how I have grown no matter how painful it is.  Another scene in the movie that I can't forget is the part where they were laying on the ice and Joel says to  Clementine  "I could die right now, Clem.  I'm just happy.  I've never felt that before.  I'm just exactly where I want to be."   Beautiful, just fucking beautiful.  I left the movie thinking and with even more questions.  I want to see it again.  I have to see it again.
