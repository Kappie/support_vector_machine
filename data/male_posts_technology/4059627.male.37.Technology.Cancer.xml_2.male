A group of us were turning right into Springy road, and some lunatic P-Plater turned at the "Turn left anytime with care" sign, directly into the path of the on-coming traffic. Then, rather than realise his mistake, pulling to the left and giving way, he continued on his merry way, much to the frustration of the guy he was almost deliberately smashing into.  Well, that would have been bad enough, except that 10 seconds later he was stuck to my tailpipe firmer than a barnacle on a whale. I tried all the tricks to shake him loose, deliberately over-revving to produce unburnt fuel smoke. No luck. Flashing the tail-lights. Nothing. Slowing to a crawl. Nothing. His girlfriend sitting next to him seemed pretty blas√© about it.  Eventually I changed lanes to get some fuel. Sure enough, as soon as I left the lane he was stuck to the tailpipe of the car that had been in front of me.  Maybe he thought that if he got into the draft of the car in front that he would save some fuel.       Ok. He was probably just another idiot with a licence to drive.      In true Jimbob style, that's not the point of my post.      I blame the chick! It's a girlfriend's obligation to stop a guy when he's being stupid. How else can we learn?      Let's face it, if I was in the car with this guy I would have stepped out of the car at the first set of lights and caught a taxi. Taxi drivers are suicidal, but at least I know the risk.       There was a story on a current affairs television show the other night about young drivers and placing restrictions on them until they have learned to drive properly. Basically they were no night driving and no passengers until they were 21.  I'd personally like to see the following implemented.     No mobile phones. All mobiles to be carried in the trunk or a specially designed glove-box that can't be opened until the vehicle has been turned off. This includes all passenger's mobiles.    No radios for young drivers. This kills two birds with one stone, firstly no doof-doof music at all hours of the night and secondly no Eminem penetrating your brain whilst you are trying to listen to some nice Pink Floyd music.    No performance modifications. You've seen them. The Honda Civic designed to travel no faster than 85km/h with the chrome wheels, huge exhaust, and turbos. Nett result; Deathtrap.     Why these restrictions? Because new drivers (of any age) need time to learn the secrets of driving where they are not able to go fast enough to kill themselves, and where they are not distracted from what's going on in front of them. I was no Ayrton Senna when I was a newbie, I'm still not, but at least I learned that before I got my hands on a fast car.    And the secret is?  You are not in control. You never were.
