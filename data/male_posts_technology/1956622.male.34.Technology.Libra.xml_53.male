Jimmy had no interest visiting with me in fact he went downstairs to help   FS   work on what will soon be his room.  Then we went to Chuck E. Cheese where I got the pleasure of eating dinner with   SFW   and   FS   again Jimmy avoids me!    SFW   gives me the whole "mom protect mode" line again!  Jeremey of course has no problem hanging out with me.   After Chuck E. Cheese I had to break down and get a hotel room.  I took Jeremey and Karissa to see Spiderman 2.  They both appeared to like it.  I would have taken Jimmy but he left with   FS   from Charles E. Chedder. After the movie Karissa wanted to spend the night with me so that was cool.  I did not want to upset Jeremey so I took a quick moment to tell him that this divorce had nothing to do with him and he can hang out with me anytime he wants too!  When   SFW   picked us up from the movie she informed me that in the morning Jimmy wanted to say goodbye to Karissa before she went because he did not want to come to the bus station to see her go mostly because he did not want to see me.  I was actually excited to see the boys!  I know next time I will save my excitement for Jeremey because obviously Jimmy could care less.
