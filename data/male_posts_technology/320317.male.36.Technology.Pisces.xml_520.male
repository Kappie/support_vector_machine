 Doesn't sound to "united" to me. This is one thing about Linux I don't get. There are just too many distributions to choose from if you do become so mad at Microsoft that you want an alternative. There are just "too many choices", thus a decision an  average user  must make about something they don't understand. Most users have enough decisions in life, that what OS they are running isn't going to be a high priority. Until the Linux community understands this, Linux on the desktop will never catch on to mainstream computing. Windows will always be "good enough" (if not better), and it's only getting more stable with the release of XP. The only way I could see Linux catching for a typical user is if their workplace started using Linux. If consumers were forced to use it, then  maybe  they'd see the benefits. I would think most people want to use the same system at home as they do at work.
