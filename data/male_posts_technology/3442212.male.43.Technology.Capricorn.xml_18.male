I haven't been to the new one in Scottsdale yet, it might be okay. But in general, I really can't stand comedy clubs. Or bars, for that matter.  This is a bit of a dilemma.  Moving to Los Angeles is not an option - I would have moved there at least ten years ago otherwise.  On the other hand, I  can  post stand-up bits here.  H'mmmm...
