A month where I can sleep in until any time that I want. Or a month where my wife and I can go on a driving vacation of the United States and Canada, and not worry about what time it is.  It's not that I've never had a vacation. I've had plenty. My last vacation (to Aruba) was in May. (Only four months ago, but it feels like an eternity.) The problem with that vacation was it was only 4 days, which was not enough time to relax.  My previous vacation, a year ago, was also only 4 days. Short vacations are nice, but they don't provide any real respite.  The only time I've had long vacations, I had long journeys to go with it. The occassional two or three weeks in the Philippines. But again, no respite.  And it's not that I have never been unemployed. I was off a month between my last contract and this one. But it was a month where I was working hard -- finding and interviewing for jobs, writing a book, working on side-projects for  urlLink xguru.com  clients. It was no vacation.  Before that, I was off for 8 months in 2001/2002. I guess that qualifies as time off, even though I was writing another book, and working on other xguru projects.   Anyways, it looks like I won't be able to have time off for a while. Not even a week. The project I'm working on now is under a tight deadline, and every week it just gets tighter.   Perhaps after this contract I won't look right away for the next one... What's the worst that can happen? I would be willing to sacrafice a few months of earning money in exchange for some better emotional and physical health.
