It did make me a little disortientated. I think it was just more freaky than anything. I called my doctor firt thing but either they hadn't got in to the office yet or they were just swamped with other calls.  Anyhoo, they called me back and told me to take some benedryl (even though I am on zyrtek...) so I did. I guess allergies was all it was afterall. I zonked out and woke up feeling a little bit better and 'The Burbs' was on. I opened my eyes just in time to see him cut the power wire and fall into the shed. Good stuff.  I'm feeling much better today, though, ever since yesterday my sense of smell has been noticably better or something.  I had something to post on about VB.Net but now cannot, for the life of me, remember what it was. Well, if I think of it I will post later.     -intX    Rock'n'roll with all my friends, hopin' the music never ends.
