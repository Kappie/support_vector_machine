These are hardly the tip of an ice berg... submerged deep inside is the rejoinder to these imposing questions... and every attempt to reveal the concealed always leave us with another new vaccuum to encounter...  Over the centuries, the human mind has been so much impounded with presumptuous attitudes that the closer we try to move to an answer the farther it gets... Questions keep cropping up about the most fundamental pillars of our belief systems and how they have affected us and continue to affect...   The basis of any human's belief system - be it an atheist, agnostic or a believer - is just his/her contemplation of what constitues a "better" living... and this contemplation is in turn ruled by all the presemptuous attitudes I mentioned earlier...  The resultant is a menacingly assorted ideology of what could make his/her life to be "perfect"... and again, "perfect" is a relative word... its an iterative progression between what he/she feels is needed for a "perfect" living and where the presemptuous contemplations of the forerunners have left the person standing. A difficult phrase to comprehend..!!   Lost amid this mystification of life, the human psyche craves to move towards a calmer, more compassionate, more tolerant and more patient humankind, in search of a logical assessment and approach to our limited understanding of Divinity and Reality...  The search may lead some to a logical conclusion, which may not be scientific.. some may never ever reach a convincing conclusion... some may choose to just adopt other's conclusion... and such conclusions compose their belief system - the system they exercise on, to try to unravel the mystification in ways that every unique individual may be most comfortable with...  Its not in figuring out where one belongs among this three.. or where one should ideally belong... but in living true to their "conclusion" and appreciate the "conclusion" of others...   After all, irrespective of someone feeling good or bad about others "conclusion" the ever-concealed truth of where we came from, where we are going et. al. are never going to change...!!   Hopefully.. the after-life (if there is one) may answer it all...!!
