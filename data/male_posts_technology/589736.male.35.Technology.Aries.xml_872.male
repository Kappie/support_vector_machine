From what I've experienced of SUVs, the owners have been duped by clever marketing.  There's equal or more room to be found in a station wagon or a minivan -- and better value, to boot.  People who own SUVs are likely to have gushed about My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and probably think it's an adventure to go white water rafting with their coworkers.  I don't care what they drive; but it's generous of them to wear such obvious badges -- makes it easier to see them coming, so I can move to another table at the restaurant.  And hey -- they keep Dockers slacks in business, so...God bless 'em.
