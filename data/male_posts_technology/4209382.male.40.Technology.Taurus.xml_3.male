However, I almost feel a twinge of pity when I see his ambitious plans crumbling around him. In my daily dose of opinion from the townhall.com, this little nugget landed in my inbox.  ------------------- It seems the Swift Boat Vets have delivered a swift kick to Kerry’s crotch. Ouch! That’s gotta hurt. What’s ironic -- and typical -- is the Left’s hysterically hypocritical spin machine screaming for the Swifties’ 411 to be immediately Dixie Chicked. The self- righteous, first amendment waving, Michael Moron embracers are not so free with freedom of speech when it happens to slow roast their presidential nominee a mere 80 or so days before the nation schleps to the polls. What’s funny, [not funny, "ha-ha" … funny "weird"] is as long as the information comes from one uberliberal, overweight, college dropout with a communist bent, who routinely attempts to make "W" look like a greedy gnome who wrongfully plays golf while he unrepentantly sends our kids to the Gulf, well … that’s cool. Spreading such misinformation, created from the ether by one of the left’s darlings should not, according to most liberals, be examined. No! It should be believed and be considered inerrant and infallible, and the purveyor of such rank propaganda lifted high as a prophet. But flip to today. More than 60 decorated, non-politically active, eyewitnesses of Kerry’s four month stint in Vietnam -- men who ate, slept, and served a few feet from the Dems’ presidential applicant – have written a heavily documented, devastating tell all, Unfit for Command, credibly contradicting Kerry’s account of his fleeting 120 days in ‘Nam. They represent more than 250 Swift Boat veterans, including Kerry’s commanding officer! So, what’s the response from all the usual political and media suspects? What the heck do they know? Why should they be trusted? Dismiss ‘em; censure ‘em … and if they keep trying to talk, just shout them down. So, allay our concerns, Mr. Kerry. Weigh in and show us the Swift Boat Veterans are wrong. Prove to us that your Tour of Duty was not a ton of dooky.   urlLink http://www.townhall.com/columnists/douggiles/dg20040814.shtml    -- --- Chip
