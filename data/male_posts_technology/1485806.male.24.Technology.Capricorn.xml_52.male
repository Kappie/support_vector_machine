Last nite Ps Chew talks about silence and solitude..a powerful message which talks about quiet time with the Lord. Most of us are born into a world of noise and in this time of age, after work ..some of us would use noise as a comforter and assurance .   Quiet Time is indeed a time where you spend time with God...Many a times we spend time alone in silence but not with God but to contemplate our problems and our wishes...alone....  Loneliness does not equate with solitude..Solitude means spending time alone ..with God. To focus on Him , to deny ourself and give our rightful energy, love and focus unto God...praising, worshipping and thanking Him for who He is ...the I am.  I just get back into focus...even as I have chose to distract myself away from God and the end result, I am more confused , lost and am clueless on what steps to take .... Indeed spending with God is not easy to start of with and of course must be made in to habit and a culture to really make it happen. But God's presence is worth all the effort i will make ...  I have plans now to spend time with God in solitude but not in silence due to the nature of my working place. I have decided to use my "extra" time in office with God...thought i cannot praise and worship God in a more personal way but i guess it is a good way to really bring His presence to the office.   Right now i am redoing Experiencing God study in my workplace and yeah for my personal study  i am also doing Purpose Driven Life..  I am not just commiting myself only to the reading of God's word but also to prayer...which i am planning to attend prayer meeting as well to seek after God's presence and to learn more about prayer. So if u guys reading this wants to go ..it is on tuesday 8.00pm..Wai Nyan, Jamie and the rest , if u want to come , please do not be hesistant to call me...if i am not working...i will come and fetch u guys.   Today i have learned about God Centeredness and self-centeredness...which makes me realize that all this time have been blogging about myself...personally..and not about God ... Truly my life is to worship Him and to enjoy Him...as my friend , Father and God.   Accountability Partners..u know of my needs and truly in turn i will pray for 2 of u guys/gals...and truly i hope both of you  will join me as well in this road.  Connect,Relate and Resonate the Faith Of Christ. Joshua Tan
