Benedict Loh, the super administrator, is a Computer Science undergrad (I'm assuming that means he's a NUS student) who trains with ShinJu-Kai (Gek Poh dojo).  Well, looks like Singaporeans are taking a first step into making a mark on the Internet. Hmmm now all we need are names like Aiki.net, Aikido.net, Aikido.SG, etc.
