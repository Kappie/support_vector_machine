 Life in America is interrupt driven.  There was a time when I thought that it was just my company.  When a problem arises, let's take care of it.  I don't care that you're still working on the last problem.  But maybe this opinion was formed a little too early.  Maybe I was a little near sighted on this issue.  So I have shifted my gaze away from the grindstone to which my nose has been pressed for roughly three years to the beyond.  And lo, I have discovered that "my" problems extend far beyond my initial expectations.  In general, people do not realize that resources are always finite.  There is an infinite source or problems.  Infinity is greater than finiteness.  Therefore, only a subset of all problems may be addressed at any given time.  (I feel like I'm back in  urlLink professor Martin's  urlLink Discrete II class again...ugh.)  If you want your problems solved correctly, you need to give people the time to do so.  If you don't want the problems, then you need to let people plan.  And time spent planning is time spent not dealing with current problems.  But hopefully, this type of investment will pay off with less problems that need immediate attention.
