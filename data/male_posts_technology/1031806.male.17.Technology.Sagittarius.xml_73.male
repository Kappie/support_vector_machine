For the first production on a new stage, the play was pretty impressive, and the usual beginning technical glitches were just par for the course.  There was one rather humorous time when the lights went up, and the main character was standing on one of the stages.  He looked around, puzzled for a second or two, then quietly walked off the stage.  After the lights took two minutes to dim back off, the audience for some reason started clapping. (lol)  He reappeared a few minutes later with the missing prop - a phone.  One of the scenes was some character's creepy nightmare.  It reminded me kinda of the production  Eternity .  On Saturday, I borrowed a couple guns from Josh for the airsoft war, and got a ride with Liv and Jeremy, who were also taking Steven.  The drive took about one-and-a-half hours.  We got there, played several hours until lunch, then went inside for about half an hour, then went back out again for another solid four hours of shooting each other down.  My dad arrived just as twilight faded, and it became impractical to continue.  Olivia stayed the night at the location we had the war at, and Jeremy, Steven, and I slept on the way back.  :)  We were really tired.  This morning, I woke up an hour late, and almost missed my ride to church.  Gwen and her dad came to first service - that was cool, though she had to leave immediately afterward.  I got the weirdest head ach, and almost fell asleep.  After second service, Steven and I walked over to the Fred Meyer complex to look for Brady, who had taken a different street, and come back at the same time we left.  I was going to go over to his house, but I couldn't contact my parents.  I went home with the Gadaholts and Ben (as usual).  We fired off more potato cannon test booms and later went down to a lake to poach Nutria. (jk) We were thinking about taking the spud cannon and scaring ducks with it though...
