I won’t cover the details of the run but there a couple of things that stand out.   1] Chafing suck! Even a little. 2] To avoid becoming freakishly tired after 90 minutes of running, be sure to fuel up properly. I think I consumed all of 300/400 calories the morning before my run and I likely burnt most of that during my 1.5 hour swim workout.  3] I really do need to move to San Francisco. The place has it all: Art, culture, technology, scenic beauty, and some great bars.  That’s all for now. Gotta get back to the conference.
