       Gas, Gurgling

 I woke well again today, and not on my stomach or sweating.  I had some more orange cranberry bread before and after my shower, and Ritz crackers while I was searching for new cars on the internet.  I'm having significant gas and gurgling now, a few minutes after eating the crackers, but it is completely in the "tolerable" range. 

 I guess I must be hungry, because I'm looking forward to lunch.  I'll head up the white fish I made the other day.

  Update:  After my bowel movement at 2:14 pm my intestines are doing their best to settle down.  I have a general uneasy feeling low in my gut and occasional gurgling. 

  Update:  3:14 pm.  My intestines are adjusted and settled for the most part.  I'm going to have lunch.  White fish with lemon and herbs.
