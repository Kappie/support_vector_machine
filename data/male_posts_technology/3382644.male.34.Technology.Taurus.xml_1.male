After analyzing my play for an hour, I know that I play my hands correctly.  It found no problem with card selection, but it found weakness in my better strategy.  I figured that anyway.  I need to raise more often and not play so loose in others.  I really like it so far. I got in on a NL tournament on poker school.  It was a good set.  I really didn't get much to play though.  The hands I did get though I played aggressively and it worked to my favor.  I did over play a few hands and made mistakes.  I placed 51st out of 106.  The results are at least getting better each time.  Still a long way to go.  I did play my last hand foolishly though.  I was shortest stack and I went all in on suited Q J.  One person called and he was sitting on 8 8.  Figures.  Of course nothing flopped in my favor and I was out.  It just wasn't my hand.  I was in the double blinds anyway and the small blinds and crappy cards would have taken me out eventually anyway.  That's it for me tonight.  Time for bed.    Indiana Slim
