Been into some calculation and planning phase about financial controlling and rolling plus some further development.   My mind is pretty bloated but at least get things done with what I wanted. My last day will be on this coming friday. I will be starting my new job on Saturday I HOPE! And still require some discussion later at my friend's company.  Life is all good but again I am left with two days to stuck with shirt as I will be going on polo T real soon! Yeeee Haaaa! I also realise class 95 love to play Hey ya!   Ahh and not forgetting damn Ben for saying the wrong things to the wrong person! YES i find her cute and very cute but you don't have to tell her mum that I should call her Mum-in-law right? I was totally embarrassed! And YEAH! She is cute, quiet, smart and a woman with her own sets of mindset and opinion! I am there so frequently at bukit timah shopping centre is because just to catch a glimpse of her! She is damn damn cute. HAHAHA especially when she is reading the papers regarding soccer. YES! She is the first female soccer fan I ever come across! Special isn't it? Hope can get a few more glimpse before she found a job. Damn but seems that there isn't any topic to chat about....How to start man and lady?   I want a steamer! I want a steamer! I want a steamer! I want a steamer!  And this will bring me to my sweet dreams!
