The link listed as BPLU is  urlLink Black People Love Us , if you're a politically correct dickhead this site is not for you, as is pokes fun at jerk-off WASPs and other ignorant social classes, if you don't know what WASP stands for, you probably are one.   urlLink The Chronicles of George  is a site for anyone who has ever worked in the tech industry and use Remedy for trouble tickets, I swear I have almost pissed my pants laughing at this journey into the mind of an idiot.  When reading the Chronicle of George you can't believe that someone of this inteligence level was hired by a company.  If you have fun or otherwise interesting links email them to  urlLink AverageCypress .
