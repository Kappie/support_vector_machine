We both liked it despite the extra cheese and preposterous premise (global warming causes an instant ice age). Halfway through the movie, a bright, slow-blinking strobe light came on next to one of the exit doors near the front of the theater. This prompted many people to stand and head for the exits. Meanwhile, May and I sat quietly until the light stopped flashing a minute or so later. Weird.
