We completed 11 or more miles today that included the most treacherous hill (in my opinion) in Clifton, Straight Street hill.  We did all this in just under 2 hours too!  (Approximately 110 minutes for those keeping score at home.)  If you are unaware of this hill, it's a half mile hill at about a 40 or 45 degree incline.  To begin and end on that hill (downhill and uphill respectively) was both gruelling and victorious.  We ran from the Brick House down Straight St. to Central Parkway then made our way to Spring Grove Cemetery.  Best guess, we ran about 4 miles inside of Spring Grove which is absolutely awesome!  I've heard many people say many good things about Spring Grove, but it was helpful to experience it on my own.  I never knew a cemetery could be that big!  Either way, we did stop for a quick restroom/water/stretch break in Spring Grove before we headed back the way we came.  The difference between this week and last is almost night and day.  I could have kept running today without much of a problem.  By the same time last week, my lower legs may not have allowed me to go further without me injuring something.  All in all, it's totally cool to break that 10 mile mark, almost break the 2 hour mark, and run (that's right, run!  no stopping for site-seeing on this tour!) Straight Street hill.
