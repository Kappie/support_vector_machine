The office was shut off today!!!  Since I didn't work on business or music today I cleaned up the studio and the rest of the house to get ready for the return of   the family  .  That's right,   the family   is coming back from the tropics so Nick and I are running around cleaning up the mess.  This time the house is spotless compared to the last time everyone went away.       The only artisic thing I did today was mess around with a couple of photos using the curves feature in Photoshop.  Here is a picture of me, which can be found on the  urlLink Third Rail  web site, and a photo of my brother Nick.  Both of these photos were taken at my graduation party two weeks back.
