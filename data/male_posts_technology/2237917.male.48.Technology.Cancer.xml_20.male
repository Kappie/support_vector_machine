I can then also get rid of my telephone by using Vonage VOIP and their soft phone on my laptop. I then get a data/celphone card for the laptop so I can connect to the net anywhere and voila !!!   Think about it.   When I moved into my dorm room in college I had a HUGE stereo system and about 500 vinyl records.  No computer (1975), nor  digital anything.  My first computer class was programming using punchcards.  I failed.
