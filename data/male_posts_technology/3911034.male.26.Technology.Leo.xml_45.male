The French film Irreversible is basically about the boyfriend and the ex-boyfriend of a woman who is raped and bashed going out to get revenge. It takes place over about 5hours over the course of one night. Kinda like Memento the scene order of the film is reversed and the credits roll at the start. The whole film is shot with one camera with no cuts in each scene.  The acting and direction of the film is top notch with some scenes going for 10-15mins. The special fx in Irreversible are probably the best that I have seen this year including Spiderman2 and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. They are so subtle and at times I was awestruck into almost believing they were real. The first 25 minutes is pretty crazy especially the first ten minutes I thought I wasn't going to be able to sit through the whole film the camera movements were so irratic but it does become clear why it is used. Gaspar Noe has made a basic story into something incredible. I'm surprised the Australian censorship board didn't ban this film. Considering they banned Ken Park which is play shool compared to this because it is French it probably slipped through because not many people would see it. If it wasn't for the intense 5min rape and bashing scene I would recommend this to everyone. I'm going to give this film a 10 I haven't been so disturbed by a film in a long time. Monica Bellucci is so beautiful in this, what is it with my French ladies getting treated so poorly - first Audrey now Monica!  Story: 5/5   Production: 5/5   Film: 10/10
