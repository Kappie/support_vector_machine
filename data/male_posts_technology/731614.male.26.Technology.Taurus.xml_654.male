Oh, here's my quiz: 1) What would you choose as your nom de blues? 2)Would you rather turn into your mother or your father? 3) Where do babies come from? 4) How many of you work soul crushingly dull jobs and if you do, how do you keep your spark from being utterly extinguished by the cruel exigencies of a capitalist society? 5) Which is sexier: corset, codpiece, or string bikini?
