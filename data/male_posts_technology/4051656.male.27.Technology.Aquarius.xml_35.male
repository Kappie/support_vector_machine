Each week I'll put another musician and/or band in there along with a link to their website, and if they offer it, a link to one of their songs. That last bit might be legally troubling, so I'll probably just leave the link pointing to their server rather than downloading the song and hosting it myself. That way they can't say I am redistributing. I'm just providing a link.
