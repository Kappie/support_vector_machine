I'm thrilled to have this release out in the wild.  In the last couple weeks, our team has really pulled together to get this new version out the door and I'm psyched launch day has finally arrived.
  
 Update : I'm also coming down offa' wicked donut / adrenalin high, and apparently unable to write in more than the trite cliche.  But I'm still psched.
