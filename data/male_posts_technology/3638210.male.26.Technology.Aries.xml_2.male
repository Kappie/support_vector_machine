I've been looking for a cheap table that I can grout and tile over to use as patio furniture, but haven't found the perfect match just yet.  Anyway, I was in the left turn lane when I realized that I needed to go one more block.  The two right lanes went straight so I looked over to the closest one, put on my signal that I was merging back into traffic, then did so when all was clear.  One block later, back in the left turn lane and I heard a BEEP~ of a car horn close by.  I half look around out of curiosity and two lanes over a black SUV is stopped, parallel with me, and the driver is quite animated with his hands spread and yelling something that I presumably did.  I looked, squinted, then mouthed, "What?" because honestly, I had no clue.  He continued to gesture and yell, but really... can this conversation be successfully held across two lanes of traffic?  And furthermore can any injustice that I allegedly committed be resolved in the span of half a red light?  I mouthed "Sorry?" and there was a definite question mark in the expression and slight shrug that went along with it.  So I looked away, waiting for the light to change and then.... thhHHOOOOP!  Squeal... all lights were green and the black SUV scooted away.  But not before I gave a small yawn and casually leaned over to turn my radio up.  Translation -- "You've effected me this much sir."  But there was a bit of concern; my '98 Jeep Cherokee is still dent and scratch free on the whole, and it would be nice if it could remain so.  I make the turn into the Goodwill parking lot and hop out.  Upon inspection, the passenger side had remained unblemished.  So now the concern was replaced by curiosity.  What did that guy throw?  Obviously something expendable, like trash, but heavy enough to give a decent thunk.  I did my business (no luck on the scrap table) and then decided to investigate.  I drove one block further east so I could come back through the intersection from the opposite direction.  I passed under the light, slowed, looked over, and resting there next to the curb on the far side was a cantaloupe!  So many questions run through one's mind when they've been fruited.  What could be so bad that you are forced to throw your only cantaloupe at someone?  Or did he have an extra?  And if so, who drives around with a SPARE cantaloupe?  I really hope that when he told the story to whomever was waiting on that cantaloupe he said I ran over children and that the cantaloupe had busted my windshield or something.  I can only assume that I accidentally cut him off when merging back into traffic from the first turn lane I was in, but seriously folks... is it worth wasting perfectly good fruit?
