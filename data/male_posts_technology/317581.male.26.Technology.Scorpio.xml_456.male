(also hard to make it a priority when you're trying to get through a difficult piece)  Anyway, the problem with match.com is that you have to pay to use it. You don't have to pay to put up a profile you just have to pay to email. Of course I'm not sure I'm in a get to know new people part of my life yet. But there's never time like the present.  While I'm writing this, I'm listening to  urlLink Brak tell it like it is .  Work starts in 3 days. So much to do, so little time. should I shave before I go back? Should I pay for match.com or move on to a different service? Should I go into hibernation while I work for a while?  Maybe I should just listen to some nice tunes and smoke a bowl:) Peace-
