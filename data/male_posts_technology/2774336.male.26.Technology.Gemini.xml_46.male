       Sourdough Bread 

       Soy Yogurt 

    

    

       Waves of pain, stomach 

    

    Very greasy, but otherwise very normal! 

 

 

 On a whim I picked up some soy yogurt from the grocery store.  The brand is  urlLink Silk  and the flavor is  urlLink strawberry banana .  I have to say that the product is VERY GOOD!  There is a bit of an odd taste at first, if you are very familiar with yogurt, but overall it is an exceptionaly similar product to yogurt, and for someone like me who can no longer tolerate dairy, this is a great find!  I'll definately get more of this in the future. 

 I hadn't eaten much this morning so when my stomach started to complain around 2:30 I wasn't suprised.  It was the usual waves of pain in the upper abdomen, releived by a big gurgle or belching.  I had a piece of sourdough bread and it calmed down.  I have to be more careful to eat more often.

 After eating the pasta salad recipe all day yesterday from the "Eating For IBS" cookbook I had a bowel movement this afternoon that was almost normal! Since I've been ill, my stool has been very odd in many ways but this afternoon it was very usual in many ways.  The only thing I noticed that was out of the ordinary was that it was extremely greasy on the outside.  My understanding is that this is a commong symptom of malabsorption, where the body doesn't correctly absorb the fat content in your diet.  I can't imagine what fat I ate yesterday.  Regardless, I'm mostly pleased with the results.
