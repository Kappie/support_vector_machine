Dad's PC is probably just spare parts now and I've set up space for him on my PC as well. Ah .. anyway I dun think I need to PC much. Hope I can shift the thing out into a more public area. I just dun like people running in and out of my room constantly.  Today went NUS to check out prices for a 2nd laptop for my sis. She's quite eager on getting one. Some good deals for NUS students but I only got my cousin there as a lobang and he's already bought a laptop from Uni. 2nd purchase isn't possible till Sep and even so the price is gonna be increased I think. Anyway, there's a computer fair on during the 1st weekend of Sep, might as well check that out then and get one there. I'm sure there are pretty good bundled deals.  Went for my first run today. Pleasantly surprised to realise i could still run pretty OK. Then again it could be coz I started 3km only. Halfway back I was overtaking 2 girls when 1 of them called out to me. Such a coincidence, it was Begh (UK housemate). Wasn't in the best of condition to stay for a long chat so I departed pretty soon. Probably give her a quick ring these days when I've settled my things. Hmm ... maybe I'll go run again if I can wake up early 2moro. Maybe grab an earlier night today. Past 2 nights I've been sleping no later than 3am.
