Instinctually, uncontrollably, I lust after these boxes and wish them all to be filled to the brim with cookies.  Chocolate chip cookies are what I want, but not what I imagine is in these boxes.  The boxes are really small too.  Much too small to be girl scout cookies.  They look like they are from last valentine's day. But when I finally pass them they seem to be filled with cell phones or some strange digital communication device.  I keep walking and now my cookie lust has transcended. I now wish that every box, every box that exists was filled with cookies. Whatever cookies I happen to want. Always.
