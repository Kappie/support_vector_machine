Now, I heard someone speculate that the reason they kicked it back was to smack the 9th Circuit on the hand for letting it get this far "improperly".  I don't buy that.  I was surprised when I saw the breakdown of the votes.  I assumed that Scalia and Thomas would have been on the side of not hearing it (for fear of losing the case), but they (and someone else) basically said the case was without merit.
