Enhanced support enabled via Auto Sync.   Some more new features: 1. Choice of Online Stores 2. Improved All-in-One Smart Jukebox  The  urlLink release notes  are an excellent place to find out what is the significant difference for Media 10.  For people willing to test this product, there is community feedback link right at the top! for people in India who have interest in digital music technology this is the right time to get ahead with Windows Media 10 and make a difference.  Post a comment on this blog to let me about your interest in the digital music technology :)  For developers, following SDKs are available: 1. Windows Media Player 10 Software Development Kit (beta version)  2. Windows Media Format 9.5 Software Development Kit (beta version)  3. Windows Media Rights Manager 10 Software Development Kit (beta) 4.

Please remember to submit the bug / feedback with the *minimum* information as mentioned on the website.  i am rebooting now as it has upgraded my Windows Media 9 Player to Windows Media Player 10. I wonder how much better is the new Windows Media Codec from the version 9? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.
