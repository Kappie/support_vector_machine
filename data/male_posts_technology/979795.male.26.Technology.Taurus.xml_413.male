We did the backstretching exercise, followed by a series of other teachnoques; katatedori gyaku hamni iriminage, katatedori aihamni kokyunage variation, and a few of our regular kokyunage, etc.  Wenjun's dad popped by lastnight. Apparently he had told his dad he was going for Aikido. We've not seen him for quite a few month in fact. His dad mentioned he had stopped him because of his studies, but after that he had told him to come for training. Haiz... teens these days. Wenjun is not a bad kid, problem might be the co he hangs around with in school. His just a brash young man with too much energy. Aikido tends to put some of those energy he has into good use, but because he isn't 100% serious with his training, he still has a lot of spare energy being wasted outside with his friends. He doesn't go around making trouble all the time (I think), but because the school has kind of branded him as a troublemaker, he gets pin-pointed pretty often. I think he feels damn sian not being trusted in school and home. Don't know (or sees) him enough to be able to advise or help him. Like I said, not a bad kid but very very prideful. His ego prevents him from being told that he is at fault sometimes and when someone lectures him, he goes into a switch-off mode (one ear in and another out).  Leon got a telling off that night. He was thinking (I'd say dreaming) of his grading. At the start of class he keeps telling me he wants to buy a new orange belt - it's getting too short/small for him - but to buy one now when he's going to get graded for his blue belt soon, it's like wasting $. (OKOK you can kinda interpret that he kinda has the notion he will automatically/definitely be able to get his blue belt.) I think somewhere along during class he might've mentioned something like that to Sensei and Sensei gave him a lecture instead. His attitude was so poor during training, how to take his grading? Sensei's words were something like, "Your rolls are worse than a beginner and you still dare to tell me you want to take your grading?" At the end of class he lectured Leon in a corner of the room for a short while.  I don't know how is it that we develop the right mindset for martial arts training. Some have it at the very beginning, some naturally just develop it along the way, and others need a lot of help to develop it. I think working with the young these days (like where I'm working) is not hard sometimes, but to work with youths - now that's a real challenge. I guess that's why it's important to cultivate our kids at such a tender age. But when is it too much. Sometimes I look at the load the kids in school have now,  it's really so much different from UK. The kids know how to have fun. Some of the EM1 kids I've seen here are so serious and stiff, I have my doubts if they have the same interpretation of 'fun'. Sometimes I feel quite sad looking at how Singapore has 'developed'. We are strong in a variety of areas but there's still so much more we should/can do. The emphasis placed by our govt is not wrong, but sometimes they look a bit too far and forget the here and now. We need a better balance of things, for ourselves, our country, and a more rounded future for the generations to come. Don't you think?
