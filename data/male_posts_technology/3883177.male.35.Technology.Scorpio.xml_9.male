Sure, Pink Cadillac and Cover Me might not exactly be subversive, but Prodigal  Son and No Surrender certainly aren't apolitical. And Pawlenty would go to  a show with R.E.M. to see Springsteen before Springsteen said he was choosing  Kerry? yeah, right. Bummer - I guess this means I won't be able to  get tickets to Toby Keith because he'll be taking my seat.             Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty opened his  weekly radio show Friday with "Born to Run," but followed by saying he was  "heartbroken" that Springsteen had gone partisan.     "I really appreciate his music, but I wish he wouldn't interject his music  with politics," said Pawlenty, cochairman of Bush's reelection campaign in  Minnesota. He said he was "going to have to miss" the planned Oct. 5 show in St.  Paul where Springsteen and R.E.M. are slated to play.     http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/08/10/some_fans_dont_want_musicians_to_play_politics/
