This is the first time I've been in this situation on this project, even pending bug reviews.  Partly this is only becuase the boss has let some smaller stuff slide to the next release, but that's not the point. Still a reason to celebrate. So I'm testing for the rest of the day, and hoping that I won't find much else that's wrong.....  Oh what a glorious day :D
