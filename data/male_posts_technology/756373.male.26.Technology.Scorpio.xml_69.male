"And it says that just as America cannot be judged by what it calls 'often misguided foreign policy' or  torture  committed by American soldiers, neither should the world of Islam 'be held accountable for the un-Islamic and barbaric deeds of a minuscule minority.'   Why is it that every statement they make has to include some antigovernmental rhetoric? A bloody  meteor  could demolish Baghdad and CAIR would somehow pin it on US 'misguided foereign policy' or some such hogwash.  As for 'torture'? Abuse, yes..but calling it  torture , is either shortsighted, plain stupid...or clever enough to appear sympathetic towards the beheading without alienating CAIR's Muslim backing. Torture is flogging. Or pulling out fingernails. Cutting off bits, feeding people through woodchippers, etc. Torture is systematic and sanctioned. Parading some gits around naked with panties on their heads -  torture ? My ass. But hey - we can't pass up an opportunity to take a shot at the Great Satan, eh - even when uttering some mumbled half-assed attempt at appearing genuinely concerned.
