The IDE uses the drive from where it is launched. The IDE does not use the drive that the project uses.    To work around this problem, include the drive name for the Intermediate file folder and for the Output file folder. To edit the entries for the IntDir folder or for the OutDir folder, follow these steps: On the Project menu, click Properties Pages. In the Properties Pages dialog box, click Configuration Properties. In the General list, type new entries for the Output Directory items and for the Intermediate Directory items that include the drive names.
