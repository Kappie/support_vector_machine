If I join the army then I would probably only keep in contact when I get leave etc... But other than that I like to think I'd keep in contact with Jenny, and Andy.   I had my opticians appointment today. very scary stuff. I am long sighted and have to get some glasses for doing school work etc.. They should arrive in roughly a week they said. The glasses are pretty nice. I think they make me look intelligent, ish. I am feeling relaly left out at the moment from our group. I know I am ill and that I couldn't go out even if someone asked me because I don't want to make my cold worse but no one even invites me anywhere. Although i must hand it to Jackie, as I talk to her now on msn she is inviting me to a film. I think.
