Who's inferior? Yea, we needa check the interior Of the system who cares about only one culture And that is why We gotta take the power back  Chorus  The teacher stands in front of the class But the lesson plan he can't recall The student's eyes don't percieve the lies Mounted on every fucking wall His composure is well kept I guess he fears playing the fool Complacent students sit, and listen  to the bullshit that he learned in school  Europe ain't my rope to swing on Can't learn a thing from it Yet we hang from it Gotta get it, gotta get it together then Like the mother fuckin Minutemen To expose and close the doors on those who try To strangle and mangle the truth 'Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react We gotta take the power back  Chorus  No more lies
