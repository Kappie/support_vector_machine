There was a party afterwards at someone's house till 10... LOL That was a huge amount of cars for that small a street. It was only like 70 out, and some crazy people jumped into the pool anyway... the spa I understand, but not the pool.  Afterward, while I was driving home on TV highway, west of 170th, I saw a photo-radar vehicle on the side of the road and immediately checked my speed... under 55, so I didn't slow down. When I passed it though, the thing flashed and when I got home I checked with my mom and apparently that section of road's 45, not 55. Gayness... whatever, so I guess I have my first ticket... I'm upset, but not about the ticket so much as how little the thing was that I got it for... I wanted my first ticket to be for going 120 in a 45 or something like that...   Oh well.
