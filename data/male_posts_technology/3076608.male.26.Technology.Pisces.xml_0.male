There is a party that I will most likely be attending but I honestly don't really even want to go. If by chance I find something a bit more interesting to do, I will probably cop out. Unfortunately I do have to work tomorrow at Hot Topic so I am not sure how late I will actually be out or if I will even get torn or not. Then again, I am not sure I can handle the party scene sober so the thought of going straight seems a little far fetched. I will be spending time with Vanessa which will most likely mean I will have to see and deal with f'n Tim too. I swear I get so freaking tired of seeing the f'er everywhere I go for fun. I swear sometimes I just want to stomp him into the ground just to get him out of my system and feel better about the entire situation. It probably would be in his best interest to stay as far away from me as possible otherwise things could get ugly. Honestly I think a lot of the frustration and anger I have for Mike (the f'er that used to be my best friend until he slept around with my ex-fiance on my own couch.. long story). Since Tim basically did the same thing as Mike they both stand in the same category to me anymore. Neither of them would be safe in a closed room with me alone because I would gladly stomp either one of them into the ground and not think twice about it.   If anyone knows me personally they would probably be thinking right now "What in the world is going on with Seth, he is not a violent person" Well, for the most part that is correct. The reason why I am normally not a violent person is because I do not have enemies, for the most part. If you do something bad enough to make it to my enemy list, then I feel sorry for you because I am really never going to be nice to that person again. In my life I only have two people that I would really consider to be my enemy and Tim and Mike are both of them. Both of them took perfectly good friendships and threw them back in my face. Neither of them cared about how I felt so why in the world should I give two flips for anything they think or feel. If I could have about 15 minutes alone with each of them then I would probably be fine and never have another second thought about hating them. Unfortunately, I have tried to be the civil one about the entire situation but all it has done is fill me full or rage and regret for not whipping their ass into the ground.   I am sure that one day I will be over both situations but its not going to happen any time soon. I think I would probably have to go about a year or more without seeing either of them before I could actually be over either situation entirely. Unfortunately I see them way too much then I care to. Some more than others but both way too much. I wish there was a cure for this anger and rage I have inside for both of them but the only thing I think would make me feel better is physical retribution. I know that must sound pretty low of me, but I have never had people treat me as poorly as both of them did. No one has showed less care for my feelings then them so I don't care what they feel unless it is pain and then I probably couldn't be happier.   So who is to say what this weekend will bring. I am officially out of people that I am pursuing or am interested in. I would love to have a lovely lady to spend some time with but it looks like I will just be hanging out with Vanessa. I am not complaining of course, because we all know how I feel about Vanessa but for my own mental health its better that I don't hang out in places where Vanessa and Tim are in the same location. All it does is make my blood boil. I know I should be over this already but its hard when someone say they are your friend to your face but then stab you in the back. If I cant trust someone, then there is no way that I can be friends with them. So I think I will just go and make the best of the situation. If I have to hang out with Vanessa and Tim then so be it, I will make the best of the situation that I can.   As long as I can avoid drama or feeling like my guts are getting ripped out then I should be fine. I am not going to be able to stay too awfully long at the party so I should be able to avoid feeling bad for the most part. It really sucks that I cant go anywhere anymore without him affecting me negatively. He seems to show up everywhere and every time that Vanessa and I hang out. I guess I have to just start getting used to it since Vanessa and him are going out but there is no way that I will ever like him or trust him again. I can eventually tolerate his presence but he shouldn't ever expect me to be civil or even remotely nice to him. See Vanessa doesn't really know Tim. She thinks she does but what she knows is what he has told her. I have known him and known of him a hell of a lot longer than she has. She always gives people hell for being whores but what she doesn't know is that he is one of the biggest whores I have ever met. The fact that he even touched her makes me want to break his fingers off. If she knew how many people that he has slept with and the scum he has slept with, and it wouldn't surprise me if it were both sexes, then she probably wouldn't have gotten with him. I hope that Vanessa gets tested some time soon because that whore has bound to have caught something by now. I worry for Vanessa because I know she doesn't use protection like she should. I would have said something to her but I figured him having sex with Laura unprotected would have been enough to keep Vanessa from ever messing around with him. I never would have thought she would have gone for that fag anyway. He is one of the queerest straight guys I have every met. Unfortunately she was stupid about it and did it anyway. So in theory she has slept with Laura too and that really disgusts me. I worry more than anything though.   One last thought. If Vanessa ever removes her little barrier of protection on Tim I am going to hunt him down and beat the living sh!t out of him. It will be a good day that day. Heaven forbid he ever hurt her or do anything to tick her off because it will be just enough of an excuse for me to ruin his face. I will take great pride in cutting off that gay pony tail and making him eat part of it. Kung Fu has been very good for me but now its starting to turn intoa 101 ways to kick Tim's ass. I know I am bad, but at this point I really don't care. Being the good guy has gotten me no where so I will just go back to doing what I do best. Being the evil f'er that I really am. My horoscope said today that I should be the real me, well this is me folks. Its just a dern shame that I wont get to act on all these pleasant thoughts. Instead I have to just sit on them and try and be a good boy. One day I will have my chance to turn this situation around and feel better about the entire thing, but until then I will just have bite my lip, grind my teeth and bare it.I will be fine of course, because I am the master of my own emotion but on the inside sometimes I just want to explode just so I can feel some relief for five minutes. Instead I am stuck trying to be the nice guy because I don't want to tick Vanessa off and make her hate me. She is the only thing that keeps me from resolving this entire situation but its probably for the best. I am afraid what I would do to Tim anyway if I were ever given the opportunity to hurt him.   Chance are tonight will be little to no fun for me. I am tired of the party scene. I am tired of the people that are in it. AllI want to do is relax and have a stressless free time but its not going to happen so I will start dealing with it now so that when the time comes for us to go to the party I will be ready to deal with the actual event. If I am lucky I will find some really cute girl to pretend to love me and get me the heck out of that place. Knowing my luck though, I will just come in with Vanessa and probably leave alone.I will of course update you on what really happens... More definitely to come. (Hopefully with some freaking good news for once).   Here is my prediction for the night, andit will be fun to see how accurate I am. I will probably have a late start with Vanessa, have a good time with her for a bit, go to the party and be bored and annoyed, then go home either alone or with Vanessa and just pass out. Chances our my time with Vanessa will be great as usual but as soon as I get around the rest of the crowd it will just go down hill from there. As always I look forward to spending time with my best friend but dont look forward to having to deal with a bunch of people I dont know, like or care to tolerate. Well, so goes my life. Its all good. Its just another weekend and nothing I havent been dealing with for god knows how long anyway. {sigh}
