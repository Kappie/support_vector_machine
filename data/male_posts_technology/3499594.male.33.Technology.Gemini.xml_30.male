We had one before of 13 girls ( or was it 14 ), now that was work. I was going to bail on that one, when one of my wifes friends was going to help out. She canceled and I had to stay. I got caught in the kitchen corner once and had to tickle my way out. :  )   You have to understand these are 5-6 year olds.   Anyway last night I continue to be amazed of the dichotomy of each kids personality. A couple of them are wilder than a march hare and the other 2 were calm and quit. But they all seem to get along well. My 5 year old son loved it of course. My wife really enjoy these. I at times cannot tell who is having more fun she or the kids.  Can we say...the energy one has bounces off the other ? Man they are hyper together. Usually one or two never wants to go to sleep. Last night was not different, 2 first kept talking and playing, while the others started falling out. Finally at around 11:30 p.m. I just said 'OK, after this movie we are turning it off.' One was still awake after the movie.  I crashed and was only called by work once last night around 12:10 a.m. which was good.   So yeah, I am drinking the coffee this morning and we are waiting till 9 a.m. central for the parents to come pick them up. My wife continues to entertain this morning. We woke up around 6 a.m. and bless my wifes heart, she has allergies that are rocking her and she already done all their hair, breakfast, played Disney UNO, shall I go on?  Is it 9 yet?  heh heh  ( Yes, I snuck away for a bit to write this. Oh God, they found me........
