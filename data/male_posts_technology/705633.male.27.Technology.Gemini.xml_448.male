I have added a "Shout Out" feature to this site.. so all our favourite people like Dangerous Frank, Nelson, the Shut It ladies and all those girls that read to make sure we arn't writing about them.. you can add comments onto our site now after the posts. Enjoy!  So.. Iraq. That's a funny old game, isn't it? The way I see it.. they missed the boat on the whole thing anyway (apparently Clinton was watching golf when they could have popped Saddam, but he didn't give the order in time.. dumbass)  As terrible as it is, why would anyone join the army if they didn't want to get in a bit of a ruck? I mean think about it.. these guys have training year in, year our.. running around assault courses, stabbing giant hessian dummies with their bayonets, etc.. etc.. it would be a shame for them not to have a bit of a scrap wouldn't it?  I was in the Air Cadets for a while when I was a lad. It was crap. We would spend ages running up and down the sand dunes, carrying logs, and polishing our boots. What on earth for? I am not joking. It was like being in the Hitler youth. I only left when I heard a rumor that I didn't actually HAVE to be there. That I was supposed to be there for fun. I just don't see myself as military material. I have a problem with authority. If a chrome-domed drill instructor was screaming orders in my face I think i'd crack up laughing.  Apparently the french are allergic to sand so they couldn't go.  Donald Rumsfeld came out with a great quote.. "Going to war without France is like going duck-hunting without an accordion"  Thoughts on the upcoming war lads?
