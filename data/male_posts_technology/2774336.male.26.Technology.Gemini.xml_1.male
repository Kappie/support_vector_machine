       Tonight I was planning to send out a large email to my friends and family.  My email program was set to add people to my address book automatically, so it was full of email addresses that I didn't expect to be using.  Online shopping stores, marketing email accounts, subscriptions for which I didn't sign up.  I had known about the problem for a while, but because I usually respond directly to emails I have received, I didn't worry about it.  Tonight, however, I decided it would be a good time to clean the floatsam from my address book. I wasn't prepared for what I would find.   I started at the top of the list, checking the names and deleting the entries I knew were duplicates or old email addresses, along with the entries that I didn't recognize.  Not quite halfway through the list, I was stopped by an entry that I didn't know how to deal with.   The entry was the name of my friend and high school computer teacher, Paul Soik.  The email address was valid.  The person was a friend.  Initially I decided to leave it, move on to the next one. But then I stopped.   Paul had passed away over a month ago.   For only the second time in my life, I have discarded the contact information of a friend who has died. It's a disheartening feeling.  I know I'll never have need of this information again but I still feel guilty, as if I've thrown away the friendship and memories along with the phone number and address.  Even though he is gone, I still think of Paul as a friend.  Why am I throwing away a friend's number?   A part of me is glad that I feel guilty.  I hope I never get used to removing friends from my address book. I hope I never have to remove the number of someone who is still here.   Twice recently I've had conversations with people who act as if friendships and personal relationships require constant maintenance or should be discarded.  "If they don't talk to me why should I talk to them?"  Is that really how it is?  Do people really stop enjoying someone's personality, their company and companionship, if that person isn't giving some predetermined amount of attention?  I don't understand that attitude at all.   There are people that I haven't seen or spoken to in years who I still count among my friends, and I would hope that they count me among theirs.  In fact, only two days ago I received a phone call from a friend that I haven't seen or spoken to in over a year.  Between us, It was almost as if no time had passed at all.  We had a lot to talk about of course  a lot had changed in our lives  but we knew that our friendship was still the same. It's comforting to have a relationship with that kind of timeless consistency, consistency that isn't a product of diligence or perseverance but of choice.  We choose to stay friends.   I'd like to think that I could call any of my old friends and they would be happy to hear from me, regardless of how long it has been.  I'd like to think that old friends still think of me fondly from time to time.  I'd like to think that the people I've met in my life will grieve a little bit when they remove me from their address book; not because I'm no longer a friend, but because I'm no longer here to talk.   Rest in Peace, Paul.  You've still got friends here.
