Karzai is not the most legitimate guy he was "elected" by commitee a commitee that was appointed. 3. Th library thing is true. You have to get support from FISA who has only once turned down the goverment since it came into existence. That denial can be found in my archieves somewhere. 4. "What's the point of getting people killed just to be consistent?" This stinks of cynicism. If we're not consistent whats the point of having policy at all. 5.  If the WMD exist it's by luck not because we knew they were there. Most of the state department's claims can't be  urlLink verified . 7. The embedded reborters are not objective. The US has  urlLink something  against the unembedded reporters. 8. The contracts are very suspect. The American people are paying for this war and the big profits are going to some very unfortunate companies like Halburtin(spell). 9. Perhaps if Syria hands over it's WMD Israel should do the same. 10. A prevailing system does not make it a right one. The arguement that because something has been around for a long time makes it ok is a pretty bad one.  The Article isn't perfect isn't even a great one but I thought it was interesting and apparently so did you. The writter did get some facts wrong, but your philosphy seems to be that either nothing can be done about it or this is the way it has always been. I think that is very cynical.
