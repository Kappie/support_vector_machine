I was washing the dishes when I heard some topic the others were talking about, one of the comment was funny (to me lah) so I laughed out like really really hard, long and loud. And she just left the table, supposedly all teary-eyed. Sheesh, no doubt lah I didn't like make the comment lah, but I think it felt like I was laughing at her directly in her face or something. Sure, some of them said I wasn't the one to make the comment so I wasn't like really responsible. Still, I think to say that I had nothing to do with it is absolutely irresponsible. Sighz, ... guess I'll have to apologise to her tomorrow. Will try to finish my report by tomorrow morning so I can stay awake overnight to apologise 1st thing when I see her.  Goodness, feeling a little bad.
