According to  urlLink report  published on  urlLink Reuters , a federal judge on Wednesday ordered Microsoft Corp. to begin shipping Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java program within 120 days, after the companies fought over implementing a ruling he made last month.  Sun had complained in a court filing that Microsoft wanted to take up to a year before including the Java program to copies of Windows it sells.  Microsoft told U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz that shipping Java with Windows was not a simple matter and a sudden change in the operating system could harm large corporate users of Windows.  But Motz ruled, "I can't sit here hearing after hearing, I want this done in 120 days."  And so, Microsoft had to eat the humble pie... for once!   (I still get a niggling feeling that Microsoft will wriggle out of this hole too!)
