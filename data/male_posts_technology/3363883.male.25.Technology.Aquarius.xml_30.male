However, it's not much of a beast; comfort factor isn't there and having only the radio drives me mad.  Did I mention British Radio plays the worst Pop Crap in the world?  So I'm looking about.  I think I'll try and get my hands on a Toyota Celica. I'm not sure, but probably the 2.0 Gt turbo.  Bit of grunt and something stylish.  I've found a couple of different versions and ages that are out there and I think they look pretty sweet.  I have no doubt that it doesn't agree with all the boys back home.  It's a V6/V8 or it ain't nothing.. .. .. .. apparently.  God sometimes I wish I can understand car talk.  I'm not buying anything brand new, I've been there and done that.  Not going to get burned again and lose a shed load of money when I sell it off.    So I've found a nice car.  First things first, I'll check out what the damage is with insurance.  Upon my first phone call I get some pretty decimating news.  I've been driving in the country for the last 18 months TOTALLY illegaly.  I've already gone on to the British Driving License Website and I have to admit, they do make it quite clear.   If you are resident for more than 12 months in the UK, you MUST apply for a full british drivers license.  I've been driving for 9 years, my [Oz] license is valid for 7 more years.  This doesn't amount to squat.  I have to retake a theory test and then do the physical exam.   That's not the best bit.  If I don't stretch the truth and say that maybe I have come here in the last year, I'm going to have to go back onto my "L"s. :-)    If it wasn't happening to me, I'd be pissing myself with laughter.  So that's it.    No more driving for me until I can get this all sorted.  I should look on the bright side and be happy that nothing has actually happened.  Then again.  I hate people who look on the bright side of things.
