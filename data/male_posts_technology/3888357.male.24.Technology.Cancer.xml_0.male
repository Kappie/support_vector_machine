I'd generally get my coke at the corner store, referred to around work as the "Brothel Deli" -simply because by day they sell sandwiches and by night...well, you can figure it out. But perhaps I can resist today and therefore avoid the brothel row walk.  You've probably figured out by now that I work in a district in which the day-time occupation is general commerce-type jobs and after about 7 o'clock the common prostitutes come out. Lovely area really. No wonder Jace won't let me take the bus to work.   Currently, I work for  urlLink Internet Business Corporation  (IBC for short). I am the Marketing and Business Development Coordinator. To translate, it means that I do workshops, PR stuff for the company and its products, copywriting, and sales. Everyone wears multiple hats by force, being a small company, as opposed to the preferred reason, which I would be tempted to say is fashionable choice. As mentioned, I'm on the outskirts of the city but every so often I'll walk into the city during lunch to meet up with Jace. He works for  urlLink Apache Energy , an American oil and gas firm. Go figure he gets the perfect international company and I get the web development role in the red light district... but I guess if I don't get a raise I can easily pick up another job on the side. Score.
