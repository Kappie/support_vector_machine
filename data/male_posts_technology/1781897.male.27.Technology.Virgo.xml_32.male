That being said, I feel it is also important to mention that I too feel as though I am qualified to be a professional drinker.  Tonight, laides and gents, was a stellar performance.  Not only did the drinker (me) show passion for the drink, he showed that one must drizzle the jizzle n cizzle tizzle their hizzle spizzles in circizzles.  If it were a contest......allz i know is....the match was mine!  Laides and Gentlemen, the captian has illuminated the fasten seat-belt sign as we are beginning our final approach for landing.  Please return your seats and trade-tables to their original position..........Please remain seated until the aricraft has come to a complete stop at the terminal and the capitan has truned off the fasten seat-belt sign.  Be careful when accessing the over-head bins as thier contents may have shifted during the flight.  Because we know here at e-airlines that you have a choice when you travel, we would like to thank you for choosing us.....enjoy your stay and have a nice day!
