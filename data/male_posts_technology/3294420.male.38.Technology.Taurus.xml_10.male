Right now she is snugged out in a little baby sling across my lap...making her little grunts and sheep noises.  Everything checked out fine with her MRI.  So far...so good as far as her health is concerned.  She's having some tummy problems so our first night was a bit restless and sleepless.  I'm happy to give up sleep....if it means that I can have her here with me.  Gotta go....she's awake and demanding some attention.  :-)  Love,  Gina.
