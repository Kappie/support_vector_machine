If you come home at 3am, they don't ask where you've been. 4. They don't hog the bed and steal all the covers. 3. They don't eat (unless you count disks). 2. They remember everything you want them to remember, and forget everything you want them to forget. 1. They never complain that you don't take them anywhere.

Computers don't give back-rubs. 2. You can't put your freezing feet on a computer's leg to warm them up. [Well, you could, but: 1) they wouldn't get very warm, and 2) you wouldn't have the pleasure of hearing the computer shriek]. 1. You can't have sex with a computer.
