Stress. Even the word invokes that unpleasant tight-chested feeling. Stress really sucks. Like, it sucks when you boss comes to you and gives you an ultimatum and starts quoting phrases like " I want you to drive this" (um, it has a steering wheel?). I mean, what is it with stress? Why does it exist? We would be able to go about our lives so much better without it. someone once said, Panicking never solved anything. Aint that the truth. Stupid chemicals and human fear and instinct have, in any stress inducing incident, only  hampered  success. Someone scream "Bomb in the building!" at a crowded place, for instance, and watch everyone trample each other like stampeding cattle to get out. Whereas simply filing out calmly would probably get everyone out much faster. That exact same scenario can be applied to the workplace. When your boss comes to you and starts going on about deadlines and shit, your emotions start stampeding, running riot if you will. Fear and urgency and a myriad of others all clump together and block off whatever vision of a solution you may have had. And instead of going ahead and doing what needs to be done, you mutter and stammer and panic, and if anything is accomplished, it is done so at half the pace that you would have set for yourself had you merely acknowledged the urgency of the task and carried on as per usual.  So, adapt or die. Humanity needs to adapt to stress. right now it's killing off people at an astronomic rate - stress induced heart attacks and stress-related accidents (traffic accidents etc) are probably the number 1 causes of fatalities amongst the working middle class. Not terrorism or anthrax or even AIDS. So why isn't anyone doing anything about it? The workplace causes stress, yet so few workplaces offer employess ways to combat it. In some American companies , employers have recognised the risk of stress to their employees, and offer what we in the third world would laugh off as trivial - Tai-Chi classes, 'sleep areas' for afternoon siestas, etc. We office-masses in Africa are not offered such "luxuries", and yet we face the same stress , the same challenges that our foreign counterparts do (it being the Global Village now, you know...), and if we are to survive, if companies in Africa are to realise a profit from employees, they're going to have to begin adapting.
