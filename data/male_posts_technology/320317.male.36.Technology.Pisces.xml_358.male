The remote control was invented for people with limited mobility. From the typewriter to the remote control, special access tools developed for disabled individuals eventually become conveniences for everyone."

 Interesting little facts I never knew. Accessibility is really about making your information or your ideas accessible to the broadest audience as possible.
