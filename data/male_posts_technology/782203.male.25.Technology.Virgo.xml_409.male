Hmm let's see what I been up to .....spend the whole weekend learning how to use Photoshop, extremely frustrating but now I know what layers are so it was good in the way. I also figured out how to save an image without the damm canvas; just save it as gif instead of jpeg. Ok theres probably a way to do it with jpeg but hell as long as it works right. But still struggling with Flash. Was supposed to watch Spanish apartment with a friend but now it is only showing at GV Grand and at one time slot of 2 pm.  Quite a waste cos I heard from a lot of people that it was really funny.   Haven't been online much as well; kind of lost interest in online chatting recently, for reasons better left unmentioned.
