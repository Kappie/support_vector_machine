Each three- to six-hour leg will be charged at $19.95, while access on trips under three hours would cost $14.95. 
That's no free hotspot at the local coffee shop, to be sure, but I was expected something far more pricey.  I mean, doesn't it cost like $20 to make a 4 minute phone call in the air?  
  
One weird detail ... the initial plan is for wireless and they hope to offer Ethernet later on.  Seems a tremendous expense to go around laying wires to every seat for people who will only have laptops.
