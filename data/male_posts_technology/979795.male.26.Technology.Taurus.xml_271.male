Though it's a full marathon (42km), I'll just be running the half marathon route (21km). I'm even considering the biathlon which is organised every year in March but I think I need to seriously cross train properly before I can take it.  Still dunno what came over me.  Yuishinkai's seminar will commence this coming Thurs to Sat (2nd-4th Oct). I think I'll register for the Thurs afternoon seminar. It should be an interesting experience. After that I should have more than enought time to grab dinner and head on down to Siglap for Aikido class at Siglap. I just hope my leave application on Mon will be approved.
