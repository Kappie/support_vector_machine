But I face an issue.. i.e, whatever u have typed from the new layout is not visible for me as such.... at times it is visible... But mostly I have to select the text for seeing the content.... Whether its the problem with My I.E or anything else.... or anyone else face the same issue....  By way where do u have options to design the layout of the blog page in the blogger....  Cheers Ram
