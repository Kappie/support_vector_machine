Day after day after day of sitting here crapping on about flow control, the nyquist theorum, and project quality management can just blow me.  Ahh roll on next Friday. Ice ice baby!  Rearraged the house yesterday, and as soon as Officer Hugh returns my CF card I will post a picture. It roxx0rz. We are all ghey interior designers here.  Yay.
