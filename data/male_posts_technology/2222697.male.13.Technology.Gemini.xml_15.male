Ok im done you'll have to buy tickets yourself and i am not gonna get in trouble for giving out spoilers and ruining the movie experience. So I'm in tyler this morning and i have thought about some features to put on my website. There will be monthly polls, a shoutbox!, a sprite of the week, And a download of the moment. I am willing to take donations you can email me and we will work things out. The donations will be going torward features on the site, enough money for me to review a demo disc, or whatever. The donations will be highly appriciated and you can advertize on my site for a set amount of time. If you have anymore ideas tell me and be sure to tell all your friends about this blog we need more ppl to read this site and you do, tell me, the more support i have the better the site will be, but remember to read the rules before posting on my november 6th post.
