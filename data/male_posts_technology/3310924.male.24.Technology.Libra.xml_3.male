I had to make some cutting modifications inorder for some of the peripheral cards to fit in.  There are other things wrong with it, but they would take to long to explain.  After may hours of trying to track down why the computer would powerup by not display anything on the screen I finally figure out that is was something to do with both the floppy drive cable and the CD-RW drive.  All in all, it is fixed and put together.  Now I just have to worry about the rest of this office.  I so want everything to be put in their places but to be able to get to them if I need them.  I imagine that I am going to go on a search tomorrow for a simple table that I put inbetween my desk and the bookshelf.  I want it high enough to put over the three computers and then on top of it I will put my photo printer and my scanner if it eventually gets here.  I also want to find some kind of wire, pull out shelves to put inside my desk so I can organize the space in there.  Anyway, there are so many things around this apartment that I want to do, but I have to just keep focused on one thing so that I can complete it and move on to the next.  I have a bad habit of starting something and not finishing it.  Speaking of finishing things, I need to finish the Psychology website that I have started.  I would be cool to get that done by the end of this week.  I will have some time for that when Joy goes off to do the Harry Potter thing with here people.  Anyway, enough for now and hopefully this computer can stay up for a while now.
