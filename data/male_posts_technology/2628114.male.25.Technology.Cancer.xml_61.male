The temperature was awesome, I felt really good again (except for maybe some tightness in my lower legs), and I actually got to take my iPod again and let the sounds of Ibiza power me through my run (did I say I wouldn't take the iPod again?).      I went up Victory Parkway from my house and turned left up into Avondale just before I got to Dana.  From there, it was an up and down run as I ran in between Reading Road and back to Victory Parkway along all the roads before you get to MLK.  The hills were awesome to run up and down and I love running through Avondale when there are that many people on the streets.  It leads to more confusion than anything else for other people with questions like, "What's that white boy doing here?" and "Why you running so fast white boy?"  My journey led me down streets I have never seen in all of my years living in the city and down streets that I probably wouldn't frequent.  It actually got to a point in my run where I looked up and wondered, "Where am I?"  No big deal, Avondale isn't THAT big and I knew it was small enough to get out of to go home.      One funny thing to note is more of a runner's experience that most only runners will appreciate but I will share anyway.  About my third street between Victory and Reading, I started to really have to use the restroom (1 not 2) and it just so happened that the road I was on was all woodsy and vegetationy (that's a word) with no houses at that particular point.  Well, since I am a man and the world is my urinal, I sped over to a U-shaped area of vegetation but was faced with a dilemma.  There was only coverage for one way of traffic.  If I chose incorrecty and a car drove by going that direction, they would absolutely see a tall, lanky white boy peeing in the 'hood.  I had been running up this road for a few minutes and had not seen one car.  In fact prior to that, it was downright peaceful with the wooded area and no traffic and all.  Considering that, I figured I couldn't lose, no cars would come anyway no matter which side I picked.  Good thought, right?  WRONG!  Well I chose my side and had no sooner begun my dastardly deed then of course, you guessed it, a car came driving by to see a tall, lanky white boy peeing in the 'hood.  It was okay though, it's probably not the first time they have seen something similar.  At least I wasn't in some guy's front yard, right?    Enough for today.  I don't even have a final thought.  I will just leave you with that picture of a tall, lanky white boy peeing in the hood.      Have a great weekend!  Six miles coming up for me this weekend, followed by a 3 miler on Sunday.
