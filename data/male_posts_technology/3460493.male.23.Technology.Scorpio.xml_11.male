If that alone doesn't cheer me up, there should be something seriously wrong with me. Besides going home for the weekend, I also get paid every Friday afternoon. With a new car and everything, I can't be spending it like I did to basically every paycheck I received before. But it's cool, since I have a new ride and that's the most important thing. But before leaving, I want to share what's on my mind about certain newsbytes.  - Am I the only one who finds it amusing that a software compnay bundled their software with their rivals in order to "prove" they're the best? That's what Linspire is going right now. The company formerly known as Lindows is promoting and selling a Linux bundle that includes Linspire, Fedora and Mandrake, just to compare which one is best. They even have a cheesy  urlLink website  that "shows which is best". Of course, they give their product five stars and the others way lower ratings. I think the idea of Linspire is cool for beginners, but for other people, I think this really, really sucks. Especially with Mandrake 10, since I really think it's a really superior product. The best Linux distro I've tried yet.  - I've been playing Metroid Prime non-stop. But yesterday, as I'm moving to mostly underwater levels, I found something weird. Whenever I use the wave beam, the flash of the beam creates a lighting effect where you can see Samus' face. I admit, Samus does have pretty eyes, especially for a bounty hunter, but it still freaks me out whenever I see it. It's like a ghost is looking at you or something. Very freaky...  - Who's gonna win the hardware? Hopefully the Pistons will show that a multi-million spending team like the Lakers doesn't automatically mean winning the championship. I like both teams, but so far the Pistons have really surprised me, especially after game 3 where they won by 20 points. Brings back very good and fond memories of 1998, when the Chicago Bulls beat the Utah Jazz 96-54, breaking the mark for lowest points by a team ever. Good times indeed!  - Rest in peace, Reagan. I was too young to remember his presidency, but it seems like he was a great president, especially in the times when the U.S. was enemies with a lot of other nations, especially the Soviet Union superpowers. Reading about those times, it's pretty scary what could have happened if a war broke out between these two nations.  Well, my mind is blank again, hopefully I'll be able to post again this weekend. But I'll be too occupied with other things, and spending some quality time for myself! So have a great day, and a great weekend too!
