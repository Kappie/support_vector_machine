And I think it is up to Jackie what she does about it. I woudl suggest going to talk to Mr Johnston as he does actually do something about it but its her choice what she does. I just hope it works out for the better whatever happens and that what happens in her lessons don't affect her final GCSE grade.   "Halt, who goes there? BAAAAAAAAAA!" That is a quote from a very amusing true film based on the Apollo 11 mission, the film is called 'The Dish'. It is based in Austraila. We have uiton DVD and I think you guys should watch it someday. Put it this way: "Cliff! You just bulls***ed NASA!". Any film which lies to NASA has got to be funny. And anotehr film whcih is the total opposite of The Dish is Drive Me Crazy which I saw in 1999 with Angela. It is a good teen flick, which such lines as: "Well, I guess it's easy to be a bitch now that Brad's availabe again." "It's easy to be a bitch either way." and "Get drunk, have sex, be free... we're the class of '73!" and of course the great "Son are you stoned?" "Dad, wouldn't the correct question be, son are you ill?" along with ""I'm sorry Dave. I would have drove him home but I dunno how to drive a stick." "C'mon baby I'll teach you how....I got a stick right here!" "I meant a real car Eddie not a Matchbox!". HOW AMUSING!!!!!
