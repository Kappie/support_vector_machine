Dad and I are gonna try to go to this coffee house that he thinks that they have an open-mike poerty readings. I hope so.. I use to do that before I met Ms. Slut! I took her once and she didn't like it, so that was the last time I went.. or allowed to go... To this day I am amazed on how much she controled me. I belivie in being a gentelman, but she walked over me... Like closing doors in my face. At least 3-6 times a month she would "not see me" and shut the door as I was tring to go through it! Whatever...  Sorry for rambeling about Erin, but I have a bad feeling that I will... Well hey at least I will get it off my chest.. of I think so.  I am thinking about adding a writings Blog to this... what ya'll think?  Humm maybe I will see if I can add a poll question to this site.. that would be cool!  Oh once I find a decent place to host a pic of me I will post it!  Well that is that for this post..  Lates!  Joe or Fred! let me know what ya'll think!
