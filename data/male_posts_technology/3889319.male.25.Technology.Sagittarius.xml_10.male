We had a long conversation on the phone some minutes ago, and i could feel her sorrow.. She was melancholic. She is a joyful full of life person, she makes me laugh every time i'm sad. She loves me immensely. It's hard for me too, i care a lot for her, she is an amazing person. Oh shut up.. i'm talking as if she is gone forever. She'll be back on Saturday night.
