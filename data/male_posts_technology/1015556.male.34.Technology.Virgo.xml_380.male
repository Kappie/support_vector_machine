Meaning that missions should not destroy the culture, but try to provide spiritual leadership, at some point, from within the culture.  I think the same thing applies to youth culture.  Most of you probably sense it quite often - students need to own the ministry.  You can (fill in the blank here - lead a talk, invite some kids, run a small group, etc.) and you will draw X number of kids.  Have a student help you or own it, and they will draw X*X number of kids.  Someone told me that the Univ of MD has the most Chinese foreign students in the US.  Their point was that if a person had a heart for Chinese, they should do ministry to the students at U of MD, for one student there could reach multitudes more Chinese than they ever could. It's one paradigm thats important with SPACE.  Here are two quick things I'm doing: - asked one Senior to write some devotionals for a middle school trip. - hoping a Junior will come on the middle school and do worship for me. I think both of these ideas have the indigenous concept as well as having older kids involved with the vision reach out with projects to the younger kids, forming more of that momentum.
