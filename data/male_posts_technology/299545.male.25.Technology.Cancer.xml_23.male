The House of God is a book that Ryan recommended to me, a surprisingly realistic (maybe) and cynical (definitely) look at 6 interns' from the "Best Medical School" at "The House of God." (i.e. Harvard and Beth Israel). Up next is a book called "Arab and Jew" by David Shipler, and some of Jeff Shaara's Civil War books.
