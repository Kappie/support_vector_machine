 I watched this "incident" live and didn't think anything of it.  Apparently, Kimmel really ticked some people off in Detroit saying that he didn't want them to win because it isn't worth seeing the fans burn the city (I'm paraphrasing).  His reply is classic:
 
  "What I said about Pistons fans during halftime was a joke, nothing more. If I offended anyone, I'm sorry.  Clearly, over the past 10 years, we in L.A. have taken a commanding lead in post-game riots. If the Lakers win, I plan to overturn my own car."  -- Jimmy Kimmel
