I played tennis last night and today my legs are killing me -- which is great since I'm riding the mountain bike this afternoon.  Sore legs make for fun hill climbs.
 
 Speaking of mountain biking, I read a great  urlLink article  in  urlLink National Geographic Adventure magazine  last night.  Apparently, I lived an hour away from "Little Switzerland" when I was in  urlLink college .  I really wish I had known about these places while I was there.  They would have made for fantastic pledge rolls or even day hiking trips.
