The blogs I write here will mainly focus on the problems I see at work (and am trying to fix) and the good things I see at work that I want to write about for future reference.  I don't have any expectations for this blog besides personal use (I have a bad memory, so writting my thoughts down helps me remember them later).  However, if I write an astoundingly good blog, I might rewrite it as an article and submit it to a web site or magazine.  Who knows?
