Equations are the easy part, then the trouble starts with essay questions. luckily the one short answer part was pretty easy to answer if you read the book a little. I look forward to having a masters degree, but I have to wait until the end of next year :-( I will proofread the test today at work and post it. Then, go to Front Page bar to celebrate tonight.      I have come to realize that my short term memory is kind of bad. I have hidden my cigarettes from me somewherez in the apartment (I already searched my car). The point was to not have them accessible until I went out drinkin'. But, if I put them away and do it quickly... I actually don't remember where I put them! This is stupid of course, but it bugs me that there is half a pack somewhere and I am not sure where. I have places where I usually put them, but it isn't in any of those places. MAkes me wish my memory was better. Maybe I should take more ginko biloba. It is probably the drinking or those drugs I did which is to blame! yeah, that's why i don't do you drugs anymore! damn you! But not you beer, how could I ever get mad at lil old beer? Damn, you have alcohol too! Well shit, one vice is making me blame the others. This is getting rediculous... I might post more later. Maybe about that new stupid fire drill procedure we got yesterday.
