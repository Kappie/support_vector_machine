Spiderman is supposed to be a Superhero and superhero never say these kind of words. He is supoosed to be   "Man of Steel".    Even James Bond never shows that he "Bleeds". Why Spiderman ?  Is it just that he is more human, or is it something else the creator of the Spiderman wanna to convey.  Anyways think about it....   Why Spiderman being a Superhero said this ?    ...
