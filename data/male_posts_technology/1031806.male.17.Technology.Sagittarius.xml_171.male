Another great country song:     What The World Needs - Wynonna Judd    I look around at all the faces and I see All the lonely people looking back at me Rich,poor don't matter we're all the same Everybody's hungry in a different way We're clawing and climbing and kicking and screaming And fighting but really  What the world needs now is love Love and only love A little help from up above A way to make a better day Let's come together lay our difference down Spread it all around That's what the world needs now  La da la da da  Sometimes all it takes is just a smile To change somebody's weather chase the clouds out of the sky Sometimes you got to give and not receive Sometimes you got to live what you believe Open your arm's 'cause that's where it starts Right here with you and me  What the world needs now is love Love and only love A little help from up above A way to make a better day Let's come together lay our difference down Spread it all around That's what the world needs now  Nobody likes the cold We all need someone to hold No one wants to be alone  What the world needs now is love Love and only love A little help from up above A way to make a better day Let's come together lay our difference down Spread it all around (That's what the world needs now)  What the world needs now (What the world needs now is love) (Love and only love) Love and only love (A little help from up above) (A way to make a better day) Let's come together lay our prejudices down
