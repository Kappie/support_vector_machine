If they can develop this degree of resolution for imaging macro-scale objects such as a living human brain, then non-destructive  urlLink uploading  of an emulation of oneself becomes much more possible.  If molecular nanotechnology allows precise reconstruction of a physical brain from such a template, then we can take backups of ourselves and/or spawn exact reproductions (no more of this messy mixing of gametes).
