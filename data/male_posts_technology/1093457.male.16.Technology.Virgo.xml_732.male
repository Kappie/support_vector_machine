Today I am nipping over to Jennys to say hi and then I am going to the park to meet some friends. Then tomorrow I am going to the park to see you guys! Yay!It's way too hot though. I may come down an hour or two latebecause I don't fancy wandering about at midday when its at its hottest. Hmm. I will decide tonight. Tom, you should be very impressed with me. I have entered a thought for every single day minus one on THINK. (Link above)  You and Max both forgot yesterday. Tutt tutt. I am the champion. LOL.
