Here they are:       Impressive no? Hahaha well maybe not, but I was still impressed. In other news, I had a full set of physical examinations today to see if I'm qualified for West Point (the college I'm trying to get into). The high point of that was probably when the doctor was finishing the *cough* *cough* hernia check, he told to me bend over, and I swear to god my life flashed before my eyes. Luckily for me, the doc had been doing the hernia exam without gloves(eeew), so he passed on the rectal examination(I have no idea what he was actually looking for back there). I have to give my guardian angel props for that one. Other exciting events of the day include finally getting my laptop back from repair. Unfortunately though, the genius's down at the repair facility forgot to fedex the power adapter with the laptop, so all I have is one battery charge before its useless again. I called them up and gave them a piece of my mind, so hopefully they get on the stick and next-day air that sucker up to me tomorrow. Until then, I'm out!
