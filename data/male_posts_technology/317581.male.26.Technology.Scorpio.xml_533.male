I've always thought that women would be the ones that would fall in love more often, but it seems that my circle of friends is the exactly opposite. I've found that it's mostly girls that would rather not be under the commitments of a relationship.=, where most men I know would rather be in a committed relationship than a string of one night stands.   It seems that I read a book recently, Tao of Pooh or Te of piglet? Where the author was explaining how women are no longer treated like ladies because the womens rights movement sought to do away with any mistreatment of women. I don't know why I mention it, but it seems that women are more like the men of yesteryear, and men are the sensitive guys that women always said they wanted, but didn't really.  I'm sitting here lost in a sea of uncertainty- Tim
