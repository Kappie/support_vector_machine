The  UGC  has mae it compulsory for faculties to pass either  SLET / NET . Wonderful. But where are those bright graduates, the future architects of India?  I can agree with the later part of the article - IITs being the only advanced educational model. There may be other models, like CEDs for example. But I feel that the refinement of the education model has to be from the grassroot level. There is no use trying to improve only the  creme de la creme .   We have been following a mish-mash of education patterns, some practices handed down by tradition and some copied from other influences. The education system should be more life-oriented, i.e. more education that would be useful practically need to be taught. I am not advocating total westernisation of education, but instead a ecletic adoption of best educational practices . I believe there is one such school somewhere in Chennai. I don't know its name. But the education system followed sounded good. Students studying there might not go on to be engineers or doctors, but they can handle the challenges of life more comfortably than thier peers in professional streams.  BTW, western institutions have become great institutions over the years because the sense of 'alma mater' was high among the students. The students did thier best to build up the institution that had taught them, through whatever means they could, from monetary funds to physical labour. Somehow, I find that sense of giving back is mostly missing in our country.  That could be a reason why the IITs (no, the entire education sector) looks hoary.The final words, "educators and lay people would consider India's future educational needs", is the point that one should ponder upon from the article.   All said and done,  it is interesting why this issue has come up with the elections just round the corner? Maybe this speech by Joshi is slated to appear in the election agenda? Maybe someone really cares... Maybe...  Kicha, Thanks for sending the article by mail.
