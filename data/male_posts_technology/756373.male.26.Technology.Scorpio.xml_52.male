We'll be mounting that sucker in my PC case tonight, or sometime this week or this weekend. It's a monster of a fan. I'll have to run it directly off mains instead of off 12V PSU supply. We're gonna put a little rocker switch on the case someplace, and wire it directly to the 220V power out plug on the back of the PSU. I don't know how much air that thing pushes, but it must be a LOT. Funny how we do these things not because they're strictly necessarry (my CPU runs within operational temperature limits), but because we can. Oh and to show off. Yessir. I want to go to the next lan and see guys' eyes pop out their heads when they see the size of that fan stuck in the side of my case. God, sound like a 12 year old , but hey, I guess comparing metaphorical penis size is just part of being male.
