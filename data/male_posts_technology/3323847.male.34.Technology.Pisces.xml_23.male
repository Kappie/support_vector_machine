It's a type of commentary site, coming from the tongue-in-cheek "I'm right, you're wrong" point of view.  I don't find Maddox to be particularily hilarious all that often, but his web site is highly original, and I totally applaud him for that.  These days with people just "towing the party line", it's refreshing to see someone willing to dance to the tune of a different drummer. :)  P.S. If you tend to take things too seriously, I'd recommend against going to that site.  Let me say that if you can stomach South Park, you can stomach Maddox.  See: " urlLink Tongue in cheek ".
