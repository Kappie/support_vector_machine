It is a very good opportunity to raise high (Grow with the growing organisation)... Do well, All the best...  hmm! open for discussion any time.  yeah, ur link about PGSM @ IIMB, I am already aware of.. and thanks for remembrance... but not now!!! Any plans for you?  Ofcourse Kicha is right.. but moving as per the standards is quite difficult.. after proj. delivery for the sake of maintaining the level one completes the process on time b4 the actual Audit... (ha ha ha)  Anyway its really really helpful during future review...!!! :)  Cheers
