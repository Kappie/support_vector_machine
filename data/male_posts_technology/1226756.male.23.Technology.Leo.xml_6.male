The only dissapointing thing was: on the floor, the bug didn't move. When I lifted it off the floor, the motors spun like crazy, on the floor... Nothing. I guess not enough torque in the motors, but the motors are quite powerful. I have sent a message to ozkal, who built the simpleBUG, asking for advice. He's online right now (10:57 GMT+1 08.06.2004), so I hope to get an answer soon. Will post update. I have also started the work on my web-site, and will redesign the whole thing. Articles, images and I hope translated (and maybe new) tutorials will be on the site.
