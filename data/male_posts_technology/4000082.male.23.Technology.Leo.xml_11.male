I have noticed people of three categories when they are waiting.    Either:   A) You wait...alone.   B) You wait...with two people ( you and your friend )   C) You wait...with your group.   Let us look at their behaviour and state of mind:  Case A  :       In this case you wait for an event to happen...like arrival of the bus or the Lift to come to your floor.  Remember there is also a factor of space here. In the bus stop you have a large space and in the Lift a small one.   Large Space: (Bus Stop)  When you are in the bus stop, have you noticed these chain of reactions:  1) You first look left and right...and see whether the bus comes. 2) Then you look at your watch...to show you are a busy person. 3) ...you look at your belongings...fumble ( at this time people start noticing you ) 4) ...you scan all the people who are also waiting. 5) ...you look up and down. 6) ...Now since its a large space...you have many interesting things to gaze upon...like     you start noticing all the vehicles that go by, Maybe you look at a shop and see what they are   upto. 7) ...Now its already 5 minutes and you shake your head for showing others that you are annoyed and  convincing them that you are a very busy person ;-) 8) ...You may draw patterns in the ground with your shoe. 9) ...you massage you face or eyes. 10...Some people cleverly read a book and forget all the steps mentioned above.   Small Space: (Lift)  Well now since the space is small, you have to do something.  Suppose your floor is the 30th or something...now that's a looong way.  1) People usually stare at the Floor number display which changes rapidly. 2) ...you may also look down or fumble with your pocket. 3) ...you may also look at your watch and show everybody your new watch ;-) 4) ...Some people watch others what they are doing. 5) ...you may read the warning or message board in the lift without even missing a single sentence. 6) ...Some pray god their floor should come fast to save them from this boredom.   Case B:   Differs when two people are in this category. In both case you may end up talking like crazy...in the bus stop you may talk about a known subjectbut in the lift you may blabber since everybody is hearing your conversation...you might also talk about the party you attended last sunday...which your friend may be least interested in.  But the hours go fast and Abracadabra here the bus arrives.   Case C:    This is a bit complicated since it depends on the group you are in.  If you are in a very talkative group...the hours will be like minutes and you might think the bus should have been more late. But if you are left alone in th group and you end up laughing (forcefully) at other's jokes then you must refer Case A...you go back to square one and minutes will feel like hours.  Anyway some crazy thought I documented...Hope your minutes did not turn into lightyears ;-)
