As a teen, I did try a few cigarettes under peer pressure, but only as in the Bill Clinton "didn't inhale" style. Tonight, I ran into my first new experience with tobacco in many a year.   After work, I sometimes go to a pool hall where I will play a few games and talk to people. Tonight, after a few games, the people I were with pulled out a small can and began doing their ritual of pouring two spots of powder onto the back of their hands. This powder was snuff. I have seen them do it before, but have refused to take part in it before. Before, I could say anygthing, somebody had already poured it onto the back of my hand and I realized I was in this round. Oh well..I have always learned, as was the case with alcohol, if you just do it once, people will get their kick watching you do it and then will leave you alone. So I decided to do the snort and just get it over with.  To my surprise, it was nothing like tobacco, but rather more like a "Fisherman's Friend" backed up into your nose or a Vick's inhaler. Very strong methol rush. I even agreed to one more later in the evening. Hopefully, I am not addicted ;)  As for web links, I won't bore you with details, but a few that I visit regularly include   urlLink http://www.google.com - I like the news summaries here as there is always more than one version of the story.   urlLink http://www.cnn.com - A fast roundup of the news, but usually they have a headline dealing with Iraq which is a real turnoff to me.   urlLink http://www.cinescape.com - A sci fi /fantasy movie and tv website done by the publishers of the magazine of the same name.   urlLink http://www.trektoday.com - A daily roundup of all the latest Star Trek news.  Nothing too much more interesting to post!
