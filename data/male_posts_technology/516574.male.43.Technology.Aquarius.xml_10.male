You are allowed to choose one celebrity date for each night of the week and one alternate for each night, in case your first choice dream date is, say, arrested or is away on location. The remainder of the rules are as follows:    1) The definition of "celebrity" varies according to the group with whom you're playing. Basically, everyone in the group needs to be able to pick your choices out of a police line-up.  2) No time-traveling. [You might] like to date Paul Newman, circa  Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , but that's against the rules. Everyone you date, you date  right now .  3) It doesn't matter if you and your friends all have George Clooney as your Saturday night. This is bound to happen and it's fair within the rules of the game: having to cross check your schedule with your friends will add a level of difficulty to this game that you don't need. It's hard enough to decide whether So and So is a Tuesday or a Wednesday without having to make an Excel spreadsheet to make sure you're not stepping on your officemate's toes. You'll see.   4) You can't use, say, "the cast of  Band of Brothers " as one night.  One man or woman per night. Nice try, though.   AND NOW, MY CHOICES:    SUNDAY  First choice:  urlLink Lindsay Lohan  Alternate:  urlLink Jennifer   urlLink Love   urlLink Hewitt    MONDAY  First choice:  urlLink Michelle   urlLink Branch  Alternate:  urlLink Chelsea Clinton    TUESDAY  First choice:  urlLink Melissa Etheridge  Alternate:  urlLink Portia de Rossi    WEDNESDAY  First choice:  urlLink Katie Couric  Alternate:  urlLink Kelly Ripa    THURSDAY  First choice:  urlLink Reba McEntire   Alternate:  urlLink Ashley Judd    FRIDAY  First choice: the WWE's own  urlLink Stephanie McMahon  Alternate:  urlLink Carmen Electra    SATURDAY  First choice:  Survivor 's  urlLink Jerri Manthey  Alternate: 80's pop princess  urlLink Tiffany  (still have that  Playboy  issue, yes I do...)  THE BULLPEN:  urlLink Catherine Zeta-Jones ,  urlLink Madonna ,  urlLink Kelly Osbourne ,  urlLink Sharon Osbourne  (most every *other* TV mother-daughter tag-team [now *there's* another list idea...]that came to mind for inclusion here would've also required some time travel [usually in addition to some interdimensional shifting, but let's save that for the fanfic, shall we?...]),  urlLink Misty Mundae  (link probably NSFW),  urlLink Emma Watson  (which would probably be a lot less creepy if for the purposes of this list I could consider time-traveling a 20-years-younger self 5 years into the future, but oh well...), a host of additional country singers left off mostly due to consideration of rule #1 -- and of course there were a number of others who were considered that, given slightly different constraints (or a different week, or a different breakfast...), might have made this list as well...
