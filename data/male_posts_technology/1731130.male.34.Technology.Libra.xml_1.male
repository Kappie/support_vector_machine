I devoured all Wells works and amongst his great works (Invisible Man, War of the Worlds, Time Machine etc) and his "wierdo" stuff on utopian politics and peace on earth, there are a couple of lesser-known gems. I would recommend:   The First Men on the Moon.  Certainly not the greatest technological foresight but definitiely colourful and well-written. As well as an excellent story, I found it very revealing that not all Wells' predictions were accurate (or even plausible): hindsight is a terrible thing.   The Sleeper Awakes.  This book has a fantastic premise: A man falls into a coma, when he wakes up centuries later he discoveres his modest finances (having been invested by his estate over hundreds upon hundreds of years) has grown to make him the richest, most powerful man in the world. Wouldn't that be great? Well, not according to the book it wouldn't.  Other classics you might like to try is Conan Doyle's The Lost Continent and The Poison Belt. Both very good (if underrated) science fiction yarns from the creater of Sherlock Holmes.  Link:  Project Gutenberg
