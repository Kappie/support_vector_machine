My little bro-ham David (the famous renasance painter) has packed his pipe, and headed north to the  urlLink Colorado State University .  Damn....used to wipe ointment on his nuts whilst changing his diapers, and now hez all growz up.....   Random side note.....  As if the smell of baby powder lingering in your mind isn't enough to make you feel like an old geezer....try going for a run on a Monday...that'll make you feel pretty fucken old too man.
