They were from two of the clan members.   urlLink Kilikina  and  urlLink Sapphire .    Yeah, real live girl gamers that commented on my blog.  Wheee....hehe.  Anyways, here's a little update on my stats and progression in Team Survival for Rainbow Six 3 on XBOX Live  This is Cummulative  Rank    Gamertag      ELO    Kills Deaths Playing Time 28499   mikeloxlong   1098   812   1181   21:58:00    Monthly  Rank    Gamertag      ELO    Kills Deaths Playing Time 17400   mikeloxlong   1043   387   471    08:34:00    Weekly  Rank    Gamertag      ELO    Kills Deaths Playing Time 14097   mikeloxlong   1041   103   117    02:08:00  As I said, in the beginning, I had no idea how to play, I didn't know where the spawns where nor did I know what the hell they were talking about "box room" for or the layout of the maps (Trainyard, Carnival etc.).  I also didn't know where most of the points of entry are and where good sniping positions would be located.  Besides that my roommate likes to play sharpshooter where they are just out to kill everyone and with that, my deaths clib because he doesn't play a whole lot.  Now with that said, I played much more and am more familiar with the guns, the maps, how people play (i.e. where they would throw grenades, rushing etc.).  I'm still not good but I try to be as competitive as I can.  There are a few good people on my friends list and everytime I get an invite from them I am weary to join their game bcause I know they are probably playing with good people.  I still join it anyways to learn as much as possible.  Ted, you really need to get a computer.  After that, get freakin DSL since you already have "The Dish"  Then let's fucking tear it up in RS3.  Sam, stay at your job so you can finally get cable and broadband and then get XBOX Live.  It'll be one brotha.  Derek needs to get broadband and XBOX Live.  You all should have that shit in time for HALO 2.  Here are the stats with the guys that play with (monthly stats)  Rank    Gamertag    ELO   Kills Deaths Playing Time  80317   BLADE1000       781   180   396    06:03:00 33610   JMV 624         990   585   968    18:24:00 62920   Zerro G         908     3    14    00:14:00     58283   Four Runner     924    89   100    02:13:00   15257   BiggerGunz     1054    80    53    01:42:00   49547   WarMoose77      951   183   248    05:48:00 78376   TheProduct23    813    65   136    03:09:00     39078   Silversable x   977   269   321    04:23:00   17400   mikeloxlong    1043   387   471    08:34:00  Yeah, not that good but getting better.  That's it for now.  Lunch time (late lunch here in Chicago (3 PM)
