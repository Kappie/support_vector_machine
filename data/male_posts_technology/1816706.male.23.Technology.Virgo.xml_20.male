It is a narrow road and the speed limit is pretty slow, so it takes some time to get there, but if you wake up early and give yourself plenty of time it is well worth it.  We stopped at a little pullover in Hana to get some fish on a stick, which was quite fabulous, they also have some fresh fruits and other souvenirs there.  After that we headed for some red sand beaches next to a school and a baseball field in Hana.  The beach was really nice and had some nice views, plus itâ€™s kind of cool to see red sand, we did encounter a little bit of rain which is kind of normal for that side of the island.  Next we headed up the road a little further to a national park where the 7 sacred pools are.  This is quite a famous attraction.  The name is a little misleading as there are not exactly 7 pools, and all the water in Hawaii is sacred, but it is a beautiful place none the less.  If you go down to some of the pools towards the ocean it is very touristy, but you can get your pictures or whatever you want.  We opted to go away from the shore and take a nice hike, probably about 4 miles to a beautiful water fall in the middle of the jungle.  The hike to the falls was nice because you see some more of the sacred pools on the way as well as hike through a very nice bamboo forest.  On the way back we took a swim in some of the pools and swam upstream a little bit where we did some cliff jumping into the water and some people swung from some vines.  It was pretty cool.  Lastly we hit up some black sand beaches and caves.  There are some small fresh water caves to one side of the park and at the other side at the ocean is the black sand beach.  Again, it was a little rainy, but still made for a nice day, the beaches were really nice and quite a spectacular view, as the pictures will show.
