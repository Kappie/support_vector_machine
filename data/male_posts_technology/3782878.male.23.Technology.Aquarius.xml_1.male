Being only my 3rd season I began to wander and eventually found myself once again outside the city walls. Having recently been captured I made my way cautiously into the land of Kunark. As I wandered I came upon a stone book mounted upon a pedastal and as I touched I was whisked way to an unknown land.  Fear is the strength of the Iksar thus I did not fear but I was still startled by all the noise and ... the Softskins! They were everywhere! Having the memory of the teachery of those first softskins to land on Kunark I was terrified but then I saw a familiar face. Deltree, The Great Feral Lord, basking in the sun in his alabaster robe.  As I approached the great lord he turned to address me, me a young broodling without anything but a dagger, and invited me to join the estemed guild Call of Honour. I immediately accepted having heard many of the exploits of this great guild and being aware of how selective they were of their members. Deltree then blessed me with the best spells my young form could take and I commenced my hunt.  During my time in this land, which I learned was called the Plane of Knowledge, I heard of a place called Crushbone on the continent Faydwer and of the vile orcs that live there. Appearently they were mounting an attack on the elves in the woods of Faydark. Now not that I care anything of the elves the thought of battle excited me and I traveled to the woods of Greater Faydark. It was here the next six seasons passed slaughtering endless patrols and camps of orcs. As my ninth season drew to a close I learned that another of my siblings had hatched so I raced back to Cabilis to greet my new sister and to show my guildmasters I was ready to receive training in the arts of healing and enhancment and receive my first Scaled Wolf.   Shasthis Ironscale Norrath is mine for the taking stay out of my way and you shall live ... for a time
