He has been making home copies of T.V. programs, singles from cassettes and CDs. He even gives these compilations out to his friends, but he never charges money, not even the cost of the media he puts it on.  I think a quote from him pretty much sums it all up:    When I buy a CD or a DVD, that content should be wholly mine to do with as I please as long as I am in no way selling its contents or profiting from it. ... Present law is predicated on the assumption that consumers will rip-off copyright holders. The vast majority are innocent of that assumption, but all are treated as guilty.     -intX    keepin' it real in the 'hood
