I just got back from my school's annual Fall retreat to Winema, a Christian campground on the beach. This Winema was one of many firsts for me: It was the first one I've been to as a junior. it was the first time I've been there and not climbed on, or even seen for that matter, the 60 foot tall rock on the shoreline that everyone loves. It's the first time I've felt God lead me not to get into the worship, it's the first time I've hung out with... almost every group of people for an extended period of time. It's the first time I've felt unwanted by the class above me (if only for a short while) and it's also the first time I've ever missed someone so much who was there with us the entire time.  Sometimes firsts are good, and other times...  Goodnight ... may we all die restfully in our sleep that we may escape this world and all its grief.
