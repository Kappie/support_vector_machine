For the last few hours we have also been receiving uncorroborated anecdotal evidence from reliable sources that a working worm is being trialled on the Internet, in preparation for imminent release. The primary concern is that this flaw affects unpatched SSL enabled IIS servers, which could potentially be thousands of hosts."
