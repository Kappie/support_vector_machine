We should've seen this coming We should've seen this... YEAH! YEAH!  [Chorus x2] This wasted so many nights and again I've wasted so much time on a friend Too young, too proud to understand So this is the end  YEAH! This is the END!   The last couple days have been awesome! Partying non-stop... On the 1st, Spiderman at the Redshaw's house then Spiderman II at the theater (good movie btw, I'm never watching the first one by itself again), then afterward back to the Redshaw's, then to Wendy's. And yeah Darren, the people sitting beside us were prolly confused as heck... ROFL ... Good times, good times. Anyway, after eating, a firework at the Redshaw's again then off to their youth group (short but fun). Still after, walking all over the place, hanging out with Tye, who I've not seen in years (at least I think...) and then finally blowing up a big firework in front of Matt R's unsuspecting house somewhere close to 11.  Then on the 2nd... Getting to summer school late, staying until 2, giving Kat a ride to Neil's house... playing pool and badminton for a while, then picking up Steven from his work and getting over to Adri's house past 5:30. Basically everyone from our circle of friends at school was there save Gwen who happened to have left for a couple-week long mission trip the same morning. We sneaked into the garage and surprised them by coming in through the back of the house... that was great fun. At some point we were messing around outside and someone stuck Adri in a compost recycling bin (ensuing chaos and funness... like the owners of the bin coming out of their house and us fleeing, and the girls getting into a water fight which led to them getting into the hot tub in the back). Josh and I went back to our houses and got several swimsuits, and we and Steven joined them. Then pizza and the fireworks....   HAHAHAHA... that was great too; I constructed a petebomb that had an actual piccolo pete as the igniter... Everyone had been warned to stay back and cover their ears - it would be loud, but the fuse took a while to work so when the peter finally caught they started to relax and think that that was the only thing going to happen... hehe, like I planned it. *evil grin* Then, without warning, BOOM the thing blew up and the entire cul-de-sac (spl?) was filled with little crackling fireballs. LOL that was so funny.  After this, Steven, Josh, Darren, and I came up to my house quickly (kinda...) to make a couple more bomb-style fireworks which we eventually lit off in the LDS stakehouse parking lot later by ourselves (the plan was for everyone else to come after we'd set it up and watch, but Adri's mom wouldn't let them. It was huge... we attached three 'normal-sized' bombs together.  We took Josh and Josiah back home less than a minute before their curfew and headed back to Adri's where we found a disgruntled crowd amiss at not having witnessed the big firework... so we took a walk all the way to Josh's house (but didn't go in... his dad didn't want him up... then continued to our English teacher's house outside of which we set and talked for a while and finally headed home and found Rachel, Jen and Mandy in the hot tub.  At this point, Steven and I were the only guys left and we didn't feel like leaving so ... er, we didn't (lol). I eventually got back into the hot tub only to get right back out again to go back up to my house to grab my glasses, contacts kit and chargers / batteries for both cameras and my phone (which everyone had killed by talking to Josh for over an hour - lol).   We just hung out and watched movies until like 7 or 8am when some people went back over to pick up Josh and Josiah again. Steven had to be at Sarah's at noon, and hadn't packed yet so I took him home shortly there after, and went back to my house and crashed around 9... Thus ending yet another co-ed sleepover. (lol)   I woke up past 6pm, took a shower, left, got gas, and arrived at Peter's in Forest Grove close to 9. Everyone just got back from an hour of warwalking a few minutes after, so I came at a good time. We spent a couple hours constructing and setting off fireworks... we got pretty crazy t'word the end... just dumping everything we could get out hands on into cinderblocks and throwing lit fireworks into them... hehe  *I wonder if the sparkler writing's still on the ground...*  I finally left past close to 2am and decided that I was going to do that speed test of my car right then and there... was tired of trying to set up a time for people to film me doing it. ;) But... after passing the second police car and encountering a lot of traffic on highway 8 before I even got to the section I was going to test on, I decided to call it off. I made up for it though by going 90mph on Rosedale and 110mph on 175th. :D ... That was great fun.  I'm sitting at home writing this right now, getting ready to head over to the Neff's for yet another evening of fun and fireworks...  I've got pictures of the last several days and I'm working on compressing the video I shot so I can get it up on my server... those will be up within a couple days pending the approval of everyone [read: the girls] who was at the sleepover that might be finnicky about it.  Bye everyone, cya ya'll soon enough~
