We talked a little but not about a whole lot.  Just nice 4 year old chit chat.    I finally asked her if she wanted me to call her later.  She said yes but if I am not here leave me a message daddy.  Well I did just that and at 10 pm I received a call from Karissa and she told me how she spent the day at Sarah's and how there were a bunch of kids there.  Today being Tuesday and the day before school starts it kind of makes me wonder if she is really visiting Sarah who works as a nurse or if she is going to some kind of day care or something while   SFW   does whatever or whomever in search of money for her attorney fees.  Regardless talking to Karissa lately has been extremely pleasant and a lot of fun.
