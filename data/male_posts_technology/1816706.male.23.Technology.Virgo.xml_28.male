You know, little things, like getting a place to live, getting a cell phone, getting a car, getting insurance, blah blah blah, it's like there is no end in site.  And so then all those headaches come back with it, the car isn't working right, so I have to pay to get that fixed, the cell phone wasn't working at all, so i have to go hassle with them, car insurance was a snap, way to go Geico!  And that's what sucks the most is having to deal with "crap" for lack of a better word.  Just little things, annoiances (sp.)  The flipside to this coin, and what really keeps me from being upset at all about it, is there are some huge ass waves just waiting for me to go swim in just as soon as I get off work, then there are drinks to be had at the hostel and people to meet.
