    
       So i'm walking down the street in King's Cross, heading towards my training centre. On the side of the road is a huge van, with "POLICE HORSES" written on the side. It's parked outside a dodgy looking house. I start imagining a team of elite SWAT horses, running around on hind legs with bullet proof vests and MP5's, about to storm a crack house. I start grinning and a policeman walks out past me, giving me a really evil look like i'm hiding a recent bank robbery or something.  Apart from that, the course is going great. Server and Professional exams on Wednesday and Active Directory on Friday. Scary, but bring it on..
