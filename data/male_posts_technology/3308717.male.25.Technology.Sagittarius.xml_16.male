I was back in my old neighborhood where I grew up and was at my neighbors house. Somehow I had my left forearm replaced with a synthetic/mechanical arm. It must have been a new addition because there were still stitches and it was sore. I also had a remote controled truck of some kind. It was a full sized vehicle but I could controle it with an arm mounted remote, kinda like K.I.T. needless to say it was pretty fucking rad. Pretty fucking rad that is, until my friend started messing with the controls and it crashed into another neighbors house and took out part of a wall. I back the vehicle up into a garage and closed it and we ran inside before anyone noticed.  Once inside it was like our old neighborhood get-togethers. All of our parents were there, the grill was going and it seemed like a good time. The next thing I remember was that I was lost in a strange house that had a T.V. in every room, I was trying each one, looking for anything except static, I think the static was causing my robotic arm to act up and I couldn't control it efficiently.  I think this is where I woke up. I know there was more to the dream but I just can't remember it. It's strange, I have been having very vivid and outright strange dreams the past week or so and I rather enjoy it.  In other news, I have decided on the topic for my research paper. I am going to write about the downfalls of the DMCA. It is an argumentive essay so I will be arguing that the DMCA does more harm than good and that it should be drasticly altered or done away with. Depending upon how it comes out I might look at publishing it. Also, if I enjoy writing this essay as much as I believe I will, I think I might write another on the problems with the Patriot Act and how it steps on the rights of individuals.  On a scientific note, I'de like to point you to  urlLink this article  I saw on slashdot about David Deutsch's experiment which, as he describes it, shows proof of a parallel universe. He also gives instructions on how you can test this at home with a laser pointer, a pin and a piece of white paper.  The parallel universe he describes sounds like some evil, negative, shadow universe where an exact copy of yourself exists, except with an opposite moral allignment. If you ask me, I think that's pretty bad-ass. I would caution against taking this article for fact though. I might take some time and do some more research about this, though I have done a lot of reading and research on quantumn theory and what he is proposing does, actually, make some sense.    -intX    randome phrase
