Abey C is a new character I've drawn for this book idea 'Learn The Alphabet.' A slightly darker look at the alphabet. I will soon be doing more of these in hope to get a line published. Abey's 123 Book, Abey's Colours, Abey's Shapes, etc. So between this  urlLink one  and the previous one's we've featured  urlLink here ,  urlLink http://newlinks.blogspot.com/2004/03/movie-alphabet-game.html">here ,  urlLink here  and  urlLink here  you've got no excuse not to be learning.   via  urlLink Hal's Stoopid Links
