Somehow, when I was contemplating breaking in to the whole mountain biking hobby thing, I didn't think it would be a death defying sport where I'd be constantly worried for my life.  I didn't see the steep sandy downhills over steps, roots, rocks and logs in the brochure.  In fact, I think I missed the brochure entirely.  No, I pictured myself riding through the woods, communing with Wally the woodchuck and Mitch the muskrat, stopping occasionally to listen to the whisper of the wind through the trees or find pictures in the clouds slowly drifting overhead.  
 
 Boy was I wrong.  Stillwell gave me my first spectacular over-the-handlebars wreck this morning.  I don't know who built this one black diamond section on this trail but it is rediculously difficult.  Somehow I came off a hill with a little jump and managed to plant my front wheel sideways.  If you've ever ridden a bike, or seen a wheel for that matter, you should know that wheels roll front to back better than they slide side to side.  So naturally my bike decides to stop in its tracks which was news to my body as I did a superman over the handlebars and landed in spectacular fashion on my head and shoulders.  Thankfully it rained a little yesterday so the ground had a nice cushy give as I collapsed in a heap in the middle of the trail.  But I carried on.  I picked myself up, gathered my dignity, gave Wally and Mitch the finger and rode on.  Until next time, Stillwell.
