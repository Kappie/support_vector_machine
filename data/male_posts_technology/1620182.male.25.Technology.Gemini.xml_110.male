 I got back from my Memorial Day weekend trip last night.  I would have been back sooner, but I was trapped by the same storms that spawned 90+ tornados the day before in the Midwest.  This weekend followed immediately on the heels of my trip to Vegas.  And by immediately, I mean less than 12 hours after I arrived in NY, I was on the road down to VA.  So you can imagine that I'm not too well rested at this point.
 
 Rachael and I headed down to Amar and Connie's house in Raleigh on Friday.  We got there around 2:00am and immediately fell in love with the area.  The most attractive thing about NC is its affordability.  I really want to buy a house down there now because lord knows I can't afford one here or in Northern VA.  
 
 The four of us set out to Wilmington Saturday morning.  We stopped along the way at  urlLink Duplin Winery  -- the largest winery in the south.  This place was amazing.  Not only did they have one of the more comprehensive tours I've ever been on, but they also have a free wine-tasting session where you can sample 12-15 of their muscadine grape based wines.  Good stuff.
 
 After purchasing our fill of wine (they liquored us up), we headed further into Rose Hill, NC to take pictures of the world's largest frying pan.  That's right.  This bad boy uses over 200 gallons of cooking oil to cook over 300 chickens at the annual poultry festival.  I guess they really like fried chicken in NC.  I have pictures if you're interested.
 
 Sunday was supposed to be our day at the beach, so to speak.  Connie, being a west coast baby, had never seen the Atlantic ocean before.  Unfortunately, it rained all morning.  No worries, though.  We're an all-conditions crew, so we went to the beach anyway.  Albeit, we were only there for ten minutes while Connie dipped her toes in the pond.
 
 Later that night we went on a ghost tour of historical Wilmington.  It wasn't all that scary, but the tour lead us through some gorgeous homes and the stories weren't bad either.  The only problem is that Wilmington is a typical southern coastal city.  It was extremely hot and humid and we were perpetually chased by a cloud of mosquitoes.
