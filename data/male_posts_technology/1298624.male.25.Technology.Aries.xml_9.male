All 10 times I got my ass kicked severely and thoroughly by the computer on the EASIEST level. All 10 times I sat there wondering what I did wrong. There has to be something. No way do you go up to a horde of enemies and not stand a fighting chance against them. Then, after the 10th time of losing and getting pissed beyond belief, I went on a hunt to find ANY reason of what I might be doing wrong in this game. I think I may have found it.  According to some Warcraft III strategy websites, there is a process known as micro or micromanagement. Apparently, you are suppose to manage each and every single individual if they come under trouble. Additionally, there's another technique known as "focus fire." This technique allows you to concentrate all your firepower on a single unit in order to kill it faster and get on to the next unit. Now, of course, what I am thinking that goes along with this is Unit Selection and that is where strategy comes in. If you do enact focus fire, which unit will you destroy first? The Hero? Likely, but somehow in my mind, that doesn't seem like the smart thing to do in certain situations. Ranged units? That would be good. I think out of all units, those with the capability to have a ranged attack do the most damage. But still, something in my tells me that just attacking those units would not be effective. Melee Units? Well, maybe. A big maybe. They are the frontline of any force in the game. If you focus fire on one melee unit and keep on destroying their frontline, then their ranged units will kill you instantly.  I've been thinking that maybe separating the ranged and melee units into two separate groups. The idea is two fold really. I'll have control of my range attacks and have more of them (12 per group) and I'll have direct control of my melee units and also have more of them. But the problem there is where the hero will be placed with...the ranged or melee units? Does it matter? I'm also thinking that if I do have ranged and melee units in separate groups...I would be able to fire on the ranged units so the same damage is dealt to that side of the group as I'm doing to the melee enemy group with my own.   It is confusing, to say the least. I never knew this version of Warcraft would be so...intrinsically involved. You must handle each unit differently and must keep watch over the hero at all times, as he is the catalyst that keeps the groups going. The only thing that I'm unsure about right now is the build order. What do I build first? Barracks or Hero spawn? I wish there was a way where I can build both of them at the same time, but then my wood intake would suffer...and if I made more workers to get lumber...I'd run out of available units to train because I would have no one building farms.   What I could do is assign all five first to gold, build four more, one for wood, two for barracks and hero spawn, and another building a farm. After the barracks and hero spawn is built, have one start more harvesting of wood, while the other building a lumber mill. When the farm is built, have that guy start harvesting wood as well. By that time, I'll have to build another worker to build stuff.   Seems like I understand everything...but I have to be more aggressive in my offensive tactics. I see so much more of the enemy than what should seem normal...sometimes I think the computer is cheating. But I think it has to be that way because of the nature of online combat in Battlenet. It's rush to be rushed. I think that's what really turned me off on Warcraft III early on. I hate being rushed to build a base and quickly form a strategy of attack. I hate having no time. But it can't be helped. The computer is not going to wait for you...and neither will a human being *sigh*
