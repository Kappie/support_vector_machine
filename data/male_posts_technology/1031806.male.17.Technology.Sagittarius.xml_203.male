It’s an interesting concept: imagine you're checking someone's blog at school or at work and your teacher / manager / any person you don't want to see the site walks up. With this tool you can simply click a link and immediately go to a website or application of your choice. The link  urlLink    is customizable, via a cookie that you can obtain from Gary (the creator)'s  site . My and Steven's redirection site of choice is  this .
