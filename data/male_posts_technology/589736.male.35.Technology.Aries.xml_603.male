While her tormentors take a break, she finds herself alone in a room with a figure curled under a bloodstained sheet. When Dianna pulls back the sheet, there is a woman who "opens her eyes, and they are light brown in the black and blue of her face. Her teeth appear in the crack of her swollen lips. She is trying to smile. I catch a sob in my throat and gently take her hand. Her breasts have been cut, and maggots are crawling in them." The woman asks Dianna's name, and says "Dianna, be strong." They hold hands. "For what seems like hours, we hold on to each other."    urlLink http://www.salon.com/books/review/2002/11/19/ortiz/index.html
