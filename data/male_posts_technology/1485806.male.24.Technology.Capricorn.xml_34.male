Yes you did not see wrong , a christian channel ...that is mostly targeted at youth and i found a lot of sermons and programs as well as MTV are very inspiring and God focused... For those with StreamyX , this is for you ..I highly recommended it , and I thank God for allowing me to watch it during my work time and i thank God for a wonderful company. The channel is called JCTV (Jesus Christian TV) , found at http://www.jc-tv.net . It have relevant sermons for the youth today. There was this cool show which is called bombshelter.org(which is a real website) , where young people (Christian and non christian ) talked openly about their situtation. Let say today was about forgiveness, the youth will be talkking about their situations, their problem and the youth who have went thru will encourage the person...There is no scripts prepared because this is a very spontaneous.  Before i thought my job was boring ...and there is nothing to do except monitor the servers and fix up computers....but when i found this channel,,this channel actually runs side by side with my company computer...so i 'll found new enthuasiasm to go to work because i am very inspired even while working. Because of this , I am able to send encouragement emails to everyone ..hehehe  So remember to click on watch now at www.jc-tv.net and watch it, Remember you gotta have StreamyX to be able to watch it....so Wai Nyan ...remember to get StreamyX... it is also 24 hours a day...if u can get yourself to a WIFi hotspot...well ..it is that good.
