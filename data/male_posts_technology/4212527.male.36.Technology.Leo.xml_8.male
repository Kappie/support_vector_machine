The Dogfish Head  urlLink  Shelter Pale Ale   that's in my fridge now is very good. It was the first beer I got at  urlLink Oaklyn Discount Liquors , which I would not have thought to go into until my brother recommended it. They have a good selection of craft brews, but I don't know if it's worth having to wait behind a woman buying a case of Molson Ice and a pack  of rolling papers  (apparently the latter being a last second "Ohh... almost forgot" kind of purchase).  What I really liked this summer has been the Smuttynose  urlLink  Old Brown Dog Ale   and the Lancaster  urlLink  Milk Stout  , both of which have gone really well with  urlLink burgers and steaks  . Both beers were purchased at  urlLink Voorhees Discount Liquors , which has more microbrews and (from my experience)  fewer potheads .  I'm still looking for someplace around Philly that sells  urlLink Kennebunkport Brewing Company  beers. They're the beers that turned me into a beer snob ten years ago.  urlLink
