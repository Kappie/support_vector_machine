Sure many of us will blame pop culture, peer pressure, the media, advertsing - whatever. Hell, I am usually the first to bitch about how marketing sells things these days based largely on fiction rather than the actual,real merits of said products. In the old days, products sold themselves. Today, brand consciousness and flat-out lying does. However, last night I was looking through a friend's Magic:The Gathering collection : a collection he is selling off now since he needs the money pretty badly, and I'll tell you this much - I wanted those cards. Not because of marketing , not because they're good cards, not even because they're valuable to the right person. Rather, I wanted those cards because I like Magic:The Gathering. Sure, I could spend that money instead on the newer, more powerful cards. But I really, really  desired  having another Shivan Dragon. Perhaps because Shivan Dragons are pretty good and exceedingly rare, but more likely just because  it's cool . Maybe it was peer pressure that helped create the desire to own it - other Magic players really go 'WOW!' when they find out you own 4 Wrath of God's, for example. Maybe effective marketing made me want it - The WOTC 7th Ed ad-campaign really helped make Serras Angels popular again even though newer decks usually slaughter them. When you come down to it, an expensive, rare card like Shivan Dragon or Serras Angel is nowhere near as good as some dirt cheap uncommons (or even commons like Terminate). Nonetheless it has a 'cool' factor all it's own. It's hard to explain. Moral of this ridiculous tirade? Sometimes it's pretty pointless trying to blame someone else for making you want something. Once you want it, it's game over, and you can only really blame yourself for wanting it. --- Props to Miktar over at ATTYSH for inspiring todays blog.
