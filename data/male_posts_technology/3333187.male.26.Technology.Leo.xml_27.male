Well me self Bubs and Rick where going to see Farenheit 9/11 but had well over two hours to kill. With a running time of about an Hour and a half it was perfect. Weren't expecting much and got so much more. Johnny Knockville is F'in great side kick for the Rock. And the best Anlagen for the Whole film is The Rock uses a Big plank of wood to Wup-ass. THE MAN DUN CARVED'EM A WUPPING STICK!!! The film is cheese but good Cheese.  Farenheit 9/11 is well worth watching... And note to anybody running agents Gorge Bush in the next Election.... Don't waste you money on a flashy party political broadcast. Jim Henson whole crew working 24/7 could not make a bigger Muppet!!
