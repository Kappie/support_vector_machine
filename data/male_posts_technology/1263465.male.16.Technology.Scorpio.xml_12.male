[quote] For those of you who have not yet installed 0.9 of FireFox you might want to backup before you do. Some people have reported cases while upgrading that their systems have locked up, then upon restart it executed an infinate loop sucking all system resources until all of the programs crashed. [/quote]  Some users have had to nuke their HDD because of this.  See this link for more details:  urlLink http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-ports/2003-April/000233.html .  peace out.
