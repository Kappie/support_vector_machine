Worst lesson i sprobably psychology cause ms Ajit is a stupid woman who continually writes stuff on the borad and it gets kinda boring after like 10 mins! I woul agree with nicki bout the free periods but only cause u can laugh at peeps in lessons! i am quite anoyed that i only got 8 frees now rather than the 14 i started with! lol Worst thing bout 6th form is the ammount of work you get, i think it is unbeleivable you get sooooooo much. And if you have more than one teacher its even worse! Ahhhhhh help me with my homework i have like 6 peices to do and i am getting bored of it already! Well what colour do you guys reakon i should paint my new room now my sister has gone? I need to know by tonite though so my daddy can get the paint! LOL I cant wait to get in this room permentantly cause that way i will have sooo much room and space i wont know wot to do with it all! But i know for a fact i wont let my room get into a mess like vanessa did! You could only see the floor on good days or after she had supposedly cleaned up! Lol  Shes gone now and it still looks a mess cause she has left half of her stuff her! The whole room is covered in dust cause we havent been able to get to any of the surfaces for at least 2 years!  Wow this is a really long blog for me im used to writing like 10 words then signing off maybe im writing sucha a long blog to stall me from doing my homework! Hehe And i have one more thing to moan about, Nickki have you noticed how all the chairs seem to be dissappearing over to the "upper 6th side" and less of them sit that side ne way! plus they have the new chairs over their side and the pool table! Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
