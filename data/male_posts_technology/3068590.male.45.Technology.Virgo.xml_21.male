The event that I am speaking of is the Apple Worldwide Developer Conference and Steve Jobs will be using this forum to make some major announcements. The first is the announcement of "Tiger" there next version of the operating system.   As I like to do, I like to make predictions of the types of products will be made.   Further details of these, and why they are important will be posted to this blog before the 28th.     - Redevelopment of the entire IBM suite of development products on Apple's Platform. I previously predicted this and look forward to the day that it actually occurs. Requires IBM to port their tools to Apple's G5 processor, aka the IBM 970 processor. Apple's contribution to this will be the release of their API to Cocoa and WebObjects to IBM.     - This offers enterprise customers an impenetrable security model for any developments made on this homogenized platform.     - Updates to the Xserve to 4 - way processors. This will be the outer limit of the 1U server, and the beginning of volume production of these units.     - Updates to Xraid, and clusters, with the addition of a "blade" processor based on G4.  Further elaborations on these points, particularly the "security" model will be made prior to the 6/28 deadline, barring the silencing of this point by Apple or IBM.
