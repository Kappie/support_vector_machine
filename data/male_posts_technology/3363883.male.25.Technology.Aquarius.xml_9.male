Think I might have blown that a little.  Oh well.  I haven't had a drink for a couple of days which is good but I think I might blow that tonight with a going away party in a curry house.  Play it by ear.  I will talk about the weekend in a later blog when I have some time for more writing.  I'm in a mixture of moods today.  I had an absolutely dreadful night filled with nightmares which is something I haven't done for years.  I dreamt of an Ex giving me a good deal of abuse.  I think the term she used was "Victimised".  Just thinking makes me shiver.  Funny how dreams can seem so real.  What you perceive is your reality I guess.  Think my subcouncious still needs some work.  Pass me a beer :- )  On a lighter note however, I got some emails from some truly wonderful friends back home in Adelaide [and brisbane].  A BIG hello to Che and Sarah.  It was wonderful hearing from both of you and it makes me feel warm and fuzzy knowing that time can pass between us but when we do catch up, you know that things won't have changed in our relationship either.  Being away from so many people makes you appreciate these kind of relationship so much more.  A big Hug and Kiss to Alex J as well.  I had a wonderful conversation with her on monday.  Over the last couple of weeks, things have been a bit strained, with relations back home and my own personal life.  It's nice to hear a friendly voice who will always hug you [phonewise] when you need it and give you a good kick up the arse when you need it even more.  She is a one of a kind and someone whose contact I will never lose despite me being half a world away.  Thankyou so much for being you Alex.  Also.  Some people have asked where all the photos have gone.  The software used was "Hello" which was allright apart from causing my machine to crash out at bizarre times.  I ended up taking it off and opla, it's all fine again.  I think I read a new version has come out, so I might see if I can put it on and give people more photos.  Always nice to let you in on photos of my world.
