Well, it turns out that the Marines may never have strayed into Iranian waters to begin with. According to this article, the Royal Marines were in Iraqi waters and were forcibly escorted into Iranian waters. If the GPS data backs this up, then this would prove to be an act of war. With luck, the Bush administration will turns its sights on Iran in the next term.
