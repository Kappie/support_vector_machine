Slept over taipei, missed the train, shopping, warcraft, drinking, working out.....................................  Basically, just majorly slacking off.  And no, it's not boring.  However, I do wonder how many weekends of the same will I get before I'm sick and tired of this kinda weenend...?  Probably never??  After August, I won't have it anymore.
