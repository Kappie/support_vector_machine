From a business perspective, their history gives me some pause.  From a technical perspective, the device has always seemed interesting to me.  Saying that, however, I'm not terribly convinced there is a market for this thing.  Time shall tell, however, and I'm gonna be sitting by waiting to see how the market reacts to this thing when it finally hits the street.....  P.S. In case you were wondering, no, I would not purchase this device were it to be available today.  To me, the cost/benefit ratio is just isn't balanced for this device.
