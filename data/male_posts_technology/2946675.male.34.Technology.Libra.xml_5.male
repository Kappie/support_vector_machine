They reach up and rub their nose, then you get all self conscious and you think "I have a cliff hanger ... Shit!" so as inconspicuously as possible you reach up and rub your nose. Now, they see this and they get self conscious and they, as inconspicuously as possible, rub their nose again.   *heavy sigh* it's a never ending circle that doesn't end until you both part company.   What is it about human nature that makes you go ... Hmmmmm
