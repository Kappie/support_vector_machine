(diplomatic exchanges apart) its really opened up new ways to explore the net and great platform for knowledge-sharing (and gossip-sharing :-)  ).  and as broken at 4:23:59  ... Kavitha will be moving to Chennai Development Center next week. That'll be the end of her short saga in Bangalore... she now goes where she really belonged... (atleast I feel so)... even though she had always asked me to pray that she gets posted to BLR, I told her "I'll pray surely, but that will not prevent them from posting you to Chennai"... and the rest is history.
