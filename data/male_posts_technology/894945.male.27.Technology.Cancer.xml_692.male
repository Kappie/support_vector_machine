I spoke to Custard recently and he mentioned that he was going to set something up at some point because  of birthdays while you were on holiday - but he didn't tell me a specific weekend. You're great fun and we wouldn't burn off your birthday had we known about it.  You have been in our circle of friends for a long time, and you are the only female that has consistently expressed an interest in posting on TF. Originally I didn't want this to happen. Toaster Files has a long history of being about us lads and I wanted it to stay purely as something for us guys. Eventually I relented and invited you to join. As we know for some reason this didn't work (you may believe I engineered this - I didn't, I have no idea why you couldn't join up) but I believe that was a mistake - nothing at all to do with you, but to do with my I set up this site in the first place. I feel I have messed you around by changing my mind and I apologise for this.  With this in mind, I think I need to put clarify some things and compromise on others.  Once a month, we have a night out with the shirts on. I will organise a calendar so we know when it is and what we are doing. These nights are for the guys only. We will take into account other people's birthdays, weddings, holidays, funerals etc and plan around them. If desired, I will add these other things to the calendar so people are aware of what's happening and when.  Everything else that we decide to do, be it going to see a film, have a meal or going out on the knacker is fair game for girlfriends, wives, female mates, pets, imaginary friends, etc.. etc. But I think the lads deserve a night just to themselves to go out and get mad with it.  The main site is for us guys only. I don't want people posting stuff under somebody else's user ID. In future these posts will be deleted. Anyone can leave comments or post on the forum, use these instead please.  I am not doing this to inflame the situation - I feel that if everyone knows where they stand we can avoid people being upset and pissed off in future.
