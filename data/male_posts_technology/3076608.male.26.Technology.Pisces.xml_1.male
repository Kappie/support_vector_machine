I made the mistake again of thinking that there was something more than what it really is. I am fool for thinking that already someone that I am interested in is actually interested back. No, the curse still stands true for my life. I am doomed to be the good friend no one wants anything serious with. I am not really surprised, or really upset for that matter. In all honesty, I tested the waters and only found them to be bitter and hard. So its day two and I am back to square one again. There are plenty of people that I am somewhat interested in but no one that is interested back. Sometimes I wish I wasn't such a risk taker but if I didn't take risks I think that I would never really find what I am looking for. Just one thing to keep in mind above everything else when it comes to taking risks. Never involve your friends in any risks that you take in your life. Hold to your friends and the people that are already important to you like valuables in a safety deposit box. Its better to keep them away from the rest of the bank and greedy little hands than to involve them and take the chance of losing them. Lock them away some place safe and never take the chance of putting them into the same place as the rest of your money. If everything else falls apart and you think you have lost it all, at least you still hold to the most valuable object you could own, good friends.   You know the saying "don't count your chickens before they hatch"? Well that lesson is one that you should always keep in the back of your mind all the time. Take things at face value but remember your world can be turned upside down overnight. Nothing you have in this world is constant. Here today, gone tomorrow. I think that should be my theme phrase. It can be applied to just about every aspect of my life. That is what is the most frustrating part of my life is. I have no constants, just temporary amusement and entertainment. The moment I hold something dear to me is the prelude to me losing it. I wish I could just find one person or one thing in my life that I knew belonged to me and that wasn't going anywhere no matter what. That is my dream. I just want one thing that I can hold to and never worry about losing. So this is day two and there is yet to be anything good to say just yet. I have knocked another potential from my list and am left with a blank list all over again. More to come when more has happened.. Tonight will be a quiet night at home after Kung Fu. All I want is to sleep and sleep and sleep....
