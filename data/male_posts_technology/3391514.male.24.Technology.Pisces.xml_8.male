They died for a cause, but were all brought back to live "happily ever after" as it were... a change from my usual apocalyptic style.  Not much else has happened... I'm now on antibiotics to try and get rid of this damned cough, and my sleeping patterns have been disrupted by the damn pillows and cats.
