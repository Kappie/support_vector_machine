It appears the US managed to allow the Soviets to steal intentionally defective software back in the early 1980's, resulting in a huge pipeline explosion in Siberia.  This struck a heavy economic blow, not only through the damaged pipeline, but also through a sudden lack of confidence in all the wares the Soviets had pirated from the west.  I suspect our failed  urlLink Strategic Defense Initiative  was another early 1980's attempt to wage economic warfare.  It didn't matter if we actually succeeded in creating lasers that could down an ICBM.  All that mattered was that the Soviets believed this was enough of a threat to require redesign of their ICBMs to include reflective and/or ablative coatings.  The added weight would necessitate a total redesign, which would bankrupt their already teetering economy.
