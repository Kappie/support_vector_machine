Not sure if I mentioned on here, but my baseball team disbanded before we ever got to our second meeting or practice.  Evidently General couldn't get enought akers for the team.  I have sent the President of the league an email asking to be placed...crossing my fingers and waiting.  The new office area at work is losing luster...all I could think about yesterday was how nice it was outside...I really hate this late shift, but only three more days of it.
