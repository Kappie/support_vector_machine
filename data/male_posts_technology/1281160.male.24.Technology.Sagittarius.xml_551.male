(chicken)biriyani, fish fry, white rice with fish kozhambu, rice with rasam, rice with moore,............. I really tired in this process, i was unable to get from the chair, so naren took me carefully to the wash basin...  initially we planned to go back to the match. but naren's friends came to his house, they pulled him to the "Thiruda Thirudi" movie. so we started to that movie, we went to 3 theatres, but in all those 3 we didnt find the ticket(not even in black). so they started to beach, but i decided to go to my room as i hav to wash my clothes. so the remaining day went in washing the clothes.  ram, dai venni yennada valliya orediya pugazhura. what u told??? "American school has taught u a lot". how can u say like that. in American school she has only very few things to learn but more things to teach. she ll teach there based on the knowledge and skill acquired from msitm(professors and classmates) da.   valli, beef rice - in chennai, in the road side fast food hotels, they usually call the beef fried rice as beef rice. reg. new members - chance kidaicha pothumae, vanchi theerthuduviyae. but i havnt expected my name to be the first one in ur list.  ranjini, un samaiyal mega serial enna achchu?  jax, sorry for not answering for ur qns reg blog layout, bcos i m not at all interested in it. anything is ok for me.  kicha, eppada formukku varuva.  sindu,mahendran,ganesh,rajesh,kavi - ellam enga poiteenga, bcos of ur absence i m posting lot of msgs, it is not good for the health of our blog. so return soon.
