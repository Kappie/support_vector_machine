I personally think that our education system needs a lot of changes.   A lot of factors can be said regarding why poor people do not send their children to school. but that can be changed by bringing in few changes.   This iam saying with those poor children in mind. my views on what can be changed are:  1. It is waste of time in having so many subjects in our syllabus. we study history  geography right from 1st to 10th standard. the same old wars, asoka, buddha, india, ocean, mountains etc. these subjects can be stopped in 5th standard.   i think basic english, maths  science is more than enough. what importantly can be taught is other subjects related to work. for eg like carpentry, painting etc. there r so many in this world. this can be taught after say 12 years of age. by this he can also earn some money along with his education.  but then we may hear a few voices which will say there should be no child labour. we think we should not care about it. if a child enjoys what he is doing then how can it be harmful to him. he will only gain more by expereince. this will not be a 12 hours job which some children go thru now. he will also get time to enjoy his youth.  Goverment should play a important role in this. it is giving so many subsidies for so many unwanted things. those can be reduced or stopped and this kind of education should be encouraged. then only we will see a next generation which thinks logically, votes to select the leader he wants, which is not poor etc.  See kicha, abdul kalam cannot come every where for everything. it is we who should do something. we r the present generation and it is in our hands to do something may be after another 5 years of time.  We should be happy that these kind of issues r being discussed here. but it is also important that we play a role in implementing atleast some of them.  bye
