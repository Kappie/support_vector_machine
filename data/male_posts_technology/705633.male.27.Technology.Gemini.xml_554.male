When I get back I'm going to ditch Blogger and set-up my own server to do the job with my new found Linux skills. Hoorah!  Only a few days left of my little antipodean excursion and I'm looking forward to coming home. Sydney (or Tokyo, as the locals now call it) is just warming up for summer in the last few days - typical weather. Tonight I'm going for dinner at the  urlLink AMP Centre Point Tower , which should be nice. I've taken a few pictures with my Nokia so i'll get those uploaded when i'm back.  Last winter (or was it the one before.. I forget) in the very early days of TF, we had a habit of all meeting up in Chambers by the fireplace for drinks on Friday night, right after work. This memory gives me a warm little glow in the cockles of my heart, imagining all of us lot crowded around a fireplace with a few drinkies and nobody getting stabbed. I'd like to organise this again a few times this winter...  are you down with it?  We can even set Baity up with random Irish slappers, it'll be grand :D
