But you may not disclose it generally, because you also want others feel that you follow the latest trend.     Spend the time listening to it, if possible close your eyes and don't involve in anything else. I am sure that by the end of it, you will have a new idea in your mind. You will be in a hurry to do it, not even able to finish listening to the music. I believe that everyone will have a few musical collections which will definitely innovate them. Music heals the world. It heals your mind.     I have tried this many time and the result was amazing. Even I was able to solve deadlock situations after spending a few minutes dedicated to my favourite song. It creates extra energy in your mind and body.      You will be feeling tired after watching a new nice or great movie. You will be tired after watching a whole cricket match even when your team wins. These kind of recreations give us rest and comfort for the time being but it drains your energy slowly. But I am sure that a heart touching muiscal peace will make you feel more happier.     Try this. It will definitely solve some of your problems. The great Karnatic musician Balamurali Krishna has done a good job in this field. He is engaged in giving treatment to many-with only one medicine "music".
