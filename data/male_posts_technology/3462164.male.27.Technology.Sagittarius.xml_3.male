Jens Pulver (2-0, 1KO) came out as a fighter, quickly closing the gap between he and his opponent, covering up with ear muffs, and launching power shots.  Vincent was light on his feet, and peppered Jens' body with lighting quick shots.  1:40 into the first round, Pulver was dropped with a fast and vicious left-right combination.  He recovered well, coming right back at his enemy with conviction.  In the second round it was Pulver who scored a big knockdown around the same 1:40 marker with a monster left hand.  Vincent had dropped his hands and was somewhat show-boating with head movement when he ate Pulver's patented left, that sent him tumbling to the canvas in shock.  He also recovered, but Jens failed to capitalize on the opportunity.  The third round of this scheduled four round bout did not cease to keep the audience on the edge of their seats as Jens AGAIN floored his opponent with a monster left.  This one was much more stunning than the first, and Vincent was beginning to make an impression on the canvas.  Pulver came out a bit more aggressive when his man recovered, but still lacked the killer instinct to close the show.  His man survived to see the final round.  Unfortunately for Jens, the fourth round did not include any knockdowns, but instead gave Vincent the opportunity to showcase his superior technique and fast hands.  He peppered Jens' forearms with quick combinations, with Jens landing the occasional mean punch, but none of them made him shaky in the knees. Most of the judges gave the fourth and final round to Vincent, as he significantly outlanded Lil Evil from bell to bell.  The end result was a split decision victory awarded to Jens Pulver.  In final punch stats, Vincent clearly out punched and out boxed Pulver, but the two knockdowns Jens scored were the deciding factor.  One judge still scored the bout in favor of Vincent, meaning he gave Jens a 10-9 round for one of the rounds he scored a knockdown.  All in all, this was a good win for Jens.    Many are doubting the potential of the former UFC lightweight champion, and current MMA star.  However, with only being 2-0 it is far too early to judge where his career is headed.  I believe that if Jens works on a few aspects of his game, he could become a force to be reckoned with in the welterweight division.  Here are some of the points I came up with after viewing the fight:  1.) Pulver needs to use the jab with more conviction.  Look back to my "second training tip."  Jens barely used the jab in this fight, and sometimes when he did, he'd paw with it.  I think that if he establishes his jab earlier on, and makes it a stiff jab, he'll find it much easier to set up those mean left hands that put fighters on their backs.  2.) Work the angles.  Jens came straight in, and although he is a natural fighter as opposed to a boxer, he should try working different angles to get to the body...which brings me to my next pointer:  3.) Pound the body.  After he closes the gap, Jens should nail the body with some nice hooks and crosses before taking it upstairs.  He was somewhat of a head hunter against Vincent, and that is why he had little trouble blocking the shots and returning fire.  4.) Stop focusing on the left.  It is no secret that Pulver has a monster left, but I feel that he spent too much time and effort trying to set it up.  It was almost as though it were the only punch he wanted to land.  If he follows the above pointers, and punches in numbers, I feel that the devastating left hand will set itself up.  5.) Make punches a bit shorter.  Jens needs to close the gap between he and his opponent a bit more before he launches the power punches.  Going to the body first will certainly help ensure that this distance is closed.  Making his punches a bit tighter will make it more difficult for his opponent to capitalize with counter punches.  Congraulations Jens Pulver!  Good luck in future pro-boxing bouts.
