As long as I'm setting out to maintain a reputation of honestly, I may as well tell you that I got kicked out.  The admins got horribly ticked off- and Brad, the owner, isn't generally a guy that loses his cool- and I am now exiled.  It goes without saying that I consider his decision unwarranted, but I'm also a teenager, and we all know how  that  goes:)  For a while, I'll probably post the best of the best from my old blog.  Hopefully, by the end I'll have made enough local friends to begin posting articles that fit into the kind of demography that people read here.  Enough of an intro for now.  Blog in peace.  Dan
