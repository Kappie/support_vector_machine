Add the fact that you got your chemistry set out the other day and threw some copper cobalt and other chemicals together to boil up a concoction that seems to have wiped  the memory of Danger and PK, leaving them dribbling idiots that follow you like lost sheep.  Please don't tell me you have involved them in some bizarre sexual experiment? The Cult of Lord Baity is, by its very nature, dangerous. I plead that you come to your senses and wake up. You do not want this, really. It may seem nice to brainwash followers, but they have friends and families that care for them. Friends and Families that may come looking for them. Upset people with guns! You know its happened in Texas before, Don't let it happen in Jersey.  Alternatively, you have been taken over by a megalomaniac symbiotic snake alien that controls your body and makes your eyes glow and gives you a strange desire to travel to Egypt.  I know which one is the truth and there is only two alternatives.  Danger and PK will try to defend you but only because they are not in there right minds.
