One time we sang this song about his headgear:  I have to wear my stupid headgear    he has to wear his stupid headgear I have to wear my stupid headgear    he has to wear his stupid headgear     all day headgear   Maybe it's because I grew up with him, but I appreciate his weird sense of humor.   Oh yeah, and he was dropped on his head when he was a baby. He fell off the changing table when mom wasn't looking.
