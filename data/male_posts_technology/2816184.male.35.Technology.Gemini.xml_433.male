I know it's not good, whatever it is.  I'd love to know when we can be together.  I can see a shining light in the distance and feel the first rays of it's warmth, but I want to know when that brilliant star will shine in my sky for me to adore.  I'd like to feel like I'm making a difference...somewhere, anywhere.  I feel like I'm not doing anything for anyone, like I'm just wasting time and effort and could be doing so much more.  I'd like to do that "more".  I long to kiss her.  Someday.....  I wish I could see her more, talk to her more, hold her always, remove her trouble and her pain and let her do the same for me.  I want to know what I want to be when I grow up.  But then again, I don't, because if I know, then I'll have to grow up and be that won't I?  That would be bad, because I don't want to grow up... :-)  I want to be happy again.  Really truly happy, all the time.  I miss feeling that way.  Did I ever really feel that way?  It's been so long now I don't remember.  How do I love life?  Believe it or not, I'm about 7 or 8.
