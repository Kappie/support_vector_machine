Months ago his Liberal Party was expected to easily garner the 155 electoral districts needed for majority rule. Well as the results of the last undecided district rolled in, it went to the Conservatives, meaning that the Liberals and New Democrats  combined  didn't even reach 155. Ouch.  Totals:   LIB: 135 CON: 99 BQ : 54 NDP: 19 N-A: 1
