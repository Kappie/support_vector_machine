They are starting a regime of heprin (an anticoagulant) and will continue for the next 6 weeks if she continues to live.  If things are still working out at the end of that time, they will continue the anticoagulant for another 6 months and, hopefully, the clots will dissolve."  That being said, I'm on a bit of an emotional roller coaster right now. I don't know how I feel about my step-sister, except I know I don't want her to die. It's been an emotional week besides that, I've had to give up one of my closest friends and that hurt.    Work is work, and it does a good job of distracting me during the day.  I hope all is well in your life-
