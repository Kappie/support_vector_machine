At the end of the march, they are going to be knocking down a 6 meter statue of George Bush.  Toppling over statues seems to be symbolic in the US media as the end of a regime, so I think it is very appropriate.  I came here to get away from George.  He followed me to St. Petersburg when I was living there and now he's followed me to England.  He needs to stop sweatin' me.  I mean, I know that I'm super cool and all, but damn!
