After everything is done at the funeral home and cemetery, she tells her closest friend that there is no money left.      The friend says, "How can that be? You told me he had $20,000 a few days before he died. How could you be broke?"       The widow says, "Well, the funeral cost me $6,500. And of course, I had to make the obligatory donation for the church and the organist and all. That was $500, and I spent another $500 for the wake, food and drinks, you know. The rest went for the memorial stone."       The friend says, "$12,500 for the memorial stone? My stars, how big was it?"       The widow says, "Three carats!"      Bachelor Cooking     Two confirmed bachelors were sitting and talking. Their conversation drifted from sports to cooking.      "I got a cookbook once," said the first, "but I could never do anything with it."       "Too much fancy cooking in it?" asked the second.       "You said it. Every one of the recipes began the same way, 'Take a clean dish and...'"           Get Back In There!     Working as a secretary at an international airport, my sister had an office adjacent to where security temporarily holds suspects.      One day security officers were questioning a man when they were suddenly called away on another emergency. To the horror of my sister and her colleagues, the man was left alone in the unlocked room. After a few minutes, the door opened, and he began to walk out. Summoning up her courage, one of the secretaries barked, "Get back in there, and don't come out until you're told!"       The man scuttled back inside and slammed the door. When the security people returned, the woman reported what had happened.       Without a word, an officer walked into the room and released one very frightened telephone repairman.      Hospital Regulations     Hospital regulations require a wheelchair for patients being discharged. However, while working as a student nurse, I found one elderly gentleman--already dressed and sitting on the bed with a suitcase at his feet--who insisted he didn't need my help to leave the hospital. After a chat about rules being rules, he reluctantly let me wheel him to the elevator. On the way down I asked him if his wife was meeting him.      "I don't know," he said.  "She's still upstairs in the bathroom changing out of her hospital gown."
