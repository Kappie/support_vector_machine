It's also a top-notch PDA, and a cell phone capable of replacing your trusty old Motorola or Nokia. Being able to access your e-mail, and surf the net without wires, or troublesome IrDA connections is a pleasant and rewarding experience, if you're willing to pay the price for it. The i700 isn't for everyone, only those willing to rethink the way they use a cell phone will find this type of integrated device truly useful."

 

 Definitely looking into this.
