My happiness and my sanity are most important."...I tried to IM her but she won't respond...this is killing me..but I can understand that it is also hurting her greatly...i want to make her happy...the way things used to be...she was (and still is) everything to me...there isn't a moment during the day that I don't think of her...I keep having these feelings of "i've already fucked up my life, maybe it would be better for all parties involved if i was dead", but then I cannot do that to my kids..i can't quit...oh well, lemme go do something and try to get my mind off this "shit"..i hope to post more later Sue's profile pic  urlLink
