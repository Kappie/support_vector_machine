Live 2 Burn09: u Live 2 Burn09: when u move undermyalarm: oh ---  I can't really keep from punching myself at this point. I was the one who chose to move and I am punishing my friends for it...  What is amazing is that I met most of these people THIS year. They got to know me, now I am moving. It is really hard to befriend me, because I don't ask for much. I only expect people to not act like a tard.  I feel like an ass, doing this to my friends. No one is gonna suffer more than Shelby, I bet she is bawling right now.  Another sad thing is that I WANT to move, I WANT change. I have lived here forever, and I love the place I am going.
