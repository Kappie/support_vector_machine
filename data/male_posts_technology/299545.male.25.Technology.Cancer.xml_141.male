So what you're saying is that a) you are going to be handing back a country that is in total chaos and pulling out but b) you're not allowing the government you leave behind to control their own armed forces and or enact new laws? Does that seem like a handover that is only in the best interests of the Bush administration and not the Iraqi people's to anyone else? I thought so. |  urlLink via  |
