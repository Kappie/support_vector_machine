I've gotten a few calls so far, and they haven't been pleasant. I find myself not caring if their password is revoked, if they can't use their VPN, I just don't really care. I spoke with a lady today and she just made me sick to my stomach. Everything I asked her to do didn't work, all she kept saying was "no its not working" I wanted to reach through the one and strangle her. These user's are telling me, "hold on", "let me try this." NOOOO!! Don't TRY THAT! DON'T TRY ANYTHING! JUST DO WHAT I TELL YOU TO DO AND SHUT YOUR BIG MOUTH! Man this job is just driving me nuts. I'm slowly losing my mind! I think I'll be living up the street at the state hospital soon. I don't know I enjoy this job, but it's slowy killing me! hahah..I make it sound like I'm out in the sun picking lettuce or something. I'm sitting in a air conditioned room playing on a computer, big hard work! Well I guess I just needed to vent. These users are impossible, they are beyond stupid most of the time. And because of their ignorance and their pride, they are quick to lay blame. And who you might say do they blame? They bite the hand that feeds them. The very person that helps them is the one that they blame for their problems! We are here to help, and all we get is disdain and contempt. I swear it! Ahhh....this is driving me crazy. I despise this place!  There are only few people who can sum up how I feel about this, and it's Agent Smith. Much like neo in the matrix, I'm stuck in a cube, which is on a square floor in a rectangle building on a geometrical grid! This is how I feel about this place:     Agent Smith: Can you hear me, Morpheus? I'm going to be honest with you. I hate this place, this zoo, this prison, this reality, whatever you want to call it. I can't stand it any longer. It's the smell. If there is such a thing. I feel.. saturated by it. I can taste your stink. And every time I do I feel I have somehow been infected by it, it's repulsive. I must get out of here. I must get free.     Nothing sums it up quite like that. I need to just do something else. I just don't know what. Well I'll live, but it's not the way I want. Hope every one else is doing better. Adios.
