Hell Fighter said this because he thinks that our school is full of crazy weird chicks. Well for the most part he is right. But I believe that out there some where there is a very cool gal lookin for him. But hey I am sure things will get perkier for him soon.   Check out his post at the Hell Fighter Boy link. And see what he says. Bye again.
