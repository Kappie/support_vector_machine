So now I'll never know and now I think  urlLink Kelley  might be mad at me:(  Also, I was thinking, I am really sexually frustrated almost to a point of actually pursuing sex. Not quite to the point of actually pursuing sex, but it seems that I cannot live in this state of sexual frustration forever. I mean, I want someone to return the ball:)  Another thing I find interesting is that the peeps that read this thing. Like there's people I talk to who've I've mentioned the site to and then they tell me later that they find it interesting:) (or at least that they read it, they don't really say it's interesting)  Also important news tonight. I've registered www.timsadventures.com and www.unwantedhero.com  The timsadventures will be the site for normal tim, and the unwantedhero will be for alter ego tim(or as I like to call him, John)  well, check you later
