I wonder how long it is until  urlLink HUTN  is mentioned, and then disregarded, in this discussion, and whether anyone will contact either  urlLink me  or the  urlLink folks at DSTC  to ask about it...  Actually, someone at work asked me about HUTN yesterday, which surprised me. I had kind of figured that it would fade into a small note in some PTC minutes archive and be forgotten, but perhaps I was wrong. I still think its a useful idea, although it would really benefit from someone providing a more up-to-date implementation than  urlLink this one .  On a final note, looking at the OMG's spec catalog would  urlLink suggest  that HUTN has passed the BoD stage, and is thus a "real" specification now. Yay.
