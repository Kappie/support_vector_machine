Using email and/or names, members get to search and add their friends into a personal network. Once added, you can view your friends' friends and so on. The interesting is that sometimes you'd realise a lot of you actually have a friend in common. What's unique about this system compared to ICQ/MSN/Yahoo messengers system is that you get to see how other people are linked to you. Eg. Me -> Person A -> Person B -> New Friend.  Feeling a bit out of sorts today. I think it was because of doing Guard duty on the last day of the month. It doesn't feel like it's my last duty for Oct because coming week I'll have another duty soon. In fact for this month, I had a really hard time planning out duties for the Bde again. It's so hard to be fair because there's just way too many things I needed to take note of when planning. It's getting so tedious and yet I dare not really slack too much on this as it will make a lot of people's life miserable if things weren't planned out properly.  I'm looking forward to the last day of Nov as that's approximately the day of my last duty again. But that's also my last duty for my NS. Wheee!!!
