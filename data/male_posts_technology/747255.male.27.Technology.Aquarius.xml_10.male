Maybe it would make some people more comfortable if it was called something other than marriage.  urlLink Today President Bush called for an amendment to the Constitution to protect the sanctity of marriage.   The wording of "sanctity of marriage" doesn't really work for me. I can't find a quote directly attributable to Bush using that wording but his  urlLink press secretary said exactly that.  It's the definition of  urlLink sanctity  that bothers me. It means "holiness" and I don't think it's our governments job to create law based on a religious belief. Every religion in the country doesn't feel the same way about homosexuality.  Anyway, that's semantics... not what I really wanted to post right now.  I haven't heard a good argument against same-sex marriage. I understand that some people don't agree with that lifestyle. I understand what the Bible says about homosexuality. I also understand that people can make their own choices about how they want to live their lives.  While forming an opinion on this issue I was thinking about the gay people I know. One of them had a really hard time figuring out what to do with himself. He grew up in a Christian home where it was taught that homosexuality was wrong but he had these feelings. He tried to be straight for a really long time. He fought with his head what his body was telling him. Now he's openly gay and is probably happier for it. Anyway, what I'm getting at is that I think homosexuality is a natural phenomenon. I think for the most part it's not some artificial choice people make for some outside reason. I really feel that their chemistry tells them who they are. I don't think people should fight that so much. If you feel gay, be gay. Whatever.  So with the understanding that homosexuality exists and will forever exist we move on. Gays and lesbians fall in love just the same as the rest of us. I don't think our government should penalize them because they can't or won't understand that. If two gay guys want to live together and merge their lives into one I think they should be entitled to everything my wife and I are entitled to. I think they should file taxes the same way we do. I think they should be able to get family health insurance at the same saving we do. I think the state should license, join, anul, dissolve this union the same way they do with a straight couple.  What social purpose does it serve to ban these people from signing a contract to merge? Your religious preferences have no place in this debate at all. You can't argue for the protection of your children either. Gays will exist whether they marry or not. In this country that boasts so loudly about our freedom, why are we only going to stand up for the freedoms of the countrymen we agree with?  I support gay marriage even if I don't feel gay. I support flag burning, even if I think you're opinions are ridiculous. I support free speech even if I hate what you say.
