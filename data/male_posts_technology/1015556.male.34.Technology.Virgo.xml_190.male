Quick quiz - how maby people groups are in Haiti?  And how many of them are unreached?  And how many of you out there have sent at least one student mission trip there?  And tell me again why?  PS - There are 7 people groups, none of them are considered unreached.  Haiti might be a great place to take students, for some sort of relief and development work, teaching English, etc.  But I wouldn't call it strategic in light of world missions.
