I still haven't gotten harrison to email me the prelims of our comic, since we aren't ready to write/draw, we are gonna put some random stuff up until the comic comes rolling down.  ---  Tomorow is april fools day, and i'm gonna have alot of fun... *evil grin*  The group walking around the track in geek PE class today thought of some good stuff.  One of my ideas is to walk into school and yell "April fools!!!!!11" and then dissapear with smoke bombs and come through the other door.  ---  Ok I don't feel like blogging...    "Your mother has a smooth forehead"  LOL ^_^
