But I have to say he has got balls, he makes fun of all the celebrities and even downright insults some of the people. After Good Charlotte performed on stage he referred to them the 'mediocre Green Day'! He also said Ashton Kutcher was 'literally a motherfucker' . But my favourite one was when he was saying how Americal Idol should get proper judges; "Paula Abdul judging American Idol was like Christopher Reeve judging a dancing contest!"  Yes so very mean I know but damm funny though.
