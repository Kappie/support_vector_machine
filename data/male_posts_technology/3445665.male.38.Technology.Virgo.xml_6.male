I found out my neighbor didn't want to buy the van,  oh well, have to sell it to someone when I get back from vacation.   Sunday   I didn't do much today.  I read a book on open source.  I went and saw the movie, "Van Helsing"  It was ok, lots of good action and exploding green goo. Didn't scare me though.  And the 'Q' like friar with all his inventions was so stollen from XXX and James Bond.
