A storeman in my bunk got his locker locked up by some unknown bugger. This storeman went to complain to the RSM who asked for the culprit to own up. When nobody did, he decided to confine our whole bunk until the culprit surrenders himself. Goodness. Being the duty spec today I'll have to stay in anyway but I'm wondering if it drages on till Thurs, how can I go for training at Siglap. And what's going to happen if it drags on till Sun? How am I suppose to go for Japanese class.  I can only hope for RSM to change his mind within the next 2 days or that the culprit will own up soon instead of dragging down the other guys. That's regimental life for you.  What a malicious and brainless prank to pull while you're still in the Army. Good gawd...
