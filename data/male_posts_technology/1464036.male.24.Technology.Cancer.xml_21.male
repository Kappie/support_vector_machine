Christie took care of me.  Only if I would marry her or something. j/k.  Mark and I are waiting for the scrubbing of the RAID 5 partition to finish so that I can watch him reload the operating system and then we can work on getting this doctor's clinic back up.    Today is also Christie's bridal shower at the apartment.  The main reason why I chose to go out of town and do a server reload.  To much estrogen for me.  Hope everyone is safe and will post again soon.  13 DAYS LEFT!!!  AGGHHH!!  ILY
