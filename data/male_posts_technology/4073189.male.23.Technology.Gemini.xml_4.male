I think its the 39th year of Singapore independent... While feeling bored, I started to watched the Augulimala, Hidalgo VCDs which I rented at Friday...  Totally bored the whole day until even too bored to play video games... "Crap... I'm dying of bore and laziness!!! Arghhh~!!" I switched on the TV program in my computer and started to watch Disney Animation and fell asleep!!!   Time:   1750hrs  Woke up after hearing PM Goh voice on the national day message. PM Goh had been guiding  leading Singapore for 14 years through Highs  Low(from Sars,9/11, Eco crisis), even by doing Beyond the call of duty... That's what I see while I grow from a boy to a Man... For that I salute PM Goh for his delicateness for Singapore~!!!   Time:   2015hrs  Finished watching the National Day parade 2004, Singapore idol came next... Quite funny  saddening in some areas, but that's the truth about entertainment field... its cruel~!!! Ho Ho  Finished up today's work and plan for the better tomorrow...   ORD countdown:   69 days    Why is there a timer for my ORD?     NS is a waste of time... And I serve 16mths with a rank of CPLÂ…
