Most of them have barely no writing skill, and they have no ideas of their own. You will be complemented more if you create your own stories, characters, and settings. If you were an author, and it took you 2 years to make a book, slaving over a cold cup of coffee and writing with a pen almost out of ink on a napkin, you get your book published, someone makes a movie out of it. Everything is great right?  No, It's not.  You are looking on the internet and notice that fanfiction.net has added a category of your story. You are flattered at first, so you decide to read one of the stories. The writer makes all of the characters gay, changes all the settings so every house is made out of plushies...You see people praising the story, like it is a wonderful work of art.  How would that make you feel?  ---  What I am trying to tell you is that since you can make story lines, all you have to do is make characters and a setting.  If someone we're to write a naruto fanfic, he could easily change the characters and make an ORIGINAL ninja story.  I was once among them, I wrote a lotr fic about ents, then I understood what I had done to Tolkein. Something told me that I made him turn over in his grave...I could have easily called them treelords and it would have been MY story.  I have found to love fictionpress.com instead.  really.  Think about what you are doing to authors. Just think, would they appreciate your actions. If they say no, You are not a FAN.  (please comment)
