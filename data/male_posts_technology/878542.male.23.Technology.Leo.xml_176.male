And I can certify, this is an amusing movie, that contains a great love story.   for you christians out there, it is not relentless christian bashing(although I would have welcomed that) it is a much classier movie than it's silly little preview makes it seem.   for you atheists, it is not christian propaganda.(it is a much classier movie than that). It is in fact, nuetral on the subject of religion, and concentrates, quite properly, on the people.   for people of other traditions. this movie might not make sense. It relies on a knowledge of christianity and some of it's practices, and a cultural understanding of of a baseline to compare the culture presented in the movie to.   It's still a touching love story, though.  Macaulay returns!
