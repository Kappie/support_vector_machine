The procedure would save the life of one, while the other could not be saved.  The pro-lifers are vying to have the House of Lords rule on this matter since it is along the lines of abortion.  Their idea is that the House of Lords would either postpone or oppose the seperation.



Here is the kicker:  if the two are not seperated, they will both die within months.

Here is the broad generalization: Pro-lifers are complete idiots.
