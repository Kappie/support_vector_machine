I do make myself known to be available for the developers and I do make myself available to the higher ups. If you want to despise me for doing a good job, then so be it, but don't downright undermine me.  I don't know, it seems like people would rather argue with me, since I sincerely have no power over them, than to try to help me with something that a developer might need.  Anyway, I digress... I wanted to write about the things one deals with when "managing" 14 people, or something like that. I forget.  Anyway, I should start programming again and maybe I'll be able to get a really real job!! Now if I only knew where that quote came from... dammit!  Goodnight- T
