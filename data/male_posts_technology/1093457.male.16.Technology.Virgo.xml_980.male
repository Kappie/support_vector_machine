Yup, and Dave.D's party was kewl, Andy kept chucking stuff up this girl's skirt and Rob was dancing quite happily with this pissed girl. At the end of the party, Lee phoned his house to ask if his parents could pick him up. Okay, so when his parents didnt turn up half an hour later, we dropped him back home. He lived literally 30 seconds walk from Dave's house. *Hits head hard on table*.
