The path from here forth be full of trial and tribulation it will, tread carefully and keep your eyes to the light side you must!!"  I had heard that you were spending alot of time trying to accomplish this goal, and I am happy to hear that you have at last acheived conquest, very much as I have! As far as 'The Two Towers' are concerned, I happen to be a total Tolkein nerd as I am sure you all know, and I have to say that although I agree with you that they are all part of one big epic, I believe that the first film was better than the second. I was a little vexed by the second film as I believed that it portrayed a few characters incorrectly, and if you would like to discuss tis then by all means do so (as long as you don't mind me telling you your wrong hehe, only joking m8).  As for the consumption of vegetables......I FUCKING HATE THEM...DIE DIE DIE GREENS!!!!! AAAARRRRGGGG!!!!! They suck, their evil, their green!!!!! And thats all I have to say about that.  The discussions are a cool idea and I may very well participate ok.  I got to go now but keep up the posting guys (actually Brett, being as you are the only person on this site who can bother to post!) As for the rest of you...YOUR ALL FUCKING LAZY!!! VIVA LA REVOLUTION...Baity signing off.....
