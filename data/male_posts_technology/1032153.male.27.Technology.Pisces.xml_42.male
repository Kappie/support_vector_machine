You can't win. I decided to visit the old staff shop today. I came out with all sorts of goodies, which I distributed to my youth leaders at C.I.A, and also Tanya, (because she asked). Sorry Alana! I'll get you something next time. Go the boysenberry trumpets!  It's late I'm tired and drained! Gotta go.
