FYI, I did some research after and found out Unitarianism is a religion where you can pretty much believe whatever you want and it's very liberal. cool.  The first band that played was No Birds. They are a 10 piece band with a brass and string section. They play lengthy moody experimental rock pieces. Usually instrumental. There are some major talents within that group and I think that most of them are high school kids! You'd think that at best high school kids would just show a hint of promise but this music is fully realized. I bought their CD  Don't Rely on Dying Young .  Next was Parades Against Parades. A four piece that had the other drummer and the other guitarist from No Birds. They played post-Dinosaur rock in the vein of 764-HERO or the rockier side of Broken Social Scene. I dug the sound and they can only get better.  Both No Birds and Parades are a part of  urlLink The Teargas Recording Tree . A collective a like minded local musician (think Saskatoon's answer to Elephant 6). Anyway, I'm really impressed and I must say there's something special going on in this town/scene.  Next was Edmonton's Fractal Pattern. They were really good musicians and played their guitars with bows and had a french horn player but somehow I didn't fine their 9 minute epics to be as engaging as they should be.  The last band to play was Clann Zu. All the way from Australia. They are on  urlLink G7 . They sounded like Radiohead but the singer was a bulky Henry Rollins kind of guy. It was weird to hear that high little voice come out of his mouth. They were good but it wasn't really my thing and it was late so I went home.  So in short. Yay, for the local kids and The Unitarian Centre is a good evnue with good sound. Look out for shows there.
