Vinton said I cant do electronics because I am not taking physics. Crap. So instead I chose to do Media Studies instead of Electronics. Now, as I have seen the application form again, I just want to do I.T and AVCE Business. Media Studies will probably not play any part in my life, so there is no point in doing it as it will be in theory 25% more extra work for sod all in return. P.S: I managed to recover 50 pages of Business coursework out of the 75. The other "lost" 25 pages I found in draft form on the schools network. Not bad. I'm getting happier.....slowly.
