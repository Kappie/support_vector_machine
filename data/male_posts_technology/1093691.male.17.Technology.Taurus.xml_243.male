Why? Because I stay for art, science, german, textiles and IT. Now i'm all run down and erugh :( And now the Inspectar Calls trip has been canceled I'm very annoyed. Well, at least we get our money back.  So what have I got to look forward to atm? My great friends on message boards I talk to who are teh most lovely people in the world! I am looking forward to Saturday Jo! Woooooooo! (BTW, if you can get dropped at my house at 10.15am or so then my dad can run us both straight up the train station). And I am emailing some people who have seen it so that we may have a chance of meeting Chris and Freddie! Wooooooooo!  What programs do you watch on MTV if you get it? I watch Jackass and MTV Cribbs. Love Cribbs. I was watching O-town!!!!!!!!!! really nice house!
