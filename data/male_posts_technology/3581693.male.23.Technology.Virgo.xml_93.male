I of course thought (only for a millisecond mind you) that they were the actual lyrics from the website (which btw I had just found and sent to her - I'm not thick - I'm just a little slow sometimes)... anyway - at the bottom of the lyrics there was an Updated By:... with the e-mail address of the person - so I e-mail the person (Kayleigh) and said "What's this noise?" Of course she was perplexed - what on Earth was I talking about I naturally had to apologize to for such wild accusations as incorrect EJ lyrics... and now we've sent a couple e-mails back and forth for a week or so.
