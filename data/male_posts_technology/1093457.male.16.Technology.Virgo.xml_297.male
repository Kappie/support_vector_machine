It was really scary, i was talking to my friend about e-mailing people and I was saying "I e-mail Tom alot cos he's always there", look up and who's walking towards us, but Tom? It was REALLY scary! Anyway. I bought a CD today but it's for Lisa's birthday so I shouldn't really post here what it is just in case someone accidently lets slip, lol! What else did I get? Oh yeah, a beanie baby Babboon as a late easter pressent for my sister, cos she was moaning abut me not getting her one, and it was cheap, lol. Cheap-skate me. Other than that I got a little book too! For all you lot to write it, ha ha!
