Unfortunately, my inability to synthesize, theorize, and analyze have frustrated me into keeping those essays in draft form.  I'm growing more and more disgusted with my cliched, overly critical writing these days.  Do you think that reflects some deeper trend in my life?  ::shrug::  Maybe that's the topic for another blog.  Anyway, the essays will come in due time.  You just wait.
