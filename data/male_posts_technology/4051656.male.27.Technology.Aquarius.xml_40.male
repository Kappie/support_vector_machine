In no particular order:     urlLink Winrar 3.3     urlLink MSN Messenger     urlLink Jabber  This one's solely for work.   urlLink Mozilla Firefox  and some of its extensions:    urlLink Googlebar     urlLink All in One mouse gestures    urlLink Bug Me Not    urlLink BBCode        Well, that's pretty much it for daily-use stuff. If I think of anything else, I'll edit this post.
