I quickly changed and we left. The first thing i noticed bout Johar town was that the roads had been repaired. But, as we turned towards our school... the misconception was gone :s. I was going to school after bout 3 months. And all the khaddas were still there. Neways, I went in and bought the forms and prospectus. I had to pay for it. The school was being renovated and work was going on. I asked the guy some other details and then left. Next, we went to Lacas. I had seen the map in a newspaper and directed dad according to the directions i remembered. But, we couldnt find it :s. Then, I called Ahmed and asked him bout the way. He said that he ahd just some to our school and that we come over there. Then, we went back to LGS and he told us the way. So, we got to Lacas. They've got a nice, big campus. I went into their office and got the prospectus and forms. It was much better than ours... and they didnt charge any freakin money :o !! On the way back, I studied the stuff. But couldnt decide :s. Neways, we bought haleem on the way, went home, and had haleem for lunch. Then, I sat at my pc. Checked my mail. Chatted. Posted at the forum. Then, I went to the office for a while. Came back, chatted again. Changed and went for jogging. Came back. Chatted some more. Then, I had dinner. Chatted some... more :p. Explored Orkut. It is really an interesting thing. Mamu called and told that they were going to eat Falooda and that we should come along. So, we went to Ferozepur road and had falooda. It wasnt that good, but we still enjoyed it. Neways, then we got back. I changed and sat at the pc. Chatted for a while. Sana told me to make some changes to the sig. Then, she left. Hanan came. Chatted with him for a while. Farazeh came. Chatted with her. Meanwhile, I edited the sig. Adil was trying to convince dad to get him a new, seperate pc and dad even said yes!! This cant be!! :S Neways, since dad was in a good mood, I asked him for a mobile... and he said yes again!! :D Just like this.... time passed. I mailed Sana the sig. Dad kept telling me to get off the pc... but i kept lingerin on... but at bout 2:30... he got up and told me to close it... or no pc from 2moro!! :@ Damn yaar... I hate this!! :@ Neways, this is how the day went.
