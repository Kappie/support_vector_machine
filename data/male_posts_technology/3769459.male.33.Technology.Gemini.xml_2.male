I'm still looking for a drummer for the project. I'll be setting up rehearsals soon. And have a target date of late July or August to play live.  Allan and I have started to audition guitar players and drummers...  IF you are are either a guitar player of drummer and you want to play some bitchin' tunes from the 80's send an email to "scotty_saturn@hotmail.com".
