To the rest, I hope everything is going well with you.    I WAS NOT CALLED   "I cannot go," I hear you say, "It's not my work; I was not called. Too bad so many die that way,  Without a hope, without a God, But here at home I have to stay." But then I hear my Savior say, "It was my work to die for you. In Heav'n I did not please to stay. I came to earth not for a few, But all should know I am the Way." "I cannot go," I hear you say, "My child is small  And he needs all the world can give him today. It would not do to be so cruel To one who cannot choose his way." And then I hear my Father say, "I gave My Son, My only One, to give the world the only Way. He suffered alll upon the cross. Can you do less for Me today?" "I cannot go," I hear you say, "It takes so much Of strength and grace. I have no talents to display, My faith is weak; right here I'll stay. The smart and strong go far away." I hear my Lord and Master say, "Have you not read Within My Word, 'Ye are vessels made of clay?' I choose the weak to give My strength. Let all who will serve Me today."
