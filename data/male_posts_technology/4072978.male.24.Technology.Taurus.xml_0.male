Basically, it's about clones... of one of my sister.  In the dream now, my mother was taking me to school along with my eldest sister (still younger than me) when all of the sudden I also saw her walking to school on the side of the road.  I got excited and exclaimed to my mom and sister what I saw, they were baffled.  I hopped out of my car and chased after my other sister, but when I was about to get to her I saw another one coming out of a store from across the street and another further along the street, in fact I saw a clear line of my sisters walking away from some place in the distance...  So I went and followed this odd path with my sister(s) trying to get my attention and distract me, but I was persistent and I found them all coming out of a factory!  I sneaked into the factory and overheard, what appeared to me, a mad scientist shouting about how he is going to rule the world by overpopulating it with clones of my sister!  I woke up then, as you realize, at my age, this was a nightmare and I still remember the dream.  Scarry huh?
