       Belching, bloating 

    

     

 

 

 I'm still up from last night (check the last post) its only 12:11 in the AM.  I just downed a quarter dose of Citrucel with a few big gulps of water afterwards.  Generally that isn't a good idea, and I'm not expecting this time to be any different.  I am still having some belching from yesterday (only a few hours ago, again see last post) and I suppose this will aggravate it. 

  Update:  Jeez, when its late at night and I'm sitting in front of the computer, seems like I'm posting every 15 minutes.  The truth is, I'm watching some anime on my pc so I tend to eat and then post at slow parts in the story.  I am a geek. 

 Watching Japanese cartoons is something that I've really come to enjoy since I've been sick.  It's a great distraction to keep my mind off of being ill, for as long as I want or as long as I have episodes to watch. 

 But, getting to the point, I've been snacking on these Ritz crackers for a few minutes and I was able to let out a long belch.  I don't think the whole thing was just from the crackers, so it felt pretty good. 

  Update:  Well, its 1:20 am and the belching and bloating has dropped considerably. Those crackers made me damn thirsty though.  I don't think I'll have too much more water, however, because that always brings back the belching.  I think I'll have some more licorice tonight though, and maybe just a little water to wash that down while I read my book.
