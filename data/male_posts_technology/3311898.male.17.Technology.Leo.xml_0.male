I cite most of these claims from the following article, which can be found here http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A22819-2004May12.html   There are some very STRANGE circumstances that just dont fit together right.  For one, Berg had planned to leave Iraq March 30th the, but he was supposedly detained by the Iraqi police for "suspicious activities" before he had the chance to leave.  He was detained through the 30th, and therefore missed his scheduled date to leave.  However the FBI is telling Americans that they offered Berg a free plane ticket out of Iraq on April 6th and he turned it down.  Hmmm... think about that for a second, why would a man who wanted to leave, but was detained and prevented from leaving, and then offered a free ticket out, turn it down?  That simply defies logic.  The moment a rational person was released from that, logic would say his first concern would be leaving as originally planned.  So why turn the opportunity down?  Another very FISHY aspect to all this is that U.S. spokesmen Dan Senor denied that Berg was ever put into US custody after his detainment by the Iraqi police.  However he did say that US Authorities were aware he was in custody. However, according to the Associated Press, Iraqi police had no recollection of Bergs supposed detainment.  To quote the AP, "Senor referred questions about the reason for Berg's detention to the Iraqi police. In Mosul, however, police told the AP they had no knowledge of the Berg case. Police official Safwan Talal said the only American arrested there in recent months was a woman who was released soon afterward"  To make matters more confusing, being that Iraq is under occupation by the U.S, it seems unlikely that they would hold Berg there for such a long period of time without approval and permission of the U.S Authorities. All of this starting to seem very...wrong.  However, contrary to what the Authorities are telling us, Berg did in fact tell his family that he that U.S. officials took custody of him soon after his arrest and he was not allowed to make phone calls or contact a lawyer.  This was all heresay of the parents until they were able to present demonstrable emails stating that he was in fact in US custody in Iraq. To quote the emails (found on http://wcbs880.com/siteSearch/topstories_story_134141930.html) -   Beth A. Payne, the U.S. consular officer in Iraq.   "I have confirmed that your son, Nick, is being detained by the U.S. military in Mosul. He is safe. He was picked up approximately one week ago. We will try to obtain additional information regarding his detention and a contact person you can communicate with directly," the e-mail said.   "I have been able to confirm that your son is being detained by the U.S. military. I am attempting to identify a person with the U.S. military or FBI here in Iraq who you can contact directly with your questions."   So Berg WAS in fact in U.S custody, despite U.S claims that he was not.  Finally, the latest twist in this disturbing case, is that Nick Berg was questioned in 2002 by U.S Officials after his computer password he used in college turned up in use by Zaccarias Moussaoui, the al Qaeda operative arrested shortly before 9/11 for his suspicious activity at a flight school in Minnesota.  The FBI dismissed the case as just a college student who was simply careless about protecting his password.  But in the wake of Berg's gruesome murder, it becomes a strange and sickening coincidence that an American who inadvertently gave away his computer password to one notorious al Qaeda operative is later murdered by another notorious al Qaeda operative.  Noticing a trend here??  Other emails sent home to his family told of how he walked around Iraq freely, unarmed and unguarded.  Now why would he do this unless he had a reason to feel safe, something NO westerner would reasonably do.  If you have seen the uncensored video, you'll notice that Berg does not look noticeably nervous or even fidgety while he was sitting there with the terrorists.  He was almost eerily calm, up until the point where they attacked him with the knife.  There are few theories about Nick Berg.  One is that Nick Berg was set up by the American Forces to draw world attention away from what we were doing to the Iraqi POWs.  Perhaps he was a CIA agent who was becoming a liability and was set up by U.S to be abducted by Al-Qaeda, serving two purposed: Nick Berg being dead and no longer a liability, and turning world opinion to be more sympathetic to us.  Or perhaps most chilling of all, and what I tend to believe, he was assisting Al-Qaeda, giving them information and involved in their terrorist activities.  Al-Qaeda decided one day that they needed a white American to kill, and who better than the guy hanging around with them all the time.  Easy to capture, easy to trick, and just as effective to kill.  Whatever you choose to believe, you MUST look past what our press wants you to see.  This was not just an unfortunate random American civilian in the wrong place at the wrong time.  There is much more to this story, the outcome may never be known for sure, but as is with any government story, we must try to see past what they want us to see.
