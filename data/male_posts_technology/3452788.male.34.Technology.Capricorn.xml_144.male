We have VERY large poison oak here, sometimes reaching 50-60 feet tall climbing the trunks of redwood trees - locally known as "old-growth" PO. Very interesting how marching straight through the PO is more macho than "tiptoeing around it like a pansy", this statement from someone who has spent most of the last several months miserable from reaction to PO. Anyway, we always keep the Tecnu around.  Actually, I seem to be one of the few people who has very little to no reaction to poison oak, yet I am allergic to every other plant on the planet. A single flower blooms, and I sneeze my ass off. I get a severe contact reaction to any plant that scratches me, especially grasses. I am most susceptible to grasses, pollen, trees, and mold. That covers nearly everything. I think I can tolerate saprophytes.
