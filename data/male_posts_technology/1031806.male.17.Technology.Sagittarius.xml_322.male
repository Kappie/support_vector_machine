What should you do?  A) Postpone the proposal untill you can agree on a place to worship. B) Tell her that the wife must submit, so she will attend your church. C) Alternate between the churches each Sunday. D) Agree that you will attend you own churches   2. What is the most common financial problem faced by newlyweds today?  A) buying a house B) credit cards C) investments D) multiple bank accounts   3. You observe your friend Bill cheating on a test. What is the best responce?  A) Leave an annoymous note on the teacher's desk. B) Do nothing but pray. C) Inform him that you will have to tell if he doesn't. D) Encourage other Chistian people to pray for him.
