How can we show them that we're about more than just McDonalds and Nike sweat shops and arrogant conservative Presidents when, from my perspective, that's all we're really showing them right now?  I'd like to believe that America is so cool for school that we can make the rest of the world like us...and I completely agree that there are a lot of wonderful things about this country that could appeal to many.  But I don't think that's the image we're really showing right now.
