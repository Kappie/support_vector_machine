I think I am going to take a nap before I drive home tonight.  I am dissappointed because I had wanted to mow my lawn this morning before work.  Oh well, maybe I can get motivated tomorrow morning.  Tonight I'll do my dishes and wash my pants so I have some to wear for tomorrow.  I got to work and fixed a few bugs in our product, then did a release build.  Not much else happened at work today, talked to a few people about code stuff. Oh, and some one brought in these little round sour chews. Yummy.
