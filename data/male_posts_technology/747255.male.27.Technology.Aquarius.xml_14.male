But there is one thing that I will not miss at all.  Tonight there is a helicopter orbiting at between 1000 and 1500 feet around what seems to be the east side of Fort George G. Meade. Actually, tonight it looked like there may have been 2 out there for a little while but there's so much air traffic out here it's hard to tell. But right now there is just one. I don't know exactly what the operation is. This all really started back a few months ago when all those flights from London and Paris were cancelled due to some terrorist threat. It seemed that every time there was a flight that had been delayed into the Washington D.C. area (BWI, IAD, or DCA) one of these helicopters would do the orbit for an hour or so. Could be a coincidence... who knows. Anyway, In our first house we lived pretty close (a few hundred yards) from a neighborhood frequently visited by the county police with lights and sirens on... I know what a police helicopter looks like and I know what they look like when they're searching for someone or something on the ground. They orbit at a much lower altitude than these guys are and they usually have a pretty bright light shining down on the ground. I know they have newer technology than a big light but they still used the lights pretty often in the old hood. They would also stay in a generally small area and do a search pattern until they decided they weren't going to find anything or they ran out of fuel. These guys hover at one spot at the east end of Fort Meade for several minutes and then move to a spot at the south end and stay there for several minutes and then they sort of run around the west and north ends (what seems like for less time) and start the whole routine over. The first time I noticed them out there they had a spot light on but they weren't scanning the gound beneath the chopper but they had the light shining several miles out as if they were scanning the horizon. Acting more like a light house than searching for anything really...  Anyway I don't know if they're guarding the Fort from some threats or if it's just an exercise or what... but I won't miss hearing it.  Thinking about this reminded me of the couple of days right after 9/11 when all commercial air traffic and general aviation was grounded. We were still hearing aircraft, but not at all what we were used to. Fighters were doing orbits around DC and Baltimore and since we sit right in the middle they often would pass right overhead. They flew day and night and at times it was frightening. We'd be laying in bed sleeping and then suddenly we'd hear the thunder of an Air Force fighter zipping past. Sometimes it would sound like a formation of them going over and other times it would sound like they were going back and forth right over our house. They're so loud it sounded like something was going to crash into the house. Adding on to that, when air traffic did start moving again the pattern at BWI seemed to have changed. Instead of being in the arrival path we started seeing departures fly over our house... a much different experience because it looked to us like the planes were going the wrong way (since we were used to them decending and heading toward the airport... It looked like they were still decending but not toward the airport...)  Anyway, we're a little more paranoid than most people we know. We're actually the only ones we know that have emergency stuff ready to go. We have a couple large duffel bags and a box of stuff that would only take us a minute to load into the Jeep and hit the road. We have food, utensils, cooking equipment, fuel, heat, sleeping bags, toys for our daughter, water... radios, batteries, lights... basically everything we'd need to head for the hills for several days and not rely on anyone else. We try not to let the Jeep get too low on gas so we don't have to worry about filling up if we need to leave in a hurry. We have a .45 ACP pistol and ammo ready to go... I'd really like to get a rifle that would be a little more practical. The pistol is no Desert Eagle... it's not very well balanced... there's no porting or anything like that. It's labelled as a compact. Basically, it's difficult to handle. I'd rather take off with a .22 LR and a couple thousand rounds. At least with that I can fire ten rounds really quick at whatever and then switch magazines. In the time it takes to fire those 10 rounds I'd probably only be able to squeeze off about 3 with the .45 with the same accuracy.  Anyway, the new place is far enough away from everything that we shouldn't see this kind of activity with regard to the helicopters....
