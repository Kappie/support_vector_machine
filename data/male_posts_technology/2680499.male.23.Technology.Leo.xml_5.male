My colleague from that district came to fetch me. It was an early flight (6.10am) though, I had to wake up at 4.45 am and get myself ready to the airport. So, I was all the way dizzy and half unconscious in the car as my poor mother was the one to send me to the airport. But as I was in the air plane. I was awake for the first 15 minutes, partly because I wanted to taste the drink. But what excited me the most is the beautiful sky. I've been traveling to few places by flight in my life but never seen such scenery before. The clouds are thin and layered nicely. Through the layers of cloud u still can see the main land of Borneo. It's as if The land is covered in mist. Some clouds even moving driftly, just like in some movies that shown the scenery of the moving clouds. But I still couldn't stand the greed of more sleeps so I crashed into dreamy land.  Well, it took only about another 15 minutes to reach Tawau. As well as we met(my colleague and I) we drove our way up to Semporna(another district that's nearby Tawau). That's about an hour distance on the road. On the way, I see lots of palm trees, cocoa and all sorts god I don't know what. As we go, he told me some of the interesting information of the places, like there's lots of crocs in the river and bla bla....  As we finally reach there, we did our work and it was about an hour or a little bit more that we have done everything we need to do. So we were good and ready to leave. But before we headed our trip, he brought me to the nearby rest house, which is placed at the sea side. It was beautiful, we saw some nice sea creatures. We even saw some squids swimming around. Then he told me it takes about 2 hours of boat to reach Sipadan Island from there, What a place that everyone wishes to go.  On that day, we have done 2 districts, which the other district has nothing much to tell, so I'll save time for that. We then headed back to Tawau, and look for hotels for me to settle down for that nite. We finally found one and checked in. Then we said good bye for that day.   It is boring doing nothing in the hotel, I went to the nearby supermarket to buy some drinks and had my dinner right after. Then I headed back to my room and try to watch some crappy movies. Thanks to my colleague, who told me the day before I came, that at nite someone may come to knock on the door and sell some extra services. At that very boring moment, I suddenly had his bad influence infected my mind. I was suddenly waiting to expect for someone to knock. God knows if the price is right, I might have done something silly. But that was a silent nite. Except for the sound of rains at the late nite and some opening and closing of doors. I first was hoping that I could hear something from the next rooms but then that thought faded out and my mind goes blur and so I crashed.  Till the next morning, I was still imagining scenes that may happen when someone knocked on my door.   Hehe..... Bad thoughts!!! I then clean myself up and get ready to meet my colleague again. That morning, he brought me to one coffee shop which sells "instant noodles". The food was delicious, and I can't help loving the "Sotong cake", I don't really know how to put this but I think they meshed the squid and deep fried with flour or potato~I can't tell. All I know its nice. After the breakfast, we went to the client's office in Tawau to start the work of the day. Damn unluckily, there wasn't any electricity. My job deals a lot with electric and yet there is no electric.... Bad day!!! We then waited... And waited... Still not coming then we went to one of my friends shop and took our time to read some newspaper. Time passes slowly, and we had to wait until 2 O'clock in the afternoon. We went back still the place looked dark from outside. But thank god, at least the current came, not fully but at least I was able to switch on the server and do my maintenance. Then we worked as fast as we could, and we were ready to go at 5 minutes to four.  On the way to the airport from the town took about 45 minutes. So, we have plenty of time since my flight is  pm and we started our journey at 4. We had some chat and some orders then we depart at the airport. Nothing special after that. So the story ends here. Today, I have some more works to do, but I've also spent some times on this blog. So, enjoy!!!  Adios.
