Most of the other students were transferred over from students class so they almost all from secondary school and one from primary. A funny lot. Made me feel a whole lot younger (Sensei mentioned that too at the start of the class haha). But they were a cheeky lot as well. Sensei seemed well and happy teaching them. Some of the specifics of a technique may be missed by them, but I did realise that a lot of them were pretty good and soft. Maybe it's the age they've started and they've grown to develop a nice foundation for Aikido. I realise I'm even looking at how they do certain stuff to curb some of my bad habits here and there. And they were pretty soft as well. All in all, it was a good start for me and I'm happy going back there for my regular training (at least while I'm still in NS lah).  Did know four of their names. There's Leon (Pri 6), Weide (I think), Daniel and another I can't quite remember now. They were asking me lotsa questions about NS (I went right after camp so I was in uniform) and I answered them as best as I can. Some of things I told them were the brighter side of things. I think it's no point giving them the nasty stuff and direct them towards a very negative attitude of NS. I did give very neutral and fair comments that a lot of things depended on them how they perceived everything and their attitude. Think they were a bit young to fully understand what I was saying as well but I hope that they'd grasp a bit of what I was trying to convey.  Oh yar. One more thing. NS pay came in today ... so did my eMart credits. WOOHOO! Bought my AHM running attire ... goodness, the V-cut on the running shorts made me feel really 'exposed'. I miss the Mizuno sponsorship we used to have for AHM runners.
