The Chona in the City blog about a maid from Romblon living in Valle Verde is only a few weeks old but is gaining popularity like wildfire. Her profile was visited  4613 times  as of today, pretty good considering her account was created on July 26.  If any of you can see my hit counter (I can't see it right now, site must be down) I probably have a little under 200 hits for the whole month from a few close friends. Chona's story is the stuff of telenovelas and romace booklets.  Whether it is true or fiction does not really matter.  Its's amusing, funny and addictive.  You can't wait until her next blog. Her little anecdotes on her "  Mam Tess  " and "  Sir Jeff  ", and her run ins with  Reynante , her annoying suitor and The new helpers  Aling Choleng  and  Myrna  are enough to get you hooked. With her popularity,she needs no introduction. As Chona would say in her own words...  urlLink " I'm chona mae banaag but you can call me chona for sure".
