On a brief note to the immediate family, the stopwatch is back in action from all those years ago (have those batteries ever been changed?).  Update for 3/3/04 I proceeded to the Princeton High School track after work to do the Yasso 800s (Y800).  For clarification of what a Y800 is, see my previous update.  I warmed up with a mile on the track to get my legs going.  To me, even in spite of the rain, it was a perfect night to run.  It was perfect expect for some lower leg pain mainly focused on my calves but also leaking to my shins and knees a bit.  My leg pain was annoying for the first two Y800s but subsided pretty dramatically after the last two and after stretching in the end.  I completed four sets of Y800.  My times were 4:15, 4:13, 4:05, and 3:36.  I have no idea what happened to me on the last one, but it brought my average to 4:02.  These numbers were very exciting to me for two reasons:  1. Negative splits  2. If these truly are an accurate estimate of what my marathon time will be, then I will have surpassed the self-proclaimed slow runner Brad who will answer my shots at him about slow running with comments like, "Go and beat a 4:05 and then we'll talk."  :)  I finished with a 400m walk to cool down.  It was a great night all-in-all.  Update for 3/4/04 I went back to the Rec this morning and I am happy to report that my workout was great and no one dropped a weight set on my foot.  I have also learned that the devoted worker-outers come in the morning.  There was no makeup, but there was plenty of sweat.  I did 45 minutes on the stair climber again on level 14 totaling 293 floors (just can't beat that 300 floor mark!).  The stairclimber was a good workout, but it might be time to up the intensity level or duration.  I finished with 15 minutes on the rowing machine.  It's always kind of odd rowing next to someone because you will almost always subconsciously fall into the same rhythm as the person.  Kind of weird but cool all at the same time, especially when you realize this and you intentionally vary your speed to throw off the other person's rhythm.
