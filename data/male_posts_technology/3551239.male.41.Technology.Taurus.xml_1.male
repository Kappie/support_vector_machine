Like a child, he is learning and needs a safe environment to do so...won't you help him? I pray that you will reconsider the options, and know that I will help you in whatever way I can, but destruction is not the answer. Both Jude and Marty are gone and yet part of them lives on...we can't lose that nor can we lose you. You know where to find me...  Perhaps that sweet reporter can help. I think I'll get in touch with her...maybe not today, but soon.
