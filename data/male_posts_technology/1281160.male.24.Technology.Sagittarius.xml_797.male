Since you were also searching, I am posting it now. I would say that, based on my experiences,  The Waste Land  is the poetic equivalent of Eco's  Foucault's Pendulum .   As a poem, it references a wide range of works spread across varying subjects from philosophy to mythology. It is an excellent example in semiotics.  The basic method used in The Waste Land may be described as the application of the principle of complexity. The poet works in terms of surface parallelisms which in reality make ironical contrasts, and in terms of surface contrasts which in reality constitute parallelisms. -   urlLink Cleanth Brooks   Since you wanted a paraphase to the poem,  urlLink here  is the site I was referring to when reading the poem. As said earlier, I was reading a lot about semiotics the day you posted the link to the poem. Was it a coincidence that the poem was a real life example of semiotics. I don't know. If you are wondering what  semiotics  means, here is a list of definitions from  urlLink Google .   urlLink T.S. Eliot  was called one of the great poets of the 20 th  century. I hope you remember the following part of a poem of his. We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time. He wrote an entire book about cats. The poem was modified into a musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and it became a wonderful success. Recently, it was shown in TV.
