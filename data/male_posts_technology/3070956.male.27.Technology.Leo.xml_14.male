Anyway, Ariane's boss had a very posh wedding. It was among the most impressive receptions I have experienced - wow! I guess that possible when you marry two older doctors.    Ariane and her boss, the groom.   urlLink     ... I did end up getting to Ariane's place in plenty of time to get ready and hang out for a bit. After 12 years her mother remembered speaking with my parents about Lebanese food and had picked some up from a local restaurant - it was great. It was a good thing since I was starving after not having eaten all day!   I also found out that her parents have fun as members of a large historical society named  urlLink The Society for Creative Anachronism . The organization learns creatively about the Middle Ages. Ariane's parents  urlLink prepare for war  in Slippery Rock, PA together each year by making costumes, equipment, and a large tent - all in accordance with what one would see in the Middle Ages. The pictures below include one with me and her mom, and another of her father working on their  urlLink tent .     urlLink    urlLink     The event is called the  urlLink Pennsic War , and according to information I found on one of the previous links here's a short list of the major event highlights:     A wide variety of heavy armor combat in various melee scenarios with lots of participants (we're talking really big battles here, where binoculars are highly recommended!).  Archery competitions in a wide variety of shoots.  Arts and sciences competitions and displays.  Demonstration sports (games, ballistic weapons, blackpowder, weapon styles, etc.).  Huge (and lengthy) kingdom courts.  An enormous masked ball.  Lots of merchants (Ancient SCA Proverb: If you can't buy it at Pennsic, it can't be bought!).   Tons of classes (you wouldn't believe how many!).  Parties, parties and more parties. Did I mention parties?   ...wow. Sounds pretty cool! I might have to just go and see since it is so close, hehe.     * * * * *   After we were all ready (and I was all fed), we picked up her friends Dina and Steve and went to the St. Regis hotel. The pictures below are of Dina and Steven and then Dina and Ariane.     urlLink    urlLink     This was one crazy expensive wedding; when we first got there - valet parking was included and the door. We couldn't go up to the wedding until it was time so, we all went to the lounge, of course. Well! Guess how much drink were?? I bought two drinks - a Captain  Coke for myself (they were out of 151), and a Bombay and Tonic for Ariane... before tip the drinks cost $34 and change!!  Ugh .    The most expensive drinks ever!   urlLink     The generosity of the bride and groom more than made up for my expense at the bar, however; when we finally went to the reception we received amazing service, an open bar with champagne and practically any drink I could want, huge shrimp with tasty sauces, rack of lamb, and other delicious starters. I was surprised at the setup there that I initially expected that there wasn't going to be a sit-down dinner! Oh, these are just the appetizers I was told later... wow.   We sat down at tables shadowed by towering floral arrangements and glasses of white wine. We were served salads with huge chunks of lobster. We were given a choice of either fillet mignon or Chilean sea bass as the main course. The desert was a hard thin chocolate candy cup filled with berries and topped with delicious sorbet in the shape of miniature pears and other fruit... dinner was great.     urlLink    urlLink     And the cake... again - wow. It was well, a wedding cake. Both, it was exceptionally decorated with an ornate bouquet of cream flowers! Ariane hear that is had cost in excess of $5000.       urlLink      urlLink        The band was great  performed of jazz and popular songs. Ariane and I had fun dancing together. I got to be a sweaty mess as usual, heh.    Everyone dancing   urlLink     Another interesting occurrence - I hit it off really well with this guy at the next table to find out from Ariane later in the night that he's the NYC commissioner! hahaha. He gave me his card at the end and told me to keep in touch. We had fun speaking.     Me and  urlLink Commissioner Joseph Bruno    urlLink     Everyone received favors after the wedding reception, though I didn't take one. It was Waterford Crystal. Nice. After all, I was thoroughly impressed and had a great time.   People I was spoke to were inspired about how Ariane and I were hanging out after not seeing each other for 12 years. You never know... you know? I guess I made an impression in other ways as well; Ariane later e-mailed me:    So I was at work today and the phone keeps ringing. Five of those calls were from Dina, Ida, Paul, Maria (Ciro's wife/ Ida's cousin who never calls just to talk to me) and Dr. B (from his honeymoon in the Caymans) who all called just to tell me how charming, personable, handsome and in general what a great person you are. Everyone at the table adored you and really enjoyed your company. ...how nice - what a compliment! I'm so touched!     * * * * *   We left the wedding after midnight to meet Warren and other friends of mine. They were celebrating the birthday of Warren's cousin and my friend, Joanne.    Me and Joanne   urlLink     Ariane and I each had a drink and danced with everyone and partied. It was good times, but I got tired after an hour or so because I got up so early in the morning.   Warren has a girlfriend, now. Which is crazy because it's been such a long time. She's pretty cool, and I can't wait to get to know her better - I've only seen her in crowded loud crazy places so far, hehe.     urlLink     In the picture above is of Warren's girlfriend, Daryll - Warren's younger brother who I hadn't seen in over 6 years, some girl I didn't know - think her name was Stacy, and then Ariane on the right.   On the way back to Ariane's place I got a flat in the worst of places. Didn;t really need that.  sigh .  Had to change the tire in my nice clothes and I was tired. Ugh.  The next morning, Ariane went to a diner by her house and enjoyed the pictures together  It was a good, full day... after 12 years, hahaha.  -Ryan Riehle
