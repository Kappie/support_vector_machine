First thing I saw there, was a figure flopped over on a chair snoozing. Couldn't tell who it was initially, so I went straight to change into my gi first. When I came back I saw Tommy kinda poking at the body or something and it was stirring... oh ... Eileen nah... thought who.  Anyway, talked to Tommy awhile about that morning's grading and Yuishinkai's training. Class started pretty soon after that. It was quite nice all the way (though somewhat crowded) until we started weapons training. First few were still OK, but towards the end everyone was kinda 'I stare at you and you stare at me'. Well, for one thing, I had problem even see the whole kata because I was too far behind and there were just too many heads blocking me. I found that evening slightly disappointing because I was actually looking forward very much to Hattori Sensei's weapons class.  Mon evening, after work, I left early and went down to BB East CC. Hattori Sensei will be teaching there as well. Was early so I enjoyed the curry puffs I bought from Old Chang Kee earlier. Later I saw Iulian, Ah Hee Sensei, Alvin around and popped in to help with the mats. The night class was very very very good. For one thing, I was lucky to have paired with a pretty decent beginner (Kenneth, who seems to train at BB East). Also some group techniques went quite smooth too. But Hattori Sensei's weapons class that evening was the best. He revised what we did the day before, but this time he broke it down into parts and everyone picked it up a whole lot faster and easier. Really shiok lor. I like the fact that he's teaching mostly same things as what he did in last year's Aikicamp. Because we don't do enough weapons work, it's the only way he can make sure we are learning correctly, by teaching us himself. I wish like Tommy mentioned, there's someway he can conduct regular weapons work locally instead of just once or twice a year. Anyway, the final night's training went very well and judging from the applause, I think everyone felt the same as well.
