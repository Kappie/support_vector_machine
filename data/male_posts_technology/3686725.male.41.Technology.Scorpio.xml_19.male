Now it seems, the sci-fi sounding Zogby is the place to get your reliable poll data.  That is where the  urlLink DailyKos (scroll down to one of the first entries for Sunday, Aug 15)  pointed me to find out that  urlLink the Shrub's campaign is hurting .  Look at W's numbers and he is behind Kerry in many key demos, tied where he should be strong, and showing an anemic lead where he should be trouncing Kerry.  OK, so he hasn't had a chance for his convention "bump" to kick in yet.  And what an oddly timed convention that is, too--the latest in the season  ever .   There is a sea change out there.  The Right has been too brazen with its power while the Left has learned that they no longer have to accept marginalization.  Progressives are traditionally a lazy lot.  They only seemed to get involved when the shit really hits the fan.  Well the walls are pretty damn splotchy now and lefties are coming back.  Meanwhile, that huge political behemoth The Center which has heretofore been romping about on the right side of the park cuz it felt good for awhile, is finally getting a peek at the man behind the curtain as the smoke and mirrors are blown away and smashed by the newly energized left. Limbaugh  Company had us all kow-towed for so long.  How many times have you seen (or been) someone who posited a progressive point of view only to be dismissed with a haughty "oh, a  liberal " and then ignored?  The word itself came to mean "not worthy of consideration".  Somehow the Right had marginalized real political discussion until they achieved the one-party government (essentially, given GOP/neo-con control of all three branches) we have now.   But the Fat Lady is warming up.  People are speaking out in the  urlLink media  and  urlLink individually .  And the House of Bush is begining to wilt.
