As the school year ends, there are more and more activities going on there.  Of course, I want to participate in as much as possible.  I've been in Ian's class 2-3 days a week!  But it's so rewarding.  Ian appreciates having me around, and the other children are all so wonderful.  I've been spending as much time at my mom's house as I can, doing chores and helping out.  Plus she's in physical therapy twice a week.  The water therapy has been wonderful for her, so it would be awesome if she could continue that even after her prescription ends.  This weekend my Aunt and Uncle are visiting from Detroit.  They bought a house in Las Vegas (heh heh), and will be moving there soon.  Until my uncle retires, they visit their house as much as possible.  This trip, they're also coming out to San Diego.  They were going to stay a little longer, but my uncle's sister-in-law isn't doing well, so they need to drive up to Sacramento on Sunday morning.  Since they'll be in town, Joe and Tam will be having Samantha's family-only birthday gathering on Saturday.  It's short notice, and Sam  Alex are dancing that day - so I'm doing all of the cooking.  That way, Joe and Tam only have to worry about cleaning and the cake.  I'll cook all the rest. YIKES!  I can't believe that Samantha is going to be 8 years old!  She's grown so fast.  What a cool kid she is, too.    Sean will be in Santa Clara next week.  :-(   To top it all off, I'm trying to get rid of a migraine.  It hit me Tuesday... HARD.  I couldn't see, I was throwing up, etc... not to mention the pain.  Thank God Jessica was such an angel.  And luckily Sean was able to come home and watch her  pick up Ian from school so I could sob in our bedroom.  I hate migraines.  At least there's a silver lining - I lost 1.5 pounds that day.  ;-)  In eight days, we'll be in Hawaii.  ~sob sob~  I wish we were already there!  But I need those eight days to do all the last minute shopping, packing and chores.  I keep having this  Star Wars moment... voices in my head are saying, "Stay on target... Stay on target!!" and "Almost there.... alllmooooost there!"
