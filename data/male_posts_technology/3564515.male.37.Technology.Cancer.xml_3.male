I sat with kids when they ate. My 7 yr. old daughter is an avid reader. I haven't told you that, right? She reads like crazy. She is reading Harry Potter these days. For old-time sake, she wanted me to read to her before she went to bed. And I did. Great satisfaction. I read to her, kissed her good night, and went to eat with my wife.  Our younger one also loves books. May be it's because her older sister reads so much. We had kept all her books. When we ate, she hung around eating little bit from our plate and drinking more water. I had bought alphabet magnets for keeping on fridge. She has started recognizing few letters. Then I read her a book titled "First Words"! Then she kissed me good night and went to sleep with her mom. And I am back online.  What a wonderful day! I love my wife and kids, I call them my girls! I am in the thick of some tech experiments. Let me get back to it. May be I will come back here to scribble just before I go to bed.
