Seems my HD is going bad:(  Anyway, the other thing it's been doing is signing me in and out of messenger service like a cop in a donut shop :) Wait... am I mixing metaphors? or just not using the right one?  Anyway, life is good. I found salmon burgers and have fallen madly in love with their low carbs, omega 3 fatty acids, and all around tasty-ness. Now if I just had unlimited amounts of money I could just live on brocolli, salmon, asparagus, cheese, crystal light, and diet mt. dew for the rest of my days. I think I could handle that.  *sigh*  back to work- Tim
