However, I will probably be getting on this coming weekend, so I will relate tales as they occur.  I now have five friends on XBL, so I can usually find someone to play with when I am on.  Just to clarify, these are not just "Friends List" friends, these are "In Real Life" friends.  So I guess I can't be too nasty to them online.  One of these (ISuperGeek) just got his gamertag yesterday.  Although I urged him to pick up Project Gotham Racing 2, he declined based on some irrelevant fact that he does not like racing games.   Pfeh.   At least he did enjoy a rousing bout of  urlLink Cat  Mouse  during the GeekFest 2004 weekend.  I expect I will find him for a little Crimson Skies at some point in the near future.
