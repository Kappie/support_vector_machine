I have to talk to him about that (it requires a clean reinstall of Win XP Pro).  2). I seriously have to stop spending money...like this week. Poor mode has been activated and I will binge on home foods and a week of videogames (when I go on my vacation next week).  3). I have to pass a game. I'm thinking it's going to be Painkiller (since it's so much fun), but I'm open to pass any other game as well.  4). I need to learn how to use MS Project and Dreamweaver MX soon. A lot of development really depends on the usage of these applications.   5). Research a replacement laptop for my irreplaceable T40. I love that laptop.
