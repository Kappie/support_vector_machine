Why, who'd have ever thought that Mechanicsville, of all places, would make it onto Yahoo News? Guess that puts it on the map,  urlLink literally .  More damning conservsations from my weekend:   Me  (at Sephora in Regency Square):  Hey, did you notice that Jennifer Lopez has her own perfume now? (Holds up a white box that says  "Glow"  with the infamous "J.Lo" logo below it). Wonder what it smells like...   Sara  (my other half):  My guess is Crystal, sweat, and pinto beans.  Guess I won't be riding that train alone.
