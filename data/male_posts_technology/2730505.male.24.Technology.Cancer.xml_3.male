Yeah that's a great steak house huh?  Then suddenly the place goes out of business.  You then try to find another steak house that served that perfect steak but nothing has come close to it.  Maybe in the future you will find a steak house that serves steak that is just as good or even better than what you had but right now you still want to go back to the steak house that served THE BEST steak.    Yeah this is a metaphor or something like that.....
