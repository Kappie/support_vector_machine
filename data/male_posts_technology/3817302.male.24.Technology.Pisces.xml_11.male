Gernot, as he allows his "Gnomenclature-challenged" friends to call him, hails from the City of Anchoril on the island kingdom of Lantan.  Growing up in a world of gnomish artifacts and gadgets, he was intrigued in all manner of mechanical apparatus from an early age.  After primary school, during which he also assisted his father in the family smithy, he was originally enrolled in the Sambar Dual Institutes of Alchemy and Alchemical Fire Response Training, where he was easily surpassed by his brighter (and more reckless) classmates.  Gernot simply did not show the aptitude for work with dangerous alchemical compounds, though he was intrigued by the few samples of smokepowder provided by the local Temple of Gond.  Wanting to know more about this interesting concoction, and assured that he would certainly recieve higher marks in his classes with a steady supply of the material, he entreated the Gondian clergy for more experimental material.  After several trips to the Temple, Gernot became more and more comfortable in the surroundings, and realized that the initiates at the Temple were more like himself than the students at the Institute.        Possessed of a new purpose, he returned to his family home in Anchoril and announced his new direction in life.  His father, a weaponsmith, agreed to fund his enrollment at the Temple, and Gernot became an Initiate in the Church of Gond.  In keeping with the Church's teachings regarding the value of deeds over words, Gernot hired himself out to employers along the Faerunian coastline, acting as both a healer and a troubleshooter, a specialist in the area of mechanical devices.  On one of these missions, Gernot was hired along with a fearsome, scythe-wielding warrior known only as "Solomon" by a merchant named Galimar in order to investigate some sort of woodcutting device of orcish manufacture.  Upon reaching their destination, Gernot and Solomon realized they had been betrayed by Galimar, and became embroiled in a fiasco, finding themselves allied with the unlikely companions of a local druid named Silvanus and a sneaky little halfling named Dungo Dagbar. With this incident began their long journey of retribution against the villainous Galimar.  Gernot has traveled through a large part of the Realms in his travels, with an ever-increasing bounty on his and his companions' heads. He and his companions, which now include a mysterious martial artist from the East and a reserved yet powerful wizard from Silverymoon, have defeated many a foe.   Gernot continues to spread the good word of Gond in his journeys, and has indeed converted two of the members of his party, the mysterious hexblade and the stealthy halfling, to the faith of Gond, enabling them to recieve Gond's full blessings when they are healed.  Gernot has continued extolling the virtues of a life of crafting, creation, and invention, and helped found and protect a mining town named Silvervein, but popularly known as Gondor, in the northern reaches of the Sword Coast.  Gernot currently has plans to construct a sort of mechanical bodyguard and assistant known as a Gondsman, and has visited the High Holy Crafthouse of Inspiration in the city of Illul on Lantan in order to pass the Trials and recieve the manual.   He continued his adventures with his companions in order to bring Galimar to justice and stop his destructive business practice, and this chapter was finally brought to an end when the wrathful adventurers descended upon Calimport, Galimar's base of operations, carving a swath of blood and destruction directly to Galimar's front door.  Galimar's final moments, cowering and whimpering under a table, were far from noble, and Gernot feels a hint of regret for what he considers may have been too hasty a solution.  It remains to be seen where Gernot's adventures will lead him, but for now, he does his best, acting, crafting, and inventing in the service of Gond.        Gernot is a tallish gnome with a large brown moustache.  He wears a saffron-colored robe with a red sash full of small tools, odds and ends in the style of the Gondian clergy, as well as a blue traveling cloak and a feathered smith's hat.  His holy symbol is an enchanted mithril shield in the form of Gond's toothed cog, and he carries an enchanted mithril hammer of Dwarven manufacture, which he acquired in Mithril Hall.  He still nurses an affection for the Gondian smokepowder, and has plans to train in the use of the matchlock-style firearms manufactured and controlled by the Church.
