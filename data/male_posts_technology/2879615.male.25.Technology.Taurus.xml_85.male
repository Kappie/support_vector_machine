For Lala's birthday party we trekked down to teh beach adn lemme tell you getting there was a chore in itself thanks to the incessant whining of uncle craaaiig and licky licky poo poo. If we didn't have those green apple test tube shots of phlegm waiting for us, we never would have made it.  Holla at the new song errrbody is singing "Some ppl want pearl necklaces, some just want anal beads ripped out of their ass like you were gonna start a lawnmower...WA WA WA but that ain't you baby..." Me and Uncle were the only soldiers at that party. We kept it thorough from the borough by swimming in the ocean @ 4am.   If you're 25 and have a "real" job, it is unacceptable for you to get so drunk you pee your pants.  Last night was kind of interesant as well. AKL hit stables for Peaches lame ass party where that motherfucker tried to charge us $5 a cup. Peaches, are you serious? The party was a meaty sausagefest and you were going to CHARGE chicks who were patronizing your piece? sig tau boys are AWESOME! Holla @ the foot of snow.  "SCOTTIE! HE THINK HE FLY, FLY ENOUGH TO BLOW YOUR MIND! SCOTTIE!! HE THINK HE BAD..GET ON THE FLOOR AND SHAKE THAT ASS!" Urkel was in his usual sitting up sleeping position when we showed up at 11:30. Way to be a champion steve. Lauren Kate and me had our EyeSpies out. The shady...I'm just biding my time.  To wrap it all up, the cops hanging out hardcore in the parking lot across the street was a nice touch. It kept up the festive attitude of the bday celebration. GO EWING PO!  anyway, I'm hungover and need eggs.   smashu? SMASHME!
