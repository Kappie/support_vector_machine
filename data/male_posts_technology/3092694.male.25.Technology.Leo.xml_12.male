While divergent, my submission ran:   Dear Andrew, It astounds me every time I return to my home town I find it ever more littered with the gaudy effigies of Mayor Mc Cheese, and The Ham-burglar.  What, I ask you have they ever done for the city?!  Were I Mayor Mc Cheese I wouldn't be such an ego maniac.  Best, David C. Houder   Today Andrew read my email aloud, however he stopped after the first sentence. (punch line clearly lies in the third)  I am wondering if Andrew had to cut short his oration because of the DAB digital radio ad the station had to run, or because he was embarrassed by the fact that he pronounced Mayor Mc Cheese as "M.C. Cheese"  I clearly heard him chuckle as her read, but then upon realizing the error of assiging Mayor Mc Cheese a title that might give him "Street Cred" Andrew says rather sardonicly, (aprox.) "Ah well he comes from the land where McDonalds is found."  Caw!  Dear Blogger, how desperately I want to be accepted by the British!  P.S.  Ms Word Acting Up, Doing that thing where it types over other letters when you try to insert text, Possiable misspellings afoot.
