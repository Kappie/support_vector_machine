Ropes condition indicated that they have undergone maintenance work with couple of knots on each rope. He himself is wearing a safety belt, no helmet and no jacket to minimize any damage. Legs between a sealed rod and chair he rests his feet on the window’s edge. His face showed an image of a scared man, he wasn’t purely confident of his safety. But perhaps getting the job done as quickly as he could was his utmost priority. With shaking hands he was holding roller in his one hand and trying to balance his seat with another. Whenever he gave an extra push to roll his roller on to the glass his seat would take a big swing and he would struggle to balance it. Started from 8th floor he had come down to fourth his mission was half done. How many times he must have done that before? Risked his life for what we call “earning”, atleast he is far better than the one who beg for living, far better than those who live on “under table resources” and far better than those who feed on the Meager ones.  But is he responsible for his own safety?  What if, with some bad stroke of luck he has an accident? Who will compensate his family? Who will feed his dependants? This is what I call Life. This is what is I call Pakistan, where price of life is maybe of few “Paisas” or even lesser. I must say he is Brave Man. He is a Window Cleaner…  PS: Check out this new link on my side bar it goes  urlLink "Elena's Motorcyle Ride through Chernobyl" . Its about a journey through the horrors of Chernobyl.
