CK was actually one of the first people to train yours truly back in the days before  Mass Storage Area One  even existed (in a place aptly referred to as " the old building "). Now, he's back to ride shotgun in the  Department of Inbound Deliveries  and, more importantly, to take the lead on  Project X . More on that later...  Speaking of the Department of Inbound Deliveries... I returned after my 4-day foray into the world of home nursing to find a veritable mountain of computer cast-offs, all patiently awaiting my attention and assessment in cleverly laid-out, random piles. It was, quite literally, difficult to make heads or tails of the area. But, with a little hard work (those of you who know me personally, don't laugh) and some much appreciated help from the aforementioned CK, it's coming back together nicely after only 2 days. Do I rock, or what?
