The logic behind letting this happen was simple, according to the book. If Zia did not help the US on the Afghanistan issue...  "The Afghan resistance would collapse. The Soviets would triumph. The Zia government would disappear and be replaced by an anti-American one in Pakistan armed with a nuclear weapon" So, in effect the Americans armed Pakistan with nukes because they were afraid Pakistan would get the nukes from somewhere else. Interesting!!
