I've been really enjoying "A Song  of Fire and Ice" I recommend it for anyone interested in fantasy books. Sorry that I haven't posted a lot of personal news lately but unfortunatly it is very hard for me to talk about myself, but I hope you don't mind all the misc. links and such. I will try and post some stuff that is actually personal more or if you would pefer I can post the cool pics and links I find.
