So we get off the plane and board buses to travel for an hour to Camp Doha. This is the main base for the military in this region. Troops  civilians filter in and out, to and from the theatre through this base. This base appears to have a lot of activity. Once at the base we, meaning military  civilians that were deployed from CRC this past week, were dropped off at this staging area. The staging area has two large white open-air tents side by side, one for the military and one for the civilians. When I say open air I mean there are walls on the sides just none on the front or back. One thing that was very noticeable was the heat. Inside those tents you knew you were in the Middle East. A coordinator who is in charge of the civilians meets with us and gives some briefings about what to do and where to go. He then starts handing people off to there point of contacts (POC). After handing everyone off there were us three from ITT and there was no one there to meets us. No biggie. The coordinator tells us to grab our belongings go to the other tent and wait as he will go and contact our POC. Well after about the second hour standing in this hot ass tent waiting for someone that looks like they’re never going to show up we ventured out on our own. After about an hour of search (which required us to bother several people) we found the office of this coordinator. Honestly a few minutes more in the heat and I would have passed out. Rocio didn’t look in too good either. Jim, well that guy seems to be part android because he’s so straightforward and emotionless to almost all situations. In fact I worry that, god forbid, his base was ever bombed he might not run, he’d stand and watch the show. But who knows (I’m kidding Jim in case you read this). It turns out that the coordinator dropped the ball and failed to contact our POC and left us hanging while everyone else left. Fortunately there was a happy ending. We talk with this other coordinator who was very nice and helpful. He promptly called our POC. Our POC (Mike Davis) picked us up and took us on our merry way. In their defense though, this process had just been change to this base where in the past it was handled on another base. So they’re still working out the communication between the offices. Just too bad we had to be the guinea pigs.  As I mentioned life here on this base seem busy. A lot of troops walking around, shopping and going here and there. One thing we’ve all noticed is that the many people we’ve encountered are good-hearted, helpful, considerate people. They happily exchange information about themselves or what life is like downrange. Before coming here, through other sources, I was led to believe that the military didn’t care about and even despised civilian contractor because of the pay we get. Maybe this attitude is different in the theatre, but so far I enjoy meeting these soldiers. Now that I’m here and I see a snippet of there life I can truly say, and not that I didn’t mean it before, but I truly have a new respect for these men  women here. They deserve a lot more credit and respect then we give them.  Our living conditions are somewhat similar to those at Fort Bliss. We are in an open bay inside a big warehouse like structure with bunk beds and wall lockers. Directly outside by the entrance to our bay are some tiki torches, so I call this place the Tiki Palace. There are many people here that kinda do there own thing in their own space. This also is the primary housing for ITT folks as we have talked with many of them, either coming in from the theatre or going out. They too seem friendly and helpful.  One thing I think I haven’t mentioned is the food. To my surprise Army food is pretty good. Of course I can’t eat everything but what I manage to find is mostly very tasty. And I’m talking about both of the bases I’ve been to, Fort Bliss and Camp Doha. On top of that, there’s the fast food court by the PX that has several chains; Subway, Pizza Inn (it’s like Pizza Hut), Baskin  Robins and Kentucky Fried Chicken to name a few. I’ve already eaten at Subway  Pizza Inn. So much for losing weight.  So I just continue on through the process waiting to see what happens next.
