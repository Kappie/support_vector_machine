We can't check into the  urlLink cabin  until 3PM, so we'll go over and pick up the keys from the  urlLink main office  early Saturday afternoon.  I'm trying to get directions faxed to me.  If I get them, I'll post them as a followup.  I'll leave a copy on the kitchen table at Morganton, also.  Daphne will be arriving on Monday late, as she's driving down from the Outer Banks.  We'll all (4) leaving Friday for Norcross, as the kids have to be back at their mom's on Saturday AM.  I'm bringing a tent, an inflatable mattress, and a couple of sleeping bags for overflow of campers.  Does anyone have fireworks?  I don't know what the vibe will be, but it would be nice to have them if we can use them.  Koala dumped the stash that we had in a fit of paranoia.
