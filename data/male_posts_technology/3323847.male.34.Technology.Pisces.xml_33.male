It's called  urlLink "The Day After Tomorrow" .  It's one of those "End of the Earth" types, but with a little more "It could happen" behind it.  Alas, I digress.  The linked article in this posting is what I personally believe we need to be more concerned with.  I've read a few articles and seen a documentary on this "Global Conveyer" theory, and it looks a lot more solid, and possible, than any other  urlLink "Chicken Little"  theory out there.
