The day we arrived walked up to coaker's walk..   just hung around a little and wasted time.. The funny thing is it was not as cold as we expected.. by evening it rained and finally kodai was a hill station.. The next day we went upto pillar rocks purely on foot..   yes sir, a total of 14 kms of walking... the best was yet to come.. The boating.. as with anything it started with a thud when we took the paddle boat.. The beauty of the thing came out when we started on a rowing boat.. and with it came the rain.. we got wet and kept rowing.. now if u have never done that before u should definitely try that... i wish i could row more.. i will someday..  now things at Bangalore have started to pick up.. i am afraid though that i might loose touch with technology if i ONLY remain in touch with people and not technology.. so here it goes.. i will also be involved in development of shared software.. i know of sourceforge.net.. will check that out and volunteer...  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.
