No its not my blog url (the p and s are switched in the word 'blogspot'), it is some religious website. And its true for any web address that ends with blogpsot.com, its forwarded to that page. I think its illegal though i remember yahoo suing pple who had domain names such as yahhoo.com and stuff.   I got a 5 minute presentation to give tommorow and I got no idea what to say. My chosen topic was Indian weddings (dun ask me why i chose it) , and I think im just gonna get some screenshots of my sister's wedding and burn them into a cd and just talk abt each one of them briefly thats abt it.
