Well I say "lower back" but I really mean "ass".  It's not pretty, I'd put pictures up if I didn't know it would mentally scar anyone who saw them.  At least I can sit down now, I was reduced to lying on an inflatable mattress in my living room for the first few days. The TV aerial's broke with perfect timing so I can't even watch Tricia in the mornings and shout at the stupid people.  Alex (girlfriend) should be round soon to help relieve the boredom, which is nice.  Just finished watching Rocky on DVD, I'm amazed at how I still can't help but shout "C'mon Rocky!" during the last 5 minutes of the film.  Watched a recent video interview with Sly afterwards, he looks funny.  Not quite Michael Jackson funny, but not a million miles away.
