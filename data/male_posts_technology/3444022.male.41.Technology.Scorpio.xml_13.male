Marina didn't believe it, I did but wanted it verified, since it was the first time in Rita's life that that word was spoken in the morning, first thing.  In any case - verification turned the proper smell (very blatantly so) and that was incredible for both of us.    Then we drove to the daycare and for the  first time Rita did NOT cry !!!  This made our day, week and month!
