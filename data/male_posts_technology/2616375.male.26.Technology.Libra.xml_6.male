Of course, I have "heard" numerous times about people talking about how great the MVP program really is.. but this is one documented musing :) At the MVP Summit, the Product Groups jostled for attention of MVPs and that is a fact important enough to realise the importance of "community" thinking in the products MS is developing going forward.  No application in the world has tighter community integration than the one i have seen with MS Office 2003.    The community is at the guts of a "commercial" product..  And if you have been following  urlLink Bill's speech at CEO Summit , you would know about the community and blogs he talked about..  Now if only you were wondering why Product Groups are standing up and taking notice :) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.
