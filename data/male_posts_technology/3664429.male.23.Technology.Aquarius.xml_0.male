They covered all the vet bills as well. He had feline leukemia (paraleukemia or something.. he had no white blood cells.)  as well as advanced liver disease.  Such a young age to go through this.  He had a good home during his last days.  The vet said we would have waken up Saturday morning to a dead kitten.    On a bright side, we got to choose two kittens.  My kitten is a totally smokey colored kitten, born 1 week before Buddy, and is a soft cute fluffy thing.  Right now, his name is Silvio.  That may change.  The other kitten's name is Paulie.  The two are brothers.. and Paulie is mostly grey/black with a white stomach and feet.    I feel really bad right now, I choose Buddy because he looked like he needed a home.  I hope his last few days were a pleasant one.  I slept on the couch with him this morning, and he came over and laid in my hands.  I will miss this kitten.
