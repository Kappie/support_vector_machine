ALong with tragic situations.  I am now temporarly blind.  I have about 30% of my vision.  Why this has happened I am also unaware.  Anyone looking in might ask.  What is he doing to deserve this?  I really do not know.  Many times we can be a llight of widsom of Jesus and others sometimes we doubt ourselves why and where we are at in out lives.  I just hope this storm passes soon.
