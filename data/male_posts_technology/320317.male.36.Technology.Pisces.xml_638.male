 I honestly believe the macs are cool, and I think the new "iLife" is pretty cool integration, but their market share is dwindling in mainstream america. I guess the "switchers" program doen't seem be working. In fact instead of coming up with hard fast sales numbers, Steve Jobs talks about browser stats on their switcher web site instead. Nice spin.
