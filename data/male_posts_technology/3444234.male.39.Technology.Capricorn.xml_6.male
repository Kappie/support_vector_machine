We went a month ago for the first time, but  Bun  was only 7 weeks old at that stage and that's a bit early to start talking about being pregnant on a public forum! Everything seems to be going well though, so I thought I'd start a journal of what happens for a father through a pregnancy. What the heck is a  Bun  you may ask? Well it seems to be a good idea to have a code name for a baby before it's born, makes it easier to talk about. So as near as we can figure  Bun  was conceived on or around Saturday 27 March 2004. On that day we went to a wedding of our friends Cherie and Curtis at  urlLink Bundaleer Rainforest Gardens , and  Bun  is the oven, so to speak, so that's how the name came about. Incidentally also on that day  urlLink Campbell Newman  was elected Lord Mayor of Brisbane (so we had to vote too - what a busy day that was! Hehe). For some reason Jo resisted my idea of  Campbell  as a codename though.  Bun  it is.  Anyhow, that makes  Bun  11.5 weeks or so today, and today we got to hear the heartbeat, thumping loud and strong in amongst all Jo's gurgling bowel noises (lol). Well I guess we were waiting for lunch at the time. A month ago the doctor had done an ultrasound so I got to see the heartbeat way back then as well. There's not too much at 7 weeks, just a blinking pixel on the screen, but Dr Bretz assured me it was good strong heartbeat. So far so good!  Jo of course is a legend champion mother - no morning sickness, no strange cravings. Of course she could be having symptoms and she'd never tell you, but I think she's had an easy time of it so far. Fingers crossed that can keep going! She's doing some Pilates exercises a few times a week to stay in shape for the birth - that woman plans ahead.   Next week I have to travel to Thailand for work, which is bad because week 12 is when you have the first major scan called a  urlLink Nuchal scan . Nuchal means neck, it's a test where they where they measure the thickness of the back of the neck and it can help identify  urlLink Down syndrome . At Jo's age there's around a 1 in 300 chance this could happen, so we will be quite nervous about the outcome of that test. At this stage all I want to hear is "Normal, Average, Par". We don't have to be super human, let's just be OK. It's a nervy time. Once the first trimester is over (13 weeks) the baby has completed initial development and things are set in place. I look forward to coming back from Thailand, watching  urlLink Euro 2004 , and celebrating making it to 13 weeks with Jo. Then we will breathe a little easier.
