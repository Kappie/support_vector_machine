Word of Advice: I have no advice so I’ll keep Steven’s >>   The years fly by faster and faster as you get older (or so it seems). Take a step back and realize that the pain and suffering you might be feeling at the moment will pass, and the year will pass. Enjoy your young carefree years while you still have them, they are slowly shrinking, at the same time, don't be afraid to take responsibility
