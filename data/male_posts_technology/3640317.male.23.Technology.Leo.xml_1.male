Many of us dreamed of becoming an astronaut when we were young. Some of us never got over that dream. But  John Glenn  rode the shuttle in 1998 at the age of 77;  :-) So keep your dreem alive and try hard to make it.  So, how do you become an astronaut? Few tips - ;-)  1. Learn how to work effectively in a team environment.  2. The "minimum degree requirement" is a bachelor's from an accredited institution. A good "Master of Science" is better.  3. After college, 3 years of related increasingly responsible professional experience.  4. Very good communication skill, not only verbally, but written as well. It's a good idea for an astronaut to be bilingual as well.   5. And get ready for a rigorous training program.  Being an astronaut can be hard on family life .  6. Health # Height 64 and 76 inches, 20/70 Corrected to 20/20, blood Pressure-140/90.  [All these information are collected from different sites.]
