The concept of a  urlLink five-year-old girl giving birth  seems so bizarre I’m fairly sure I shouldn’t believe it. However, I understand snopes to be fairly credible and they cite a fair few sources as well.      Regardless of our squeamishness, we have to note that the claim of a five-year-old girl giving birth is apparently true. Her name was Lina Medina, a Peruvian girl from the Andean village of Ticrapo who made medical history in 1939 when she gave birth to a boy by caesarean section in May 1939 at the age of five years, seven months and 21 days.    While having a look around myself,I found  urlLink one  or  urlLink two  other reports from seemingly reputable sources. Very odd.
