Anderson prequels, it is not up to the quality of the original Frank Herbert novels but it was still good fun.  Some of the threads are finally coming together and the Cymek and Zensunni story lines are no longer total bores.  The twists this book took at the end were really surprising and I'm definitely looking forward to  urlLink  Dune: The Battle of Corrin    , the final book in  The Legends of Dune  trilogy, which comes out next month.
