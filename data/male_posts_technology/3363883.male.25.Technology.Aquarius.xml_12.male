In Australia, everyone is very appreciative of their sport and enjoy it.  I think the typical Australian will be more than content to sit down with a beer and watch just about anything.  If Australia is playing, even better.  There will be cheers of Aussie-Aussie-Aussie which has thankfully died down an awful lot after the sydney olympics.  However, the English are deeply passionate about two things; their country and football/soccer.  It's funny.  In no way am I not patriotic.  I will be one of the first people to say that Australia is the best place in the world.  We're loud and boistrous and enjoy ourselves.  If someone says their country is better, we'll listen to their argurmen, weigh up what they say and probably tell them to blow it out their arse and go for a beer.  n England, people can't even conceive that there is a better place and people will be tempted to be almost violently opposed to anyone saying otherwise.  Their passion is very deep, stiff and I think old fashioned.    However, it is very entertaining.  There is nothing like being in an English pub and watching Wayne Rooney score for england.  I'm afraid even Australia couldn't top that.  Everyone's hugging and buying each other beers and shouting  "Roon-ey Roon-ey" and the good times are rolling.  This was last night when England beat Switzerland 3-0 in the group stage of Euro 2004.  I thought it was a good game, I don't know which I enjoyed more, the game or the crowd.  I was the ONLY person in the 100 person crowd [in a pub that fits 50] to NOT wear an enlgish football top.  I got a couple of weird looks but eventually it was circulated that I was Australian and supported Enlgand while I was here and that was all fine.    Tally-Ho.  A friend here told me that to be a true English Supporter there are a number of criteria: 1]Drink two pints of wife-beater [Stella [long story]] in the first half 2]Drink 4 pints in the second half 3]Think Emile Heskey plays like a Donkey on acid.  From here, There are two schools of thought.  If England lost, the people from the old school of thought would get a couple more rounds in, start calling out "IN-GI-LAND" and then make for the nearest non-white person and knock his block off.  The new school of thought is to just weep quietly and think about what went wrong.  The most obvious response is always "Why the f*ck did Sven [coach] put Heskey on!!".  I prefer the new school of thought.  Much safer for the token australian.  England played france in their first game.  I didn't know much at the time so I'm assuming you [dear reader] don't either.  GOing into the match, France has not lost a game in the previous 18 matches and hadn't been scored against in the last 11.  That's pretty strong.   I went to a very good friends place that evening for the game.  He did a real treat of cooking a luscious barbeque.  Thankyou Neil, the mozarella, basil and tomatoe sausages were stunning.  And everyone was in a good mood.  This was hightened when England managed to score the opening goal.  You could actually hear the whole neighbourhood scream out at the same time.  Oh Happy times.  The rest of the game was about England just trying to stay ahead.  There was a penalty where Beckham miscalculated his kick and kcicked almost to the goalie [whom he had played at Manu for the previous three years].  This sent a bit of an emotional shockwave though the english team, they got slow and tired.  So what did the best team in the world do?  They came back to score one goal in the last 30 seconds of the game and then to win by scoring in injury time.    This is stuff that heroes are made of .. .. .. in france.  So I am eagerly waiting the final match against croatia so see if where the emotional roller coaster takes me.
