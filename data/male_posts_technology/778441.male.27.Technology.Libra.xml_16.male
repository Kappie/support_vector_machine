Makes the home complete! :-)   Indians played some great cricket on the last day at Trentbridge in Nottinghamshire (correct me if I'm wrong here! ... I mean the location of TrentBridge). The big three, Sachin, Saurav and Dravid fired when the chips were down and ensured that India stays in the hunt in the series by drawing the Test match. Great work guys! ... Keep it up!! ... Added to it was the fact that the other players...  i.e. the famous Indian tail , played dogged cricket which was dour at times but always effective! Agarkar is improving by leaps and bounds as a batsamn and thats good news! The kid in the team (17 yr old Parthiv Patel) showed guts to stick it out till the end.   What else?! ... nothing much from the personal front! ... apart from that... ummmm... oh yes! ... India got a brand new Vice-President yesterday. Bhairon Singh Shekhawat of BJP is the new VP.   Well, I joined the Proud 2 B Indian clique. Its homepage is at  urlLink http://www.freewebs.com/proudindian . Seems like a nice idea! And with India's Independence Day approaching fast  (15th August) , it seemed very timely too!! :-)   Anyways, thats it for now. cheers!
