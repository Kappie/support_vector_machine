I read Steven’s blog at something like 5am and in it he said that he was prolly pulling an all-nighter, and sure enough, he was on aim, so we talked for a couple hours. He bailed though and slept through church (lol). I got back home and slept from 2pm till past 7:30pm. At something like 8:30, someone knocked at my door, and assuming it was my sister (who was currently being hyper with three equally hyper friends), I opened it. It turned out to be Adri who was returning my overcoat that I had left at her house last week. Eventually we (Melissa too, who was with Adri) went over to Josh’s house from some reason, picked him up and went to the Gadeholts. We stayed there for a bit then visited Christine the restaurant where she works, visited Josh’s brother at his work, and went to Starbucks. We went back to Adri’s house with our drinks and ice cream (obtained from the restaurant) in tow, but left again because we didn’t want to wake up her parents with all our noise. We went back to the Gadeholt’s house (Christine was off work by this time) and ate our ice cream and such… Since it was approaching midnight, we decided to get back to our houses, and on the way back to mine, we noticed that the snow that had been falling all night was finally sticking :) (lol - awesomeness). Once Adri and Melissa (who was staying at Adri’s) got back home, they called me and we talked for… 3 hours and 20-something minutes (lol).   I woke up just before noon today and got ready to go out to lunch with my grandparents. Before we got there though, we stopped at a couple random parking lots Southridge etc… and did some power-driving on the slick roadways. Man, that’s a nice VW that they have :). We went out for lunch, went back to house, and Ralph and I took off to go get me some experience driving a manual transmission on slick roads. Turns out that I’m too big for the driver’s seat of his truck (lol – annoying non-moving steering column).
