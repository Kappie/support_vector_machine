And thanx for ur words of appreciation too.....  and jax regarding this layout, please increase the font size of the writer and also let it be a bit below the line without dashing the line.  And kadaisila keela irukara that notice kooda romba brighta irukku. Can dim a bit.  I have uploaded my wedding album in files section in the form of PPS, prepared by srini.  FYI all the snaps in the presentation have been taken by one of srini's close friend who is learning photography and its been taken without our knowledge. So u can expect some surprising expressions on our album! As the official photographs are @ madurai, we have prepared this album, using only those snaps taken by his friend. So only his friends and not our friends are there in the album! Dont get disappointed. Will turn out with some more snaps with our friends on it soon. So wait for the next release.....  Ok then will mail u all later Bye for now Ranjini
