Which is ok for driving I guess, not that any of us can drive officially yet.  Actually I'm really annoyed right now, I know that a number of you went to see 'Catch Me If You Can', I am led to believe Jackie and Jenny went. Thank you both of you, I guess people really don't listen to me, I'll repeat what I said to you both in January: 'I want to go see Catch Me If You Can, shall we go together in February' and you both said 'sure'.  Thank you, you have both just proved my point on how  no one listens to me .
