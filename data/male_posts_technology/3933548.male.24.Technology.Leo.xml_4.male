It does have beautiful landscapes, snowy forests, a fantastic place. I always love to be in my village eventhough I can't because my work place is located in the Garden city of India "Bangalore".       Payyampally is covered with amazing greenaries. I completed my school from payyampally(St Catherine's HSS). The village is occuppied with Christians, Jains and Hindus. And we have a great tradition of communal Harmony in Payyampally. The silent nature, greenary and the good people always force me to go back to Payyampally and enjoy Payyampally
