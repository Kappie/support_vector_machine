It's the best. It was good to see Dej again. Been like forever since I saw her last. Also, Megan was there. In case you can't remember she was the waitress there way back when I started going. It was weird cause we had the Pete's combo pizza with breadsticks and pepsi, and she's all like, you're still getting that. and I'm like yep, haven't changed. But really, I usually order like calzone with feta cheese and sundried tomatoes, it's just tonight I felt like pizza.  Sometimes I wish I were a performing artist.
