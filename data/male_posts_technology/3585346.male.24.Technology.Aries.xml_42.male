Freddy and Jezamine has been couple since secondary 2 really is one of the couple that most of us envied most and not to mention it does not come easy.  Walking with them along Wisma and Taka kind of remind me of our secondary school days, when we got nothing to do but to walk and talk cock. Our joker, Chi Chuan, was all time funny since secondary school. With him around there will always be non stop laughter.  Just finish watching a TV show, it goes like this "If you have a Dream, walk towards it."  "Si vous avez un rÃªve, marchez vers lui."
