I wore the shoes of yellow majesty and they carried me along effortlessly as I ran.  After no ability to run this past weekend due to lack of time or work emergencies, my body was itching to get back out there.  I ran along one of my favorite routes down Madison, Grandin, Erie to Hyde Park Square, whatever that road is, Madison, Woodburn to home.  I started mildly slow and picked it up as usual.  I warmed up and stretched out during the run and felt so good, I still have trouble believing my speed in the end.  To give you some perspective for how fast I was going, my feet were landing in perfect time to The Twist by Chubby Checker.  If I had to guess, I was going just below 8 minute pace but with very little effort.  Update for 4/28/04 I don't know how to explain tonight's run.  It was good and bad, tiring and fulfilling, difficult and easy all at the same time.  I guess my body was just tired or something.  I only ran 30 minutes and the first half was a complete dichotomy from the second half.  The first half was sluggish and exhausting as I plodded along.  The second half was like normal where I could just run without much effort and I was going at a faster pace.  I don't really know how else to explain it beyond that.  My body felt good for the most part.  My knee pain has subsided to the point I can go 26 miles without fear of hurting anything.  Being one of my last runs, it was a good indicator that I have to get back onto a normal sleep schedule and get some more rest before this thing goes down.  Other than that, it was all good as I wound through Eden Park.
