It was all inclusive, so all food and drinks were included.  The food was excellent.  The hotel also put on a show every night.  We watched two of the shows "The Perfect Date" and "The Michael Jackson Show".  The Perfect Date picked 3 couples from the audience and had them do little physical contests.  It was pretty funny.  The Michael Jackson Show was amazing.  The impersonator was excellent.
