Since i have got some work to be finished this weekend, my plan of updating the database section of our group is a bit postponed. Once its done i will send u all the links where in u can update more information if any. And yes jax, as usual before u could say i have started promoting our blog to our friends who can be potential dayworkers. If it works out then i think u can invite them.   And friends i was on leave yesterday. Woweeeeeeee i was feeling bored at office except for a piece of blogging. And so yesterday i rested and did just i wanted to do.  Got up late, read my favourite books, Chatted with my cousin at hostel, ate well, spent sometime more with srini, prayed well and ofcourse dint do any work.......... went to bed late woweeeeeeeeee good i am feeling fresh after a tiny break.........
