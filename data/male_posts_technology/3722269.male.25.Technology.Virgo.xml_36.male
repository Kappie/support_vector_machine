Sounds like apocolypse is here folks, did you pack your 8 litres of water? have you got your fire extinguishers - and most importantly, have you worked out how to irc without a phoneline or electricity? We had some madd cool undulating earthy-type quakes today, that lasted for several seconds, and sent all the doggies and birdies in an uproar, and trees and powerlines all swayin n shit.. I like nature, and I respect her ability to pummle me into dust if she so desires. The rocking earth reminded me of how hard my sister and I laughed when we watched from a moving car, oblivious to why it was happening, but frightened people running about madly, and a gentleman fall off his bike like he'd suddenly got a case of 'sux to much to stay upright' I think I was about 7, so she would've been 9 - to us it was just funny... but this has got me thinking, theres a lot of predictions out there about just when and where and how the world will eventually decide enough is enough and erradicate this plague that we know as..well.. us, humans.. people.  I watched a documentary called Walking with Cavemen, it was pretty cool, went through the supposed evolution of man from jibbering ape through to what apparently makes us 'different' and 'better' and special, which is our ability to imagine, or think about things that dont actually exist. After thinking about it for a while I realised that yes, it makes sense that that was a huge thinking paradigm shift, and that it probably is what has enabled us to fuck up the planet like no other species would've ever managed. Way to go us! hoorah. Nature will cane our collective ass, and most likely with cataclysmic resource or atmospheric change.. even tho alien invasion or something else would be totally cooler. Nevermind. I love the scene in The Time Machine, that depicts how this would happen, or at least, how I percieve it to happen, and seeing as this is -my- blog, what I say goes. Right?. Good. Basically we've all noticed the seasons slipping around so that winter starts later, summer goes on longer, and it doesnt take a huge imagination to forecast that if that keeps happening we will inevitibly be summering in what is now our winter, and wintering in what is now our summer.  Understandably this will screw with the animals, the poor unsuspecting bystanding animals, and plants that will all be 'wtf mate?' as they emerge expecting warm tropical weather, and freeze a grizzly cold death. too bad, how sad, never mind. I'm not quite sure how the trickle down effect will go exactly, but I suspect that this seasonal shifting we'll survive just fine, for now... we'll cope, in that it wont wipe us out... I see us having far more of a hand in our own destruction than all that malarky. A swift extinction, by comparison. I suspect the oil reserves in the world will run out. America, being by far the biggest consumer of all things oily, will then have to either, curl up and die, or declare war on somewhere else to get their oil - which is far more likely. Eventually someone will fire the first big warhead, boom, then it will be avenged boom... and before you know it, there's nuclear missiles flying around all over the place, decimating the majority of life... then we end up in a sort of world-wide post-chernobyl apocolyptic ickyness.. barren harsh scorched land, polluted water sources, dead rotting food sources, and well.. mass deadness. Killed dead, even. I often thought, when I was a kid that it'd be 'super cool gee willickers neatoriffic' to have a whole house, underground, n shit.. well, in these circumstances that'd pretty much be gauranteed.. the fall out from the bombs would probably result in a big cloud of fucked up smokey shit artificially blocking out the sun, causing madd snowing and extreme cold... and we'd have an ice age.. thats all good, pockets of people will band together and survive, hell theres probably whacked americans already stocking their bunkers in preparation. Countries landscapes will change dramatically, the waterlevels will change, some land will dissapear, earthquakes will create more islands, NZ was created like this eons ago, a couple of techtonic plates smackin' together and jutting up outta the sea.. hey presto the mountain range that runs down our countries backbone. Neat. Not so neat when it happens in reverse tho, and we're all plunged soggily to our doom. Doom de doooom doom dooom dooom *snaps out of invader zim mode* Yes the world will end, but much like my own life, I realise I can live in fear of it suddenly not being there one day, and spend my time best trying to plan for that time, or I can carry on and enjoy myself and not bare the burden of that stress, which is what I choose to do... you might be different, and if you are, I'll probably be the first person to rack up and offer to join you in your subterranian shelter, humour, after all, will keep you sane. mmm. Anyway, I think TopGear is on prime soon, so toodleoo!
