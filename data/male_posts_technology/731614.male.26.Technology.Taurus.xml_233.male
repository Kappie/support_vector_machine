That it's possible for me to add one more thing to my life to feel guilty about (infrequent posting). Thanks, Boz.  That there are more quizzes floating around the internet than should be allowed by law.   That the house is always empty when I'm around. Coincidence?  That, although we may never meet. I'm better for living here and knowing you. This place has helped me through a pretty tough time.   Marci... You're giving up a good thing here. But isn't that always the way?
