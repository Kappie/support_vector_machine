Especially when 10 feet away, there's a decent cooker that will do things so much better.  Yes, had a BBQ today. Well it was sunny.  Went to Skoda garage, was full of old folk. So didn't get one. Somehow ended up in a Ford garage and got a Focus ST170. I'm not a big fan of the Focus, but this one seems OK. Not a bad deal, ex-demo Â£9999, 8700 miles. I get it Thursday.
