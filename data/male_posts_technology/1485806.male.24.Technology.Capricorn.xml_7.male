The plane bounced 3 times before settling down on the ground . News later came by Capt Ramlan saying the latest strain of SARS  by WHO and they sprayed the plane with disinfectant everywhere. SIok chye looks suspiciously contagious with his ever sneezes which draws unnecssary attention from the flight attendants.  Went to the University of WA , WOW - it was fanstastic, the weather is 12 degrees celcius and the University College was good, Life here it seems slow paced with fantastic sceneries and street floor so clean u can lick off it....Shops closed on 5.00 pm and the city is closed at 9.00 including the service stores.  I am glad the day before i went and bought a digital camera 3.2 Megapixel with 16 RAM for RM 800 where i bargained non stop with the guy for 20 minutes. Took lots of photos around 60 of them with sun rise on Maltida Bay , the ppl and friends.  On Sunday i went to a church nearby....i met this girl Poh Lee ...who incidentally attending DUMC who is joining SIB soon./ Both of us met up and really had a good time together....hint hint./....  We went to UWA on that Sunday morning...looking for the OCF or the church. On the day i was praying for wisdom to look for the right church as all churches here are mainstream Anglican and Catholic churches. I can't get used to it so i prayed God specifically for Spirit Powered Bible Based Ready to Serve church and lo and behold  The Lord lead us to this nice church planted by the City Christian Church...who incidentally the same mother church produced the  Prophesy Album...it was planted recently in UWA and it is known as the Crawley Christian Church...pastored by Ps Darren ..the youth Pastor...the same church who produced Walk On Water Album,  I praised God for even leading us both to the right church...that day Ps Darren's dad who is the Oral Robertson 's professor gave an AWESOME sermon. He talked about why most churches ordained pastors and send them to the worker's field and not the politician, business man or even students/ He have preached this to many churches as have ordained and annointed businessmen, students, politicians and even beggars with the power of the Holy Spirit and even on the day , lives were changed almost immediately . There was this beggar who came to church looking for food. and Darren's dad prayed for Him prophesying to the beggars the plans of God in his life. The beggar later received food and clothing, and then worked for the church and gain himself an education and now he owned one of the largest business in US giving almost half a million dollars for tithes each month and spreading the gospel like wildfire.  We had a great time praising the Lord and even then the church moves into temporary place every Sunday which happens to be the restaurant byt Maltida Bay.  I got to go...more great news...and  PS : Bought a discman , clothes, chocolates and souvernirs.
