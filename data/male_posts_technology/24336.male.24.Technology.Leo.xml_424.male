Instead of doing what everyone else was doing (using Powerpoint), I decided to use  urlLink Flash .  That required *learning* Flash first.  I spent about 3 hours on the presentation itself and 40 hours on learning Flash.  I think it was worth it.  See the final result  urlLink here  (The page numbers are used as front and back buttons).
