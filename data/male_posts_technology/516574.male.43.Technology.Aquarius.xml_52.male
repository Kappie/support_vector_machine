False  -- from 1980 to the present, I've gone to the voting booths twice: Carter/Reagan and Clinton/Bush (and the only one of *those* four I voted for was Bill...)   2. I pay little or no attention to the campaign ads aired on television prior to a presidential election.   As  True  as is humanly possible, given the saturation rate and the amount of TV I watch...   3. I can see myself running for some type of political office someday.  Oh,  *hell*  no, definitely  False  -- too g@$@#* many skeletons in  this  closet, yawl...   4. I believe we will see a woman become president in my lifetime.   True  (although the optimism of that answer is still buried under a few layers of skeptical cynicism...)   5. I try to keep an open mind regarding all political issues.   True , if we define 'an open mind' as being "I ain't deciding who I think's right until at least *one* of you makes an  attempt  to give me an intelligent answer!"...   6. I believe the drinking age should be raised.  Kinda  True  (yes, now that I'm officially  Old , I can say that -- if I was still in the college dorms, I'd naturally argue the other direction...)   7. I think the legal age to vote should be raised.  I kinda like the idea that guy in California had about letting  urlLink 14-to-17-year-olds vote , so I guess that's a  False ...   8. I thought these questions were interesting.   Well, certainly not in  urlLink the Chinese sense , so:  False ...   9. I will be back to play again!  Oh, so  True ...   [and I'm skipping the Bonus Question this week because  urlLink I have nothing interesting to say, and no way to say it ...]
