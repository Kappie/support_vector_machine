Today is my last day of freedom before summer school starts tomorrow *Shakes Fist*, I really do hate my math teacher, giving me a goddman 69 in Pure 20, but then again, its hard to learn when the teacher isn't even positive about the material in the course.  As for what I'm doing today, not a hell of alot, got to finish up configuring and installing the rest of the software on a computer I built for a Client, after I do that, probably not a hell of alot, seeing how its my last day of total freedom for all of July.
