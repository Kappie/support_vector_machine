TOday's paper is freaking different from the previous years' exams. And yes, all the students are swearing the way out. No, they come out then they swear.  Ok, so what's the freaking good news? Well today, my group back our grp project for OOSD, and we got the highest of all groups, with a whopping 97.5%, we have (choose 1 from the below)  beat, blow off, blow out, breeze, bulldoze, conquer, edge, finish off, gain, gain victory, lock, nose out, overcome, overwhelm, plow under, prevail, rack up, rake in, shellac, shut down, shut out, sink, sneak past, snow, succeed, triumph, upset, walk over     the ang mohs.. wahahhahaha... Bring it on!  Ok, so that's the good news. Bad news, is that its that its rather hard for today's paper, so i am just keeping all fingers cross for good marks. So lestan is going to take 1.5day break, before mugging for the next paper lah. so i will be very prompt in blogging for at least next 1 week.  So what's mingquan's plan for tomorrow? i am going for a run ard city, then going for retail therapy, and hopefully can meet my friend when she knock off work. THen i need to do my notices for selling the following items          (GOING HOME SALE!)  	- HP 920c Deskjet	($89)  ----(both printer + scanner= $150) 	- Scanner		($89)    	- Toaster		($20) 	- Iron		        ($20) 	- Utencils(All)		($15) How's the price? is it a bit mercenary? hmm do comment about it.
