There was supposed to be a poker tournament today at Mitchells as I stated yesterday I believe, but that was cancelled due to, something, I dunno....so I just played poker online (WHICH SUCKS!) and lost miserably. For example, I had an Ace high flush, which only a couple hands can beat as you probably know...well there was only one combination of 2 cards  that could of beat me, And some guy just happen to have it after I bet like, half my stack. It was a depressing moment in my life.  And let me introduce Robin (the girl who made the only comment on my last post, to those of you who don't know her. Robin is a girl that I met on www.gamefaqs.com, on one of the social boards there (LUE). She posted a picture of herself, I thought she was cute, so I added her to MSN Messenger and started talking to her, more and more, along with liking her more and more. I then found out that she had a webcam, and so we started camming back and forth, until my cam started to hate my computer at some random time. So now, I usually just watch her as we talk...Creepy? Yes, very....Anyhow, I'm rather obsessed with her, and would give my left arm to meet her, but she lives in Newfoundland, so that makes it extremely hard. :(   I know that most of you (out of the 4 of you who read this blog) don't really care too much about my "love life" as the kids say, but this is a very rare occurance for me, so whoever doesn't like it, can kindly go fuck yourselves ^_^
