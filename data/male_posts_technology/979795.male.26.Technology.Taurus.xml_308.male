By the way, the old one konked out on us yesterday. Had a hard time clearing some of the food. Let's just say I went to bed a bit heavier and feeling satisfied.  Wasn't the only one to be abit late. Tommy and Cody came while I was changing. We did shomenuchi ikkyo, iriminage and I'm sure there's something else that I just can't remember right now. The second half was a lot of suwari-waza. nikkyo and sankyo. Felt a bit more balanced than lasttime. But still had a lot of problems. It's weird though, I never used to feel that suwariwaaza was fun, but I did today. Maybe things just felt they were in place... dunnoz. We kinda ended with kaitennage (and of course kokyu ho). Again, my kokyuho felt really crappy. All in all, it's been fun. Looking forward to Thurs's class at Siglap.  Oh yea, got home just in time to see the new fridge. Wooo...
