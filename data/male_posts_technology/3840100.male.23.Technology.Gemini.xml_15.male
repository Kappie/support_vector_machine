I'm actually thinking about re-mastering some of the older recordings that I have made in the past.  We'll see where that idea goes.  Right now the main focus is getting the  urlLink Third Rail  songs done and out of the way.  Once those are complete Off the Deep End will finally reach the Internet.  So as you can see re-mastering isn't much of a high priority right now.  I've been toying with the idea of a singles collection which I would re-master songs for sure in that case.  Other than all that stuff I spent the day sleeping so nothing new has happened.  Go Red Sox!!!
