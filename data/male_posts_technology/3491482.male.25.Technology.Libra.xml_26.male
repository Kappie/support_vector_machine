And, although DPRK is playing ball by continuing to threaten our national security by attempting to produce WMD, it is unlikely that the US will attempt to overthrow Kim Jong Il.  There are a variety of reasons why not, including the great liklihood of collateral damage to South Korea and the much higher cost in both treasure and blood.  Too bad, IMO.  DPRK could really shine, just like their southern neighbor, if only they had a decent government.
