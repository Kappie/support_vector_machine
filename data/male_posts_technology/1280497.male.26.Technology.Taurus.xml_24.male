Judge for yourselves, though I think this would be tough to fake. Well, not tough so much as just unlikely that anyone would bother. I think it's interesting, though, because it gives a look into the life of someone who's pretty driven by business; I felt tired just reading about all the events, the conferences, the business meals, and the traveling.
