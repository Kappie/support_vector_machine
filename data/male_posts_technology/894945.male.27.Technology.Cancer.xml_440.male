You see I doubt you did, due to the fact that some fucker decided to delete my post, most likely due to the fact that my post voiced my opinions to the Toaster Crew, and someone didn't like that opinion!!!  I believe in the right to free speech and the act of deleting my post goes against the whole point of the site, which as I thought, is meant to be used to voice opinions, events and happenings, good or bad, that go on. I doubt many people will read this post before it gets deleted, but if you do then understand that you are one of an unspoken minority that will have experienced my words, and therefore they will have beared at least a little weight, before being wiped from existance by the powers that be on the Toaster Files............FREE SPEECH!  Baity signing off......
