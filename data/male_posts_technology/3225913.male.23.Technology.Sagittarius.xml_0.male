Freedom that knows no boundaries. Freedom people and nations preach about that we can only dream of...   Mostly likened to bands like Travis and Coldplay, I would say they're rather in a league of their own. Comparisons aside, let their music convince you.   Hopes and Fears  opens with   Somewhere Only We Know  , dismissing your doubts on a no-guitar policy.  "Oh simple thing, where have you gone. I'm getting old and I need something to rely on" . Somehow I guess it makes one miss his/her past. Like an emotional journey alongside meloncholia.   Bedshaped   is a track you should never listen to before heading out on a friday night. It's got this burst that drags you down halfway down the bridge which makes you want to stay in and play the track all over again.     Everybodys Changing   one of 2 singles released might very well be one of the finest tracks of 2004. As the piano escalates higher, you can't help but feel emotional satisfaction from within. A redemption of sorts.   The most outstanding track however, titled   She Has No Time   is a song about (in my interpretations) us, people taking the simplest of things for granted.  "Think about the lonely people, then think about the day she found you".   While we complain about not having enough to spend or worry if we'll ever get that exclusive limited edition Gucci outfit, others worry about whether there's still food left in yesterday's dumping area, whether they'll live another day with shoot-outs in war torn countries while people who call themselves  leaders  fight  THEIR  wars. That's how powerful this song is and how far it'll take you. To tear along to this song is to feel human for 5mins 45s. It implores on changes in the world we live in.   Hopes and Fears  is an album that means giving yourself a chance to grief a little and to wallow in your bed on a rainy sunday morning.
