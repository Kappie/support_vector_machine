Sometimes I wish it was easier to : - not give any money away so I could buy a sports car - be able to use all of my vacation time for a really long family vacation - buy really expensive and nice things and not feel a twinge of something in my soul - care about my career like other people - have normal hobbies like maybe golf or tennis (well maybe those aren't normal... or maybe they are) - care only about my children and not the rest of the younger generation - not think about how to provide experiences where my kids meet Jesus Am I that weird?
