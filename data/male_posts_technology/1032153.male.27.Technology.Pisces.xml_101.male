Why do you do the things you do? I wish I could see everyone's agendas. That would make life so easy.   But I can't so I just wonder. And I think about it often. What really makes the people I know tick?  I want to conform my own agendas to the only worthwhile one. That of God's. I want to see things as they really are. I want to be caught up with his good news so much that I can't help but tell it.
