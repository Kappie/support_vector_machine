I had a bit of time to kill after getting off the train so I went for a bit of a wander around the city.  So I've been in the Cambridge office for 3 days now. The job is good and the people friendly. There is no tuckshop which will be good for my waistline but currently I'm craving snacks!  My  urlLink HDD case  arrived on Tuesday. I had a few problems at first getting it working with the aluminum case on but once I added a bit of card under the circuit board to act as insulation it worked fine. It is really small, hardly bigger than a 2.5" drive and it works really well.  Also to arrive on Tuesday was the adoption certificate for my gibbon. NCorp  urlLink adopted  me a gibbon to remind me of them as my leaving gift. I'm sure that I have a part share in a whole troop of gibbons but I like to think there is one that's mine. I have called him Dobbo.  Andy  Anita came to dinner on Tuesday night. After dinner the whole proceedings kind of deteriorated into Kirsten and Anita playing the drums while Andy tried to fix my  urlLink sparc station . Much fun was had by all.  Yesterday Labhaoise passed her driving test so K and her when to look at cars together. Pete, Labhaoise, K and I went to see  urlLink Shrek 2  in the evening which was really good.  Labhaoise was going to drive us home but then the lights in Pete's car broke (again) so he drove us back to our house. Pete and I  urlLink fixed  the lights so Labhaoise could drive the car back to their house.
