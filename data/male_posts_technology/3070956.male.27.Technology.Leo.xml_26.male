I've been using the service for many years - and I like it, because they will receive my  paper  bills and allow me to pay them online. Well, since I've started my company my income has been much more irregular and I've neglected (avoided, really) checking my bills and managing my finances, in addition I've cancelled most of the automatic payments I was making when I had a regular paycheck.   Now, my car insurance bill is mailed to Paytrust. I forgot that I turned off the automatic payment option for it, and I haven't been paying attention... the bill went overdue andmy car insurancewas cancelled mid-June without my knowledge! uugh.   Now I'm re-insured as of today, but the insurance company is required to send out a notice that I am not insured, which has happened once before... and then it causes a huge hassle, because the state will want me to fill out a form stating that I didn't use the car during that time... but I received three tickets during that time, too! uugh.  -Ryan Riehle
