I've been bumping along fairly well the last few months - sure there have been rough spots here and there, but generally things have been good until I found out I couldn't go to NZ. Then things just all started falling apart for me.  The conclusion that I've come to is that not going to NZ stripped away my main goal for the moment, so suddenly without something to work towards I've been a mess physically, mentally, and emotionally.  I've also realised that I have a lack of goals I can directly work towards now, everything else is based around the approval of my permanent residency here. Once that's approved I'll come out with guns blazing, but for the time being I have to sit tight and wait.  Too bad I'm broke because it's the perfect time to be on holiday. :P
