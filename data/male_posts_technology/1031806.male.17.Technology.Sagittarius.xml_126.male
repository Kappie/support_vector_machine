There's been so much happening over the last two weeks and I cannot really sum it all up any way except by writing it all out (a task that I'm working on at home... still a few more days until a couple of massive posts that will cover that.  Several major points off the top of my head:  1. My small group (plus Steven and Sash.) went on an all-nighter two Fridays ago and TPed Ryan and Drew's (two youth leaders) houses. 2. I drove Wednesday and Thursday with Mr Weber (my Bible and Driver's Ed. teacher). 3. I attended my high school's graduation and recorded it for Gwen 4. I went to a really weird Grad. Party for my friend Christine 5. I went to Song on the Mountains (a really cool romance / comedy play by  urlLink Stages Theater ) with Gwen, Goody and Cam. 6. I went to Brady's Grad. Party and got really wet in a water fight (twas fun). 7. I met the people that I'm going to be working for this summer (more like having fun with). 8. School's out at 12:00 tomorrow!!!
