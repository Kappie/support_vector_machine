(I'll spare the details here)  But it did cause us to ponder what our last requests for gastronomic delights would be.  I thought you might like to read them:   jen:   i'd have fettucini alfredo with grilled chicken,  pine nuts, and mushrooms; garden salad with balsamic  vinagrette dressing; fried scallops and clams and ketchup; grilled salmon; potato skins with bacon  and sour cream; mozzarella cheese sticks; vanilla ice cream  with hershey's syrup; and faygo red pop.    Mine:   Prime rib, medium rare, 20 oz., with mushrooms   Greak Lakes trout, broiled in lemon butter   Garlic and cheese mashed potatoes with butter   Sweet corn on the cob   Homemade pumpernickel and white bread   Chocolate malt with extra malt   Coke   Raspberry cheesecake with a raspberry sauce   Double scoop chocolate sundae with marshmallow topping
