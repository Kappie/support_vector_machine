And I managed to keep my mind off food -- no cravings.  I still haven't lost much weight -- 5 pounds only. But perhaps the biggest lasting effects from this diet are:  - a better appreciation for fruits and vegetables (I hardly ever ate them before) - enjoying the feeling of not being full - I'll be more careful with snacks and late-night eating  I still hope to lose weight with this thing. I'll give it one more week -- if I don't lose any more weight, I'm dropping it.
