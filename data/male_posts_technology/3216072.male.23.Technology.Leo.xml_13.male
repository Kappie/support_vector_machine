The boy disfigured stood there waving at something in the alley. As I approached I must have startled him cause he looked my way, without making eye contact. Then like that there was nothing he was gone. When I rounded the corner of the alley to see what the boy had been waving at I saw that it was empty.  Standing there puzzled I looked around to see if anyone had just witnessed these events. Finding no one was around I decided to go to the doorway halfway down the alley and have a seat. It was dry here and a little bare light shown on the ground from above. I had been sitting there for a couple of minutes when I heard something back at street where I had just come from. It was the boy standing there just staring at me.  I just looked at him for a minute before I decided to make contact with the kid. I called out to him and asked if he was ok. He just kept staring. As I started to get up to walk towards the boy he took a step in my direction. I stopped and tried to look a little closer but the rain made it hard to see. His hair hung down over his brow and he made me think of someone I used to know.  Standing there in the rain I couldn't quite make it out, but he did look familiar. I started to walk closer, but this time the boy took a step backwards and looked down the street. As if to say I will run again if you come any closer, but in my state of mind I paid it no attention. I tried to speak to the boy again. I told him it was ok I just wanted to look at him. This seemed to bother him, but he stayed as I came closer. When I reached him I could see that he did have similar features to a childhood friend I once had. I stood there looking down at this boy who stood there looking up at this man. His lip looked like someone had pulled it in two and let it grow back separated. I couldn't stop staring at it. I felt myself reach out and try to touch his disfigurement, but the boy slapped my hand away.  "I am sorry" I told the boy and asked if he had a name. He said that he had forgotten what it was, but his mother knew. By this time the alcohol was wearing thin and I was getting cold from the rain. The boy must have noticed, because he asked me if I would like to come with him to a place out of the rain. As I stumbled after the boy with no name I realized that he also walked with a slight limp. When we arrived at our destination I looked up and saw what appeared to be an extravagant hotel in its day. Now it looked run down almost to the point where the city should condemn the place. Then I heard a buzzing noise that startled me a bit. When I looked I saw the boy, pressing a button on an intercom that hung from its original place in the wall by its wires.  There were no words spoken and I saw no heads appear from the windows above. Just a buzzing noise followed by a click of the lock. As I followed the boy into the dimly lit hallway I could only think of how wet and dark the inside looked. The wooden floor creaked with every step we took. The furniture must have been exquisite in its day, but now looked rotting and discolored. We came to an empty elevator shaft at the end of the Hall. There the boy stopped and looked up the shaft. "The vator must not be working again" he said as he pulled open the door to the stairwell. I followed him in and up countless flights of stairs all the way to the top floor. There on the door hung the number four beside the outline of a one that had long since fallen off.  Into a new hall that resembled the lower floor, but with a deep blue wall paper that was striped away in places. I heard the muffled voice of my little friend say that we are almost to our destination. I watched him enter a doorway with no door. As I rounded the same path I felt as though I had entered another world. It was a living room of sorts with a few people still lingering. I watched an old man seated in front of a had of poker lean towards the boy and ask a question. He slid his eyes up at me in such a manner I knew the question that was being asked. The boy looked back at me and apparently  told the old man what he wanted to hear. The man just tipped his head and resumed playing his game. It struck me odd though that he was playing poker by him self.  This room had only a light on in the back behind some sort of make shift bar, But the whole room flicked from the TV. A woman no older than I sat in front of the TV as if we had never entered just starring into the muted set. Such an odd place this little fellow has brought me, but how could I complain. I now had a place to lay my head.  We sat towards the back of the room where there was no one to bother us. He sat there on the red velvet couch next to a rip that allowed you to see the springs inside. He was starring at me as if he was waiting for the next thing I was to say. "So where is your mother" I said looking for some resolution to the nights events. The boy got up and told me that he needed to go to his room, but I could stay there till morning. When he would come back to wake me.
