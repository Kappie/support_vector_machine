There r 2 categories of people.  1. the "anything will do" kind  2. and the "nothing but this" kind  the 1s are ready to accept any kind of job. They might have a primary interest but may be ready to compromise it for anything under the sun as long as they r having the expected benefits out of the job. The 2s will not think of anything but what is in their mind (unless personal/family circumstances force them to go otherwise).    Note that.........u have started 1s as anything will do........and ended them with expect benefits .................doesnt it condradict....!!@!!   k, I have some work...........Let me come later.........with my views.. .. typed freely at home and bring it here..............
