As James so earnestly informed them that I was the investment banker with enough power and influence over one of the largest global finance companies that I could bring down every third world nation at the click of a pen! Ha! If only!  Glad to see that they don't stereotype anyone just as they would protest loudly at being stereotyped themselves. Apologies for the outburst but I hate hypocrites and well I am glad they got to know me before making their value judgement on the worthlessness of my existence! Anyway, on a much lighter not I have two essays - 5,500 words to be exact to finish before I leave in a week, this as well as movies with Carrie tonight, dinner with mum and the krapes tomorrow night, helping mum pack on Friday night, partying saturday night, kicking off the first sessions of the beginners program on Sunday and then well I have three whole days of work and then I leave.  Not much to do before I go. Well, must away and do useful stuff at work. Take Care and see you soon Kai xo
