 Considering Macintosh owners are the  urlLink smartest of all computer users , they must make more money than Windows or Linux users. I am sure they won't mind the upgrade fees. They  urlLink didn't mind paying  for ".mac" at all. And Mac users blame Microsoft for the "bait and hook" business model? Regardless, I believe in paying for good software like the Apple " urlLink iApps ". I sometimes wonder if Mac/Linux users understand companies are in the business to make money.
