"We say that the time of death cannot be foretold, but in saying this we assume that it is hidden in some obscure moment in the not too distant future, never realising that it has any connection with the day already begun, this very day that is so certain, and has every moment planned in advance." "CARTER YOU DICK!!!!" "Because of you I am still alive, Thank you." "Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay." "Don't talk to me. You scare the hell out of me." "Good sign. Younger the better. It would be a fucked up God to take down this plane...A REALLY fucked up God." "Well FUCK DESTINY!!!!!!!!!!" "You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by it's tail. Every single move we make,from the mundane to the monumental...the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of...is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave. " "You don't even want to fuck with that, mack daddy!"
