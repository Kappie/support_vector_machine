Losing a love due to circumstances beyond your control.  Moving to a new city. Removing yourself from a situation that makes you hurt because you care about someone. Becoming strangers. The new make over show, the swan.   Stuff that is good   Rekindling a friendship lost in time. Moving to a new city. Rekindling a love that was lost, but is now found. Meeting new friends. Dining out. Walks around greenlake. Having my health and beauty. Singing in the shower. Whistling a happy tune. Learning to play the piano. Going out with friends.  kissing. cuddling.  peace out- Timatao
