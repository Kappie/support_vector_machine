I just walked upstairs with some testing in my head, told Peter and Todd, they quizzed me on the error messages, and then looked at the code for about 30 seconds. Then, peter told me to go try it again, and that the error would be fixed by the time I got to my computer.   I walked downstairs, and will run the same test as soon as the build is done.   Now it's done.   This is productivity. I will have great difficulty returning to a more normal turnaround on investment, I think.
