Since only a few friends know of my poker exploits, I thought it would be nice to share them with others.  Assuming anyone even stumbles across this blog or even has interest in poker.  But I'll tell it anyway......  I actually only started playing poker in March of this year.  A friend and I would recap the World Poker Tour every Thursday morning and it eventually ended up leading into playing for play money online.  I joined PartyPoker.com in late March.  It was fun playing with play money at no limit tables with no real consequences.  I would play almost any hand, bet anything, lose everything.  But it was fun.  It was just play money. Then, for some reason, I started to really want to strive to play a good solid game.  Maybe for the hopes of winning money but also for the challenge of really calling myself a poker player. I started reading books by Ken Warren, joined PokerSchoolOnline.com, and read as many articles as I could on Texas Holdem' Poker.  I was hooked. I finally started to develop a strategy as I played more online.  Note that it was still for play money but I tried to make it as real as possible.  That is hard to do though.  Unfortunately, a lot of people play like I did at first at the play money tables.  Bet high on nothing hands and hope for the miracle flop.  That's not realistic and hard as hell to play against.  That's why PokerSchoolOnline was good.  You still use play money but you play for points to get sponsored into real money tournaments.  That makes the play more realistic. After a few weeks of working with my new found knowledge and advice of the game, I decided it was time to play for real money.  In early April, I made for first $100 deposit at PartyPoker.com.  It was time to put my knowledge to the test.....  I'll continue on the next post.  I think it's an easier read if I keep it as chapters.  I hope you're not bored as hell already.
