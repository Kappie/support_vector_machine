I usually read faster than this, but I constantly find myself wanting to re-read parts of it. This is actually very stupid and wasteful as I know I'll be reading this book again, yet there is so much that I want to re-experience as I am going along....  In a way it makes me sorry that I did not go in for academia, as I realize at some sort of meta-level that the only reason Pinker is not talking down to me is because thats not his writing style; he would not in any way be out of line to do so from a knowledge standpoint. His brilliance in a field that fascinates me is at times intimidating and on that aforementioned meta-level I feel a little bit of resentment for this man who has (as the saying goes) probably forgotten more about language than I will ever know. But then the realization that I cannot likely know as much makes me glad for what I can learn and not at all resentful, but then still feeling a little dumber and a little stupider than I was before.  The dumber will get better as I read the book, the stupider I am not as sure about. I'll have to think on that a bit more....   Then (in typical mind-game-with-myself fashion) I realize that not everyone goes through this thought process, and at yet another meta-level I realize that I may not be as stupid as I thought (at least comparatively speaking with other readers?).  And then at highest meta-level I thank the whatever high atop the thing (whose wrath I would never want to tempt) that I have more than one thought track (more on  that  another day) so that I can have all of the simultaneous meta levels in my head, and I shut it all down and jump back into Pinker's book.  Its truly amazing, and theres only one more thing to say right now -- 'Colorless green ideas sleep furiously'. Chomsky was right about that; they do. Especially the green ones. The colorless blue ones stay up nights....
