Jax, gud... when can we have our Annual day celebration?...  coming to Excellent effort by our HRD ministry:  Although the right to speech / express ur views are allowed in a democratic nation, I dont think coming out with points like kicha has mentioned is _____ ....... It seems to be very hypothetical...  Before commenting something we should take into consideration of what really we are meaning...  May be / Not IIM Fee cut reduces its quality output / input... Actually coming into consideration of loans... Banks provide loans only if u do have a high security...  And, Let us know first what the IIMs really do with the huge amount it receives now from the students as well from grants...  and how the fee slash is going to affect its performance .... after that let us start our arguements / discussion...  if u see, CDAC, C-DOT, ISRO, DOS, Military (Most of the PSU) are paying less for their employees compared to outside private units... do you feel any quality lack in it???
