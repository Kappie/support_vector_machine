We completed literally all weekend tasks on Saturday and so today could afford to do those jobs you never have time for such as: scanning off faulty goods and then: DESTROYING THEM!!! Yes. You see folks once you have scanned off a product which is faulty for whatever reason: doesn't sork, broken etc... then you must smash it up comepletely because they little pikeys can't get it out of the trash and then try and claim it for a refund. The fools. So once Lora had finished with toys and whatnot I set about on the electrial goods. Which are full of plastic, metal and other sharp objects. This left me with many a small cut on my hands, arms and face. Woo! The pain was worth the amusement of getting a mallet and smushing a kettle in one blow. Yes I really am the amazing spider-wo-man. Woooooo!  Yea so after that we spent the rest of the afternoon with everyone slagging everyone else off. In a jokey way. All rather amusing. Ritchie slagging off Lora, Lora slagging him back. Me slagging of Deano, Deano not knowing what is going on. Char helping me confuse Dean etc.. etc... madness. All of it.
