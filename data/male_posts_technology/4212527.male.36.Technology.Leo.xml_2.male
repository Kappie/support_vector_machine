Bush thinks of the Iraqi Olympic Soccer team :  "The image of the Iraqi soccer team playing in this Olympics, it's fantastic, isn't it? It wouldn't have been free if the United States had not acted." According to the same article, here's what the  Iraqi Olympic Soccer team thinks of Bush :  "How will he meet his god having slaughtered so many men and women? He has committed so many crimes." "The American army has killed so many people in Iraq. What is freedom when I go to the [national] stadium and there are shootings on the road?" "We don't wish for the presence of Americans in our country. We want them to go away." "I want to defend my home. If a stranger invades America and the people resist, does that mean they are terrorists? Everyone [in Fallujah] has been labeled a terrorist. These are all lies. Fallujah people are some of the best people in Iraq." One player said  if he were not playing soccer he would "for sure" be fighting as part of the resistance.
