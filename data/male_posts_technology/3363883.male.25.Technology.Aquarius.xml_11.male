If I ever wish to do something out of my normal character, then I won't do it until a monday.  I'll be ready for a new frame of mind and will have hopefully talked myself into this new change by monday morning.  This month's change is trying to become healthy again.  In fact, this has been going on for the last fortnight, but I know it started on a monday.  My flat mates and I decided that perhaps we had been eating a little too much comfort food and it was about time to get some healthy food into us.  It doesn't help when you're being told this by a lass who is stick thin and couldn't put on an ounce of weight even if it involved eating a kilo of cadbury's best.  Oh well.  If they're happy ot put up with healthy food, then god knows I am.  As it is, we've only slightly improved our dietry habit.  I eat less and convince myself that putting some lettuce on my sandwhich is now healthy.  However, I have hit the gym very hard and that's good.  My flat mates are both very fit, and trying to keep up with them is much more of an incentive for losing weight.  Over the weekend I managed to ride to oxford and back and then go on a five kilometer run which isn't too bad .. .. .. both days.  I've never really been totally unfit and sometimes I surprise myself with what my body let's me get away with.  Still, I hope to be able to jog for a little and kepe up the weights and get down to 69 kilos.  I was just a bit oabove this before i left for the states, and I managed to keep it off there.  But 10 days of mum's cooking is all it take to put it ALL back on.  Oh well.  I'd much rather add an hour to my day exercising then totally revamp my current diet.  As per most sunday's we managed to have a takeaway indian and watch Portugal squeeze out a goal with big term rivals Spain.   I'm still detoxing but not quite so hard now.  The occasional beer seems to float in, but it's limited to only a couple.  I'm still fas free after a fortnight and feeling good for it.  I don't want to jinx it.  I havn't gone this long in Enlgand since I first got here.  So if I keep it up, it should be happy days ahead.  I know that I wouldn't be at the gym AT ALL if I was still fassing.  So hopefully, that change will be for the better.  Enlgand play Croatia tonight in the eurocup.  It's all sudden death now.  If england lose a single game, they're won't stay in the league.  That said.  if they win the next four games, then they will be crowned European Cup champions of 2004.  I really hope they do win.  I think it would be great to be here if they did make it!  How hard can four straight games be?
