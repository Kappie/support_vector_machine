I know, it does sound weird that ESPN has included this kinda thing in their programming but people shouldn't be so surprised after they started airing poker games.  Anyways, I was sitting on the couch checking out one of the final rounds. This awkward-looking Indian kid with a complementary strange name and stoic demeanor,   urlLink  Akshay Buddiga    steps up to the mike. He recieves his word to spell, which is '  urlLink  alopecoid   .' After repeating the word a few times, our man Akshay seems to be deep in thought.  Then it happens. His eyes flutter and begin to grow wider as if he's shocked or something. His body begins to sway to his left a bit. Almost imperceptibly, Akshay begins a slow descent to the ground- drawing gasps from the crowd (probably stifled snickers, too). Further replays (thank you ESPN!) show that he does absolutely nothing to slow his fall. No flailing arms, nothing. You know those videos where you see loggers chopping down trees? Akshay looked just like that. Well, almost like that. Imagine a tree with glasses and prematurely developed facial hair.  At the expense of his embarrassment however, I was left with a classic moment...one of the most hilarious sights I've ever seen. I would pay to relive that shit again.
