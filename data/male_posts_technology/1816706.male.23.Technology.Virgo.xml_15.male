Me and Thomas rented a p.o.s. car and went strait to a sports bar to catch game 7 of the playoffs, Red Sox vs. Yankees.  I hate the Yankees!  After that disappointing loss, we went and ate Saimin at Hamura’s Saimin.  Saimin is basically a really good Ramen Noodles with some pork and fish cakes added in and you can get these chicken and steak kabobs for a buck each.  It’s cheap, good, local, and filling.
