I have a job interview next week in a Hi Tech company in Haifa. I so want this job.. The position I'm applying to is R Engineering Support. It has to do with System/Information analysis, JDBC, ASP  .NET. So I had to lie a little in my resume, I add few good spicy thing and deleted others. Since I have been studying so damn hard for this - I have no idea what JDBC is - so  I had to find out what the hell is it...I hope I'll get the job. Wish me luck, I'm optimistic.   anyway, this is the first time that I write in a blog and I think I like it. I hope could meet people in here who share the same interests with me, and I'm looking forward for any comments/replies by the readers. Truly yours;  Joker.
