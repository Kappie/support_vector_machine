This way I can enjoy a long weekend and still not interfere with the life-runs in camp. Woohoo ... But of coz it's still flexible lah, if I get any interviews here and there, I'll still need to shift the dates around so I can go for them.  Err ... if anyone out there has anything to suggest about the way my leave should be planned. Please gimme some tips too huh.
