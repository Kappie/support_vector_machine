That's when I realized that it was truly done.  Life goes on.  These are the things that I may or may have not told you over the phone.......  Thanks for everything. Thanks for challenging me to think a different way. Thanks for showing me that the little things in mundane routine everyday life are really worth taking note of. Thanks for eliciting feelings that have laid dormant for a while (good to know that they're still there). Thanks for making me appreciate things that I have taken for granted. Thanks for making the time I spent at work more enjoyable because I looked forward to talking to you on the phone. Thanks for making me feel wanted in ways only a woman can *wink wink*. Thanks for showing me that being picky is a good thing. Thanks for everything, again  This experience was most definitely enjoyable as well as educational.  I will always look back at the moments that we shared in person as well as on the phone with fondness and gratitude that I actually learned something here and it was fun.  I hope that things do work out for you and your boyfriend and if it doesn't, I hope that your next will be someone who is good for you as well as you be good for him.  Have a good life and good luck in your future endeavors.    You know where to find me......
