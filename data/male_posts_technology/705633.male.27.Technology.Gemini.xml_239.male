I have been a member of this site for sooooooooo long I can't remember being a normal person hehe, however, whilst I was at Toaster's house last night, sinking a few cold ones, I noticed that we have a link to another cool web site called 'Shut It'. Now, after I realised that I had been a total blind tit I decided to have a look at the site today.....very cool! Hopefully now I have seen the light I may even be able to get to know the crew. Anyways I got to go train now......oh god 200 sit-ups and 50 press-ups!!!!! Well I guess thats the price for being fit (says with a saddened look lol). Talk you all again soon,Baity signing off.........
