I think I would like the change of pace that alberta would give me, although I would miss my friends.   I woke at 4:45 this morning with a panic attack and called my mom who talked to me till about 6:30. I'm sleepy now.  I have tomorrow and friday off and am looking forward to a much needed vacation. I hope that everyone is doing well. Catch you on the flip side- T
