I tend to make alot of grammatical mistakes cause I frankly I am lazy. I just type what i am thinking that moment and post. Sadly that is probably a bad habit and am trying to break it with only so-so success.  The point of my blog is to spout about whatever I feel like. Can't guarentee it will mean a thing to anybody but hopefully those that read it will not feel like they wasted their time.  So anyway...welcome to erasend.
