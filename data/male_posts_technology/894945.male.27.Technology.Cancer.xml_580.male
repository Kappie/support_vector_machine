Not much has been going on recently, it's that kind of no-fun zone between the end of summer and the start of Christmas drunkedness.  I've been out a couple of times for cheap grub on the  urlLink Tennerfest , once at Blue Fish and again last night at Shiva.   I'm flogging a few old bits and bobs I have lying around. If you're looking for some cheap car audio amplifiers or a crossover, check out my adverts on  urlLink Jersey Insight .   I'll be your friend if you buy me this. :)
