While the commission did not say that a "dry hump" is always within the bounds of the commission's rules on broadcast propriety, the panel did note that "both characters are fully clothed, and there is no evidence that the activity depicted was dwelled upon, or was used to pander, titillate or shock the audience."   I'm very glad they ruled against this complaint but sorry I for one  was  titillated and shocked!  I mean come on look at this:  urlLink     How is that not titilllating and shocking?
