That being said, we marvelled at the psycho-lady (not pictured) who boldly marched into the sea wearing a blue bikini.  By the way, I'm having some "non-display of color" type issues with the individual entry pages ... until a crack team of blog specialists has been able to resolve the problem, uh, imagine colors.
