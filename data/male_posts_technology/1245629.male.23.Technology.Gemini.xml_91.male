       
      Thank you for contacting Google about our  urlLink Copernicus Research Center .  We've received an overwhelming response to this opportunity and are not currently accepting additional resumes. We will, however, keep your information on file should we have an opening in the future. At the current staffing levels, we anticipate that we may need additional applicants on or around April Fool's Day in 2104.  Until then, we appreciate your interest in Google and your taking the time to write us.   Sincerely,  The Googlunar Recruiting Team
