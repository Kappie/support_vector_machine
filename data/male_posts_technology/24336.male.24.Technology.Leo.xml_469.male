"Well, we first have to figure out what the real problem is before we can solve it."  Then you have a requirements phase, trying to figure out what will need to be done to solve the problem.  Then you have a design phase, trying to come up with a good way to solve the problem.  Then you actually do it.  I need to spend more time with biology and less with computer science. It's pervasive.
