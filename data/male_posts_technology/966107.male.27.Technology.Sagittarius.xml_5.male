They say it heralds a new age of communication and connectivity. Actually end-user mobility has been there in the networks for a long time now. But the cost of mobility was very high, almost prohibitive. What really struck me in the article was the ease of configuration and low cost wireless equipment that is now available to end-users.  Using wireless access points and equipments a user can move anywhere around in the campus in a LAN without the hassles of carrying a mesh of cables and wires. Just imagine the peace of mind the user and the support staff will have with these. There are two standards on which this technology works: 802.11b and 802.11g. More to come on this later.
