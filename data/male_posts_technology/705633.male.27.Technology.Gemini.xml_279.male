I was only planning on going out for a couple (not expecting to the last person alive last night at 2am) so I didn't take the camera. Sorry.  I found myself at the bar in the sports bar arguing with good dougal and bad dougal whether I should buy 2 jugs of sex on the beach but luckily good dougal won!! Till the next time it was my round to buy drinks, I think good dougal had fallen unconscious by this point and two jugs of that evil cocktail appeared on the table. Well we ended up in the meat market (Follies) where I was DANCING thx guys for not stopping me. It was a really good night though Custard ended up leaving with what was explained to me as the STALKER (Please post if your still alive) I met an old friend who gave me back the camera I left in their car 2 years ago. Not to sure what the pictures are of, I think I have some pictures from the Old La Cala night club on there so I will get the film developed tomorrow and post them as soon as I can.
