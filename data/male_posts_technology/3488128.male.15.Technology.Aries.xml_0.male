I lost all of my good friends over a stupid fight and now we want 2 kick each others ass. I also woke up a little, grew a little, I realized tht my life itsn't tht best barbie doll life around. I realized how family reall treat you, who are your true friends, and i must admit i still don't know how they are.   The there are good thing tht come out of bad things: like i spent more time with katelyn than i do at my house and she got me 2 like the things she likes. Like for instance; writting a journal. expressing my feelings, doing blogger, listening to dashboard confessionals (i love them now)and so many other things. I'm glad i'm in high school and so i can go meat new kids and make new friends  I love you mike s. you helped me alot and i love you. Good luck on baseball and i go to all of your games defintatley.   Peace  Noreen
