Now.. the long version: --- Friday  Our trip to Mt Washington , New Hampshire, begins in Maine.  Yes.. Maine.  It would seem that whereas my map clearly shows 93 in New Hampshire, it apparently does some fancy foot work and ends up in Maine.  After  aquick stop at the Maine visitors center, and some lady behind the counter who runs into this problem so often there is a stack of printed directions to where we want to go, we head back into New Hampshire.  It gets dark as we hit Rochester, so let that be a lesson.. if you leave at 4:30, you cannot get anywhere north of rochester while there is still daylight.  After calling the campground to make sure they are still going to be open if we dont make it by 8, we finishe the hour and a half north and arrive just after 8:10 at the Glen Ellis Campground in Glen, NH.     After driving in the dark, shining our lights on hapless campers for about 20 minutes, we manage to find our water front campsite and settle in.   We managed to pitch the tent, setup some chairs and make a fire.  I poked it with a stick a few times, we had a marshmallow, and went to bed early, knowing that Saturday was a big day.  --- Saturday  We thought that setting the travel alarm for 7 am would be a good idea, as it would give us plenty of time to grab a bite,  pack up our gear, head to the mountain and start on the trail nice and early, but nature decided to get us up earlier.   At about 6:45 acorns began pelting our tent and the surrounding ground as two - five, rather burly looking red squirrels were trying to make daily collections.  We cursed them, then took the hint, and got on the road by about 8:00.  Entering White Mountain National Forest was lovely, there was a morning mist, and at times, we could see the peaks.  Each time we saw one we though.. maybe thats it... no maybe that one...  then it hit.  Whichever peak we saw, no matter how intimidating, ours was going to be at least that high.. or higher.   *rock*  We finally identified Washington as the only one with antannea on the top of it.. and the giant hotel saying "Mount Washington Hotel" at the base of it.  We started in off the main higway along the base road.  It at this time that I need to tell you about the millions and millions of signs in NH and Maine that say "Moose Crossing"  and.. "Brake for Moose".  I have been to Maine and New Hampshire many, many times.. in as backwater places as they come, but never had I seen a moose out there.  Well folks.. they dont have those signs up for nothing.  As we are traveling on the base road, as we joke about the moose signs for the 100th time, Chris says.. wow, it would be cool to see one.  I agree saying I had never seen one.    Sure enough about 5 minutes later.. I halt the car.. and about 50 yards ahead on the side of the road a big brown moose is hanging out.   As I halt, it stares at me.   *no antlers.. must be female* I think.   Then Chris gets her whits and grabs the camera which was, of course, in the least accessible place at the time.   Thankfully the moose holds his position and Chris snaps one.   Then we see the second moose.  This one is clearly a smaller moose.. we guessed that it was a juvenile that was out with mom for a morning stroll.      I approach and they dont seem to be moving... then after a couple honks.. they get the drift, and decide its safe for them to cross and they do.   Man..Moose run like girls.  They are the most ungainly beast i have ever seen.  Its like watching a horse on stilts.  But ungainly or not.. once they passed into the woods on the other side, we couldn't see any sign of them again.   We  got some pics.. hopefully they came out, and in the future I will post em.  We arrive at the parking area for trails, pay our parking pass to the self serve slot, visit the very stinky outhouse, and hit the trail at 8:40.  NICE!!  The first thing to hit us as we get into the woods is the overwhelming scent of pine.  It is amazing, very strong, and it reminds me of christmas.    Now about 10 minutes in, on a trail that is not too steep, we are short of breath.  Chris is the first to admit it .. and we laugh *nervously* about the trail ahead.  We are crazy.. huffing 10 minutes in.    Let the record show the first official break  was at 20 minutes in.. for water, and to take the bottoms off our Sahara Pants. (FYI.. the  urlLink BEST pants I have ever hiked in )  After continuing on for about a mile, through your average hiking path in the woods, we met up with the Amonoosuc River.  It is a nice little river (more like a brook or a big stream) and it was to be our companion for the rest of the trip till we hit the Alpine Zone.   Following the river we passed a big group of kids and adults.. some kind of field trip I bet.    The hiking was occasionally interrupted with river views, and small falls but the good stuff didn't start until we hit Gem Pool.  This lovely pool was at the base of a 15-20ft cascade and it was lovely.  Chris and I stopped here for a photo op. (one of the few we actually took with us in them.)  After the group we passed caught up, we decided it wa time to leave them behind us and get moving.  Now.. the AMC book on the Amonoosuc trail notes that the portion after the gem pool is steep.  Steep is barely the word to begin it :)  We climbed up staricase after staircase of wood and boulder steps that were about a foot high each.  This went on for the better part of the next hour.  We were occasionally rewarded with openings in the trees that afforded views into the ravine we had been climbing.  each time we stopped to look we were amazed at the height which lay below us.    Finally the stairways abated, and we crosed over a brook that fed the Amonoosuc and stared up large slabs of rock.  They were not too steep, but some tricky footing was around, and a slip would certainly have been ... lets say .. bad.. as below the slippery rocks were the many waterfalls and cascades we had passed on the way.  As we crested one anonymous slab, we came across a small sign.  It read "Welcome to the Alpine Zone"  kind of like.. "Welcome to New Hampshire".. it was kind of silly.. but it was also rewarding.  The sign went on to warn of where you tread as this area was a delicate one.   We pressed on.  All of a sudden as we went over another rock, Chris let out a shriek (the excited kind) and I looked up from the trail to see the top of the  urlLink Lakes of the Clouds Hut  .  It was closed for the winter.. but it gave the mental shelter of konwing we had hit a big milestone.  We climbed up to it.. hunkered down and decided it was a good time to break for some snacks.    Now it may seem that i am exxagerating here.. but this is the events as I whitnessed them:  I sit down and admire a view over the ravine.  I notice a whisp or two of cloud comign in over the land. .. and hitting it..  I realize I am in the clouds at this point.   *cool*    I turn to get some food from my pack.  I turn back.. and My visibility which was previously about a mile+  turned to 20 feet.   3 minutes.. I swear.   Let that be a lesson to those who thing the weather wont come fast on Mt Washington.  We joked with a nearby hiker about how fast it had come.  Marveleed a little more.. then started on the Crawford Path which was a 1.1 mile jaunt to the summit.  YAY!  The path had a only a slight uphill grade, but it was all rock.  and by all rock, i mean it looked like the bottom of a rock quarry.. only with some lichen and moss.  Cairns (piled of rocks used ot mark trails where there are no trees) were spaced about 20 feet apart and were eary to track.  We could see one cairn ahead in the fog, and *just* make out the second one if we strained.  It was like being on some other planet.   We tridged forward.  Deffinitely feeling tired at this point.. but nothing to do but press on.     At this point we came a cross a scary sign.  It said  (more or less) "Many hikers die on this trail.  If weather is bad.. turn back now".  Kind of a stark reminder that your not messing around here.  Besides the fog (which we figured would blow over)  the weather was warm.  We had gear for worse weather, so we pressed on.  Finally, as mysteriously (and quickly) as the fog arrived, it passed.  We were left with views of the hut we left behind (it seemed so painfully close), the summit ahead (also painfully close) and the vast expanse of rocky ground between both.   We could see Bott Spur and Mt Clay behind us and pretty much everything to the west of us.  There were great looking trails marked by a great line of cairns up to Bott Spur, it was sweet looking.   But our trail lay ahead.. and as we reached our last sign before washington, the cone of the summit loomed ahead.  .5 Miles to Mt Washington Summit.  And what a long .5 miles it is ;p  By this time, people from other trails had joined up with this path, as it is a main ascent up the final cone.  We encouraged each other as we passed, or were passed.  The climb was all broken rock.. and all steps up.  We were looking at our 4th hour of straight hiking.  We had ascended over 3500 feet and the fatigue was starting to set in.  At this point, we made the decision, that while we could probably hike back down.. why the hell should we.. we were going to try and get a ride down on the Cog Railway.  But enough of the way down.. we had to finish going up!  A final push (with a few stops to catch out breath) we made it to the visitors center!  Then feeling very good, we walked up the final path to the true summit.. and had the obligatory sumit photo op.  Now.. up at the summit, there are lots of tourists.  They drove up.. they rode up.. and at that time I hated them all :)  I was just thiking.. I WALKED UP!!  Those other hikers knew how I felt.  Now.. a headache had started in my head about 40 min into the hike.  It was probably due to extra blood pressure on my head.. as I had plenty of water the whole time.  By the summit, the neck tension of watching the ground, and the constant push had turned my headache into a wicked motha'.  We rode the  urlLink cog railway down.  (not as scary as one would think, except the price.. which is $35 one way down!!!) and then at the bottom we had to walk another quarter mile back to the parking lot.  We peeled off our packs, and got in the car.  the ride back was uneventful, though my head was pounding and nausea had set in... thank you migranes.   We arrived back at the campground, I took a shower and took a nap to lose the skull pain.   It didnt work, but thankfully it went away about 20 minutes after my nap.   All in all I was very sore, but the headache gets all the attnetion here because it was far worse than any muscle pain.   Chris was pretty sore as well, and moving around last evening was a silly sight, but we were deffinitely ok.  Chris had managed to make a nice fire while I napped (yay Chris!) and we sat and ate dinner over it.  After dinner over the campfire, since we were still not tired, we decided to head to a bar that was across the street from the campground.  We both ordered a margarita  and after a long day of hiking, they were relaxing and had us giggly after one.  We headed back, crawled into bed... and I was alseep before i knew it.  --- Sunday    In the middle of the night the rain came.  It cmae down pretty hard at some points, but my little  urlLink zoid  held out, snug as a bug in a sleeping bag.  By morning it had stopped raining, but I knew that more was on the way.  We woke about 8, and decided to head back early since we knew rain was coming, and I wanted to catch the Pats if I could  :)   We took our time getting home, stopping in some shops as we wanted, and I got home in time to see the Pats win a nailbiter in overtime.  *YAY*.  Great weekend.... Great Hike.. and quite an adventure.      Final Stats -- Start 8:40 AM   Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail Head   2560 Ft.
