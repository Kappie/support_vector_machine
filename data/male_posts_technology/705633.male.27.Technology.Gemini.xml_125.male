I mean, I get asked if I want to have a threesome on Friday night, Of course I say "Yes and if your boyfriend runs out of steam I can push his arse for him for a bit."  I'm even polite enough to ask him if he wants front or back, as she wont have both of us behind ;-)  But no.  He just mumbles something about if she brings me home too, that he is leaving and that's the end of their relationship.  Not one to break up a couple, I decided its time to leave, She knows my number and when she leaves the most boring Irish bloke I ever met, she will contact me!…  My weekend brightened when four, Yes Four! Girls invited me out to the School girl fancy dress party… That's more girls than ever invited you out at once Custard! That should be fun!  Humm, Me, with my reputation? At Girls collage sixth form leaving do, with a bouncy castle?
