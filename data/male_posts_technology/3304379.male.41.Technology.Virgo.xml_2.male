Thanks outlook!    Of course, have to respond to each reply...  names have been changed, confidential stuff left out.   -----Original Message-----  From:   Yarddog   Sent:   Tuesday, September 02, 2003 2:33 PM  To:     People I don't work with.  Wrong department, similar name.  Thanks Outlook! Subject:  client   The original e-mail with confidential stuff left out.    I mentioned that we are interested in learning more about the direction of their company noting their presence as a partner.  Earl strongly declared that the relationship between XXXX and XXXX is very important. He would like XXXX to remain the primary upstream feed with XXXX taking a secondary position.  They currently have 50000 clients.  12000000 people on staff.  And are looking for ways to grow their business.  They believe they can do this offering some thickness/content to their site.  They also note that there is a daily battle for quality downstream (distribution).  In my opinion, this is a company that is honest and wants to improve.  We should help them.  Suggestions? Thoughts?  I would like to schedule a follow up call with XXXX as soon as possible based upon everyone's feedback.  Please advise.  XXXX     My response:  Yes, XXXX and I have done battle with many a rainbow trout downstream.  The distribution is not the best, but now that he has opened a trout hatchery, things should be looking up near term.  He only has one obstacle...his wife loves cats.  So much so that she opened a kitten ranch next to the trout hatchery.  It is quite a site seeing all of these kittens clawing their way up the roof, swimming around the cold water, clawing at the baby trout.  The head mama cat and Spartacus, the old Tom, could really change things at the trout farm.  I saw Sparticus and a group of young tom cats, close to 12, the same number that just about brought down the Roman empire meeting behind the tobacco barn on a regular basis.  Sparticus starts the meeting with a big Brown trout.  The other cats are all pupils.  I believe they are up to something and frankly, I am not sure I like it.  XXXX has advised me of the places he plans on releasing the trout up  and down claw river.  I plan on being there to catch fish.  However, I bet Earl, being the southerner he is and his fondness for sickomore pie that his wife conjures up, he has probably told her the whereabouts of the release points.  She in turn sleeps with Sparticus.  Loose lips ruin fishing trips.  I believe Sparticus and his band of Orange toms are planning on beating me to the fish.  His first lieutenant is Agent Orange.  Perilous times are ahead, but XXXX is a good guy and man, can his wife cook!  We need more southern food down here.  They would be a great addition with Brent Miller leading the way.  Back to codeville.     -----Original Message-----  From:   Yarddog   Sent:   Tuesday, September 02, 2003 6:53 PM  To:     People I don't work with.  Wrong department, similar name.  Thanks Outlook! Subject:  proceed!   Original e-mail   How do we want to proceed with this partner? I spoke with XXXX this afternoon. Very forthcoming and humble guy     My response:         I agree on the forthcoming and humble attributes of this gentleman.  We once shared a common area in the Florence SC flea market.  I was selling home grown beefeater tomatoes that were the size of Victorian dinner plates.  He was trying to get rid of a litter of half Rottewieller / pit bull mix puppies.  It was quite hot under that tin roof in July and the place smelled of redneck sweat.  I always thought it smelled like a Big Deluxe hamburger with extra Vidalia onions but XXXX thought it was more like a baby borg maturation chamber post born.  Yes, he was really into Star Trek...          I went to my S-10 1989 Black Chevy pickup truck with the fake bullet holes to get another box of swisher sweet cigars for us since the smoking laws don't apply in SC.  A lot of laws don't apply there and XXXX even questions the laws of physics in the Pee Dee region...          As I walked back into the flea market, squeezing in-between women wearing tube tops and dressed out at nearly 250lbs smelling of gardenia perfume mixed with kerosene to tighten the skin in-case some of the cellulite broke loose and went on a rampage, I noticed XXXX was talking to one of the other vendors....Patti the palm reader.  She looked like a cross between Janice Joplin and Marlin Monroe with a dash of Haitian voodoo about her that made me squirm when I went by the table filled with old pin cushions with various needles and such sticking out at odd angles.          At that moment, I heard a commotion coming from my table that XXXX was supposed to be watching while I got us some Cigars.  I made my way through humanity slipping through like a 1 inch thick greased black snake going down a length of 1.5 inch PVC pipe toward my table.  When I got there, XXXX's half Rottewieller/Pitt Bull puppies had escaped from their metal cage by chewing through the metal, jumped up on my table, and were now laying waste to my huge, beautiful tomatoes not unlike my brother and I scarfing up all the burnt match head tips in ash trays at the Charleston Piggly Wiggly, eating the tops off until my mother finally gave in and bought us little debbie cakes.          The puppies had there way with my tomatoes.  Red tomato meat all over them and their mouths.  They looked like they were laughing as they mauled my tomatoes.  The biggest of the big southern patrons there was mulling over a table full of ratchet sets and bootleg cassettes.  He heard the commotion and immediately came to the table in awe, sporting a pair of huge overalls that could raise the titanic if used as a flotation device, you know, tying the legs in knots and such so you can float until rescued.  I believe by the look on his face that he thought  these mutts had actually killed something and the tomatoes was blood.  He bought every baby dog on my table, taking the clawing beasts away, licking the tomato off of each other.          XXXX was counting a mountain of cash,  I was starring at what was left of my tomatoes.  I was sporting a look that must have conveyed that those tomatoes were the biological  children that I never had.  Of course, if XXXX had thought a little further, why would I be willing to sell my children to people to eat?  He split the cash with me like a perfect gentleman and I bought an authentic white skull of a bull with the horns to go on my front porch and a toastmaster fan and XXXX got his palm read by Patti.          XXXX would be a great partner, I am sure of it.  He loves animals and his animals love tomatoes.
