Yeah, right...head over heals and I still have time to write in this blog. I'm also working on IPB v2.0 modifications...I already made two!  urlLink Here's the linky . Both took me about an hour or two to make...they are a lot harder to make than you might think. I guess I'll get used to it and go make some more later on. The other job I have is working on another website, except this time for a good hosting offer, and if I pull it off just right, I can host both my forums and the whole archive on that site...how exciting. I have to finish the job first though.   Speaking of which, I have to code part of that site up in PHP. Okay...well, I kinda don't know how to do PHP...so. Well, I know how to edit it but that's a whole different issue by itself. The real problem is I've been waiting for my PHP instruction books for over two weeks now! They're in the library, on the shelf, I made a hold, and no dinky librarian has even made any effort to pick up thier lazy a...rear end and go get the book, shoving it into some car to transport it to my library section so I can get some excersice by getting on my bicycle and cycling down 11 blocks to the library. No, they sit at their desks all day and play computer games...they're worse than me!! Ech...yeah. So I have no clue how to work in PHP and can only hope the books arrive before the "boss" gets pissy.   Oh, I promised umbrellas... urlLink Umbrellas!!!    Oh yes, it was 100 degrees and we had to sit through church with no AC or fans (those grandmas get too cold too fast, stick them in the bottom level of hell and they'll still be cold)!  Signing out, -RC
