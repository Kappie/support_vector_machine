I had the fortune of attending a Worfaire event in 2000, and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of said event - the sponsored machines were groovy, the massive spectator screens rocked - I enjoyed it all immensely. Earlier this year though, GLSA hosted the Worfaire preliminaries. Normally Worfaire is all about the competitive play, but in the prelims they decided to host a BYOC LAN as well. And boy, was it a lemon (reportedly). Middle of winter, no heating, no carpeting, frequent network problems - they all conspired to create the biggest disappointment in GLSA's esteemed (thus far) history. Many people were pissed. And it looks like their cockup has returned to bite them in the ass. GLSA intended to have the first 1000+ man LAN in the southern hemisphere, in an attempt to beat Oz. Sadly, thanks to the 'orrid prelims, only about 100 gamers signed up for the BYOC lan, as opposed to the 600+ they needed. Royal mess. Strike one. I heard a saying once. "Everyone is entitled to 3 strikes". This is GLSA's first strike. However, I'm wondering if it may also be their last? Life is cruel, and people have little compassion - our most base instinct, one each of us obeys compunctually, is greed. We want it all. Is that a bad thing? Greed  runs  the world, capitalism is built on it, and ever increasing in quality goods and services is a result of greed trying to satisfy greed. It may not make the world a better place idealogically, but it does work. Better than Communism anyway. And this is what the GLSA has to embrace now in order to save it's reputation and prevent "jumping the shark" (I love that phrase...). Trying to persuade gamers that it's their  duty  to fork over the 100 or so bucks to play in what may be a repeat of 'The Fridge' (what the dreaded prelim has come to be known)  will just not work. Because no matter what, greed wins out over patriotism every time. Time to get that marketing machine rolling, GLSA.
