Leave all the moons behind Put sugar out of your mind In Him another youâ€™ll find He makes another kind of grain.  O mind you may be wise In knowledge and insight may rise Or is it better to prize He who makes the mind insane?  Body, soul, mind and heart With power will make a start Yet in a drop, with art A hundred eyes will entertain.
