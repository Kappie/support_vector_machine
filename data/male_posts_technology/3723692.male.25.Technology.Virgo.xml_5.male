We might not reach the finals, but this win was very important. Defeat today and we might have seen the end of Pakistani cricket. But no we are back, although its way too early to say that things might change but at least we have got ourselves a breather. Lets hope this victory brings some consistency and professionalism in our cricket and might transfer some in our daily lives. I have a strong belief ,you all can disagree, Sports especially cricket can play a big role inrevivingour Nation. Majority have lost faith in it but it can all come back with few good years and one World cup will add a cherry on top of the cream. Lets hope and pray for this Nation  Adios
