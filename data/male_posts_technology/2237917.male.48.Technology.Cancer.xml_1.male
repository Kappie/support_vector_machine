The U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team, known as CERT, issued a "vulnerability note" saying that computer users should not use the Internet Explorer browser because of security vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit to launch attacks on personal computers and corporate networks.   Hmmm, that Bill Gates is one sly fella.  GW should make him VP, cause @ this point microsoft can access just about anyones data @ any time.
