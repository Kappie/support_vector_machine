I dont want the visitor to have to stand the entire  length of ... ..well whatever they think of my posts,  if they dont want to. Just a small summary and then  a  urlLink Read More>>  link and they get to read the whole post, else they just read the rest of the blog.  One  urlLink Prof  drilled into my mind that any site if it doesnt catch the fancy in the first  twenty seconds, it has flopped.  What I am basically trying to do is not cause a bad  day of mine resulting in a bad post result in a bad  opinion about my poll.   Any pointers ?  urlLink Six Foot Two  are you there ?
