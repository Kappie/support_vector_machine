 I fought tooth and nail to get off this island at a decent time on Friday.  It didn't work quite the way I planned, but I managed to arrive in VA around 9:00p.  This allowed plenty of time for the corruption of Disney through our invention of the Emperor's New Groove drinking game.  Fully 1/3 of a case of Bud Light later, sleep forced itself upon me.  Damn "llama" rule.
 
 Saturday was devoted to UVA football.  My girlfriend and I arrived in Charlottesville in time to see our beloved Wahoos fight gallantly in a 19-14 loss.  We should have won.  Damn Seminoles.
 
 The drive from VA to NY was a quick and smooth 4.5 hours last night, despite three leisurely stops along the way.  Traffic was pristine, and the batmobile hungrily devoured the open roads.  Yeah, even FSU couldn't rain on my parade (although that was highly disappointing).  I hate to see my girl cry, but when she is shedding tears at my departure I know that all is well again in that department.  ...and the peasants rejoice.
