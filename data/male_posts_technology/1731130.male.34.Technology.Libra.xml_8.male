They though it was a foolproof cryptography system, but the allies cracked it and some believe the war was shortened by at least 2 years as a result. Genuine WWII Enigma machines survived, but you're unlikely to find one for sale so the best you can home for is a PC based emulator or one of these little beauties:  Rather than building an Enigma replica, which is a tedious task, an electronic alternative is available, using modern components to replace the mechanical parts of the original Enigma. The Enigma-E is a DIY Kit that enables you to build your own electronic variant of the famous Enigma machine. It works just like a real Enigma (and is compatible with an M3 and M4 Enigma as well as the standard Service Machines). A message encrypted on, say, a real Enigma M4 can be read on the Enigma-E and vice versa.   Simon Singh's  The Code Book  has an excellent chapter on the Enigma as well as tons of other cryptographic highlights.  Link:  www.xat.nl
