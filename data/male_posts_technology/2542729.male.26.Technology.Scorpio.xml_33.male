Faith is the substance of things unseen So glad the Lord will stand right beside me Your loving kindness to all living things Oh Jesus Holy you are! Oh Jesus Holy you are!  I wrote this chorus while I was in Church, I believe. It will be the last track to my first gospel album I will call Truth  Virtue. Once I get the rest of the verses together, maybe i'll add an audio snippet so yous guys can hear how it sounds. Its very much a praise  worship song, very dear to my heart in word, content  deed.  I hope to keep in better contact during this deployment. I know i've been slacking but its all been for reasonable excuse (you try getting up @ 3:45 in the morning  working all day long and see if you feel like sitting in a hot computer room sending emails). There is so much to discuss tho, so much that has transpired...not to mention, i've released my first rough draft of the first 3+ chapters of French Kiss, my new poetry volume, to select audiences! Well, right now just one person but...still...  Arite, heat is getting to me, i'm out!
