 If Apple comes out with a tablet computer I can guarantee there won't be an outcry from Windows users.  Unlike the way the "ribbed-mock-turtleneck-wearing-cry-baby" fans from Apple who blame Microsoft for why their life hasn't turned out they way they thought it would. In fact I think most Windows' users will look forward to what any technology company can add to pen-based computing.
