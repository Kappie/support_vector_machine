We'll make a wish and send it on a prayer, We know our dreams can all come true with love that we can share.  With you I never wonder, will you be there for me? With you I never wonder ... you're the right one for me.  I finally found a love of a lifetime, A love to last my whole life through. I finally found a love of a lifetime, Forever in my heart, I finally found a love of a lifetime.  With every kiss our love is like brand new, And every star up in the sky was made for me and you. Still we both know that the road is long, But we know that we will be together because our love is strong  I finally found a love of a lifetime, A love to last my whole life through. I finally found a love of a lifetime, Forever in my heart, I finally found a love of a lifetime.  I finally found a love of a lifetime, A love to last my whole life through. I finally found a love of a lifetime, Forever in my heart, I finally found a love of a lifetime.  I finally found a love of a lifetime, I finally found a love of a lifetime, I finally found a love of a lifetime, Forever in my heart, I finally found a love, .......................................... of a lifetime.    I Found Love (When I Found You)   I found love when I found you When I look in your eyes, I know it's true  My life was lonely, Yeah broken and blue Then I found love, when I found you.  Oh Once in a lifetime, HEY that's how it feels Theres Something so good (so damn good) How can it be realoh when you touch me yeah You touch me through and through yes you do I know I found love , when I found you  Now Girl, you've got all of me And I want you to know Want you to know right now that There's nothin' in this crazy ol' world that would make me wanna let you go.
