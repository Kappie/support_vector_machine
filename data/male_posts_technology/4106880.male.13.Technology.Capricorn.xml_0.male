"               exoSyphen Studios was founded in 2003 and focuses mainly on game                development.

It seems promising, the requierments are low, so all PPC's should be able to handle it, and it seems as promising as the first game. Here is how they describe the game...  "               The world of hacker games is no longer reserved for the PC platform.                A completely new and innovative game has just landed on the PocketPC                platform. Experience the unique feeling of beeing a hacker on the                move, int this hacking simulation game.                Stay updated with new information about vulnerable targets, and                be the first to hack in, cash in the money, trash the host and run                away. Just watch out for the tracer so you won't be traced and continue                your job safely.                A complex and intuitive interface, based on excellent graphics,                will be your virtual center of operations. You can pause your mission                any time, and if you exit, your assets are safely saved and you                can continue anytime."  They also have a PC version of the PPC version, though Im not sure who will want it, unles they are a diehard fan.
