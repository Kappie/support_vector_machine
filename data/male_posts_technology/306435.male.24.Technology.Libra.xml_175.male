It took me a long time to figure it out, but it hit me today.  He reminds me of my freshman football wide receiver coach.  Coach Johnson was crazy and yelled and got overly excited and that is exactly what Woody Paige does on ATH.  I remember a practice where the freshman team scrimmaged the JV team.  I ran a route over the middle of the field and got sandwiched by to linebackers as I caught the ball.  As the players cleared off of me, the only thing I remember was Coach Johnson screaming in my face.  I caught the ball and he was happy.  So happy, he literally dragged me the seven yards back to the huddle.  I was not on my feet until the huddle was already breaking up for the next play.  Good times.  It is that excitement that keeps me watching ATH.
