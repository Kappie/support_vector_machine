       cramping 

    

    Lost that one, forced 

 

 

 The belches are finally starting to come out now, so I feel a little bit better, but I guess I hadn't been able to feel my intestines while I was nauseous.  My intestines are cramping.  It's already 1:21 am and I've been in this chair for hours.  Tomorrow (or today technically) I'm going way out of my way to take care of myself.  I hope to go to a book store and find " urlLink Eating for IBS " otherwise I'll purchase it online.  Then I'll read a bit at home before heading off to the grocery store to buy ingredients for the recipes.  I don't think I can take 60 more years of this, so I had better get started on managing it properly.
