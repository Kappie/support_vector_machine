Nothing bad, but things that will get strangers to do a double take and do a "What tha'? Did that kid just say that?"  My oldest daughter just turned two and she has been at that parrott-esque mimicking stage for quite a while now. I think the first thing I taught her to say was "'Sup Daddy!" followed by "Bling Bling" and "On the double!" (in the direction of my wife when I am tired of waiting for her). Most recently we were late for dinner on our way back from the grocery store with a container of strawberries open so my daughter wouldn't go into a diabetic shock (she's not really diabetic, but a child’s volatility potential seriously increases when they go too far beyond their normal eating times). So my daughter was in the back seat eating huge strawberries in about 4 bites, they were disappearing so fast that I had to keep my peripheral vision on her just to make sure she wasn't chucking them into the back of the car half-eaten and then asking for more. After each strawberry she would demand: "More strawberry!” We are at the stage that we are trying to teach her how to ask politely for things, so we would respond: "More strawberries, please?" and she would repeat it so we would give her another strawberry.  This lasted about 5 minutes until I got bored and started prompting her to say other things. It evolved from "More strawberries, please." to "More strawberries, NOW" to "More strawberries, I COMMAND YOU" to "More strawberries, I AM GOD." There were a few more permutations, but all in all to deify a 2 year old and hear those commands in a tiny voice and with all the girly intonations, it was hilarious. I probably wasn't setting the best example but hey, in this day and age, who does?
