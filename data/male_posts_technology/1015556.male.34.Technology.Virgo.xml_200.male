Spring is our outreach retreat, where kids are encouraged to bring their friends.  Our speaker is TG, who used to be on staff with Young Life in Howard County.  He is going to do 4 Gospel presentations through the whole weekend. I'm going as kind of a SPACE mini-launch, and KC and I are taking 5 8th graders to work on the kitchen/workcrew.  It will be a great time, I'm looking forward to building some good relationships with these 8th graders.  Of course, I'm going to try and convey the sense of vision for SPACE to them as well.
