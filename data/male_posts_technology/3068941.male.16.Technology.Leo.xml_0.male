Never mind, it drives me insane even thinking about it, I mean if I even thought about waking my parents up and forcing them to play baseball for 2 hours they would KILL me, but my little brother is different. Any who my parents and HE are watiching Lion King One and One Half(BTY he is TWELVE, Is t just me or is that just a little old to be jumping up and down when seeing that they have the movie.) Any way I gonna go passout now, Ill be hanging out a Barnes And Nobles tomorrow so i'll blog bout that tomorrow.
