A tree fell on her mobile home destroying her home and most of the contents. Fortunately, both were not at home when this happened. They are now in the process of trying to retrieve any thing they can.  Rochester Mini Storage has donated a storage unit for her use.  She could not afford insurance and did not have any.  Her Mobile home has to be torn down.  All that she and her 14 year old daughter had was in the mobile home.  Dianna worked hard to pay it off - so that she only had the lot rent of $460.00. Then she was laid off - Dianna is working now - but at a much lower salary.  Now she lost her home...  Dianna is a wonderful woman. If I didn't already have a full house, she would have moved in with me.  She works very hard to provide for her family. She never has asked for any help and is always the first one in line to help someone else. Now it is our turn.  Dianna and Whitney need a home.  She would like to stay in the Rochester area so Whitney can stay in the same school.  We have contacted some low income housing we have and they already have waiting lists.  A very generous donation was made (by a resident) of a mobile home for her use in Rochester Estates. Unfortunately it needs too many repairs for Dianna to afford.  If you know of a home, apartment, flat or townhouse that would be available for $500.00/mth or less - please call me or e-mail.  Please help get the word out.  I have not checked with Rochester - does any one have any contacts there?   She will need a flurry of things once she lands - I will try to get a list out once we know. Also a fund has been set up for her and Whitney.  I would like you all to know that Georgia Malinoski (a close fiend of Dianna), Rochester Mini Storage, Ron Crowell and Pat Somerville have all been tremendous in their efforts to help Dianna - Georgia is the ring leader who jumped head first to help her friend.  I sure hope in a time of crises, we all have a friend like Georgia.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or pass this one to anyone who can help.                           MY HEART TO YOURS! Sues  248.650.8047 Fund for Dianna and Whitney is:  Community Plus Savings Bank c/o DIANNA WHITCHARD 310 W Tienken Rd Rochester, MI 48306 (248) 651-8202
