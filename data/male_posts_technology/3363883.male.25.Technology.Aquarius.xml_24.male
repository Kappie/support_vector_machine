When I asked about the strip clubs [which is almost an obligatory thing to ask someone whose been on a bucks night], he replied that they didn't get to it that night because half the guys got banned when they went at 2 that afternoon.  Must have been a very full day for some.  Anyway, Paul told me a great story which he swears is true.  On Saturday afternoon all the boys were in the boozer talking about whether they had pulled the night before. From what I gathered they had spent the friday night in a couple of pubs in areas of ill repute where it's easier to pull a woman then a tooth out of a dead horse. So there were all kinds of stories bouncing around the table.  One of the boys came up with this: "Well, I got with some lass and managed to con her into taking me back to her place. We had a couple of more drinks and decided to get off there and then. We were both enjoying a bit of the old forplay and I started playing with her arse. She was a bit "oh no no, not there", but after a while she was all for it so I took her up the bum."  At this point Paul asked him if he had never met this girl before. "Nope".   So Paul asks "So did you wear anything?", talking about protection.  The guy turns and tells him with a perfectly straight face, "Yeah. My socks."  I nearly fell out of my chair laughing.
