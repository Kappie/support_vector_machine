Besides the fact that it sucks because it's Monday, it sucks I have to work on Memorial Day. I have memories too! I would like to remember... my dog Snoppy who died and when to Doggie-Heaven a couple of years back! See, I should be free for the day!  Instead, I get tons of work. Looks like my boss planned all weekend on what I should do, seeing that I'm only working today and tomorrow for rhis week. Then, it's off to party and celebrate for the 5+ years I spent busting my butt at college! Hopefully I'll be able to rest during this period and come back re-energized next week. Working on the same code over and over and over and over again can be boring.  Yesterday I didn't post because of how hectic it was, as my normal Sundays are. I have to scramble and check that I'm taking everything to my apartment, make sure to don't forget anything, visit my girlfriend, then go home, say goodbye to my mom and then leave for the two-hour drive to the apartment. Every week I leave something behind. This week was a towel, which I had to urgently stop by Wal-Mart and buy. Last week it was my cell phone's charger. Sprint wanted me to cough up $40 for a new one, so I spent the whole week using the phone like 10-15 minutes a day so the battery wouldn't die out. As long as my most important belongings don't stay behind (my laptop, Gameboy Advance, cell phone and CDs, in that order) then I'm good to go for the week.  Let me finish what I'm doing to see if the boss could be happy seeing that I'm working my tail off to leave everything running smoothly while I'm gone. A new technician is coming in to work a part time this week while I'm gone. I was supposed to fix PCs, but since the higer-ups saw I knew how to program, they stuck me here, which is cool because I get so bored fixing computers! Plus, I get to create new things that are going to be used in the entire company, so that's an added bonus. So before I get fired, as I always fear, let me leave this post here. Have a great Memorial Day, and remember your loved ones and even the ones you don't love, don't be so selfish! :)
