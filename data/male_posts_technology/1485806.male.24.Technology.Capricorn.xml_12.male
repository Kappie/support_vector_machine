Tommorrow got this job interview with TMNet.. yes i kinda signed up for a company i have no choice over. Tomorrow is the big day and i am like don't know where the place is  Jalan Semarak..Wisma TMTOuch.   In the whole course of thinking and mulling over the issue of joining this job or not, I thought about my time as a student is more liberal...now hey i have to secure a job and then probably negotiate so that either Sunday or Saturday , that i can have a free day. Yes ideally everybody who is holy....say amen... says don't go for the job ..That is God's day...but for a recent graduate who have been jobless for months like me,, i can't afford to say no.. Everyone says ideally but when i asked them ...have u face any circumstances like this before and most of them shook their heads....so much for principles...because if you put into my shoes ...i guess everyone else will do the same.     Furthermore the job recruitment firms says so and the job is a contract based. therefore no chance to breach the contract. It is a one year commitment to the company. So I pray tomorrow , i can't market myself in the interview and the attitude which i bring must be christlike. Not that my attitude hasn't been that way. These few days and months , i really felt the presence of God and the plan of His unveiling everyday. I pray that even by securing a job , i would not compromise His standards..because I have seen a lot of my friends who have turned away from Him and friends because he have secure a high paying job..  I guess my blogging quality hasn't been entertaining...yes it have been a trying time and i pray that my blog will carry that jars of clay that God have hidden in the field..and that those who found the jars of clay..will buy over the whole field...and owned it.  For those who have found it, man ...that is the real joy..to laugh and thankful and continually praising God regardless of situations. I have found that by praising God in the bad times is what real joy is ...and that is where God comes in because if you want God to be faithful to you ,....you also must be faithful to God.  until next blog....
