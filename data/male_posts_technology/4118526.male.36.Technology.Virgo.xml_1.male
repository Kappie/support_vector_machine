I am not sure what was different over there but here I am a small fish in a very large pond.  Plus the blogger.com site doesn't lend it self as well when it comes to finding others blogs.  So if I was hoping for comments from others, I obviously need to "go back where I came from."  Here I will just post to hear my self think and if someone comments so be it.  These things are more fun when they are interactive.
