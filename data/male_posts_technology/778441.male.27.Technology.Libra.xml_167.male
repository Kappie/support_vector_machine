At least thats what famous Albanian comedian, Sejfulla Myftari, did when armed robbers aimed Kalashnikov rifles at him with intentions of robbing him on the highway, last week.  Stepping out of the car, Myftari reached out and patted the gun and said, " Oh thanks, I haven't seen a Kalash (Kalashnikov) in ages -- will you let me hold it please ".  This amused the gangsters, who recognized the bald head and bulging eyes of the comedian, and asked him to leave quickly in his car, so that they could rob another car.  So, there you go! ... Laughter is, indeed, the best medicine!!! ;-)
