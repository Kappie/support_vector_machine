I've been drinking Coke since I was about 7 years old.Which explains a lot, now that I think about it. However, recently I've been taking to Pepsi  just to be different (coz I get down like that, I'm a regular crazy person, hide your wives and daughters).  Oddly, despite the initial reaction to want to vomit my guts out (I think Coke puts something in their juice that causes Coke consumers to retch violently when consuming any other non-Coke related product.), it sort of grows on you. It's hard to describe, but Pepsi tastes 'crisper'. It's hit the point where I prefer an ice cold Pepsi to a Coke. Like I said. Crazy.
