For the record I won this argument, he quit when it was apparent that his argument was flawed due to him being brain washed by his church. His stance was, this would undermine the sovereignty of America, and put us under the control of foreign nations. I calmly stated that he was fool and how in the hell would it hurt for us to look at other people’s successes and failures when making a decision. What kind of idiot would not use the example set by others to figure out the correct path to take. I’ll tell you what if I’m watching an American and an Englishman standing on a cliff-side and the American steps forward and falls to his death and the Englishman turns around and walks away I’ll follow the goddamn limey for sure, fucking patriotism be damned.    Now after I pointed out his flaw in not learning from history and all that, he decided to change to flow of that discussion to something he thought he knew. He began to argue that America’s real problem was that our political leadership (not the republicans) was sending us downa pathof moral depravity, because they did not make or pass laws based on their faith in Jesus Christour Lord and Savior. At this point my jaw came unhinged and dropped to floor. He pointed out that a large majority of America is Christian, and he was correct. I then pointed out that most Christian denominations considered Mormons heretics and would pass laws that required Mormon to be killed. I also then pointed out that Mormons were killed in every state that tried to settle in until they found the one state no else wanted. He then said that Utah was a gift from the baby Jesus, and I said then why in the Hell didn’t Joseph “Magic Crystals” Smith just take you right to fucking Utah. At that point I was told a non-believer couldn’t understand. Must be because I don’t wear holy underwear and subjugate women.
