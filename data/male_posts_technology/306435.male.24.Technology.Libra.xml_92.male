Ann talked to Progressive yesterday and the guy who hit us has yet to report it...figures.    I found an apartment with Tom yesterday.  It is in Hyde Park and is about the same per month as my current place.  It has all new carpet and has just been repainted.  It is in a apartment complex across from Kroger and a lot of other stores.  I like it.  So it looks like next week will be moving week.    Ann's house had a picnic gathering thing last night that was fun.  Grilled out and played Cornhole.  It sounds weird, but it is a fun game.  Set up like horse shoes, but instead of a ring there is a wooden board with a hole in it.  Teams throw bean bags and get one point for landing on the board and three points for going in the hole.  Chris Hatch and I teamed up as the ultimate team gong undefeated throughout the night until we got banned from the game.  The funny thing is neither of us had played before.
