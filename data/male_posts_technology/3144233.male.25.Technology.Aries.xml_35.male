Black Emperor    After having had a brief conversation among a few friends about the ethics of charity, or to what level of humanitarianism we are ethically commited, in a horribly noisy and unsuitable environment I thought it might be a good ideato mention it here where it's possible to think a little more clearly. The main question was this:  Can we justify choosing to do nothing at all towards charitable causes which affect human life or death?  – and if not –  Are we presently doing enough?    I think it is all but certain the answer to the fomer is  “no”  and, for the vast majority of us, I believe that the same is applies to the latter.   If you are not convinced though, you may want to read through what I believe to be a very strong argument for why the majority of us are commited to do more;  urlLink Famine, Affluence and Morality  by  urlLink Peter Singer . This paper was written in 1971 and uses as its case study the  urlLink famine which affected East Bengal  at the time – the famine itslef, along with the civil conflict which caused it, was repsonsible for at least a million deaths.   Of course, this subject matter is directly analogous or at least predominantly applicable to certain problems the world faces at present. Most notably, there is the urlLink situation  in  urlLink Sudan , which is currently the main concern of  urlLink Oxfam ; and the AIDS epidemic affecting Sub-Saharan Africa along with a number of urlLink other developing countries .  urlLink UNAIDS  (The Joint  urlLink United Nations  Programme on HIV/AIDS) predicts that by 2010 there will be 45 million new infections; of which 29 million are avoidable if the necessary preventative measures are taken now. Exactly what is necessary for such prevention is by no means prohibitive; simply money, money that is not vital to the lives of those who have it.  For further informationabout organisations related to these matters, or to look for those which deal with a specific issue, the  urlLink UK Charity Commision  hosts a very useful website where charities can be searched by  urlLink name ,  urlLink number ,  urlLink objetive  or  urlLink area in which they operate , along with plenty of information to assure even the most cynical; income, expenditure, trustees etc.
