I think she was right... it kind of botheremed me though, cause at the time she told me (yesterday around 7 pm) I was really tired after having been up since 6 am, and working a hard day of trying to fight off viruses and running around, and so I was concerened, but too tired to be concerned, which concerened me even more.  You know?  Yeah.  Anyway, I chalk it up to my two day abstinence from my daily vitamins and ginsing.  (I have no idea if that's how you spell ginsing)  I'm not all that worried about it today.  Although I did get up at 6 am again, and started plowing through computer problems as soon as I got here, so I'm already pretty tired.  Ok, phrase for today is om-mani-padme-hum.  --Buddhist mantra.  Means pearl of the lotus.  It has a deeper meaning than that actually, but it's involved and I don't have enough time or space to go into it.  Anyway, repeating that phrase during medidation helps you to concentrate, clear your mind, and become closer to nothingness.  Try it.  This is Kris Burns' last week here.  I'll miss him.  Last thought of the day:  Fair food.  Discuss.
