Its ok, I didn't like it all that much though. Camden yesterday was cool, I have never been before and I know I will be going there alot more often now. Hehe. I got a sum 41 hoodie for the winter. I like hoodies. They are so nice and waaaarm. I met Jon's twin yesterday. I really do look alike! I got a bit confuzzeled! I hope you are feeling better Tom and that the pain goes away soon!
