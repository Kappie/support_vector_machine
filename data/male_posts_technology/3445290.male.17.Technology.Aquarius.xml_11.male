I hated being a child when my mom would complain about not having enough things of luxury like a bigger house, nice new cars, clothing that is ridiculously expensive, and a bunch of oversized flatscreen TV's. I don't understand the human tendencies to spend money on things they don't need and really cant afford and just dig a big hole for themselves in the long run. I know this from experience after watching my parents complain about money troubles all the times yet they were still making impulse buys even tho they were thousands of dollars in debt and had some serious problems which needed to be dealt with first.     When my family was considered middle class or rich we kept on running up bills for things we could not afford, I was really not a very happy child because we were constantly moving into "nicer houses" which made it hard for me to make friends and my parents were always working to make more and more money which made for a very unhappy child since I was always neglected and a loner (thank god for my computer) and unhappy parents since their lives revolved around work and the only happiness they found was through alcohol (at least for my father).     I just think that too many people try too hard to be someone that their not and really try their best to impress others while never taking the time to make sure they are feeling good about themselves.      One thing that I learn time and time again in my life is everything has got to be balanced or your going to tip over. People need to learn how to balance relationships, finances, fitness, nutrition, work, education, fun, and all those other things that are essential to a persons life.  Anyways I got some things to do (play starcraft and review for finals) so I'm going to get to it. LAAAATE!
