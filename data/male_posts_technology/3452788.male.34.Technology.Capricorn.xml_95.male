God, I want to be one of those people, I always have , but I never will be.  I am at once happy for them, jealous of them, and resentful toward their perfect little lives (despite the fact I actually know nothing about them and their own problems).  I actually was watching one young woman, probably no more than 22 or 23, too long, and she looked back at me.  After an instant, I quickly looked away, pretending to be very interested in a window display but actually being embarrassed.  She probably thought I was checking her out, when in reality I was just noticing how her confident walk and pleasant expression made her look painfully beautiful.  Looking back, I remember kids in high school who I thought were in the “in” crowd but in reality I think they were just as miserable as me, only they hid it better.  I am relatively certain one girl, Shannon, had as dismal an outlook on things as I did.  I was somewhat attracted to her, but we different circles of friends, so I rarely talked to her.  When we did talk, though, she was nice to me.  I remember her voice always had a brittle melancholy to it, except when she was socializing (or possibly putting on a façade) for her friends, the popular people.
