I was on the drive home from work and some dude pulls out in front of me, cutting me off a bit but it wasn't too bad so I didn't care. So my gf is in the car and she says to me at one point, "What the hell is he looking at?"  The guy was staring at us in his rear view mirror.  I thought at first maybe he was checking for rogue nose hairs or some shit but nope!  So I'm thinking fuck, why don't you just take a picture asshole? Too cold to put down the window and yell it so I made a stupid looking face for him to look at. Gotta entertain the audience right?  I eventually pass this guy cause he's turning left and he flips ME the bird! What the hell was that about? It only took a second for me to pass so sure enough by the time "that fucker flipped me the bird!" registered in my head, I was already past.  Bah.. retards.
