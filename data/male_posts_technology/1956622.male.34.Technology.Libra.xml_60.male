She really likes it when friends come over with kids she has a great time and they play in the pool and it wears her out.    I awoke at 10:30 am after working the previous night and was able to borrow a pickup and made a run to the dump with stuff I have been meaning to get rid of. Karissa wanted to go so I loaded the extra seat in the pickup and she rode with. I think sheenjoyed the ride except for the part where you got to smell the landfill but then again none of us enjoyed that part!    Daddy (me) alsobaked pumpkin bread, banana bread and cheesecake all from scratch. All seemed to be a big hit with the locals.    Karissa talked to her mommy and and asked her if it was ok to spend the night at daddy's because she really wanted to stay, not sure what that was all about but it was all good!    My buddy Doug came by and he was showing me his motorcycleand the changes he had made to it. He was telling me how he wanted a pair of chaps so he would have to wait to get saddlebags so I gave him my chaps. After all I have no motorcycle anymore and I have not worn them in years so it seemed right. Plus he has helped me out with a lot of stuff.    All in all it was a productive and fun day!
