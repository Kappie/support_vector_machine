Today I'm back in the office, having been to Birmingham yesterday, oh the joys of being on the road - I'm probably back to Birmingham tomorrow!  Started working on my car last night only to find that nearly every bolt I wanted to undo was seized, so today I've made a management decision - I'm going to pay someone else to do it all!  Can't afford it but hey thats never stopped me before.  Also found out today that my boys adenoid operation has been delayed - whats the point of going private if the operation still gets delayed?!
