I will be sharing with you some nice stuff like .net  and misc samples, tips and tutorials, XBOX notices, technology insiders, music notes. Feel free to share. Complains are well received.  Also you will meet my family, my friends, my work-pals, my vices, and more.  See you around... Don't put yourselves offline...
