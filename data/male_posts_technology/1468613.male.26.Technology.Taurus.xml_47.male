And Gede, if you dont come home soon, i'm leasing out your half of the bedroom to someone from manpower....and no, not Jamie Durie, he can have my spare side of the bed!!!! Anyway, the long weekend was very....well, long....too many parties and other things...all whilst Caz was stuck at home studying....but Caz, thanks to daddymorebucks, now has a litre of BS Gin, so Hoorah again, thus to say that the beautiful girl will be spending at least the next three hours here!  Uni is fine, very over it...its not same being a student in a student only house....where are my workers???? (Caz wants to also add here that she passed the  urlLink PHP  assignment by one mark, and Caz says 'cheers!'...)  Not much has been happening here at McLachlan....the lesbians have been really handy of late, they seem to love the jump starts four times a day! Fred is very dead unfortunately, but my new  urlLink beagle  (ginnie) is fantastic! You have to see him!!!! He is sitting on Caz's lap right now, and I am only telling you about him because I am drunk, so act suprised when you meet him! He only cost $800 but they are sending me the papers!!!! I am thinking that we can make a quick quid by entering him in shows and selling off his sperms....  I am missing my home style cooking....KFC dont seem to do it as well....even if they did cater my culinary needs twice in one day recently....I have discovered the 'Baked Potatoe Cafe' of late, and now with also Caz's stamp of approval, I have also been there twice in 24 hours!   James and Anna are still living in lovers paradise over at Spruzen....they were going to have a couple days apart so they could do some study...but that lasted all of 4 hours...bless!   anyway that is all from me, I did think on Saturday that I had cancer/diabetes/respiratory problems...but they seem to have all cleared up now...perhaps it was liver related!   See You soon! And Kai, seriously, I need a new watch! beautiful, silver, bulky, ticking, designer....you know what I like!!!! And Caz needs shoes....corporate bitch collins st shoes for malvern!!! love to all! Peace UP!  love jaMEs.....
