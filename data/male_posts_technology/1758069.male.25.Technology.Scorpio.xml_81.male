(cont'd)  there's alot more, but at present i've had too much wine and don't feel like transcribing it from my classgear notebook.  maybe i will at another date.  i can't say why i felt like bringing this up now, except that i was reading through my writing(s) and was somewhat vilified by this segment.  if anyone wants some more let me know.  this first installment is free....    album of the day:   urlLink   beulah        yoko
