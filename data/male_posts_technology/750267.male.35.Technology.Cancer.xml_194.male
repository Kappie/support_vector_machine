At the same time, Moody's said that the U.S. deficit ratio is larger than most of the other governments rated AAA, and it appears the deficit will get worse over the next 4 years before it starts getting better. If nothing is done, the U.S. will be in dire financial straights in 2020 - 16 years from now. That's a long way off I suppose, but not  that  long.  Can you imagine the outcry from U.S. politicians if Moody's downgraded U.S. debt? Holy smokes! The Moody's employees responsible for that report would be charged with treason, and the company would suffer a public humiliation beyond compare. Perhaps Moody's would be accused of supporting terrorists, since it's credit downgrade would cause billions of dollars in damage to the U.S. economy "in a time of war".  Hey, maybe that's what bin Laden has been trying to do all along? Make the U.S. spend (some say waste) trillions of dollars on defense over the next 10 years, forcing the government into either bankruptcy or a much weaker political and economic position worldwide.  That is, the weak U.S. economy cannot be blamed solely on bin Laden and September 11th. George Bush and his warriors played a key role as well.
