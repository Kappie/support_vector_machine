The problem lies in the difference between how web designers think and how the frustrated Internet user thinks , said Kansas State University psychologist Keith Jones."

 Isn't this obvious. It amazes me that some web designers still think that users actually want to see their elaborate graphic intense sites. Or marketing types think users want to see and hear their elaborate, overblown, long-winded Marketing story. Users don't care! They want to get something done. Until designers start to understand their users sites will never be usable.
