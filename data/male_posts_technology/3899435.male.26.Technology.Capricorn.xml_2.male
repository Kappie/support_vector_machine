Most of the western thought seems have come from the greek ideologies. What happeneded to the rest? Is it safe to say that they are not even present in their own country of origin? I guess thats true in the case of the Indian Phililosophy. One of the cornerstone of indian philosophy is mind control and the belief on "happiness is within" (whatever that means). Has this philosophy withstood its ground ?  There has been a recent discussion in my college mailing list about the comments made by some infosys guy that innovation can only be done in US and indian software companies should help them in that process. This somehow led to a discussion on "Are indians really dumb?". Why should a country and its people be judged by its scientific execellence? Is that all to life? Should that be a commonality among all the people and culture? Was indian culture based around it? I dont think so.  I have never thought scientific excellence was what indian culture was based upon. Indian culture did not follow the path of rationality which the greeks followed (later  became the basis of western thought and scientific pursuit). Indian philosophy, I think, involved the "unknown" and "unknownable". There are things in the world which cant be explained or understood by human beings (which is till true). So the easy way to deal with the "unknownable" is the presence of the "unknown" (belief system of gods). "Ignorance is bliss" most aptly describes indian philosphy.  So where did the indian philosphy fail? One of the main falures of indian culture could be its inablity to protect itself from western thoughts. This doesnt mean that western thought is not good. But indian culture failed to impress upon its own people the potential it offered for leading their life. The Indian socienty seemed to be impressed by the western thought and it definition of happiness. The westerners judged the Indian society, culture, development,etc based on their system. So as a new comer to the western thought, nations like india is considered under-developed.   So indian people are working hard to improve there lives as measured by the western belief system. This spread of western philosophy ( or thought or watever) to other once culturally different nations is being pronounced as upliftment of third-world countries. This new colonization is spreading quite fast.   Construct your thought around "Meaning of colonization", Software Industry, Outsourcing and "The Resource" to observe one of the manifestation of neo-colonialism.
