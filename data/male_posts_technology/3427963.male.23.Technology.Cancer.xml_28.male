Saying goes "wat goes ard, comes ard". "its better to give than to receive", i love and give and expects something back at least. of cos at least something.....no matter how much even if its not equivalent. "no fish, shrimp also good". i give so i naturally expect some return.....even if u cant give me equivalent, at least give me that little nothing and i will be contented. Like i said, i am very very silly and foolish. In fact i admit i really really am silly and foolish, i believe in love, i believe in giving unconditionally when i love that person very much. It love that drive me to do all this and not the desire or need to have a relationship, cos if thats the case, i would have given up long ago. Maybe i havent grow up, not physically but mentally. I really have a lot more to learn and a lot more to experience. A friend told me to learn to love someone who loves you, but.....teach me how. Do i have to learn it the hard way? Wats so difficult to love and accept someone? Love is actually very very simple but ppl tends to think too much and make it complicated.....thats wat i think. Maybe she dun have a feeling for me, maybe not even that little bit. its jus a one sided thing and i'm the onli willing party. But i'm not realli prepared to give up or wait for someone to love me in order to love. Cos if i dont love and give, how am i ever going to receive anything? It works like nature, in a cycle, it goes rd and rd. Maybe the saying is rite, "dun chase after happiness, jus look straight and walk ahead, happiness will follow u" Said the mother dog to the puppy who kept running ard in circles trying to catch its own tail cos the mother dog mentioned b4 that the tail is like happiness. She ask me to move on and pursue my dream.....i am, i am pursuing my dream and while i do that, cant i even have someone to share my woes and happiness with along the way and when i do achieve my dream, i hope that person i shared the joys and sadness with is none other than u.....cos i love u, really.....i realli realli do.....if loving someone is realli that hard, then y love in the first place??  Cheers, Teddy,the silly bear who love y@n alot alot alot.......
