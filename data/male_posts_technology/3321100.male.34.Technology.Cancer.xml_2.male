It was verry funny, pleasant, romantic... The feeling show on this film was so near of the feeling we could have here... It's strange how in so few time we can be so close friend, there is no limit, we can say all the things we haven't never said to someone in the real life. And it's not so superficial than the non introduce people thinks.  It was so strange, so special, I like this !!!!!! For my dear wife, this film show how people are stupid. She is angry about all this place where I go sometimes. In this part of me where she can't reach me, here... My so british secret garden was my second life!  In my secret dream, I'm an artist, living in London (speaking a perfect english lol)with a nice and intelligent girl and two funny children. Yep !!! I'll do this in my next life Sure !!!  Don't be afraid, I'm today verry happy in th south of France, with a verry nice and sportive girl and I speak a perfect french ! Isn't it ????
