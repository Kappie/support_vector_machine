I particularly like the discussion of yoga and eastern philosophy towards the beginning.  The dude who played the dad on Different Strokes was in it as was a very young Sylvester Stallone playing a bit part as a  thug.   Two thumbs up for good laughs and brevity.     urlLink What's your favorite TD celebration?  I gotta go with the dirty bird just because they got Dan Reeves to do it once.  Since my last post I have decided that mowing the yard officially sucks.   I have also decided that I make excellent beer.  The most recent batch I made and bottled is a porter and I've been happy to discover that the longer it's in the bottle, the better it gets.   It is kind of heavy, though.  I think I'm going to make and amber next time.  Fantasy team won one and tied one but lost the tie breaker (bench scoring) so now I'm 2 - 4.
