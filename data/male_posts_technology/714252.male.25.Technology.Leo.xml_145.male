Have notcied some of the other blogs have become very quiet (/me looks at bubbles) while others are doing a roaring trade! (Hey G!)  I have been flat out working on the company during the day and too broke to do anything at night but will get myself sorted on that end very soon thankfully!!   Anywho.. At some stage today we SHOULD have the rough site up and running (maybe tomorrow but hoping today). This will be a version 1 of the site to be "upgraded" once we get our proper web-space sorted out!  urlLink StepThru.ie
