It starts when my best friends invite me to watch a movie over at a house they are house sitting for, they only are house sitting in the dream not in real life, I have never seen this house before.  They also invite some of their other friends and its a cool gathering, except there is a vital problem with the bathroom at this place.  For some reason the bathroom only functions by urinating in this dirty cooking pot, the pot is unwashed from last being used for some kind of pasta.  Oh, but it gets worst, for some reason my foot is stuck in this pot, and everyone has to use the bathroom!  Between the inconvient "bathroom breaks" we watch a movie about mice.  The movie starts with the mice discovering all "life" from the world is gone and they now rule it.  They build their society until quite unexpectedly it is ended by the return of the previous lifeforms of the world.  At the end of the movie you find out that this is a NIGHTLY occurence during the hours of which the lifeforms (humans) go to bed, and the world is a couple of rooms in a house.   There was also something about Maniac Mansion about this dream, but I don't remember what.. I just get the impression.  The memories of the dream fade me, thank goodness, but I wish I could remember more about the movie!
