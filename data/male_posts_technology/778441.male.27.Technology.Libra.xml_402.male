Yup! you heard that right... 2070!!!  While Nielsen played white, the computer program  urlLink Beowulf , harnessing the combined power of 2070 distributed computers from 56 countries, played black.  The game, which lasted several hours, ended in a draw. But GM Peter Nielsen commented that he had set several traps for ChessBrain which computers normally fall for… but was surprised that ChessBrain refused them!  Results of the match can also be found  urlLink here .  God!!... and I have trouble playing against one opponent!!   [link via  urlLink Slashdot ]
