 I have been using MSN 8 (software only) for several days, and I really like it. I am not an AOL user, I am just a typical Internet broadband addicted user who thought AOL users where ignorant for needing "training wheels". There are a lot of great features I won't go into it, but the one idea I really like is keeping all my tasks, appointments, and addresses online. MSN gives a really rich user interface to all my data. And if I decide I don't want to pay the $10.00/month anymore, I can cancel my subscription, and use the web-based version to access it for free. Also, I can take it all with me since MSN 8 allows syncing to my Pocket PC (Palms too, if you can believe that). I am really looking forward to when Microsoft Smart Phone 2002 hits the United States. Yet another cool interface to my data. I certainly feel like a "Microsoft whore", but I really do enjoy it.
