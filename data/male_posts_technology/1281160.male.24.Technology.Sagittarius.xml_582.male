Regarding education portrayal, the scenario is going to change ma. Slowly there is an awareness in people about this. U r also an example of it. the anger in u is an example that u deny the fact that the education that what we get in India is not as low as whats been portrayed. But then its obviously low when compared to the intellectual property possessed by our forerunners. Similarly in most of the fields we are depicted with low values which we have never cared to give enough attention and we let it go astray. But then now people are realising that its not the case. And i think in forth coming days, we will surely try to behave more refined and prove them that, the notion which others carry, about our nation is not true. To make this happen it needs proper understanding of our culture and live as an execution of it to them.   If u read the article which i had posted a few days ago about Education in India, it will help u understand the underlying facts that obviously we are far to go in certain things. Yes to set right things which were made wrong by british is a mamoth task, but then there is always a hope in me that it will happen. What u speak about here is the external facts of the current education system. To be frank it seems, its the poverty that made u feel anger and by the peripheral things we cant judge the education system. Read that article once again to have more light on current system of education and how britishers were higly successful in achieving what he needed. Yes, he wanted us to become a foreigner in our own land and here we are good example of it. He could wisely cut us off from all the treasured knowledge and let us squander thru all the nasty meanders of the dark part of life and let us not think but only work as said. How tragic its to imagine the once so rich nation, not so long ago, probably around 250 years ago whose % in world trade was 25% of the world trade is now having just 0.5% as its share in world trade. But USA whose history dates not so long back, and which dint exist few hundred years ago is now doing 25% of the world trade. How we have left all our riches to drain.......   Got some work now, will continue in next blog Ranjini
