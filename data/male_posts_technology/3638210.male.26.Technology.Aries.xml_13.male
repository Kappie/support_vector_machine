However, that doesn't prevent the slew of tenacious college girls (and their bevy of adventurous roommates) from attempting to interest me in their web cam from time to time. Just trying to pay tuition no doubt... bless their over-showered hearts.  Well, pop ups apparently are the gateway drug for computers. Or maybe like gray hairs because the more I killed, the more I had. I tried fiddling with security settings in Internet Explorer and a few Ad-Alert and Spyware solutions, but it was too late. My computer had just been around the block too many times.  Also my Norton Anti-Virus software was Win98 and I now run XP. There were some compatibility issues and it wasn't able to catch everything.  So I finally decided to wipe my hard drives clean and start anew; the computer version of born again virginity. Hence the bit of blog lag.  I'd write more, but I'm currently caught in the graceful dance between coughing up one's lung and dry heaving. If computer viruses were communicable I'd be blaming my PC, but then again if I had what it did; it would be more like a burning sensation in embarrassing areas and would require some type of ointment to treat.
