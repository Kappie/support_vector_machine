 Oh, jeah.  If you didn't already know, this country is staged for an epic battle.  I really mean it.  This place is a powder keg ready blow.  Bush and his associates have made for an amazingly charged political atmosphere.  It's hair raisingly exciting and terrifying at the same time.  You watch.  The shit is going to hit the fan and *pop!*

 If you read the US Constitution, you'll find one very important issue that is conspicuously ignored: slavery.  The reason?  The founding fathers didn't think that the country was strong enough to survive the debate over what to do about the huge population living in bondage.  Sometimes you have to ignore an issue until all parties are ready to debate without trying to kill each other.  
 
 The issue of gay marriage, or gay rights in general, has come to a head.  We can't ignore it anymore.  In the red corner, we have the religious right who think homosexuality is morally wrong.  In the white corner we have those who believe that homosexuals are a true minority who are fighting descimination in the same way women  blacks have over this country's short history.  Soon the debate will be on.  Are homosexuals a viable minority?  Is marriage a human right of the life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness variety?  I'm looking forward to the outcome (mostly because I'm optimistic of the outcome), but I can't help but be weary of the consequences of a decision...
