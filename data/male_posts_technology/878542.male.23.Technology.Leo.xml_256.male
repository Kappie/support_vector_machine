A young boy watched me work for a while, his own sand creations forgotten, but his family was leaving, and he walked away, still looking at my lonely castle, too close to the sea.  when the tide rolled in, the walls held through the pounding, and the canals held the disintegrating outer defenses. The castle held together long enough to be completely surrounded by water when the sea finally crossed the outside walls, and began eating at the last defenses around the tower. A rolling wave carried enough away to begin to eat the bottom from it.  The tower was finally destroyed by the back motion of surf, carrying away too much foundation sand.  It was the longest one has ever lasted.  I was still sad to see it go. But I survived, and will create another. And it will be greater.
