 Of course you can say that Christian Science is just a silly and profoundly american cult, just like  urlLink Watchtower  or the  urlLink adventists . But try to read this chapter omitting direct references to Jesus (but not God). I'm not saying that this text is  true ; it  doesn't matter  if it is true or not; it is presented as a worthy challenge to the atheist science. Where would we be without challenges?
