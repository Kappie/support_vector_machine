Anyone who knows anything about computer security or data base integrity knows that these machines are a bad idea. Well, now there's proof.  urlLink The New York Times  is reporting that "almost all" of the records from the first run of these machines have been "lost."  So lets recap: the voting machines are easily hacked; have unreliable databases; have the security of an email kiosk; are owned by a company who has major ties to the republican party; don't produce an audit trail... do we really need  more  reasons to  not  use these things? If your county is using these voting machines, I strongly urge you to submit an absentee ballot instead. Read up on the rules. In my state you don't have to prove that you will be absent, so you can fill it out and mail it in right from home. I know it sounds a little disingenuous, but would you rather take the chance on having the election stolen? I'm not finding a centralized site for the application, so do a google search for your state.  urlLink Here's  how I did mine. Just replace Arkansas with whatever your state is. Also,  urlLink ActiVote  has some good information, and links to your states voting information.
