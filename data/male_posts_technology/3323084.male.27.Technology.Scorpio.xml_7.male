I signed up for Wired News and  urlLink Webmonkey ; Wired magazine is now delivered to my mail box monthly by the way.  I'd been reading Webmonkey for several years getting ideas, tips and good tutorials until the first of this year when it was announced that they were shutting down.  No more newsletters in my inbox, no more updates to the site, but wait, now there's a notice on the site that reads:  "Today's Monkey Bite We're totally back! Webmonkey is alive and kicking, serving up new articles all hot-n-fresh like a stack of banana pancakes. With syrup."    There are no updates to the site or blog as far as I can tell, so is Webmonkey back from the dead?  I guess time will tell, if anyoneâ€™s knows anything about this I sure would appreciate you letting me know something.  Until next time...
