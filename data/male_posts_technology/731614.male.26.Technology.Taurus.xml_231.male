I'm sure Whitney won't mind, especially since she's a crack whore, and in my experience crack whores don't start many fights over the changing of lyrics to express any warm fuzziness one might feel towards their roommates.  That's just my experience though.  If she calls?  I'm out of the country, adopting a baby in Guam with my husband Roberto.  Thanks.      I believe the  Real World Blogger Style roomies  are our future  Teach them well and let them lead the way  Show them all the   urlLink Tootie   they possess inside  Give them a sense of pride to make it easier Let the  roomies'  laughter remind us how we used to be  Everybody searching for a  monkey   People need someone to look up to  I never found anyone to  refill my meds   A lonely place to be  So I learned to depend on  Boz    Chorus:  I decided long ago, never to  blog  in anyone's shadows  If I fail, if I succeed  At least I  blog  as I believe  No matter what they take from me  They can't take away my  insanity   Because the greatest love of all  Is happening to me  I found the greatest love of all  Inside  the hot tub  The greatest love of all  Is easy to achieve  Learning  what a Posture Bar is   It is the greatest love of all   I believe the  roomies  are our future Teach them well and let them lead the way  Show them all the  nougaty goodness  they possess inside  Give them a sense of pride to make it easier  Let the  roomies'  laughter remind us how we used to be   Chorus  And if by chance, that special place  That you've been dreaming of  Leads you to a  mental institution   Find your strength in  zonk
