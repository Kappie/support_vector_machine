According to polls, over 65% of Americans think the news on Iraq is too negative and the prison stories were over reported.  Not so says Dan, Tom and Peter !!!  They are mad that the Reagan coverage is pushing time away from them obsessing with Iraq stories.  Just shows how out of touch with america they are !!!!!  Kevin   June 9, 2004 -- DAN Rather and Tom Brokaw work for dif ferent networks but agree one thing — coverage of Ronald Reagan's death has been excessive, they say.  "Even though everybody is respectful and wants to pay homage to the president, life does go on," Rather told the Philadelphia Inquirer.   "There is other news, like the reality of Iraq," said the "CBS Evening News" anchor. "It got very short shrift this weekend."   Networks have been going almost wall-to-wall with coverage since Reagan passed away Saturday at the age of 93. The former president was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease nearly 10 years ago.   "Once the herd starts moving in one direction, it's very hard to turn it, even slightly," Rather said. "Nationally, the herd has grown tremendously."   "I think just about everything is over-covered these days," said Brokaw, who anchors the "NBC Nightly News." "The spectrum is so crowded. With all the cable networks, it begins to have a 'video wall' feeling to it."   Jennings said he had mixed feelings about the Reagan coverage.    "I'm more inclined to spare coverage — come on [the air], do something meaningful, then get away," he said.   "The last time I had to do it was with O.J. Simpson [during the 1994 car chase], and I had nothing to say after a certain period of time."   Coverage of Reagan's death will continue through Friday's funeral on all the news networks (broadcast and cable). — Post TV Staff
