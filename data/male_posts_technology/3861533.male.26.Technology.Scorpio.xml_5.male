Being the organisation freak that I am I would have liked the ability to categorise my posts with keywords but it does not seem to be possible with Blogger. The work-around might be to simply create different blogs.  I've now created a blog for  urlLink movies, tv-shows, books, music . I first thought of creating a separate blog for each individual media, mainly because I watch so many movies, but since the other blogs would then be so small I decided to group them together as one.  I think I'll also establish a private blog, a diary. The way I see it, me writing a diary has the following purposes: 1) To capture what I was doing at a certain time. This would give me the ability to "go back in time" to see when what happened. One of my problems is that I have the memory of a goldfish for a lot of things. This does not bother me right now (if I cannot remember it, it was obviously not important enough to remember), but I sometimes wonder if I, when I'm older (say like 50+), only will remember the most basic things about these days. Since I don't use cameras (stopped in 6th grade, I think) I wouldn't even have pictures to remind me but would be forced to rely solely on my memory. It might not be a problem, but how the heck does one know how one'll feel about it in 25 years? Should one stay on the safe side and write one? But maintaining a  good  diary for this purpose will take up a lot of my time. And who's to say that a diary wouldn't go the same way as my elementary school notebooks? I threw them out when I moved out of my parents house as it simply was not worth the space (and possible storage cost) when I knew that I would at most look at 'em for an hour or so every 10-20 years. Naturally an electronic diary wouldn't use up any physical space, but the usage part problem is still there. How often would I actually re-read what I've written? Probably very infrequently. And just how much use would I have of it when I did? Decisions, decisions, decisions...  2) Providing a future partner with access to my earlier life 3) Providing any friend with access to my earlier life I don't think I could ever write a diary without having in mind that someone could read it someday. Having this point of view necessitates that everything written must be "fit" for publication. Not by distorting the truth, but by omitting it - some things might simply not "do" being published.  This somewhat contradicts purpose 1 above. If I omit things then how am I supposed to remember them later on? The only solution is probably to write entries containing enough information to remind me of the "unfit" parts. All of this worrying about what someone else might think! I sometimes think it a little too self-centered to always be expecting someone to take note, as if I was destined for greatness or something. Ah well.  4) There was a fourth reason but I can't remember it right now...
