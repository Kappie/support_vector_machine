(hence the Paxil)  Since this is my first blog ever I guess I will tell you the story of Ogrgiss from the planet of Xlplik.. Or maybe not.  Perhaps you would rather I stick to the theme and describe my daily life etc...   ON WITH THE SLAUGHTER   I was born at a very early age  ha ha  ha ha I love that one.  My wife says then I turrnneedd (sp) into a gorilla.  Not quite sure what she means by that but she is sitting right beside me so I will humor her.  she is getting abdomon pains right now but she says it isn't period cramps just dull aches that won't come out.  Probobly farts.     OH I SEE.   She said the gorilla thing as I am hairy.  wow she comes up with some good ones doesn't she.  Today I did squat.  Same as yesterday.  And the day before that.  You see I am on Paxil.  A drug that is given to people (and lab rats) that stops you from going deeper into depression.  That depresses me.  The side effects include sleepiness, a sense of lazyness, and the inability to CUM !  This is why my wife is a very happy person.  I can go for a long time without cumming but that presents other problems such as a raw penis, wife falling asleep during sex,  AND SEVERE RAINBOW BALLS   Rainbow balls are like blue balls but even worse.  To see a picture of my wife's dildo collection click here urlLink    Sorry boys that link thing didn't work.  Lets try that again here urlLink    I'll have to work on that link.    I guess I'll go for now as I am feeling horney and need to jerk off.  Sorry if I offended you but if you can't take a joke   FUCK YOU!    In the next episode you will hear about the time I rescued all the one legged taranchulas from a KFC slaughterhouse.........
