The following is part of his 7/8/2003 01:51:36 PM post:    Why the heck did God give me the life he did? Why couldn't I have the life of so many other people... they are happy. Why was I given this life to live? I'm supposed to learn from it? I'd rather not; I'd rather that I had a life like other people. Mine is freaking messed up.    Yeah, I kinda know how you're feeling right now (kinda cause my situation at home is slightly different from yours... but not by much). I've been going through this whole emotional Ferris wheel too. One minute, things will be fine with my dad, then the next it's a hurricane. I think so often, "God, why oh why did I even have to be born to live this life? Why did you pick me? Is there something I'm supposed to get out of it; is there something you're preparing me for? I don't want to go through this to become closer to You, I want to be close NOW, Lord... Why couldn't you have picked someone else to live through this hell, someone better suited for it? I just want to get out... want to get out.... want. to. get. out.  Steven, like you, right now I can't really offer many answers, only more questions. But one thing I do know (though I think many times that I'm mistaken, but always realize I was right after all, after a time): No matter how hard it is to see it now (and in some cases, even impossible), God does have a plan for our lives; He loves us and knows what's best for us. Though oh, so many times I wish God would just take me from this earth, or better yet, cause me to never have been born. All this having been said, I'm forced to wonder why he picked me (why he picked us). If God had not been with us all this time, helping us through it, I truly believe we would have cracked far before now.   Whatever... if I say anything else, it'll just be rambling on and on about what I just said, so I'll leave it at that.
