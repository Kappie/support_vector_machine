We actually have average-at-best barracks with one internet "cafe" filled with 7 systems...that must be shared amongst like 600+ people. They have a few open hub slots so when we go back down in February, I should be able to use my own cat 5 line. Acomodations arent all that overall. The rooms are hot, and not to mention, all the way up on the 3rd floor...two elements that would make it bout some bs if it was summertime. I virtually only had time to send one email a day when I finally got the chance. They have a 15 minute limit on internet usage. Not much in the way of privacy either...can't check your bank account unless u want the rest of the world to know your biz also. Well, we're back now, gonna spend most of tomorrow working on some systems, most of which have mid to minor issues. Go back to the unit Tuesday n continue this 8-5 joint til the 22nd of February. Isn't that sweet???? We're getting paid to do next to nothing!!! Man, only if I could say that when we cross those frigid waters...  My baby wrote the most touching poem i've ever read in her blogger. You guys should really check it out...this girl is talented! I can think of only one person who comes close to rivaling her ability to express the feelings in her heart...i'll give u two guesses but u only need one :-) To expound tho, it talked about us..our relationship and its future. I was touched to the point that it made me feel bad about myself and how i've always been doing other things while talking to her. All we really have right now is our communication. We lose that, we lose everything. I can't afford to let that happen. God gave her to me and its my responsibility to treat her like the queen she is! To fight the "ambient distraction syndrome", that is, doing anything that keeps me from talking to Ms Triplett is the key. And I can do that...its just that i'm not used to it. I've always had a multitask-oriented personality...even if I didn't mt well.   I will end for now but only because i'm tired of typing. I almost wish they had voice journals...apparently Nikki thinks its a good idea but she wouldn't buy it. She would be missing out lol. Its a fantastic concept that just needs a little support  ingenuity to work out. I meant truth be told, you don't expect the service to blow up into a billion dollar internet biz..its just a tool to help further communication online. I'll start posting my Ft. Benning adventures tomorrow...stay tuned!
