He loved the fact that Arnie chose to announce his candidature on Jay Leno's show.  Even though my knowledge of American politics is lesser than rudimentary, I replied to his mail ( which was actually on our school's e-group ). Here's that mail. Pardon my lack of grasp of power politics if it seems naive...  When you have a gubernatorial candidate announcing his candidature in a standup comedy show, you know why people say politics is becoming a circus nowadays.  Add to that a list of candidates that boasts of a " smut peddler with a heart " (Larry Flynt), a " pornstar who wants to replace guns with X-Rated movies " (Mary Carey),  a feisty columnist (Arianna Huffington), a " billboard icon " (Angelyne), a " 26-year-old software engineer who sells thong underwear as her campaign mechandise " (Georgy Russell), etc. They also have a couple of candidates who are named Bob Dole and Michael Jackson !! ( not the real things though )  With a circus like this, I guess California leaves behind even Florida ( remember the last Presidential elections... the one that manipulated George W Bush into the White House ).  I guess its " Hasta La Vista, Baby!! " to sanity which leaves the state without saying " I'll be back!! "  Indian elections see lots of circuses too... mostly with the clown acts, but this California thing is turning into an international farce!
