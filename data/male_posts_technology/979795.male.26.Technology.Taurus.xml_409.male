So far, it's been following pretty closely to the comic. Would be interesting to see his regular foes surface in the movie sequels such as Green Goblin 2, Venom, etc.  I had a bit more word with Tang about the financial investment plans with AXA. Figured I needed to sort my finances out first so when I got back, I decided to re-create my Excel document so as to maintain a regular accounts of my expenses and hopefully some savings. Actually I had this habit when I was in UK. Seeing how fast your money disappears will really scare you to spend much less than usual. I modified the old template to suit my current needs. Will be updating my a/c every few days or at least once a week.   While looking for my Excel document, I came across some crappy stuff I created in UK. Haha ... they were half-hearted attempts on writing boliao rhymes to depict my mood. Starting from the earliest which I had created in sec sch. I got inspired by the Mac ad whose famous phrase was "Pie...". It goes something like this:    pie, . ,  kanna sai.  Leon Lai, .  'why',  die.  buy, .  guy,  'gimme 5', . ,  fine. ,.   Haha... I was weird even back then. No idea how I thought of this in the first place.  That's not the end of it...  My first few mths in UK, I had a habit of maximising the free SMS with my hp service and on ICQ. I remembered SMSing my kakis randomly whenever I was in the mood for it.     The sun is high, the wind is cold. Tuck my head in tight, coz my nose juz froze. The day is long, dun moan  groan. I'll sing a song coz I'm goin home.    That was close to winter where the winds got pretty strong and almost always tend to freeze it numb. I was so cold walking back to my flat, but was really glad classes were over. I sent this out when classes had ended.     Enjoy wat remains of today, as I'm working on my essay. O pity to my plight, I wish you all a goodnight. If you see the stars tonight, make a wish with all your might. That I'll finish up on time, and share with you another rhyme.    Was going overtime on an essay then. Felt so tired and so sian but I knew I shouldn't go to bed till I was done. At that time, I tend to leave my ICQ on quite often and I was a bit demoralised when I saw my kakis all drift off to bed one by one. So I just SMSed them before they all knocked out.     Yes, hurray! Only an hour for today. Just hand in my essay, and away to play. Wat are you doing, better not be lazing. Hope you're OK, for the whole of your day. The Aston Webb building, now that's where I'm leaving. Gonna make my way home, for lunch and alone. Home is the place, and there I will stay. Gimme a ring, and why not drop in. Take a look see, at little ol'me.    Felt sooooo happy at submitting in my assignment I had to SMS my friends for the fun of it. It had been a looooong night. The Aston Webb building was where my dept was located then (it shifted later). I had just submitted my essay and was leaving when I created this rhyme. But I felt really lonely then because I knew all my other kakis were in classes or something that day. Though it was practically a free day for me, I felt kinda alone then. That was why I had the last few phrases. I was hoping someone could just pop by for a chat or something because I just felt really really bored.     I know you dun like it, but please juz bear with it. If you really can't stand it, feel free to delete it. We had a great chit chat, but it had to end. Too bad. The soup was pretty neat, it was really quite a feat. Begh's like a little kid, she's really light on her feet. Darren helped a bit, by washing plates and eat. Hope when next we meet, I too can join in to eat.    By this time, some of my friends were getting pretty bored (and dare I say, irritated) with my random SMSes. Haha ... It was 'that' random ok. That's why I included the 2 sentences first. That evening, I believe I dropped by someone's flat for a nice chit chat session. Because my accomodation was hall-related, my breakfast and dinner were both covered. After dinner, I dropped by my friends and I guess, I must've had a bowl of soup only. I can't recall exactly what went on that evening but it really made my feel light-hearted with all that companionship. Begh (3rd year housemate) was like a rabbit trotting and hopping around the flat, that much I can remember. Darren Lim didn't do any cooking but he washed all the dishes I suppose. I felt so happy when I left that I really wished another session like that would come soon. That's when I SMSed everyone when I got back to my flat.     Start of the day, was nice as the month of May. But at the end of today, got on my knees and pray. Had to bite off all my nails, coz I don't understand the tutorial.    Birmingham sometimes would encounter very wet and crappy weather. The day itself was fantastic, but after classes (I seem to recall it being my Databases I lecture by Alex Sexton) I felt so demoralised as I wasn't able to understand the whole tutorial.     Heard from the news this evening, The cold will come a calling. Tommorrow snowshowers forecasted, But these things can't be predicted. Don't get overzealous, Tonight's minus 5 celsius.    We had all encountered a really shiok amount of snow during our 1st year there. It was kinda a freak snow because it never usually got that heavy or thick. It was so great that most Singaporeans felt really pampered by the weather, considering it was a first experience for most of us. So needless to say, a lot of us were also hoping deep in our hearts that the same thing will repeat again. When I heard the news that it was going to snow tomorrow, I was really looking forward to it. But it also meant we all had to bear the -5 degree celsius for the night.     9 to 10 is tommorrow's class on Japan. Cya 10 to 9 at traffic lights, ok man.    I had Japanese language lessons 3 days a week, all of them the first lesson of the day. At that time I was learning it with Darren Lim and David Tay. I was arranging to meet Darren at the traffic light outside my flat and we could all walk to class together since he'd usually pass by anyway.     Hope the ice-cream was nice, though not cold as ice. Eat it after rice, it'll be just as nice. If Begh wants the radio, call me to say hello. Need to go Tesco, who wants to go tommorrow?    Hmm I can't remember exactly what this was about, but I believe it was an ice-cream I took from hall during dinner. Desserts which I can't finish, I tend to bring it back to my flat to store it in the fridge. Sometimes I'd give it with my English housemates if they wanted it. I never believe in wasting food, you see. Well, I think I mentioned to Begh that there was ice-cream and decided to give it to her since I was popping by her place (for some reason or other but I can't remember what). Haha, I do remember Begh complaining that we (kakis) tend to be feeding her all the time. Begh mentioned once before that she'd like to borrow my radio. She needed it to play cassettes or CDs or something like that. I believe that evening was a Fri night as I usually went to the nearby supermarket Tesco to get my groceries with Chris and co.     Classes have ended, I'm finished for today. Feels like I've waited, half my life away. A morning game of pool, with Darren at the Guild. Gonna head back soon, for lunch until I'm filled. If you too have ended, my room is where I'll stay. Don't be irritated, while I SMS you away.    This was one of the days in a week where I end early. Usually I'd meet Darren Lim and we'd go for a few rounds of pool at the students' Guild house. But after that I felt really bored. I was practically warning my kakis that while they were in lessons, they should be prepared for me to bug them via SMS hehe :P     Sun's up, time to wake up. Do situps and pushups, time to get up. To toilet and washup, no excuse to be held up. I'm gonna washup, soon as I finish my pressups.    It was definitely a weekend. I tend to keep a personal regime going even then. But I think I was bored. I seem to recall this particular SMS was sent to my ex.     It's a time for laughter and cheer, Time to cast away your fears. 'Ang Bao's are a little this year, But try hard not to shed a tear. That really isn't too queer, Coz our home isn't very near. If family, relatives and friends are here, They'll wish you a "Happy Chinese New Year". I too, wish you, my friends dear, To enjoy this Chinese New Year.    Obviously it was Chinese New Year. I think we all felt a bit lonely being away from home over this festive season. I know that I was. I kinda SMSed this out to everyone after a period of not SMSing them.
