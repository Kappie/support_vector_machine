God...   to all the people who don't already know: Cam's dad's all excited about a potential job offer that would relocate his family to Texas... They were originally going to know today whether he got it or not, but the date's been moved to Friday. His mind seems to be made up: he gets the position and they're moving. It'll prolly take like two months to get ready and stuff, but then again there's no guarantee that they'll even be here for Thanksgiving.  holy crap, this is going to suck...
