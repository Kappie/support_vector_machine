Quote of the Week   Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much.  Oscar Wilde   A Good Woman  Well I'm sure that caught 50% of my readers attention.   I have noticed and read with increasing interest, the letters to the New Zealand Herald editor written by Amanda McGrail. She has some very good things to say. I have already quoted her on my blog. Check this letter out:-   Alexis Stuart's call to dissolve the Ministry of Women's Affairs is right on the money. What makes a few women in Wellington think it is their noble task to define womanhood for the rest of us?   That's exactly what they are tring to do, lest too many women make the "wrong" choice - like being a mother, for instance; or even worse, being a wife.  They want me to choose power, but I'd prefer love any day, and I suspect most honest women feel the same. Bring on the privatisation of female identity I say. Ruth Dyson can keep her "economic autonomy" and her emotional wilderness all to herself.
