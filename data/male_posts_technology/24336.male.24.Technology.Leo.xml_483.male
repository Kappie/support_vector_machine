I cut myself twice, once on a bagel when I was in a  hurry and once when chopping up peppers and I wasn't paying attention.  The pepper cut, which is on my left thumb, was so deep that I probably needed stitches.  I'm a dumb boy, so I just put a butterfly bandage on to seal it up.  When working out at the beginning of spring break last week, I was walking on my hands (a relic from my pre-wrestling work outs) and stretched out my ACL in my right knee when I landed.  Being a dumb boy, I played racquetball with Joe later that evening.  I was attempting a spinning return when I realized there was no way I could land and put that much pressure on my right knee.  I stopped midway but my racquet kept going.  I smashed myself in the left eye.  I should have taken pictures right when it happened, but here are a couple pictures from over a week after it happened:   Normal coloration   Photoshopped coloration to show bruise beneath the eye
