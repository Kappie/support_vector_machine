Anger Management, Meet The Parents, Matrix  the movie draws from all of these  foren  films. The movie is basically a comedy masala movie. ( lots of oomph ! like the  kanta laga  girl playing the role of  Bijli  and doing an item number) .  David Dhawan is banking on making money by attracting  desi  audiences by showing some  maal . Having  Baywatch  attire through out the movie. (Though I give credit to the movie for having a great collection of songs).  I spent half the time waiting the movie to finish.  Sallu baba and Akshay kumar spend most the time showing off their muscles. And for a change Akshay kumar is the saving grace ! The guy did a good role in Khakhi too, I guess he gives a good performance whenever he is cast in a multi starrer, so for the want of competition he ends up raising the level of his show.  I should say this as a final verdict, like my friend Makkhi says : "Dimag mat lagao !". A thing easily said but tough to do, when u have nothing else for 3 hours to do.  PS : Those new to Bglore from Delhi, the theatre was NAGA in Ulsoor. I suggest dont go for the front row, its out right discrimination they have actually put chains between the front stall and others so you have to come out of the hall to goto refreshments ! Besides the chairs in front stall are hard wood ! Talk about difference between a 30rs. ticket and a 50rs. one.
