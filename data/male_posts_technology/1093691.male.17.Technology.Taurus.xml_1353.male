I'll talk to Lora, see how she is getting there. If I do come obviously I'll be late.  Have a nice weekend dudes, when on study leave those of us who usually go down park - maybe we should do that again? Sit under the tree, do sod all all day, be childish on slide. Lol. And whoever else wants to come should come!
