A friend who was troubled and weary he knew, Who'd be glad of a lift and who needed it, too, On him he would call to see what he could do... tomorrow.  Each morning he'd stack up the letters he'd write... tomorrow. And he thought of the friends he would fill with delight... tomorrow. It was too bad indeed; he was busy each day, And hadn't a minute to stop on his way; 'More time I'll give to others,' he'd say... 'tomorrow.'  The greatest of workers this man would have been... tomorrow. The world would have known him, had he ever seen... tomorrow. But the fact is he died, and faded from view, And all that he left here when living was through Was a mountain of things he intended to do... tomorrow.
