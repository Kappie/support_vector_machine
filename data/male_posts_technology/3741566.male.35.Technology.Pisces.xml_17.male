I realize now that it is going to turn into something much more than that. It is teaching me to write, while at the same time, it is also tuning into a history of sorts. Not just a history of my past events, but a history of thoughts and emotions. I figure that I should expand upon this and start including much more controversial topics. Our current president seems a worthwhile subject.  Let’s first catch you up on my political views. Dea (biological mother) was a die hard liberal, which isn’t surprising because her parents were polar opposites politically. Growing up, I got both sides of every political argument. National security, foreign policy, social welfare, social morality, fiscal responsibility, and states rights were all talked about openly around me at one point or another. One would think that this talk would influence me in some way, but it didn’t. My political views actually were formed from observation and careful thought.   Growing up, Dea was constantly on the move. When I wasn’t being shipped off to Ma’s (grandmother) house every summer, I was in a different location geographically. Dea moved from NY to Florida, then up to Georgia all in the first 12 years of my life. I never lived in one house from more than two years and never was in the same school for more than a year. I’ll go into the complete ramifications of moving around so much at a young age some other time. The point here is that I got to meet an enormous variety of people at a very early age. I went to an almost entirely black elementary school when we first moved to Atlanta and that experience was the defining period in my life that would shape my political and social views for the future.  It was at this school that I first learned of racial hatred. I was the ripe age of eight at the time and was trying to form new friendships in another new school and was confused by the anger and hostility that I met. To a young child, a kid is a kid. The color of the child or their economic standing never crosses your mind when you are that young. Although my grandparents were the most influential people in my life, they lived in white neighborhoods and their bigotry was never obvious to me at that time. There just wasn’t enough talk around the kitchen table of other cultures for me to pick up on their ethnocentric beliefs. It was during this first year in Atlanta that I began to understand that the other children didn’t like me because I was of a different color than they were. Because this was such a confusing concept to me, I spent nearly every waking hour trying to understand why. I remember sitting up at night crying because I had been chased home again by the kids at school. They made, either beating me up, or chasing me to beat me up, a daily event on their calendars and to a boy of eight it was as traumatic an experience that can happen.   Looking back at it now, the oddest thing about it all was my reaction to it. I didn’t hate them for it. The more hate they vented at me the more I tried to make them like me. I became obsessed with trying to make them see me as something other than the little white kid in an all black neighborhood. I eventually befriended a family on my block, and although I still was chased and sometimes caught from time to time, the amount of terror in my life certainly slackened. It was during this time that I had the chance to spend a lot of time around that family. Their lives were, for the most part, very similar to my family. The thing that made us similar was that fact that we were poor. We both struggled to make ends meet and luxuries of the wealthy were completely absent. Had I been from even a middle income family, the friendships I made would have been completely impossible. What I learned from all of this was an understanding of society in America that I think surpasses what any wealthy family can understand. I learned that everyone on earth is more alike than society will ever give us credit for.   No I am not one of those fanciful idiots that sprout the garbage that “we are all of the same genetic makeup.” We aren’t. There is actually a surprising amount of physical difference between the races and there is even a bigger gap between cultures that is hard to overcome. The point that I learned as a child is that when put into similar circumstances, we all act very similarly. We all have the same kinds of thought patterns. We all self-talk and feed on negativity around us and we all have the same difficulty overcoming it.   I was only in that neighborhood for a year, and I wasn’t confronted with that much ethnic diversity again until I joined the army nine years later. I lived in mostly white lower class neighborhoods after that. It was then that I started picking up the racial bigotry around me. I heard adults sprouting nonsense blanket statements about other ethic groups that could just as easily apply to any impoverished group of people. My first political lesson in life was that bigotry and hate were ideals that I didn’t share. Once you can identify hate it becomes all to clear to see in every day life.  It was shortly after that I learned that my grandparents were part of that racial hatred. It was also during that time, that I learned that Dea was the polar opposite. She accepted and embraced different cultures and races. She certainly wasn’t devoid of hate, but to her credit, it wasn’t directed in that direction.   This all brings me around to where I stand today in the political arena. I am a liberal. Notice I didn’t say a democrat. What do I mean by liberal?  1. I believe that all people were created equal. We all are capable of love and we are all capable of hate. Judging a certain religious group, racial group, cultural group, sexual orientation group or any other group of people, by their belief systems is pointless. I don’t agree with most world religions’ philosophy. I don’t agree with a lot of cultural philosophy. I don’t live my life as a gay man. I don’t live my life as an Asian-American or African-American male. None of this means that I hate and none of that means that any other group of people is inferior to me because I don’t agree with them. It simply means that they have come to different conclusions about life than I have, or in the case of being a different race, they have lived in a social climate different than I have. This brings me to point number two. 2. I believe that victimless crimes do not exist. Period. I have never been given an argument that disproves this statement. If no harm is done to another person, it cannot be a crime. Hurting yourself is a victimless crime since you cannot be two opposite things at the same time, the perpetrator and the victim. This isn’t saying I don’t understand regulation, such as posted speed limits. Laws to prevent high risk behaviors are understandable, but only when the connection of the crime and the risk are well documented and understood. A good example of this is drunk driving. The risk of the person creating harm to others is too great to ignore. However, I fail to see a crime in not wearing a seatbelt after you are a consenting adult. Yes there is a risk that you MIGHT get into an accident and that your injuries MIGHT be larger due to not wearing a seatbelt and those injuries MIGHT cost more money to repair and that MIGHT raise insurance rates for others causing a victim, but that chain of thinking is dubious at best. Since not wearing a seatbelt isn’t going to alter your ability to drive a car responsibly and since that the likelihood of you dying in an accident is so much larger than if you were wearing a seatbelt (thus actually reducing the cost to treat you in the hospital – you don’t spend a ton of money on a dead guy and you might be able to use their organs), there is no reasonable expectation of a victim other than the person foolhardy enough to decide not to wear one.   3. Make love, not war. The easiest emotion to conjure up is hate and rage. There are going to be times when the only recourse for the defense of this country and the defense of our like-minded allies is military action, but these times are far and in-between. Most conflicts can and usually are resolved by calm rational thinking and time. The people that make war are never the people that actually have to fight in the war and are also generally not the people whose family has to fight in the war. Wars are fought by the poor. The rich and middle class enter service as officers while the poor are the grunts. Is this true in every case? Of course not! It does apply as a whole however. It is far too easy to send others off to die when the risk to yourself is negligible. Maybe we should demand that any president that makes war has a son or daughter that must go to that war and serve in the front lines. I guarantee that a president would try a lot more diplomacy given the prospect of losing a loved one.   4. I believe in equal rights for all people. I do mean equal rights. I believe that we should redo the court system to give equal rights to the poor. I believe that gay couple should have the same rights as straight. I believe that women should have equal rights as men and vice versa. I believe that no religious doctrine should hold sway in government in any way. We have the right to believe or not to believe anything we choose and we have the right to not be forcibly recruited. This means removing the word God from government altogether. You might ask me if I believe in a God and the answer would be, yes, I certainly do. If we are going to claim to be a free country then we have to be free in every way, not just the way that the majority seems fit. While I do believe that democracy is the best way to achieve freedom, I don’t believe that our current structure of democracy provides us that. We ignore the concept of individual rights too often in favor of the concept of majority rule. Just because the majority of a population believes in something, it doesn’t make that belief any more credible. The majority used to believe that women were not equal to men. Did this make it so? Was the refusal to grant equal rights any more sound just because the majority of people believed it to be? I believe that stronger language in the bill of rights is needed to protect us from the majority and create a truly free America. The people of today that strongly oppose that idea are the people of today that are the majority. The funny thing is that we keep forgetting lessons learned from the past. Today’s majority is tomorrow’s minority. If we don’t protect all rights today, then what rights that you enjoy today as the majority might be taken away when you are the minority? The problem is that these swings usually take a generation to happen and that the present generation rarely could give a rat’s ass about the next generation so we keep making the same mistakes.  5. I believe in equal opportunity for all. This means equal opportunity for the rich versus the poor, the individual versus the corporation and the minority versus the majority. Right now, this country favors the rich. I’m not one of those people that favor labor versus corporations to the extent that it buries our international competitiveness, but I do favor a shift away from run away corporate conglomerates and profit margins while the average American doesn’t make enough to afford average housing in most urban areas without it being inherited from a family member. I don’t know all the answers, but now that I live on the other side of the fence, I can certainly see the problems. Give me a few years and I might even come up with the answers.   6. I believe in government fiscal responsibility. I’m not talking about balancing our national budget. I’m talking about scrapping the whole system to begin with and using common sense to start over. Where do our priorities as a country lie? Do we need to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on the wars (drug war and Iraq– twice)? Drop the budget in the garbage and start over using our heads. I want an education for my kids, and I want to grow old with security. Give me that and stop spending my money on senseless endeavors.   Here is where we come to the “Bush family recipe.” I use that tag line because he is our current president and it is easier for me to use him as an example of so many things that have gone wrong in America as well as so many things that have never been right. Without covering ever little thing that this president has done in office I’ll cover just two main points.  1. Let’s kill them all! The largest sign of hate from any individual is the willingness to physically harm others. The events of September eleventh are a perfect example of what happens when hate becomes what defines you as an individual or group. I don’t hate Osama Bin Laden. I understand why he and his organization feels so strongly about the intrusion of the west on their way of life and I understand the negative self talk that must be going on to produce and sustain this type of cycle of self destruction. The idea that violence is the only solution to a cultural problem is so obviously foolish. It is much easier to kill then it is to take the time to find other solutions. If I kill the person in front of me that I feel has wronged me or my culture, it is instant gratification, but actually does nothing to solve the underlying problem. Killing Americans or Jews or anyone isn’t going to educate them on your point of view. It is only going to steel their heart towards you and create hate. In turn, they learn nothing of you or your culture and in turn either want to kill you or simply continue with whatever it was that created the anger in the first place. It is a never ending cycle. Changing behaviors of individuals or country’s takes time, patience, and understanding. Because there is no instant gratification, it takes an intelligent person to see the forest through the trees.   George Bush’s answer to terrorism is just as foolish as Osama’s. The simple headed solution was to give America that instant gratification of the kill which is absolutely the exact same reason the terrorists attacked to begin with. Can we not learn from mistakes? I’m not saying we shouldn’t have gone to Afghanistan. We needed to protect ourselves from an obvious threat. If a bully has hit you in the nose, you do need to make sure he doesn’t do it again. The mistake Bush made was what he did after that and what he has said throughout the process. Any person even vaguely aware of the concepts of conflict resolution knows that you do NOT antagonize the other party. Don’t use generic blame statements and do not go into a discussion with the idea that you are right and they are wrong. Stick to the topic at hand. The topic was that randomly killing Americans wasn’t going to bring about the solution to the problem they were having. Telling them that their culture is wrong, that they are “bad” because they believe a certain way isn’t going to do anything other than create more conflict. While we were there, we should have gone through hell and high water to better understand what it is that they want from us. I don’t mean the simple answers of stop giving Israel money and arms, but a more basic dialog about what we can do better to stop screwing up in their eyes. Our government has always had this idea that their notions of policy are the only way to go about things and it gets in the way of true dialog with other countries. We should have been listening to the Middle East to see what we can do the change their notions about us as a country. Simply throwing money at other governments to buy loyalty doesn’t work because that money and support seldom reaches the people.   The only way to stop terrorism is to figure out why it is that they are angry with us to begin with. After that, we have to take real steps to change our behavior so that, while still able to accomplish our own goals, we stop the cycle of hate that sprouts and breeds terrorism to begin with. Who cares whose national ideals are right and wrong? Our goal is to protect American lives. Killing and hate has proven to never work on either side of the fence.   So instead of rooting out the terrorists and then educating ourselves so we can find a real long term solution to the problem, we play the role of international police and invade another Middle Eastern country. Saying “we didn’t find any weapons of mass destruction” so Mr. Bush was wrong for going to war, is so nuts that I often find myself shaking my head in disgust . The reasons for not invading Iraq were plain for the entire world to see. The only people that seemed to miss it were Americans. Let’s use common sense to debunk all the reasons given by Mr. Bush for going to war.  Reason One: “They are developing weapons of mass destruction and have shown the propensity to use them.”   Debunk: So what? North Korea HAS these weapons and actually said it would use them and you didn’t see Americans running off to invade them. The simple truth is that we knew Iraq was an east target. You don’t bully the guy with the real gun, you bully the guy that you know is full of hot air. The rest of the world saw right through this statement and knew we were full of it. Common sense was all that was needed to see the lie. Iran was also suspected of developing WMD and we weren’t asking to invade them. As a matter, of fact it was much more likely that they were further along than Iraq. They didn’t have international monitors and they didn’t have the United States bomb the entire country ten years earlier. They also have an “Evil” ( Reason Two: “ Saddam Hussein is a murderer and kills his own people. We have a humanitarian responsibility to stop him.”  Debunk: Ok that is a given. The guy was horrible. The problem is that he is not the only horrible dictator out there that kills his own people. Why did we all of a sudden care about this guy while we ignored, North Korea, China, about ten African countries, Syria, Iran, Cuba, and Haiti? Some of those countries would actually be far easier to take over than Iraq and some have far worse human rights violations than Iraq. In fact, Iraq in recent years, had come a long way in regards to human rights. The world again saw through this with common sense and again drew its own conclusions as to why Bush wanted to invade. I don’t know the real reasons he did, but I know that the reasons given were false.  The other reasons given were even more ludicrous than those two. There was the notion that Iraq was aiding terrorism even though our own allies and intelligence was telling us that wasn’t the case.   I do know the outcome of the “let’s kill them all” thought process incorporated by Bush. We have lost over 1000 Americans with no end in site, we have destabilized a country and driven up oil costs, we have alienated all of our Middle Eastern allies, and we have created more hate within the region than previously existed. It doesn’t take a research poll to figure out that we just handed Osama his next batch of terrorists to fight us with. Rational thought and common sense seems to have abandoned this president and many of those before him.  2. The second sign of hate from this president is his disregard and outright distain for those in his country. One easy way to spot a bigot in general is to look for other dogmas and self righteous behaviors from those same individuals. Believing that you are “right” and the others are “wrong” is the first clue to snooping out a hateful person. Those that think along these terms are more likely to also believe that because that they are “right” and you are “wrong” that they have the right to regulate your wrongness. They also are much more likely to believe that because they are in the right and you are in the wrong, they are “good” and you are “bad”. Labeling people is the second major clue of people that are prone to be bigoted, hateful, and self righteous.   Listen to our current president and judge for yourself. Those “evil wrong doers” need to be punished!. Since he is right and the world is wrong, he has a need to show the world and make the world see things his way.  He has shown distain and contempt for anyone not believing in his Christian God. You should say the prayer in school to his god. You should recite “in God we trust” in school. You should believe the same morals he does. You should not be gay because the bible says it’s wrong. The list goes on and on.   If I were an American minority, I would fear this man. I can see through to the hate when I watch him on television and I can see the hate in his speeches and in his actions. I don’t want to know this man’s secrets. I don’t want to know the hate he shares with his closest family and friends.    Note that in all of my writings I stay away from labels of right and wrong. I don’t label Bush as wrong. I think he is misguided and I think he makes poor choices in his life. Disagreeing with someone’s point of view or actions is far from calling them wrong and trumpeting you as right. As with anything I write and say pointing out things I believe to be mistakes, the point is to show that there might be other ways of doing or saying something that would have better results. The point isn’t that its “bad” that we make mistakes, the point is to show that we don’t have to keep making them.    The sad truth is this kind of hate isn’t what Jesus taught. It isn’t what Mohammed taught. It isn’t what the Buddha taught. It isn’t what all the great prophets taught. I hope that someday we’ll have a President that understands the concept of common sense and rational living. The Bush family recipe isn’t working and I fear that the damage to America the he has caused and which other presidents started might be too great to undue for future presidents. The idea of America was such a noble one but the idea that the development of democracy and freedom was accomplished with our current constitution is foolish. The founders understood this and drafted changes to the constitution to better define the idea of indelible rights as a human, which is why the bill of rights was added. We cannot rest on our laurels and believe that the task of creating a utopian democracy is finished.   Just like individuals, the government should challenge every belief that it has and always have an open mind to change. Just because you have always believed something doesn’t make it correct and just because something works, doesn’t mean it can’t work far better doing it differently.   AJ
