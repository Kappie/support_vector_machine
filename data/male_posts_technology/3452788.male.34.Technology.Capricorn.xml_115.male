       
      I'll live, don't worry.  The depression is talking to me, the many voices in my head.  Maybe I need a higher dosage, maybe I need a new therapist, maybe I need a break from therapy.  I know I always feel worse before I feel better, after a session.  Often the discussions in therapy send me on a  dark spiral that I eventually get over, but not without some trying times first.  Bye for now.
