I feel tired and permanently hung-over, I need a trip to a health farm.. a few weeks of oil massages by young Swedish ladies and some quiet swimming in mountain lakes would go down really well right now.  It's the same old crap that everyone says coming around to New Year, but I intend to do it come 2003.  I am actually going to use that gym membership I got in November and have only been once. I am going to learn the art of moderation and alcohol. I am going to take my Cisco exam and pass it. I will stop being a slapper.  Ok, maybe not the last one.. but you get my drift.  That's why; last year was the summer of love.. and 2003 will be even better. But I propose that 2003 be about quality over quantity. Simple pleasures. Sacrificing ten pints of lager for one bottle of Laurent Perrier. Aborting four nights of mediocrity in Follies for an all night beach party on midsummer’s day. Not getting off with fifteen assorted gold digger slappers from Zebra, in exchange for some top quality lady time...  Can I get a witness ?
