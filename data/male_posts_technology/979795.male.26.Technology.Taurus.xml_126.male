So you do it again -- again trying to make the ideal movement. You fail again. In Aikido, we want to make the most beautiful technique, and we fail. Still, the purpose is to make the most perfect technique. That's what we have to remember but we forget it very easily."  "There was a painter named Hans Menling who never signed his paintings. He just wrote, 'It's my best.' I attended a Jesuit College, and every day we had to write 'It's my best' in our notebooks. I think that Aikido is the same: you try to do your best -- not the best, of course, but your best."   -- Christian Tisser, 7th dan, Shihan
