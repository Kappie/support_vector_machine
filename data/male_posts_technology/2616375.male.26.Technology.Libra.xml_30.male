Today morning i am still not one... the squeaky check ride instructor of Flight Simulator 2004 isn't convinced about my flying capabilities and keeps telling me that my rollout was too early or my airspeed was too high/low, altitude too high/low and the list goes on.. gave up after trying n times for the same.. i guess i keep improving each time i fail the checkride..  anybody got a suggestion? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.
