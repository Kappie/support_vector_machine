Don't get me wrong, the sun is always welcome in my book, but in Texas, the allergies and humidity get awful, and the rain has a way of washing that away, if only for a short time.  Now is the part where I am supposed to explain how that is analogy for life, and how we all need a little rain in our sunny existence, but I have no intention of typing that redundant BS.  anyway...... The internet is so SLOW at work today.  Maybe "they" put a tracking tool on my account and every web page I surf to is being scrutinized by upper management....
