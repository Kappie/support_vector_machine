Even though we had no reason to be particularly nervous, it's very nice to hear that everything is ok from a medical professional.  Basically my role in this process was to walk to the doctors office and wait in the waiting room. (If you are an OB/GYN, it would be nice for those of us who have to wait, if you could throw a copy of  Esquire  or even  Newsweek  in the lobby.  Martha Stewart Living  and  Performing Your Own Breast Exam  don't really hold my attention.)
