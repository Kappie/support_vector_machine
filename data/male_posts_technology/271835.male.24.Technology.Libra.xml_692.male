As the waste from the mines came out the reefs got bigger. Eventually the town was abandoned in 1974 due to the mines being exhausted.  Next New Links trip? If we win the lottery maybe. After our fondness for urban, industrial archaeology demonstrated by our trip to the Byker Cully ( urlLink here  - maybe we should have done the pictures in BW for that arty vibe!) and Victoria Tunnel (still lost in Bungers' mind) this one is a natural.   via  urlLink Boing Boing .
