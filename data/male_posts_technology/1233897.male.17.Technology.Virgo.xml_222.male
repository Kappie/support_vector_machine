What’s happening now is that there’s a very high possibility that I’m going to be switching schools within the coming weeks. I can’t function at mine right now; it’s becoming more and more apparent the more research we do, that I’ve got a rather severe form of ADD that’s really effecting my ability to learn at Faith. I’m really saddened by the prospect because I’ve got some wonderful friends there, and not to say that I’ll be losing those friends automatically when I leave, it’s just going to be a huge amount harder… There is one bright side to all this though… the school that I might be transferring to is Beaverton High, Steven’s school.
