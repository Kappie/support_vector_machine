Haven't been up to a hell of alot latley, just chillin after school, and working here and there, so not too much.  Corey now has a 64-bit Linux system up and running on his new Motherboard *drool*, so nice! *jealous*, wish I could get that, but im very happy with my PowerMac G4 :D.  Well, gotta get to sleep, have a quiz tomorrow :P  Post Later.  Eric
