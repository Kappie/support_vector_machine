Dr said my eye was healing and I can reduce the medication to 2x a day now for the next 2 wks. My next appointment will be in Feb 04. Heh think he'll be discussing my options of wearing contacts and some kinda of counselling on how to maintain my contacts. Haiz ... troublesome but no choice. Forgot to remind Sensei he should change his contacts more often instead of wearing it for over the stipulated period, otherwise liek me like that, damn troublesome. Dad was nagging me to lay off contacts for 1 yr. See how lah, will try to not wear them for as long as I can, hopefully more than a year.  Following  urlLink your  post, I didn't think that Daniel was ultra weird or anything when I saw him today. I suspect he might've mellowed down a bit since last week. One good thing tho, despite having experienced 'unpleasantness' he's still willing to come back and continue training. Of course lah, it could be because he feels that he had already paid for 3 mths liao, or he came back expecting some kinda public apology ......... Anyway, today's Aikido at BB East was quite fun. Dunno why either, just found it really nice.  Just checked my email and found that the Half Marathon results have been  urlLink posted  online already. I should receive my cert by the 15th. The site is quite cool coz besides posting the results online, it also has a link which does some kinda analysis of the runners' performance.  Summary: I finished 498th out of 1409 participants. Finishing time is 2hr 21min 16sec. Net running time is 2hr 18min 54sec. (Like I said in my earlier post, it took me about 2min+ to get past the starting pt.) Placing in the entire field was 612th with 1270 entrants behind. About 32% of entrants ahead. Placing among the Males was 497th with 911 entrants behind. About 35% of entrants ahead. Placing in category was 368th place with 662 entrants behind. About 36% of entrants ahead.  Split Times (whatever this means??): 10min 36sec per mile or 6min 35sec per km Speed: 5.7 miles per hr or 9.1km per km  I must say I'm feeling really proud of myself at how much I've improved sicne the AHM. At least now I've got a benchmark to train myself. Yesterday, just asked my friend to help me get a form for the NUS biathlon in Feb 2004. Not sure if I'll signup for it yet though.
