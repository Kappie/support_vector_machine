For those of you who don't know your dog breeds, a Maltese is a little white furball that fully grown, you could still carry in one hand. Needless to say, Dru was considerably smaller. Unfortunately, this was Dru's first time in my establishment.  My left hand looks like I stuck it in a blender.  Dru became an unholy whirlwind of claws and teeth. Ouch.  I must love animals. I didn't strangle her or anything...
