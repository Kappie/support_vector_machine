Really, it's not a problem though.  I know that it's my lifeblood right now, but you can't fear these things.  The economy changes.  The country evolves.  It's happened before, and these forces will continue to erode this industry until it's completely left us for India and China.
 
 Sure, you can fight it.  You can try to unionize and fight for your jobs to stay here in the US.  It's worked for steel workers, right?  Well, it depends on what you call working I suppose.  Personally, I don't want to constantly come to work distrusting my management.  I don't want to worry every day that they will find some loop hole that will allow them to eliminate my job in favor of five off shore workers.  That's just not a peaceful work environment in my mind.
 
 So what choice do Americans in this situation have?  One, you can become your own boss and start a company where you won't worry about shipping jobs out of the country.  But how are you going to compete against those companies that  are  willing?  You can't.
 
 Or, you can try to fight for what jobs are out there.  That doesn't sound too fun, either.  Can you imagine the pressure there will be for you to perform.  There are literally thousands of people out there who can do your job as well or better than you.  Your team will constantly be understaffed and you're going to have to interface with off-shore resources on a daily basis.  Again, this doesn't sound too pleasant.
 
 Option three, my option, is to reinvent yourself.  You have to accept the fact that these things are going to happen.  Look forward to the future.  Predict.  Plan strategically.  Where will the industry be in five, ten, fifteen years?  What are you skills?  What skills do you need to be a part of the picture down the road?  What other industries seem to be on the rise?   Don't be afraid of change; it's going to happen.  There's very little you can control in this life.  Work on those things, and when it comes to whole industries, just make sure you have the right surf board to carry you to where you want to be.
