So, you call their support center for help with your retractable "cup-holder", and you get a guy on the line named Vishwanatha from Hyderabad India, who can't spell DELL, much less help you with your CD-ROM.  He costs 10 dollars a day and saves Dell or GE, or any large company the costs of benefits, wages, and even time.  Working in IT, I know the real facts about outsourcing and its successes.  First and foremost; success and outsourcing can't be used in the same sentence, perhaps not even in the same paragraph.  Most insourced people calling into my datacenter have admitted to rather having their problem sit and rot in hell, then have to call India for help.  CEO's, Six Sigma number crunchers, and middle uselessness(I mean management) all see the bottom line, $$$$$$$'s.  They don't see the fact that for every 10 calls to the outsourced helpdesk, 6 callers probably wish they hadn't.  Their problem wasn't solved, their language wasn't understood, and their needs simply weren't met.  Management actually believes that money is being saved, but time is money.  Every minute a customer spends calling our datacenter for problems, which is solved in a few moments; some other poor soul is spending upwards at around 10 minutes with some "boob" in India for a similar problem. But....nobody wants to see the hard facts, because management is lining their pockets with raises and bonuses everytime they save a few bucks cutting an American job.  Everytime a little bit of money is spent, our managers cringe as if the money were coming out of their very own pockets.  Why don't these guys grow a "pair" and tell their bosses that it takes money to save money.  Just the other day, we hired a new intern, and part of a new hire process is taking the guy out to lunch or dinner.  We decided to make a team affair out of it and order a few pizzas for everyone.  The bill ended up being $47.  We were bent over and spanked for this(not literally), and reminded that we are cutting costs.  Now, how many situations can you feed 16 people,and the bill be under $50? These people are ridiculous!!! Other the other hand, these same tightwads will ship 8 Indians over here, and treat them all to a Red's Game with seating behind home plate mind you, and a nice dinner, and allow them to have full expenses paid dining and lodging the whole time here.  It's 7am, and I'm already up and ready to kick some arse... GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!   more to come on that subject.
