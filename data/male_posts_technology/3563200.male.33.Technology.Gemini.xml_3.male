It's a great view into the psychology of a traffic officer and has some great tips on handling the inevitable violation. Probably the most valuable piece of information: most people actually talk themselves 'into' a ticket and that getting a ticket can be handled in such a way that your attorney can more easily make it 'not stick'. But you have to play your cards right from the instant you see the blue-light in your rear-view mirror until you drive away. Get the book. You'll see what I mean.
