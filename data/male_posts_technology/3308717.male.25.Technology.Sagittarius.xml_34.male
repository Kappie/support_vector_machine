While I applaud you for re-introducing today's youth to the revolutionary ideas and game concepts I cannot help but see this as nothing more than a way to rake in some fast cash by whoring out poor Link and Mario, two of your greatest champions. I certainly hope I am wrong in this, believe me, I do.      urlLink Link to IGN   Anyhoo, that is about how a letter from me to  urlLink Nintendo  would go. As you can tell, I have sorta mixed feelings on the whole situation. On one hand I am glad to see the classics getting out there on a newer system that today's children will possibly buy and find as much entertainment in as we did back in our youth. On the other hand, releasing each one sepperately for $20 each seems like more of a way to bring in extra cash. I think I would have been a little more happy about this had there been, I don't know, 3 or so games on one cart.  I read a  urlLink review  which covers Super Mario Brothers and The Legend of Zelda. The reviewer lost some credibility when he mentioned "The game has been given the same treatment as Super Mario Bros., with a gray cartridge and all". Now, I would like you to take a look at the last part of that sentence. The reviewer mentions earlier in his review that the SMB cart matched the old NES game, however the Zelda game was, in-fact, gold. They possibly did come out later with a grey one, but I have yet to see one.  I digress as I jst wanted to point out that the "new" classic NES games you may or may not choose to purchase are, in fact, out there for consumption. I MAY break down and buy one or two. If I do it will be Legend of Zelda for sure, and if I find out that there is a Kid Icarus coming I will definately have to purchase that one.  The thing is, however, I do still have a working NES attached to my living room television. I also still have Kid Icarus, Zelda (I  II), SMB 1,2, and 3 and just about any other classic NES game anyone would ever want to play (including Gauntlet, "Blue elf needs food badly").  Well, that about summs things up for the time being.    -intX    Justin Bailey
