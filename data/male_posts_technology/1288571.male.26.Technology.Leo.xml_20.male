I mean really..his friggin PC can encode crap at faster than real time! @_@ I need a PC like that. Anyways, I haven't met anyone who knows more about this stuff than he does though. Currently waiting for him to finish up editing a version of Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers into Divx. The man is all about quality so its safe to assume he won't be happy until its perfect.  /me does a Monty Burns   Exxxxxxxxxxxxxcellent!
