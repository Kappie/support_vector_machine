I have to say it is surprisingly good. It's about a girl who gets visted by God and asked to do things. The whole show is based on the fact she never sees the bigger consequences of her actions, she still thinks all she is doing is these pointless tasks that mean nothing but indirectly they are making huge differences.  Anyway, work is going well again. It's a hard slog but I am getting things together and making huge steps forward. About to do a huge sales push to so hopefully things will be getting really busy soon..  Ah I dunno, I don't really have anything to say, I'm really just typing for the hell of it. Lets see how I feel once I've had a night off.
