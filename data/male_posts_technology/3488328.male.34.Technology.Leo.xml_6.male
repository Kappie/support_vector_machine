I did first a Live Upgrade, but then recalled that I wanted to change partitioning anyway and just went for fresh installation.  Build 58 supposed to support Opteron. At least it recognized Tyan S2885' on-board Gigabit Ethernet out of the box. Still no SATA support. Presumably it should come with Build 61 - which probably means August time frame.
