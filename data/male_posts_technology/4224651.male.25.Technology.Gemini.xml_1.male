The yard looked like it hadn't been mowed this century, the brown paint was flaking and peeling off of the front of the house. There was a maroon-colored car parked in the driveway (had to be a Datsun) and one next to it camping out on the grass (probably another Datsun). All around me I saw what to me looked like junk. A couch, an old bookcase, a rusty table with four equally rusty chairs, picture frames, a lava lamp (if you can believe that). There was some old pottery pieces that looked as if they had to be from the early 1900s. But in the end, it was the silver candlesticks that caught Mom's eyes. Not too much longer after we had gotten there, my mother spotted two identical candlesticks. Very antique. She was in to that kind of stuff. She liked the whole old-fashioned, rustic look about certain things. She was in the middle of a very intense examination of said candlesticks when the old woman walked over.  "You like them?" she asked. My mother was a bit easy to startle so the question made her jump a little. The old lady was short and walked with a cane. Her shoes looked like the kind you wear when you're in a hospital and her dress resembled those smocks you used to wear in 5th grade art class. Those smocks sucked. I hated those friggen things.  "They're beautiful," Mom replied. "Are they old?" "Let's just say I got them when I was about your age." She spoke very slowly, almost with a natural stutter, but one could tell it was because of her age. She didn't wear any glasses which I thought was weird because I just assumed that all old people wore glasses to help them see. All I can remember thinking is maybe this old bag had some kind of Superman eyesight. My father and I poked around at some other junk. Dad was basically trying to appear as if he was really looking around for something while I was busy trying to find out if there were any G.I. Joe's in this pile of garbage.  "There's no price on them, are they free?" Mom laughed as she asked this. Always the packrat, trying to snag a freebie. The old lady, however, who seemed pleasant from the beginning, did not find this funny. "Oh, I must have missed those," the old lady said. She reached out slowly and took one of the candlesticks from my mother's hands and held it in her own. She stared at it for a few seconds as if waiting for the price to slap her in the face. But to my disappointment (and my father's), there was no magical force leaping at her face and slapping the old lady in the mug. Not on this day at least.  "Give me three dollars and you can take 'em," the lady said after a while. Mom reached into her purse and pulled out a five dollar bill and handed it to the old woman. Again, my mother attempted to make nice with the lady. "Take the whole five," my mother said with a smile, and the old lady, indifferent in response to this gesture, turned and slowly walked away. Perhaps toward wherever she was keeping the loot she made off this tag sale. Meanwhile, my mother turned with a what-did-I-do look on her face and motioned to my father to let him know "we're leaving now."  That was about all the time we spent at the old lady's tag sale. How odd, I thought, that she did not have an old man accompanying her at her home? In fact, I didn't see anyone there who looked like they were helping her sell her old junk. Maybe her husband passed away some time ago. The thought left my mind about as quickly as we made it to the interstate.  It was a long ride home on I-91 as I felt we had accomplished nothing (no G.I. Joe's, no video games), but my mother was happy with her candlesticks so I suppose one could say "mission accomplished." She had no idea how soon she'd be getting rid of them.
