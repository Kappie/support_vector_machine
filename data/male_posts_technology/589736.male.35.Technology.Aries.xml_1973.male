I only point to the vote counting since that is what the two rulings from the Supreme Court were about and the origin of the "Selected, not Elected" mantra that Jesse Jackson and others continue to throw out.  I read part of the Greg Palast link.  If that is part of what you are referring to, then I would have to ask about the military absentee ballots that were discarded because they did not have post marks?  While certainly not a monolithic block ,the majority of military votes got to the Republicans.  These soldiers were serving in Bosnia and Saudi Arabia and Korea, but their votes were discarded because of a technicality of the military postal system.  There is no fool proof system.  To assert that the incompetence / laziness of the company (IBT?) was deliberate a full 7 months in advance of the election assigns them the power of clairvoiance to know that the election was going to be decided by the extremely close margin it was.  There is also the assumption that all of the people that were scrubbed (terrible word IMO) would have a) voted and b) voted for Gore (and not Bush or any of the other 5 or 6 candidates).  I don't think you will find many people who live in the real world that think that the 2000 election nationwide, not just in Florida, was unflawed.  There was the judge in St. Louis who ordered the polls to remain open 3 or 4 hours longer in one area for a reason that I can't recall.  That area just happened to be a largely black area and one where the Democrats were going door to door to get people to go vote.  There was also the "math error" that led the networks to call Florida before the polls has closed.  It is impossible to know how many, if any, people in the panhandle, a largely Republican area, did not bother to vote because of this announcement.  Then there was the voter incompetence in Palm Beach(?) where the people did not know how to read the ballot.  The ballot they used there was the same type used in Chesterfield, and it was 100% clear to me.  It was a mess.  Back to a conversation from many months ago, I think many of the problems (election wise) would be solved if our participation in the process was increased. 50% for the presidential election is downright pathetic.  The reason I think it would be solved is that I think the Democrats would win handily as they have done a better job of selling class warfare (rich vs. poor) and convincing the "working class" that the government is the answer to everything when compared to the Republican belief that less governemnt is better.  The Democrats message sells better if you don't dig into it, so it would win.  Count me as one of the yays on the legitimacy of the election.  I have no idea on the commission.  Who was supposed to running it?
