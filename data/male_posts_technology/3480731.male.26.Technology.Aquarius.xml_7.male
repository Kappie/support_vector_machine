I know I set myself up for a lot of abuse over this, but I've been into it since the mid 80s and as most fans say I "have the fever". Iâ€™ve decided that one of the things I can do here is give my two cents on the current stories and shows. I know there are a lot more feds out there, but I grew up on WWE, so that is what I'm going to cover. For those of you of the non-wrestling persuasion, I'll be sure to have posts pertaining to wrestling have "WWE" at the start of them, so you can just bypass them. Fair deal? :)  Working on my first WWE Raw review right now, hopefully I'll have it up tonight...
