Always a funny guy, he loved baseball, and said his secret to long life was smoking cigars and drinking "good ones".  It's too bad really.  On a lighter note, it's time for me to move again, I can already feel the headache coming on, I hope that I don't have such a problem as last time, but I think it should be a little easier.  Getting hot here now too, gotta try and hit the beach this weekend!
