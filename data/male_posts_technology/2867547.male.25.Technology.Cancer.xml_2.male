He let me do the initial balls shattering and I was lucky to get a ball in. My next attempt was successful too. The third ball also fell neatly into the hole... The same thing happened to the 4th, 5th, 6th and the 7th.  Well, this is not the way I normally play and my friends were rather impressed too. I was somewhat growing more confident with each strike and the results were (excuse my word choice) striking.  Unfortunately it was impossible to get the black ball directly after the last ball, so it took me 3 more turns to set it up and put it in... So I guess there is a way to improve... As I expected the following games were far from this perfection. I managed to win the next 2 quite comfortably, but the magic was gone... The last game I lost quite unluckily, but still this was a memorable day :)
