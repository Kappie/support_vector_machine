I work in an industry that promotes personal debt and punishes for sick days.   Things Tim needs to do: 1) Expand my circle of friends. I need a support network in place for life's little tragedys. I have a good circle right now, I just need to diversify 2) Get out of personal debt. From now till my credit cards are paid off, I will buy no more video games, TVs, DVD players, sound systems. I will spend all my extra money trying to pay off my credit cards. I can go see 1 movie in the theater a week, but that is it. 3) give my old clothes to good will or another thrift shop. Time for some spring cleaning.  Question: Is it childish to love someone that doesn't love you back? Do you just delay the pain and/or prolong it?  Peace-
