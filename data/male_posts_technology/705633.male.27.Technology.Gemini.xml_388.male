Unless you’re a sadist or your in the army. 3) The reason why the intelligent (as you said) cat leaves you presents on your drive is because you kick them. Its not the other way round, you kick so they cack!  4) Kick a cat and they will get their own back. Some day. Some time. 5) Dogs do not protect a house, They protect their dinner ticket. Cats know that their owners will still feed them even if they get burgled. 6) Cats only stare evilly at a few people, Our very own Baity is one of them as Shreks cats give him the evil eyes between them.   7) Women prefer cats? And that’s a reason to hate them? Weird person, who doesn’t like to stroke pussy some time or another? 8)Dogs are like 5’4” Liverpudlians. They think they have to prove themselves. Cats will give you the finger even when your looking straight at them. Cats have intelligence and attitude, Dogs are stupid and rely on brute force. Although this is a generalisation of the species, I accept there are the odd individual that bucks these trends.
