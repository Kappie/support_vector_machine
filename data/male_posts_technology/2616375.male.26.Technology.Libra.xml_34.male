One of the MVP Leads comments about the question that people don't ask but always wonder: > I keep getting the feeling that something is expected of MVPs that we aren't being told about.  "You were awarded based on your contributions over the past year. You don't have to do anything at all as far as program expectations go. Of course, if you want to get awarded the following year, you'll need to continue to contribute at a high level. We do provide you with as many opportunities (beta programs, conferences, and so forth) as we can, but you don't have to take us up on any of them. The only expectations that I, as the MVP Lead, have is that you conduct yourself in a professional manner. If you start slamming Microsoft or other MVPs, we'll have a conversation. That almost never happens in my happy little world. :-)"  If you want to know who is this MVP Lead and you are an MVP yourself (if you are not then you can't access the private newsgroup), please refer to the private newsgroups, announcements_discussions and post of Bev Howard on 12 May. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.
