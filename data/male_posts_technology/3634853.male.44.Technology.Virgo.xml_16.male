It just doesn't seem that I can sustain an upward swing, but am working the numbers and doing some reading and studying and hopefully can keep my head above water until I get this figured out.  Monday 6/28        -$3.00 @ Planet PLHE table  Tuesday 6/29 PokerStars       -$11.00 SnG +$10.25 $1/$2 Limit HE -$.75 total  -$15 PLHE  PartyPoker       Day total  -$15.75   Wed. 6/30 Stars  - $11.00 SnG -$3  Multi  Planet  +$23.75  $1/$2 Limit      Day total  +$9.75   Thursday  7/1      Party -$3.75 PLHE  UB   -$11 SnG  Day total  -$14.75   Friday 7/2         Planet   $1/$2 Limit HE   +$15.25 UB       $10 SnG          +$28.00 Stars    $1/$2 Limit HE   +$13.25 Party     PLHE            -$3.85               Day total  +$52.65    Total +$28.90   -$21.60 for the 5 days projections -$36.44 for the years projections  Summary  I am becoming more and more patient but also looking for opportunities to open things up a bit in the Limit games.  I think it's working, but will hold off until I have a few more sessions results to evaluate.  Playing the PLHE tables is nice for the variey as it is a much different game than Limit and I seem to be doing ok there.    I will trying to play a few more SnG's at UB this month as they have what looks to be a very cool promotion where they are giving back 1/2 your SnG buyins in Bonus points.  It takes forever ot release them, but free is free!  This format is still being worked out and I hope it becomes cleaner, and more interesting as we go along.  I will probably being playing off and on over the long 4th of July weekend and hope to once again get on the plus side of my projections and start seeing some real progress.  Until next time......
