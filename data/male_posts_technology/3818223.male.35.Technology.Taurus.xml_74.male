If you're not familiar with this character, the books contain enough background information so you can start with any one in the series. Stephanie is a believably tough bounty hunter, more lucky than good, who usually manages to catch her man while dealing with a lot of angst about the men in her life and her slightly crazy but familiar family. Evanovich's writing is incredibly fast-paced, filled with snappy dialog and funny, kinetic storylines. Her books could use a little more description - the fast pace would probably survive a little added flesh.  - 4 out of 5 stars
