My Uncle C.H. called me at work asking for computer help, which is okay because I do work at a computer help desk, but I will be able to fix it when I go home this weekend for our pseudo Thanksgiving.  I am kind of bummed that Ann will not be able to come down.  She has a big exam and then the regional programming contest.   Okay, well, I am going to get some rest.  this first week of early mornign work is starting to get to me...my body will catch up soon...until then...
