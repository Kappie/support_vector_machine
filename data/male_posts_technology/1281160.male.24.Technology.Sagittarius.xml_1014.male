I got an answer... may be, its because of E.G.O.  after all, how can the man - the head of the family, the god of small and big things of his family - take up something as measly as cooking...   -----------------  sometimes I wonder, why I wonder… the more I wonder why I wonder, the more I wonder… I again wonder but this time I wonder not why I wonder… But how much I wonder why I wonder…
