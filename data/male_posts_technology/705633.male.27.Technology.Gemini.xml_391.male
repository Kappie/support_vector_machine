Sorry baity, I wouldnt follow you to minden place car park, let alone in your quest to be Dominah Buckweed of Jersey!  Anyway, I have to agree with the  urlLink wonderfull Andy , Im sure its "You bet I am the ass king.". The best thing youve typed in a while.  Brett... HA HA HA. Your Girlfriend wont put your meat in her mouth HA HA HA. Quorn? Baity is always saying how good it is Then again I prefer a good steak over a Courgette anyday..  The discussion Idea is cool, Can you keep it up for long? but maby thats for another week. Remember Danger, Snowballing is the way to the dark side, hmmm?
