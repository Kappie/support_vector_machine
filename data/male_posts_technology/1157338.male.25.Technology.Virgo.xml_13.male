Kinda neat, it lets you add to Blogger at any time by clicking a button on the toolbar while surfing, blocks popups (dont' have to install mozilla at work anymore) and lets you search google immediately (being the google toolbar of course. )  Neato  Maybe now I'll actually update this page a bit more frequently.
