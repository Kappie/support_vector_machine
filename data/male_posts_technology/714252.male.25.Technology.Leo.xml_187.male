I am blogging about something I have been argusing over in the Forum.. What people can\can't and should\shouldn't say on their blogs..  My main point in all the discusions has been that someones blog is their own to do with as they please.. They choose what they want to write with the full knowledge that it is on the internet.. Anyone can read it.. I once had a completely anonymous blog that no-one but my closest friends had the address to and I gave out no personal details that could trace who I was.. Now that I have this blog I use some discretion (It may not look like it but to me posts about my testicles and titie bars aren't a big wow..) because I know there are people reading who may get hurt by the things I have to say.. That's my choice.. I could also choose to say exactly how I feel about anything I wanted and fuck the consequences.. The key thing here is my freedom to choose.. I choose to be discreet and Nat decided not to be discreet.. He never hid the fact that he was being honest on his blog, he just decided no to tell certain people it was there..   Should  he have been a bit more discreet? Probably but as I said, he decided to say what he felt with no holds barred..  Did he do it for some sort of "Big Up" from the lads? He may have, I don't know and don't really care.. Again it is his choice to do something foolish..  Do  you  have the right to argue with him and tell him exactly what you think of him on his blog\the forum? Of course you do.. How would you feel if I told you that you  can't  say waht you wanted on his blog and started censoring you?  Anyway, that is enough ranting for this hour.. Come back later for a lecture on the benefits of shaving your testicles..
