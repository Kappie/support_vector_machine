At the parking lot, at the security, gatekeeper, no one had. Hardly 2 mins left for the show. No tickets. Thought would wait and try to get one for the night show.  A guy appeared from no where and asked - "Do you need balcony tickets?" "At what cost?" "Dont worry sir, its not black. No. not a black ticket. Ill give you corner seats. Come with me" Got into the theatre's ticket room. The guy got us two tickets, corner seats in the centre, same window price. Thanked him and rushed into the movie hall. Was wondering still these kinda interesting things happen at the movie theatres. Why?  Spidey-2 was fabulous. A nice story, emotions, nice and slick special effects, good action sequences, especially the train stopping one. A good overall family entertainer. Kids would love this one, all the time. Happened to see a kid enjoying in the movie hall with his spidey outfit on. Cute kid that he is...
