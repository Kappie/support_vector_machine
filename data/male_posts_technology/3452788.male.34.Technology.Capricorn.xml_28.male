I think the thing that strikes me most is how many common feelings are shared by many people, in different ways and different language, but still similar: joylessness, anger, boredom, being unfulfilled, compromise, confusion, worthlessness.  I think most people do not feel a need to constantly question and doubt themselves and everything they do and everyone else around them.  I think it is more that people like myself end up finding common ground with each other, if we can get past our fears and inhibitions enough to actually talk about things like this.  I also think these are the people who end up blogging or finding some other outlet (like group therapy).  Take myself, for example.  I am basically terrified of talking to people from fear of not being accepted, a lack of self-confidence, and difficulty setting appropriate boundaries for relationships.  I can be utterly alone in a room full of people I know just because I am afraid that they don’t care about anything I have to say.  In a group of strangers I may engage in some small talk, but it is still uncomfortable for me.  If I was in a room for 2 hours with 10 people having the exact same thoughts and problems as me, what is the chance any of us would ever talk about it?  Pretty slim.  It's not "safe" in normal society to just blurt out your fears and concerns to total strangers.  But in the blogging world, everyone essentially shares a little (or a lot) about themselves, and it is a lot easier to “get to know” someone by reading their thoughts like you never can in the real world.  There is a safety in being somewhat anonymous, but you can still interact with others whose blogs get your attention.  I have e-mailed a few people about things in their blogs that struck me, and have traded a few messages now.  I think it would be cool to sit down with these people and have a cup of coffee and talk about whatever, heavy things, funny stuff, what makes them tick, etc.  This has opened me up to the possibility of caring about other people’s feelings and desires, and the feeling that I can share things to other (anonymous) people without being too close or getting hurt or damaged somehow.  I think this is helping me grow as an individual.  I suppose my outlook on blogging would totally change if I was blogging to keep in touch with friends, share funny stories about the gang giving away watermelon, discuss Sarah's crush on Joseph, or whatever else people with friends do.  I see some blogs as a group journal where a group of freinds shares stuff that is mildly funny or frivolous or interesting, but not very deep or intense or angst-ridden.  (That's not a put-down at all, just an observation.)  Obviously mine is not that kind of blog, as I am doing this for soul-searching, for figuring stuff out, for survival.  Finally: I think there is a tacit understanding among everyone here in Blogworld that we are all a little vulnerable, and we need to be careful with each other’s feelings.  I know some people do not have that same level of care and respect, but so far I get the feeling that there is generally support and concern for a person’s feelings, and people without nice things to say don’t say anything at all.
