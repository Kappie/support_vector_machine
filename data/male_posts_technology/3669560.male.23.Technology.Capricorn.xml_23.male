For instance, I think I'm the only person in the world that noticed  urlLink Phil LaMarr  is an extra in Spiderman 2. I'm sure you caught all the other cameos, including the loser Raimi brother begging for any bit part Sam would give him. Bet you missed Phil though.   This is probably only portentious to me, but if the least funny actor on a perenially underachieving  urlLink sketch comedy show  can sink low enough towalkon as anextra, then the economy is much worse off than I'd ever imagined. The producers of  urlLink Samurai Jack  and  urlLink Futurama  must pay their voicetalentin urlLink playmoney .Look forPhil on disaster-bound mass transit, slack-jawed directly to the right of Spiderman as the web-slinger stops the elevated train from de-elevating.   I think I caused a tumult in the theatre, cackling as Tobey McGuire fought to save thousands upon thousands of people from doom. In my defense, I would have laughed without seeing Phil LaMarr, as Tobey's   trying really hard to stop this train   face looks just like a   wishbone passing sideways through the lower colon   face. Some acting coachshould tell him that general exertion is a different face than a painful bowel movement.   If they were the same, weightlifting in all its forms would be a much more satisfying spectator sport.   I also thought I caught a  urlLink Stan Lee  cameo. An old guy with biggish hair and horn-rimmed glasses pulls someone out of the way of ahunk of falling building.I also thought I saw him at my cousin's wedding inStockton, California, so takeboth sitingswith a grain of salt.    Here's aheads-up. If you the only thing you like more than funk and fetishism is the crooning of Elton John, then you should buy or download the  urlLink Scissor Sisters . This apparently belongs to a sub-genre of music called perv pop, and I like it. It'swhatSir Elton and Prince might come up with if they were locked in a room together with a gimp--only gayer.   I wanted todiscuss allthose things at length, I just couldn’t make anything come out funny. I’m as disappointed as you are.
