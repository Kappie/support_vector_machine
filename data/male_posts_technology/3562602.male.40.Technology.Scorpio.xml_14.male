We went home and moved the furniture in the family room so the wainscotting can get installed.  The porch looks great.  I talked with C last night and really got pissed off.  I was watching TV when she called so I turned the TV down.  I was having trouble concentrating so I turned the TV off.  I was then accused of being inattentive.  That's bullshit!  I couldn't hear so I turned the TV off.  When I went back to the phone all I got was a pile of shit from C.  Give me a damn break.  I called the house painters to see when they could start.  No date yet.  Still working on getting the floor refinished.  (I can't find anyone who wants to do it)
