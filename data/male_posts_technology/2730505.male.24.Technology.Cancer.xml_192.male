FUCK FUCK FUCK  okay, just to demostrate how retarded I still am....I got to Ulta right (yes I go to fucking Ulta to go get mens products and if you think that's gay fuck off) and try to go buy a new bottle of cologne since I'm getting sick and tired of CK.  I was browsing around and finally narrowed it down to 3 brands.  Polo Blue, Aqua di Gio, and Dolce and Gabana.  All of these smell good and all and all of them are pretty much in the same price range so it really didn't matter which I bought.  I finally decided on some Blue since I haven't bought a bottle of that for a while now.  I pick out the box and pay for it.  So I unwrap it and stash it in my car so I can put it on on my way to work Tuesday.  So today on my way to work, I pull out the bottle, untwist the cap and realize that there's no damn spritszer there.  Thinking it was one of those bottle with out a spritszer, I tilt the bottle to get a little bit of cologne and nothing!!!  So I look underneath and BAM!  There it was, it says AFTER SHAVE GEL!!!!  Well laddy freakin' da!  I don't even shave enough to fucking use this shit!  Don't get me wrong, I still used some to smell all nice and stuff but fuck man.  How often do I shave, probably like once every 5 days or something ridiculous like that.  Yes, I have not hair on my damn body.  The last girlfriend I had said that I was as soft and smoothe as a baby's ass.  I can still use the damn thing but whatever, I should have checked the fucking box first!  Spiderman 2 opens tomorrow.  I think that will be a Thursday night showing.  I don't think I am ready to fight with nerds of all sorts tomorrow just yet.  Oh yeah, in a Rainbow Six 3 related post, I finally caught up my  urlLink kills vs deaths  in that damn game!  finally I can sleep faster after playing it.  I just play to play now.  I accomplished my goal and will savor it for the time being.  I already accomplished my goal after that and that was 100 kills vs. deaths.  Currently, I am 120 kills over.  That was pretty easy.  Now it's going to be 500 over and then 1000 over.  Ultimately I want to reach 1000 kills over deaths before Black Arrow comes out.  Im back at work now...another 4 days till the big weekend eh?
