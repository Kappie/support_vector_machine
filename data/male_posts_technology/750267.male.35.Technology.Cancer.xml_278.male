But, every time I apply for a credit card or a loan, I have to write down the details of my income, my assets and the balances of my credit. So I suppose privacy is only an illusion for me – certainly almost anyone can order my credit report and get all the gory details of my life for a few dollars. (I found out today that companies don’t need your permission to get your credit report, which was a shock to me.)   Income   I am actually a very lucky guy. I was a bit of a slacker in high school and university, yet I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I then lucked into a relatively high-paying job right out of University without even trying.  After 6 years of working full-time, I decided to branch into consulting since I had several friends who were doing it and making good money. The money was in fact very good – my salary doubled overnight. I was  urlLink living the life of Riley . In the end I discovered it was too good to last.  My first contract lasted two-and-a-half years. I actually refused to renew my contract at that company because I wanted a change. My next contract was one-and-a-half years. At the end of two contracts (4 years), my income was 75% higher than when I started contracting. I was making an excellent living.  Then, two things happened. First, the dot-com bust of early 2001 when computer-related jobs started to dry up; and second, the terror attacks on New York in September 2001.  At the time of the attacks, I was working at Fidelity Investments and my contract was supposed to end September 15, 2001. Truth be told, I was not happy with the work, and I just wanted to finish what I was doing and get out of there quickly. Well, as fate would have it, that Friday my contract did not get renewed. Since the stock markets were still closed after the attacks, and I was working at a mutual fund company that relied on the stock market for part of its daily business, I was not too surprised at that turn of events. I was involuntarily unemployed for the first time – ever.  Actually, what I said to myself was that I would not mind a couple of month’s vacation. I had been working for 10 years at that point, without any significant time off, so I actually said to my friends and family, “I’m looking forward to some time off.” Stupid me.  Winter 2001 was very cold – both weather-wise and job-wise. It took me six months (til the end of February 2002) to find my next contract. And as soon as the ink was signed, the employees at my new client went on strike for two months. So I could not do anything but sit and wait for them to get back to work. That was eight full months with absolutely no income.  When I did get back into working, my consulting rates were way down. And they have getting worse since then, not better. And I also am finding that it is taking more time to find my next job at the end of each contract. I am off 6 weeks a year on average, which just makes the income situation worse.
