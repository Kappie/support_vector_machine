I do enjoy working on mechanical things myself, but in different contexts.  and certainly not on something so arcane as a ford tempo. I swear, it's barely recognizable as an ICE at all. So many proprietary parts and bizarre design choices. I'll take the opportunity to catch up on my theory work, I've been immersed in environmental details, C# stuff, and so on the past few days.
