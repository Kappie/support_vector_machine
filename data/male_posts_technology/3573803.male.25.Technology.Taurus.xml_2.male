Those of you who have read  urlLink 88pros  blog would by now know that we had a day out at the rock islands of Palau.    The best part of the trip (for me) was the jelly fish lake. That experience was soooooooo surreal. Swimming amongst millions of jellyfish was a unique experience I doubt I'll get anywhere else in the world. This was definitely one of the (few??) upsides of my job (i.e. getting to visit exotic places).    88pro also did us proud by jumping into the water without knowing how to swim (granted he did have a life jacket on). He continues the proud tradition of stupid/brave (you decide)people from SL, starting with the BIG BUD, who jump into the ocean without the slightest clue as to what needs to be done after landing in water. But of course there are exceptions (did someone say alien prick???!!).    That evening clubbing and pool completed an awesome day. But of course, better judgment tells me "tooo much information...aint good for you".    Tillwe meet again....sameBat-time, same Bat-channel.....
