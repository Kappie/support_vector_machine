(FICO is named after the company who made credit scores popular, Fair Isaac Corp.)  FICO scores range from 300 - 900. In reality, credit companies give everyone a starting score of 850, and deduct points based on their credit history. Of course, it is more complicated than that, but essentially that's how it works.    My FICO Score   I purchased my credit report today (08-06-2004), and found out my FICO score is 704. Now 750 is considered median, in that half the population have scores under that amount and half are over.  So what this means is I have  slightly  below-average credit. This is causing me some concern right now, and is the primary reason I started this blog. I suspect that it will not be too difficult, mostly through personal education, to raise that score above the 750 mark.  The nice thing about the credit report is that it breaks tells you the top 4 primary factors affecting your FICO number. According to today's report, mine are:   1. The amount owed on credit cards and loans is too high  I already knew this. I have a lot of debt. It wasn't always like this, but I will get into the reasons why it happened another time.   2. The proportion of balances to credit limits on credit cards and loans is too high  I don't quite understand this aspect of FICO, and will spend time learning more about it. In theory, if you have a $10,000 credit limit and you have a $7,500 outstanding balance, you have a 75% debt-to-credit-limit ratio. My ratio is currently 66% - but I am getting dinged for this number being too high.   3. The proportion of balances to credit limits on credit cards is too high  Same as above.   4. Relatively high number of accounts with balances.  This means I have too many loans and credit cards. But because this is the fourth item on the list, it is the one least affecting my score.  In coming blog entries, I will explore ways to improve each of those four areas. Then I will check my credit score again in a couple of months to see if there is any improvement.
