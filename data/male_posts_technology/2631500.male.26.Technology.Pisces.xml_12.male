I've been travelling in the same train atleast 2 times a month, for the last 4 years. But, never lost a thing. When I woke up on Saturday morning in the train, my shoe was missing. I had to leap bare-footed from the train to the car.  Maybe, the guy who took it needed it more than I do. Hope he makes good use of it.  The first thing I did on Saturday was to shop for a new shoe. I went to the shop wearing a slipper, a dirty jeans - all my clothes jumped into the washing machine, and an old shirt. The shopkeeper would've thought that I'm some begger. Whichever shoe I take, he'll say that it's costly. Finally, when I flashed my credit card, he started calling me 'Sir'. What a change! People respect only the dress.  It didn't rain in Chennai today. Felt like a furnace when I stepped out for lunch. Finished the lunch and came back quickly to the comfort of the office.  Hmm.. I might go to US for an 8 week by the end of this month. Let's see...
