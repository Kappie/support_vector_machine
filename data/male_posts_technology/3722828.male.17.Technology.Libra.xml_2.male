I've been superbly busy getting unpacked, going to a dance competition for my little sister, enjoying a sunburn-filled vacation (In all actuality it was a blast), and other goodies.  So, in detail, what's happened?  Read on.  First off, I got my iBook.  Yeap, I finally got it.  It's a 14" iBook with a Combo Drive, and an extra 512MB RAM in it for a total of 768MB of RAM.  It's running blazingly fast, and all it's missing is Office.  But I can remedy that on Limewire and a few hours or so, BitTorrent if i can get some free time.  Picked up Keynote for it as well, and now that I know the ins and outs of OS X Basics, I'm starting to dive into the Terminal and play around (cautiously) in there.  Hopefully I'll learn a lot from this laptop, and I'm already considering buying an old G4 and slapping OS X Server on it, and use it as a Fileserver of sorts.  But I'll cross that bridge when/if it comes up.  Also, I got Doom 3 now, and have been playing it to death, though I'm terribly stuck on the Guardian Boss in hell.  I know his weakpoints, but I always run out of ammo before he goes down.  I'll just keep trying, I guess.  The gameplay itself is methodically paced, and isn't your Unreal Tournament shooter variety.  You'll need to take cover and peek out around corners to survive in this game, and luring enemies into your shotgun helps as well.  The graphics are astounding, not to mention the heat haze effect, which blurs the visual area around sources of heat, like your eyes do in real life.  It's amazing, but it's a shame my video card cannot keep up with it.  Speaking of PC's, I think it's time for me to upgrade mine.  I'm currently running an Athlon XP 2200+ Processor with one stick of 512MB PC-2700 RAM, and a Radeon 9600 Video Card.  My dilema, is that I do not know what to upgrade to.  I want a motherboard with a PCI-X slot, preferably two, yet still an AGP Slot for backwards compatibility.  I also want to use my current RAM, and not have to buy new sticks, so that rules out Socket 754 and 940, if I'm right.  But Socket 939 is very expensive at the moment, and I can't seem to justify it, not to mention there's only three good mobos out for it at the moment, which makes me anxious.  Any suggestions?  Alas, it's late, so I'm gonna head to bed.  Good night, Internetland.
