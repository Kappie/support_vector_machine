Oh helpful bean.  When I'm tense you make me frantic. You make me pee. If I partake of your muddy glory in  the evening you keep me up all night long.  Oh bean, naughty bean.  When we're apart for a day you send your goons  to sledgehammer my skull.  Jealous bean.  If not for you, oh bean, I couldn't make it  through the day.
