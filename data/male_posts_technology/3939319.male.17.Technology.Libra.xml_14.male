What percentage of comedian's bits are true stories?  i mean, they claim they're all true, when obviously some aren't... Does Larry the cable guy go home at night to a wife and kids, or does he just sit at the end of his bed staring at the wall, talking in that low, redneck voice to himself all night?  The world may never know.  Speakin of boys state, i'm gonna go to the website and see if they added any more pictures.  if there's anything noteworthy, i'll report.  if not, i'm going to bed..  i feel sick..  adios...  GET 'ER DONE!!!
