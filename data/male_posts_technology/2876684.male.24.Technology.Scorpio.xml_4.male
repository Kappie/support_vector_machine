Guess I should have figured it wasn't an easy job - I never get the easy stuff! :P  Anyways, they want me on-site tomorrow too since it's the 1st day with all the new equipment so I must find out where I can can borrow some riot gear on short notice. I don't know how people take to having their computers not working! (Well, maybe I am exaggerating just a tad...)
