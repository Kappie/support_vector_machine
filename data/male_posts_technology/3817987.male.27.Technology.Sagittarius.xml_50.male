The best feature is a weekly list of new releases on Netflix with links to the Netflix pages.  For instance out today are:    urlLink  Slasher  , a documentary about a liquidation car salesmen.  urlLink  Poker For Dummies  , something i desperately need to rent!  urlLink  The Dreamers  , Bertulucci art porn.  urlLink  Sherlock Holmes: Dressed to Kill  , which while im sure is fine film has a really funny title.
