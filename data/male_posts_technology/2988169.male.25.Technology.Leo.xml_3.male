Had my first brush with a project pitch......got to go with the Actimize-MerIndus team to pitch for an Anti-money-Laundering solution presentation to ICICI bank.....man..what an experience.......though we guyz from merindus din't have to do much, watching the actimize guyz go about the presentation was an experience by itself......there was a marketing guy and a domain-expert.....both weren't technologists......but the way they handled the ICICI guyz was just amazing........u gotta talk maan......an important lesson learned on the trip to mumbhai......adios amigos........
