This means my job will end as of October 11th.  Not good news.  Yesterday was nuts.  It all started after lunch when the big boss showed up unannounced.  Our immediate manager went into a meeting with him then all the permanent employees went in one at a time.  Not good when tey all came out with green folders.  The folders had the severence packages in them.  Right away they all went home.  Kind of weird that at a job where they wouldn't let the contractors work alone they just all of the sudden leave all the contractors alone.   Anyway, it sucks because I really liked this job.  I learned new stuff everyday and got to help people.  So now I am on the job hunt again.  Atleast I am getting paid while hunting this time.  TekSystems is coming in Friday to help us.  Kelly, the recruiter, advised there are plenty of open jobs she can place us in.  That is a bright spot.  That is all I know for now...if you have an opening and want to hire me...well, do it!
