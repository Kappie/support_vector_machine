"The shipment forecast for the DS, due out later this year in Japan and the United States, is more optimistic than Sony Corp's target to ship three million units of its PlayStation Portable (PSP), a new handheld due out later this year in Japan."   Nintendo intends to have the Nintendo DS in stores for us by Christmas? I have my fingers crossed :-)
