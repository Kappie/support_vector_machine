Its easy for me to start dozing off because a brother just can't be....still...for too long. My brain needs activity or I just start losing it. Sucks, I know, but hey. I'm fairly certain this is a trait of my mother. She has that same habit from time to time. But here I sit, in a computer lab waiting for a ride to Enterprise so I can pick up a car that wasn't what I ordered...all because their crappy clientele haven't returned their smaller vehicles. WHAT JOY!!!!! All this reinforces why I don't make plans. My plans never work....EVER. EVVERR!!!!! So while i'd rather be back on my way home, packing the temp with my get right-weekend gear, i'm here, talking to my friend from Church Erica, who happens to work in the lab i'm occupying. She showed me pictures of my homeboy J.R.'s wedding...pictures apparently posted to the website of the people that did their wedding photos. Cute girl...good guy...hope everything works out for them. They both used to live in SC but are NC kids now...living it up in Charlotte. He sent me an email going on two months ago...I responded but he has yet to. Well, a little while longer to stay here waiting. It is the calm b4 the storm. I'm on the road to ATL baby, just a while to stay here, then i'm out!  Pray for me...
