But it's gonna be a pretty short trip only 2 days, but I enjoyed my time the previous time so looking forward to it again.  Just got the SDU (Social Development Unit) newsletter and I'm half-tempted to try out some of the activities. There's this tennis for beginners lesson and its like 80 bucks for 10 lessons which is pretty reasonable. But I don't even remember where I put my SDU card.
