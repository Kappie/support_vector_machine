E ven though their staffs' salaries are only average or a little above average,   but the environment is great, the benefits are great, and the typical passion, commitment, competence and intelligence of the people around you everyday is exhilarating. They have no timecards, not much office rules and given a lot of responsibility. As long as you deliver results, it doesn't matter if you come in at midnight and walk barefooted in the office.  Some of the legendary "Cool" benefits include:          You can drink all the Coca-Cola you want for free, apply for most beverages as well (Microsoft  Google)     You could bring your pet Tiger into the office (Microsoft)     You can spend 10% of your time on your personal innovative projects (Google)     Free lunch (Google)     Massage  Gym (Google)  Paid Health Club Membership (Microsoft)    No to mentioned Medical/Dental/Vision Care, Life Insurance, Tuition Reimbursement and etc.  Okay, the purpose of this blog is not to compare our current company with these legendary companies (how many company in this world can afford such luxury?). Rather, to find out what are the realistic small steps we can take to improve the working culture in our own offices to increase productivity, encourage innovation, boost up the fun level and be responsible with minimal supervision.  I personally believe Software Engineer is a new breed of workforce which does not require constant supervision and repulse repetitive work. We need to be given the space,  opportunity and responsibility to innovate and develop.  On the darker side of most corporation, most local IT companies (in Malaysia) does not belive in innovation by the low level technical staff. The management still make most of projects' decision with no regards to the software development aspect of it. Software Engineers are "suppressed" and unable to unleashed their fullest potential. "There are so much to do, but so little can be done". Hopefully from this blog we could develop a few ideas to inject an Utopian-Style Working Culture into our current working environment.
