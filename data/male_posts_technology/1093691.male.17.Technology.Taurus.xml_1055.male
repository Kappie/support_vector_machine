I've been listening to Shut Up by The Black Eyed Peas quite a lot, which is quite odd because it's not my normal taste in music, but I really like this song; and I have been introduced to Sugarcult who just rock. Rather stressed with the amount of work I have to do, but it's nearly holiday time, only two weeks left, so I'm not too worried. It's my birthday on Saturday, having a driving lesson which should be amusing! Bought my Christmas cards this evening with Jo  co in Oxted (haha, that rhymes).  So a mix of really good and really bad things - I supose they level out.
