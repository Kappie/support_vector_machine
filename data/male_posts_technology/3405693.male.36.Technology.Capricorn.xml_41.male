I know that broadcasters must aim their programming at the lowest common denominator, and that people as a rule are afraid of change.  Hence, a unique and creative show gets popular, and then gets followed by tons and tons of clones, each one dumbed down a bit more than the last.  Until finally, from starting with the Eco Challenge and you end up with The Simple Life and Wife Swap.  But what about all the other programming out there.  There are...what...800 channels broadcasting in North America?  And a lot of them put out the same 20 shows.  But there are also diamonds in that rough.  With the advent of digital broadcasting, satellite reception and the continued development and enhancement of storage technologies, why could we not have a pool of all broadcast to work with?  The consumer could select the type and or level of intelligence/humour/acting/reality and get a list of programming that fits their need.  None of this "100 channels of shit and 4 good tv shows that aren't movies, time your life around the tv guide" stuff.  TiVo has already put little tendrils of thought into this, and most of the cable and satellite companies are putting similar ideas to work for them with PVR's.  But the problem here is we still are subject to the whims of the provider as far as programming goes.  Why should I be forced to have 7 different channels showing some stupid shit like Nick and Jessica or else a bunch of crap that doesn't interest me at a given time?    So here's my idea.  Take the TiVo model and expand on it.  Have the providers work together to offer ALL broadcast in digital format, and the consumer picks their watching choices.  Not just the 150 channels we can choose from now, but ALL channels.  You could set up a rating system with different ratings for things like intellectual content, creativity (ie: is it a new idea or another survivor clone?), dramatic skill, music skill, action skill, pace, budget, "Hollywood" level, obviously sex/violence/language ratings like we have now, etc etc.  You could even set it up so that one station on your reciever only shows new shows, so you could sample what you want to watch from the bi-annual crop of new blood.  Some of those stupid shows are interesting to people who wouldn't normally watch such crap...for example I totally dig "Next Action Star".  So I could choose to look at new shows as they come out and see if there are other ones that appeal to me on a similar base level.  Obviously, the major challenge in this system would be the ratings system:  how do you make them accurate and usable?  In a perfect world, the consumers would set the ratings; either net based or remote control based, after a show a little survey comes up and the viewer ticks off the appropriate boxes to give an accurate rating.  The problem with this is that there could be payola and cheating from the big networks and producers to skew the results.  So how could it possibly be done accurately?  Perhaps a limit on the ratings each source could do for each show...one rating per week per show per cable box.  Again there could be flaws in that, but if the proper checks and balances are installed those flaws could be minimized.  It would take a bit of time to work out the logistics of such a plan, but theoretically it  could  be done.    I guess we approach these abilities now with computer viewing and downloading.  The biggest problem with the current system, however, is how does the user find the program that  THEY  want?  If you've ever tried to search out a TV show or movie on the web, you know that it's difficult to find non pirate downloads of something.  So the producers, broadcasters, networks would have to get on-board and help out with that.  Instead of commercials on their shows they could have banner ads etc.  Although that may screw up the revenue streams.  Ahhh I don't know how to make this work.  But that's why it's a  Utopian  idea and not a plan of action.
