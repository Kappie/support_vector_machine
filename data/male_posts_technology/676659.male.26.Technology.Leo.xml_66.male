I hope Achi ko indi mag amo na klase na doc! hehe Well, enjoy your time with your Achi Mae today! :)  Melissa: I made you an ADMIN na di sa RR, click on TEAM and Add Team Member na lang, para kaw na lang add sa email ni Lorelene. I forgot her address naman eh. I added Michelle na gale. Be sure to tell her to check her email. :) Where have you been and what have you been doing? hehe :)  Ko tiam naman ako, schedule ko morning naman. Cos sa aftenoon I have a different agenda. :) Excited na ko sa camp! :D Pero haven't finished making the souvenirs pa cos wala pa nila gin hatag ang full-list of songs and the names of the campers para sa ID. I won't be blogging next week and I will surely miss RR a lot! hehehe :) Bye y'all! God bless your day! :D
