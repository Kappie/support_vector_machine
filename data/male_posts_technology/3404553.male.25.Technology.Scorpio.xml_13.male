Many of the methods used to implement and verify these complex interactions can be described as design for manufacturability (DFM) techniques. In this paper we review a wide range of existing non-lithographic and lithographic DFM techniques in the semiconductor industry. We also analyze existing product designs for DFM technique implementation potential and propose new design methods for improving lithographic capability.
