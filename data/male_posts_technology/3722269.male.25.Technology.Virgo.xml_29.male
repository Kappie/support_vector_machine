I dont use soap... you know that guy that 'air dries' on jerry mcguire? well I 'air bathe'. ok, I dont, I'm just bullshitting... but at least you knew, deep down, that I was. I'm wondering at what point peoples tangled webs catch up on them, I'm wondering how many of you have really snowballed a little white lie into something spectacular. Tonight I met a guy, that apparently owned a company a friend of mine owns. Hmm.. thats odd. I was talking to him because a laptop I had expressed interest in buying off him kept changing spec. Thats odd. Now he worked for a different company . Odd again. Then he's self employed and contracing. Odd odd odd!. Then he subcontracts to major companies to do things that they have whole divisions of people to do. Very odd. Then I make a reference to two people that used to run ihug as being 'the brotheres grim' (a fairytale reference, their last names were not grim) and he produces a tracert of 'sirgrim' a fabricated report nodoubt, to let me know taht he indeed knew whoever I could think up to mention. I should've asked him to get me a /dcc chat with god, but alas, I didnt think to ask. This did start me thinking tho, the internet is obviously the perfect place to pretend to be something that you're not, hell a lot of people even use it for this very reason - either subconciously or not, as an outlet to be who they would be if they had fewer inhibitions.. a bit like we do when we're drunk. More outgoing, far less shy, and not afraid to say what we feel. With the exception of ABSOLUTE STARK RAVING MAD PSYCHOPATHS - which will remain nameless, this is fairly harmless.. but when you're going to tell little white lies folks.. at least think about how easy they are to prove or disprove.. do some background.. something, anything rather than just making wild unsubstantiated claims. This reminds me of a story... I was living in Grafton at the time, and happily talking away in #auckland, I think it was probably early-mid 2000. The subject of 'cars' came up, as it so often does and people started talking about which cars they had/wanted etc. This one cunt, soon as I said I wanted a subaru sti was all 'ooh I've got one of those' sure you do buddy, every 20 yr old can afford a performance tuned  last year subaru. Good going!. Then I said 'but for long trips I think I'd go with a mitsi gto twinturbo' same guy 'ooh I've got one of those!' OMFG! grow a brain people! so I decide to ask him a few specifics.. hah! people always get tricked on the details. 'Much room in the back seats of the gto?' I ask.. baiting him.. 'no, fuck all' he responds.. HA! I had him.. gto's dont have back seats! ahahah I was almost upset that it was over so easily. I invited him to come pick me up and take me for a drive in his STI.. funnily enough it was in the 'shop' getting some work done. Sure it was buddy. SSSSUUUUUREE it was. Jackass. Anyway, after about another 15 minutes of taunting, I tell him, he should come pick me up in his GTO, and if he does, I'll shout him a feed. We set a time, he organised someone else to pick up (further proving that he didnt have one - no back seats you see, so where would I sit?!? aye aye!) and he went off line. Everyone had a laugh, then about 30 minutes later, I hear a toot outside, so I got up to see what sort of piece of shit he had, hey - if he fronted up in a car, I'd buy him a feed.. I didnt care.. I was bored and hungry anyway. Well fuck me. It was exactly as he'd said, Mitsi, twin turbo, gto. I had humble pie for dinner right there on the road side.. but we all laughed about it on the way to dennys.. I had to laugh loudly, from the back seat.. which was really uncomfortable..fuck all room. He had the STI as well, the dude wrote BPFTP a program that sold really well overseas, and with a residual return from his company of a couple hundred thousand a year, well yeah.. he turned out to be a good cunt too. hell of a laugh. smart... but dont tell him I said that, he's arrogant too :D almost as much as me. Linux.. I'll be a linux n00b soon as I get a hard drive .. I've got a cute wee computer destined to be the smallest linux box you've probably ever seen. Had some gorgeous Dory fillets for dinner, cooked in a reaaaaaally hot oven, a light crumb baked to perfection. I'm a legend. I think that covers everything? Ka kite ano.
