For those who have been there...well u are also welcome but not as delegate but as facilitator...I challenged to those who have been empowered to Connect, Relate and Resonate..Opps my personal vision statement.. to those who have not truly experienced God's power and promises for them.  The Community project needed more facilitator as they expands the area they are reaching more to the community around Klang valley...So guys , those E03 delegates prepare yourself this year, as you go out and touch the community around you and blessing your pastors in your home churches.  The pictures are found in the  Kayanbutter photo collection viewer. Take patience as some of these picture which involves lots of people takes time to load...also i have retained some of the pictures resolution so that you can print these pictures out.  Truly after you have seen the photos...you will soon realize that God is at work...kinda like the first Realities of Experiencing God...  Regards From Fellow JesusFreak Joshua Tan
