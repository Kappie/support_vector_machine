Check out the best news site (for tech) around,  urlLink www.slashdot.org .  Anyway before the karma police arrive and drag me away for starting my own blog I thought I would say Hi.  To start I'd like to warn you, I've never been a good writer so please bear with me on the spelling and grammar front.  To finish I will add that I am a techie, whatever that means these days, who lives in Canada.  I program, run Linux and am currently doing a MSc in Artificial Intelligence (please feel free to make the obligatory jokes :o).  I work for two different universities in Ontario and have a lot of free time to spend with my girlfriend and our cat (picture to come in future).  Now this free time is generally stripped from what should be spent on doing a MSc but I still have a year left so I'll worry about the reckoning later.  Just to make it clear, I am a huge procrastinator, it is my primary function.  BANG, BANG, BANG !!!  Well my time is coming to an end, I believe that is probably ... CRASH !!! qwg; h a
