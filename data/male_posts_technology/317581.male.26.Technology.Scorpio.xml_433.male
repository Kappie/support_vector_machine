I had a dream last night. I was having dinner with a bunch of friends. Karla and a boyfriend of hers that I had never seen were also eating with us. Karla was on the table next to us and he was sitting across from me. I was on the bench side and we had two 4-person tables tables pulled together for the gathering. Over the course of the meal, whenever I turned to talk to the table where karla and the friends were sitting, her boyfriend would put stuff in my drink. One time it was a lemon, One time it was fish bones. The second time, I yelled at him to stop messing with my drink. Karla asked me why I was freaking out, and I just yelled that she was trying to poison me. She tried to explain that it was a joke, but I just kept yelling "You're trying to poison me". She started crying and I woke up. After waking up, I recalled every time I have ever let my mother down and then I felt horrible inside.  I've decided that my dream and the D are somehow connected and I will not be playing anymore.  I woke up at 7am this morning, for I had a meeting with the unemployment peeps. Just a "Getting a job" class, but I read, so that was fun. I'm finishing up the "Children of the Mind" by Orson Scott Card, book 4 of the ender's series.  Driving back from hanging out with Cliff today, there was a car accident in front of my house. I don't know how it happened. I was thinking about blogging, then I look and see 2 cars spinning in unison in front of me. It was so weird.  Tonight we celebrate cahlens birthday. YAY!!! I got a 160GB HD for my birthday, so that's fun:)  Well, I'm going to go practice the piano now.   Peace-
