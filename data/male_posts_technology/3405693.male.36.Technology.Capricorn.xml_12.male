Because sometimes I sure feel like I'm crazy.  I've gone a long long time without alot of good things happening and without getting a lot of the necessary things for good mental health.  So I sometimes wonder if I've approached and perhaps crossed that line.  Of course, now I'm taking the necessary steps to alleviate some of that, starting with my diet and moving on through getting excercise and all that.    But still I wonder.  I was watching "The Next Action Star" last night (yeah, yeah I know...reality tv...what can I say, I'm sucked in), and a couple of things occured to me.  First of all, during their acting class they all had to discuss an object that holds sentimental value to them, and go deep into the memory of it.  Well I don't even HAVE such an object.  I really don't feel sentimental attachment to anything, and own nothing that signals strong growth in my life.  Isn't that kind of wierd?  I have no talisman. Hrmm.    The other thing that occured to me as I watched this lame reality show is that the psycho chick Viviana is not so different from me.  Much as I loved to hate her, she reacts to situations very similar to the way I do, although much much MUCH more exaggerated.  I thought of this moments after it hit me that she was a total nutcase and not in control of her mental situation at all.  So that made me wonder about MY mental situation.  Now I am concerned.  I guess in the end all I can do is do what I do and do it til it's done.  But it certainly is time for me to keep a watch on where my head is at, especially if I want to make myself a niche somewhere that allows me to succeed.  Pretty hard to succeed anywhere when everyone notices that you're a nutbag...
