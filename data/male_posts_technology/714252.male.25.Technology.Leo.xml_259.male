You know when you add up everything you owe and everything you have coming in and it just doesn't make the same figure.. It's like that and not in a good way.. I'm sure I'll stumble on through but boy can life be stressfull sometimes...  Personally things are ok at the moment.. Got a bit of.. Strange news today but nothing terrible, just strange.. Had a huge blow up with the family recently too which was funny.. Had an argument with my Dad about a load of things and then when talking with my mum I said that I did see Dads point of view on one thing (Only saw his point of view, didn't agree, but obviously I shouldn't have gone that far) Anyway I could do no right where that was concerned so I just left it.  Back to work for the moment.. I think the problem is that Step Thru is too big for one person but too small for two people.. Hmmm Maybe I should look at how it's structured.. I think I will have to try and make some time to have a serious look at the whole thing from top to bottom..  You know that feeling where you've kinda lost control and you can't quite get a grasp on things.. That's me right now..  GRRR
