Right. Haul ass to the lotto shop, check last weeks tickets, get this weeks, and hardware stores sell sets of scales, w00t. Buy a set, weigh my ass, celebrate having reached goal. Thats was the plan. So I catch a ride with the old man who wants to check his lotto tickets too, we haul into town he mentions once we've left that he's got this other shopping list of shit we have to do too.. ahh well, still beats the fricken bus or walking.. so be it. So we hit hammer hardware first, this stupid-ass rotorua one supposedly the first 'drive through' lotto outlet - like HUH? WTF? yeah, anyway that idea lasted a week, now its just roped off. Good going rotorua. The imbecile that thought that one up had better of committed sideways. Anyway, I'm checking out the scales, which most of only go to 120kg.. now any measuring device that is analogue in nature -generally- starts to get a bit inaccurate as you get toward the top end.. figuring scales are the same and that I'm damn near the top end.. I'm in a bit of a pickle.. so dad comes over all smiley faced - 'the tickets won $54' well thats nice, but like was it mine or his? I'll never know, but have to trust in the old fucker not ripping me off - haha.. he wouldnt anyway.. he pays for the scales.. nice of him, and we head off home. I pop on the jug - as I'd started coming down with a migraine and wanted some more caffiene incase that re-adjusted my balance and let me soldier on pain free.. and I unwrapped the scales and went to weigh myself. Tune in next week when kermit the frog says... Ahh like I'd do that to you pricks.  Keeping in mind I had my jumper on, heavier pants than at last weigh in and my shoes on (anyone smell excuses?) I clocked in at 115kg on the nose. Well, I'm happy :) and that was a week that wasnt without its odd splurges.. as m00kle will testify, I was hardly saint-like with my eating last weekend, and, because I'm proud as hell, I wont be saint-like this weekend. Not that its likely to sustain this rate of weightloss, but, supposing I pull it off being a tinarse, I'll be under a hundred kg by my birthday. All I can say to that is.. Halle-fucken-luyah! The weight is over ;)
