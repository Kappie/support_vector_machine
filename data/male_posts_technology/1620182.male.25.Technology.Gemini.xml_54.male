 I have never in my life witnessed a sporting event that had a truly lasting impact on me.  That was until Saturday afternoon around, say, 4:00pm when Matt Schaub took a knee to end what turned out to be the  urlLink utter dismanteling  of the once proud Virginia Tech (c)Hokies.  Maybe it was all the turkey and stuffing.  Maybe it was hostile crowd.  Whatever it was, Virginia Tech looked completely confused as Virginia blitzed them from all directions in route to scoring four touchdowns on their first four possessions in second half.  And with chants of "Welcome to the ACC" pouring down from the stands, the Hokies were left to wonder why they can't win in the month of November.  You want to know what I think?  WHO CARES!!  The Commonwealth Cup is back in its rightful place: Charlottesville, VA.
