Think she's feeling damn bad about it now. Can't say I dun totally understand how it happened but I still felt really sad.  As 2 of my ex-housemates are still staying together in UK now, I kinda had a quick chat with the other girl to see if she could help talk to her. Apparently things haven't been exactly great between these 2 girls as they've been drifting apart since last year ever since one of them got into the relationship with my friend. (Hope it's not getting too confusing at this stage coz now I'm talking about the 2 girls and there's nothing to do with my Navy friend.) Somehow as we talked, I made the other girl felt like she wasn't putting enough effort into trying to make their friendship work.  But contrary to this I only said the things I said because she was always the stronger one, more sensible and with a more open heart. I think I must've really made her feel like I wasn't supportive/was laying some kind of blame on her because she sounds kinda upset even today. I feel so bad now and I've tried desperately to explain to her what and why I said. I'm really at a loss now coz I wouldn't want to lose this really good friend.  This has really spoilt my day because now I can't keep this out of my mind. Plus I'm really scared that this incident might've scarred this friendship bad enough to bring it down a level, something that I'm really afraid of but feel so helpless to be able to rectify because of the fact that we're on separate continents. I may be scaring myself unnecessarily but the more I think about it, the more I feel that's the case it is now. I'm really feeling down in the dumps and disspirited.
