Heres the quick run-down untill I have time to forumlate a full theory.  Scientists say we evolved from Monkies, etc...  Creationists say we were made in Gods image...  Now, in the bible there are 'gaps of time' that could account for long periods of 'evolution' present in science.  Ok, taken that, and what we read and have been taught/know et al...   WHAT IF...  God was a monkey? I don't mean that in a sacrelgious way... not at all, but ... hmmm I think I am on to something here, more research required.    -intX    The tree that Eve snacked on was really banana!
