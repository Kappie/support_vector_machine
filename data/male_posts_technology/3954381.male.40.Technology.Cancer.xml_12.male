I work for a real estate company whose sole existence is not to help people live the American dream but to continue to line their inflated wallets with more green. I am not so idealistic that I think I should be working for a company that provides services for nothing, or more socially concious company; but I do wish I worked in a more enjoyable industry. Perhaps something entertainment based.  My office is tastefully decorated with 11'x17" reprints of movie posters I brought in from home. I have occupied this office since July of 1999. My position is of Project Manager in Marketing; which really makes no sense. What's even more ironic is that my projects are few and far between. I have been employed here for 17 years. I left, albiet briefly in 1996 to go to the parent company to further help line their wallets. I was enticed (or is that tricked?) to return to this branch of the corporate family tree in the position of IT Manager. I supported the IT needs, sucessfully I might add, for approximately 100 branches in thr greater NJ/NY/CT Metro area. I performed these duties for 3 years when the evil parent company deemed all IT service and support should be farmed out to IBM. Rather than losing me, my company wished to keep me and transferred me to Marketing. I reiterate it makes no sense, but it's better than being unemployed. I am constantly searching for a better job, but to date, nothing has surfaced. The one interview I did secure was for a Help Desk Manager in Weehawken, NJ. I made some excuse to leave early and went on the interview. Sadly upon my arrival I discovered the interviewee was so disinterested he failed to show up himself. I wonder if I had sent my thank you letter they would have called me back?  I am working on a current project (well not actually working on it today); a multimedia training cd. When I don't have major projects going on I track Market Share, assist others, goof off, surf the web, typical duties of the Corporate employee.  Today all I have done is listen to a few Stepehen Sondheim cd's. Last week I finally went ahead and ordered the major Sondheim cast albums I had been meaning to purchase for years: Follies, A Little Night Music, Anyone Can Whistle and Sunday in the Park....  A Little Night Music is a beautiful score written in 3/4 time, in other words a waltz. Hey, I have to do something to while away the hours. Though I decided this morning I am leaving at 3. Just beacuse. Well actually because I have a couple dangling hours of vacation time and my company instituted a new policy that you cannot record less than 4 hours vacation time in a day; so an HR friend of mine suggested I leave two hours early and let her know and she would adjust the vacation balance. This was two weeks ago she suggested this; so how I haven't left early yet is beyond me. I suppose there are worse situations I could be in; I could be in a romantic relationship with an abusive drug addict.  Monday will bring a new Supervisor, err - sorry, New Vice President and Director of Marketing. Maybe she can help improve the situation. Maybe not. My old VPDofM basically ignored me. It wasn't personal, she had been with the company for over 20 years and lost her fire at least 15 years ago. I was (as were the rest of my department mates) hoping we would be supervisor-less for a longer period of time. We are a pretty well oiled machine, with each of us having very specific responsibilites and from my perspective really don't need supervision. Just someome to occaisionally let us know of new policies and programs. Part of me actually feels sorry for the new VPDofM, I am sure she doesn't realize how heinous this company is, nor how little power she will actually yield. There's zero creativity involved, it's all administrative. I will be supportive, fun, nice, informative and motivated. Ok, basically that means I will be a two faceed brown noser, but hey, whatever it takes right? I don't play the corporate game very well.  I am so bored but at least I only have 30 more minutes left in the day. I should do a lap around the floor and chitchat with some people to help the time pass. I really hate my job.
