Its all good now though, so my computer is back and I'm online again.   I've been running around a lot lately, like up to the grand opening of the jordan creek mall in Desmoines, which was quite interesting/expensive. I also had my senior pics earlier this week and that went well enough. We did a whole bunch of scenes/outfit changes that ranged from shorts and a hoodie while standing in the middle of a waterfall, to shirtless with a cowboy hat, while holding a guitar over my back. Haha anyway it was cool, and I should get my proof's back in a day or two, so I'll probably end up posting a couple of them. I've been workin a lot lately, which is always kind of bittersweet, because work can be fun sometimes, and other times suck royally, but the paycheck is always a good thing, and the more I work the bigger it is. Oh, BTW, the word of the day is hooberschnaups, just because it sounds really cool. I don't have any idea what it means, but it kinda sounds german or something, which is a crazy language. Thats it for me then, I'll post again some time soon when I get a bit of time and I am feeling motivated...
