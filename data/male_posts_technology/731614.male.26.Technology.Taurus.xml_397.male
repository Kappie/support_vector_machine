Yeah, this isn't like that.  I mean, it was purely a coincidence that I happened to be standing outside the lovely Hampton Beach Casino when Tommy stepped off his tour bus.     Also, please note that I am not one of the acid-wash jean clad girls in the following picture, and not because I'm afraid of heights, and not because I was already in his room hiding in the bathtub, but because I do not love Tommy in such a way that would necessitate climbing in his window to ask him to sign my shoe.         Anything else you might hear is a complete fabrication.  Especially if Tommy tells you himself and he mentions a stuffed bunny and a restraining order.
