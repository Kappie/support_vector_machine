Alternative application functions are launched based on the  length of time an application button is pressed. A default function for an  application is launched if the button is pressed for a short, i.e., normal,  period of time. An alternative function of the application is launched if the  button is pressed for a long, (e.g., at least one second), period of time. Still  another function can be launched if the application button is pressed multiple  times within a short period of time, e.g., double click.
