Just as I turn Steve is introducing a harmonica player who's played w/ Ringo Starr, and has a full-time gig at some casino in Vegas so of course like him I'm assuming he's an older, paid his dues musician. To both mine and Steve's surprise turns out it's a 10 year old kid. Steve jokes with him as he does with all of his contestants and then lets him play. Now having heard some pretty good jazz and blues harmonica players in my (albeit still early) day, but this freakin' kid was amazing. And I don't think it was just because he was 10, he was legit and I was impressed. So he finishes and the crowd goes nuts, and he proceeds to teach Steve how to play a few notes which of course the crowd eats up. Then Steve makes a joke like "hold on let me show you how to really play"..camera cut stage left, and out walks none other than Stevie Wonder.     They found out that Stevie Wonder is one of the kids idols, so Steve called in a favor to surprise the kid. The jammed together singing and playing the harmonica and it was just fantastic and I found myself thinking.. You know there aren't many music "artists" today who would do that. I use the term "artists" loosely because frankly most of the musicians today are so corporate cookie-cutter and watered down they're more like show entertainers than artists really, and the meaning is completely different.     Back in the day music was about the love of the music, feeling behind the music, music that made YOU feel, and appreciating the people who religiously followed you. Now it's pretty much about two things, but one major thing...marketing, and money. The actual talent isn't what it used to be plain and simple. And the connection with the fans certain isn't there like it was either. Stevie Wonder is getting up there in age, so props to Stevie for making a kids dream come true, and showing everyone else what a real artist, and a real human being should be.
