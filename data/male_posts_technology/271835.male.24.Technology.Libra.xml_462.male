All well and good but I believe Friday should be used more productively so here is New Links Friday 10 - 10 Spectrum (or Timex if you're American) games for you to play in your browser. Yay.     urlLink Ant Attack     urlLink Batty     urlLink Chaos     urlLink Chuckie Egg     urlLink Elite  (that's the last we'll see of Bungers)    urlLink Manic Miner     urlLink Jet Set Willy     urlLink Lords of Midnight     urlLink Scuba Dive     urlLink Zynaps     There are other Spectrum games to play at the homesite of  urlLink Jasper , a Speccy emulator.  For all the Spectrum stuff you could wobble a  urlLink memory expansion pack  at check out  urlLink World Of Spectrum  which has emulators, more games (but none by  urlLink Ultimate !),  urlLink programming  documentation,  urlLink manuals  and lots of other stuff.  urlLink Planet Sinclair  has a lot of information on Sinclair products and is a good read.    You may also want to read reviews of the games (or just relive your youth!) in  urlLink Crash  or  urlLink Your Sinclair .     All hail the mighty  urlLink Clive .    Ooh look - 10 links to games, 10 various other  bits of linkage + the main link to the Friday 5 site makes erm... 21. Result.
