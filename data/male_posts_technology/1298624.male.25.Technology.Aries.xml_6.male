I usually pick up things pretty quickly, but this, I don't know. I haven't won one game since I got it, and the only game I've won was when Paul was right there beside me, helping me out from getting my ass kicked! I know I'll get better (I hope), but how long should it take?! I guess I'm just impatient.   Janet hasn't called me yet. I guess she called my parents and told them they were here. I don't know, I wasn't too interested. I haven't been as enthusiastic about studying my N+ stuff recently. Maybe it's because I'm in a chapter right now where it's EXTREMELY boring. Installing network devices. Like I don't know how to do that.   I'll come help you in the backyard sometime, honey :)
