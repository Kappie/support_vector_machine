I am interested in anything so email me interesting stuf on technology, physics etc. . . warining my english sux! /warning  . I spent quite some time today searching the net for info on carbon fiber materials. Amazingly enough, quite some people in the states make racing bicycles using these materials  .Prices are quite elevated: $5+ for a yard of carbon fiber cloth about 6 inches wide ... Plus the materials you need to do the job (epoxy et al). Phew ! No wonder they charge so much for stuf made by CF ... I intend to try locating such stuf in my country. i would like to build things from it. A small car chasis would be one, for sure, but that would cost quite a bit. hmmm... Let's see ... Errr... nope, can't calculate how much. over  2k5 (that's $3k) for sure ...
