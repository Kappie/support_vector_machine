We have all been on a vacation to Intergalaxia Vogun Minor Beta. That's right y'all, the Toaster Files has hit the intergalactic ether-net big time!!!   It all started a long time ago, in an ether-net receiving station in a galaxy far far away. It appears that this 'Ether-net' thingy can not only travel over mind boggling intergalactic distances in the time it takes for a juggernaut truck to grind a small infant deer into the tarmac, but it can also traverse quantum time physics too! Who would have believed it?!  So as I was saying, it seems that whilst us lot have been writing and posting about our very meagre, manic little lives and other pornographic, funny, pictorial stuff; the whole thing has also been posting far, far out to space. Inadvertently whilst our posts have been cruising through space, they have also travelled through time, hence being how they were intercepted by the peaceful beings on the planet Intergalaxia Vogun Minor Beta a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.  Now, these apparently  'Peaceful' beings, were utterly oblivious to any knowledge of anything outside their own atmosphere! The fact that they had created an ether-net is purely coincidental! And the fact that it too broadcasted outside their own world without them even knowing about it (due to the fact that they did not know anything about anything outside their own being) and subsequently was received by another peaceful race on a planet called Uranusoryourfaceicanttell, which then sparked an immediate call for total war with the senders of the broadcast which they received from Intergalaxia Vogun Minor Beta.  Once these, lets call them IVMBs because I cannot be arsed to write 'Intergalaxia Vogun Minor Beta' every time I want to mention Intergalaxia Vogun Minor Beta! Anyway, once these IVMBs discovered that they had received our posts from somewhere outside of their planet, they promptly and miraculously created spaceships purely by accident out of washing down bottles and unsticky duct tape!! Hah, what are the chances??!!!!  So, totally by curiosity the IVMBs travelled out into space to see what it was like, navigating their way by rolling things which looked amazingly like, but weren't, smarties on an uneven surface! In fact these things which looked amazingly like, but weren't, smarties, were in actual fact small killer bugs that completely wiped out the inhabitants of three star systems that the IVMBs didn't even realize they had passed!!!!!   And so it came to pass that by some act of some sadistic god the IVMBs encountered their hunters, the inhabitants of Uranusoryourfaceicanttell and a fierce and bloody battle commenced. Oh did I mention that whilst the IVMBs accidently built their spaceships, they also accidently created weapons of mass galactic destruction too by crossbreeding biorganic materials with really sharp forks!!  And so the battles raged between these two forces for millennia, exhausting all natural resources in whatever area they pitched their wars. This unfortunately led to a universally galactic greenhouse effect, that coincidental the small minded and obstinate beings on a crappy little planet called 'Earth' believed to be due to their inept ability to create a world friendly civilization!  Now, after much conflict, the IVMBs decided to actually find out why the people from Uranusoryourfaceicanttell had waged war with them. Once they found out that it was due to a bunch of pornographic, funny, pictorial posts that had been broadcast from their planet purely by mistake (due to the fact that they had known nothing about the ether-net they had been unfortunate enough to create purely coincidentally on their planet) they were obviously curious as to where these broadcasts had come from, as they knew that the broadcasts had not knowingly come from them!  And so they eventually travelled through space and time to our present day and came in search of this so called 'Toaster Files'. When they eventually tracked us down a few months ago, they decided to present themselves to us. Now they didn't know exactly what we looked like so they decided to come to us in a variation of forms, which for some inexplicable reason meant that they looked exactly like an old human looking hermetic in brown robes, accompanied by a whiney little human looking teenager, a egotistical tightly dressed rouge trader, his hair ridden sidekick, oh and a couple of gay robots.  They gather the entire TF Crew at Toasters house and immediately beamed us their spaceships, replacing us with automaton droids that would take our place till our return! Once on their ships they explained their history and about their big predicament with the people of Uranusoryourfaceicanttell to us and we were obviously moved by the story. We vowed to help the IVMBs with their problems and travelled through time and space.  When we arrived back in their time we fought in the name of 'The Mighty Bean', and many bloody, sweaty, boozy engagements incurred. It is a pure coincidence that the people of Uranusoryourfaceicanttell looked like some sort of space elf!! And that their symbol for war was to hold up their hands and perform some sort of 2:1:2 formation with their fingers.  Anyway I don't want to write more than a few little paragraphs about this so lets just say that the TF Crew kicked the Uracunt (that's what we called the people of Uranusoryourfaceicanttell for short) peoples asses well and proper!!! I mean sure we had a few close shaves and sure we didn't all make it out in one piece, for instance Custard is still in hospital recovering!!! He need a whole new set lower spinal cords and a new middle toe on each foot, other than that he has never been better, and I am sure he will post all about it when he gets out.  Now, unfortunately Toaster, Dougal, Kirk and Custard all lost or broke their little Nokia photo phones or else we might have some outrageous photographs for you all to see but never mind, I am sure you all believe us.....DON'T YOU!!!!..???
