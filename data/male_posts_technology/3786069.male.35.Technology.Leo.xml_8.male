This is by far to this point the most challenging part of this trip. Separating from my family. Inara and I have been apart before but this will definitely take our relationship to the limit. I guess the old adage applies here “the longer the wait the sweeter the wine”.  So after several days of visits, dinners and entertainment here I am writing my first log entry, after leaving San Diego, on the plane at 30,000 feet over who knows where headed toward El Paso, Texas...yeeee hawww! One note here; we never left the airport (meaning went outside) when we landed and changed planes in Phoenix but just the little temperature we were exposed to made me think about scorching heat that lays in front of me. I looked at the weather forecast and saw El Paso is no oasis but compared to the Middle East it probably might as well be one.  The day has come to a close and I’m here at the CRC dormitory. Didn’t stay at the Fort Bliss Inn as I originally intended. It was suggested that life would be so much easier to stay in the dorm. Plus I’ll be saving $$$.  Accommodation aren’t as bad as I was led to believe. The only things I need to note here is that the common areas could use a little clean up (i.e. garbage cans overflowing, trash on the tables and the disrepair of the furniture). The other is, and Sweetie I know you won’t like this, the occasional cockroach scampering across the floor. But I think it’ll be manageable for a week or so.  I miss my wife so much but I know that this is a big opportunity we both need. After this we will have such a have such a wonderful time together, it will be fantastic. I’ll see you in my dreams sweetie.
