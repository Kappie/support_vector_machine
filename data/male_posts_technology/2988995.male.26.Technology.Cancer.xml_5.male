We often believe that it is the goal that defines the journey, but soon we realise that it is the other way around.As we motor along we come to forks , where we make decisions , we see things that change us forever and soon we question the goal.Sometime the desire to achieve is reinforced , frequently the goal mutates and adopts different forms.  I sat on this motorcycle of eductaion , the only one my family had and followed the trails my cousins had blazed.i kept thinking of what makes my bike move and how I can move it faster. Suddenly i met this guy who sold his bike and with a little more money bought a car. I realised this is a more comfortable way to travel.Some time , some where along this path I will be a guy who makes and sells things.  I will also be someone who writes funny stories based on all the people I meet and those untold anecdotes that made my journey. I know I will still have to keep riding  , no matter how much my back aches , no matter how many days turn into dark long nights.though i am impatient and anxious and though I often compare others bikes I tell myself though they will reach faster , it is not the goal that is important but the Journey ..........
