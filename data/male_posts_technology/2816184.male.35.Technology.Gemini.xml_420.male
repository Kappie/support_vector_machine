It's always somthing for my wife, something for my son, never anything for me.  I read in my horoscope this week that I'll be "getting rid of something I no longer need".  I fear that this means any sort of life or personal interests I ever had.  *sigh*  And I just wish I could have a decent night's sleep!  I keep having these royally screwed up dreams.  I have no clue where they came from or why I'm having them, but they just keep me from having a decent sleep!  By the time I drag my ass home at night I'm just about ready to nod off at the wheel....  Now it's home for another weekend of slaving to the family.  Well, only 20 years until my son's old enough to be out on his own...maybe then I'll have a chance to breathe for myself.
