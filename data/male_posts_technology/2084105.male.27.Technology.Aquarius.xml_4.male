Despite being learn√©d and amusing, it may come as a surprise to none of you to learn that Ms Toksvig is a Woman who Wears Sensible Shoes.  Those amoung of us of a more bent bent, or indeed with a generically queer view on life, may rue the fact that there aren't many ghey heros.  Gay icons we have aplenty - what with Geri Haliwell and Steps and Whitney Houston and Cher and  , one can barely turn on a radio station without double-clicking accidentally.  But these are not heroes of gaydom.  When I think of gay heroes, I think of people who's very impact on history was in some way tied to their assertion of their sexuality, or indeed their refusal to deny their sexuality.  I think the reason there are so few is that the modern gay has only really existed for less that 30 years.  We haven't really built up a pantheon of heros yet.  And yet a few names spring to mind.  One can almost not start the list by mentioning Oscar Wilde.  "The love which dare not speak it's name" was his undoing - he said what he believed and he suffered for it.  He was a man ahead of his time, and he might just have gotten away with it if he'd been born just 100 years later.  Then, just last week we remembered the death of one of my all time heros, Alan Turing.  Computer visionary extraordinaire, he eventually committed suicide because of the way society treated him, a homosexual.  He never denied his sexuality, and forcing him to take female hormones was the ultimate undoing of someone who changed the face of the world.  (The machine you're reading this on is a universal turing machine!)  Quentin Crisp is another person of whom I think, a-ha, Hero.  He said that he could only live life true to himself, and if his life impacted society then it was all the better.  Certainly, Quentin Crisp played a role in the change of attitude towards homosexuality which started in the 1960s; his book "The Naked Civil Servant" started people talking about gay people like they were human.  His interview with Parkinson remains a classic: "People would say to me, 'what are you meant to be, a man or a woman?'  And I would say, 'why what do you have in mind?'".  Then there are those "media stars" which everyone knows is gay, but who, frankly didn't do much about it.  The Frankie Howerds, the Kenneth Williams, the Noel Cowards.  Yes, they were gay, but they were products of their time, and not, if one is completely honest, heroic about much at all.  That is not to say that one castigates these people in anyway - they contributed to gay identity, but not so much by what they did as what they didn't do.  The combination of a slightly dodgy, extremely camp roman slave combined with the polari wit of Julian and Sandy could be argued to form the basis of the modern gay stereotype, but I am not convinced it contributes much to the gay identity.  Who do we have today?  Boy George - pass.  Graham Norton - ground breaking TV, but heroic?  Peter Tatchell - oh boy yes, even if I don't always agree with him.  They do all seems to be men though :-/  And this is, stunningly, where Ms Toksvig stands out.  Quietly, yet assertively, sapphic, Sandi lives with her (female!) partner, and her child, plus, I am led to believe, several animals of varying varieties.  Well known for her appearances on such televisual highlights as Through The Keyhole, Call My Bluff and Whose Line Is It Anyway, I remember larfing at Sandi even before I knew what a lesbian was!  Sandi now has a daily show on LBC, on air and online between 1200 and 1400 daily.    And frankly, it is the campest, gayest show on talk radio.  Yes, there are other gay people who have shows, but they don't seem to be quite as comfortable with their identity as Sandi is.  Her sexuality is never an issue; it's part of who she is and part of her personality that is projected across the airwaves.  She is, I believe, the epitome of the gay hero for the modern generation.  Able to switch from serious (she seethes at the mention of Mr Ronsonol as a politician) to hilarious at the touch of a button, she projects a positive, healthy image of what being gay means.  Which is that it's perfectly normal and frankly we just wish sometimes that we could just get on with it[1].  And that, I am sure Sandi would agree, would be a very fine thing indeed.
