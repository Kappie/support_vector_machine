All in all a pretty normal week:)  I haven't turned on my computer at home since monday morning. so hopefully the electric will be less next month. :) Anyway, 1 week till LOTR. I'm pretty damn stoked.  Saw, Ocean's 11 last weekend, twice. Do you think I liked it? I thought it was good, but there were some times when I knew what was happening. Well, Jarred is trying to convince me to become a screenwriter, so maybe I'll do that. It sounds like a fun job.  Peace
