So the new story is that without a scroll wheel I'm having to relearn all my habits so my productivity had practically dropped through the floor.  "A mouse makes that much of a difference?" you ask? Yeah, when your job is Internet Recruiting and surfing the web all day, every day. Now stop cutting in will ya?  Anyways, I used this to go to my manager to say "hey this mouse licks bag - can't I just go buy one and expense it?"  Well yes, I got the go ahead on that, but get this - turns out this ugly piece of garbage with 3 buttons and no scroll wheel cost them... *drum roll* $175!! (CAD) WHAT!? For that kind of money I could've gotten myself a wireless, 15 button, gold plated mouse that'll tell me when I need to take a piss just by the temperature of my palm.  So yea, to top it off, apparently my area can't send the mouse back and get a refund on it because it would cost almost as much to return it to this stupid place they got it from.  I nominate  urlLink Contour Design  as the biggest fucking rip off company in the world.
