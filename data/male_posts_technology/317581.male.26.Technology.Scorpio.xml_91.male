But then sometimes people really piss me off, and my feeling can't really be better expressed than, "You shit ass motherfucker!"  Hmm... are there any words that maybe I could make cuss words? Like "hankering"... hmm...  Speaking of hankering... I've had a hankering for Thai food a lot recently... and it's been like 15 days since my last thai fix, and I want to have like 3 different thai dishes which means I have to go 3 times to the thai restaurant... I tell you my palate is insatiable:)  People don't say "hankering" any more, how weird is that? also, why do people no longer say, "2 legit, 2 legit 2 quit"?  mmm... Hammer:)
