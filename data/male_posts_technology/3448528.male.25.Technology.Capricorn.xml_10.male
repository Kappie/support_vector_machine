It seems to me that this  will be an opportunity to get some more bike miles in ;-)    So now my quest is on for a nice bike. One that is cheap, yet also conforms closest to my  urlLink ideal . I'm looking for a bike that has splatter guards and a place to store stuff on the bike, such as a raincoat.  But, the closest thing ive seen that i would be able to afford is some random  urlLink POS bike from walmart . I'm going to have to see if i can find a used bike from somewhere around here.    The problem though is that most bikes are mountain bikes, because they are "cool". I like mountain bikes, but if i have to go to work while its raining, i don't want to get a trail of dirt on my back.  If you have any suggestions, lemme know via comments.... (not expecting any)
