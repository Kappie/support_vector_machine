This figure represents how real a threat identity theft or system corruption is for users,"    - Matt Cobb, EarthLink's vice president of core applications.    "According to statistics from e-mail security firm MessageLabs (  urlLink  www.messagelabs.com     ), 76 per cent of all global e-mail traffic in May 2004 was classified as spam.."    - silicon.com news      What do you think the world is coming to with this junk that HUMAN BEINGS are making??  Is there a one-stop all in one solution to these problems?  No - and any one-stop fix-all would probably be out-dated and obsolete far too quick for the money you would be spending on such a system.  Is all hope lost?  Have the internet pirates and thieves won this battle?  Perhaps to a particular point they have, and that will change.      "Your best defence, the companies say, is to employ anti-spyware programmes on your machine."     - silicon.com news   This statement I would have to say is not entirely true, atleast when coming at the angle of all the possible threats a PC could get...but we know that not all of it is because of spyware.  However, the fact is that spyware can still get through even with these programs installed.  Worse yet, many of those programs advertised to remove and protect from spyware are actually deceptive forms of spyware - which usually invite more onto your machine.   What you ought to do is inform yourself of the best security measures known to the best geeks in the biz.  These are readily available and usually at no cost at all-except your time to learn.  EDUCATING YOURSELF is the best way-not assuming that one or even a few programs make you safe.  Here's what to do and what not to do.    The DO List:     Install  urlLink Spybot Search  Destroy ,  urlLink Ad-Aware ,  urlLink SpywareGuard ,  urlLink SpywareBlaster , and an anti virus application.  Read the  urlLink Parasite Fight  page, the  urlLink Dealing with Unwanted Spyware and Parasites page ,  urlLink Black Viper's Windows XP Home and Pro Service Configurations  page.  Keep your anti virus updated REGULARLY.  Keep your spyware protection software updated REGULARLY.  Keep WINDOWS updated REGULARLY-If you do not know how, click Tools in I.E., then click on Windows Update.  A link to the Microsoft Windows Update site is also on the Start menu either on the main list, or under Programs or All Programs depending on your version.  For more protection but, with some annoyances like not being able to access sites like ebay, read the  urlLink Blocking Unwanted Parasites with a Hosts File  page.  Use some sort of a FIREWALL...the better the firewall the better the protection.     The DON'T List:     Do  NOT  "click here to download the best spyware blocker and removal tool"!!  Do  NOT  assume you're safe just installing some programs.. ( DO  READ THE PAGES ABOVE)  Do  NOT  open every attachment you get in email - even if its from a friend!  Do  NOT  signup for receiving news or emails from "our partners" when filling out web forms! - ( DO  LOOK AT THE FINE PRINT!)  Do  NOT  ever allow software for downloading and sharing copyrighted music illegally to be installed.  There is a REASON these kind of programs are FREE-besides, should you be partaking in something unethical?  There are plenty of good ways to buy music downloads at good prices...like the new  urlLink Napster .  Do  NOT  list your email address publicly ESPECIALLY on a web site - no matter how trusted it is.  If you need to be contacted by email and need to list an address somewhere, take the time to have a free alternate account somewhere like Yahoo or Hotmail that you can filter the junk with but still access messages that might accidentally be considered spam.  You can always change your address or make new accounts - so use these instead of your real address.  Do  NOT  choose predictable addresses if you can help it!  Avoid the following and anything else that might be in a dictionary: webmaster@, admin@, [words in domain name]@, [common names]@, [common roles]@.  A good bet would be to use initials-but not by themselves.  Do  NOT  do all this and then figure it is enough a year from now.     The Maybe DO List:      Get more information than I have here.   Consider disabling your internet connection when using it isn't necessary.  Consider not having an internet connection at all on your important windows PCs if you can't keep them secure.  I hope that this article becomes a resource for you.  My experience is that this stuff happens so easily to even cautious and experienced people.  I have reformatted a computer and less than one week of letting the customer have it back, they called complaining that similar problems (pop-up ads, freezing or slow computer) were happening!  I even set up the above programs with complete updates all the way around.  Just educate yourself people-you can do it.  Be blessed.
