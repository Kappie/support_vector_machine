It's a radical new approach to chicks, but it's one that I haven't tried-- yet one that seems to work for the JD's and the Boz's of the world.   What's up with the new trend of wearing collars up on knit golf shirts? Also, who decided that Nantucket Reds and turquoise colored pants were a good idea?   F it. Collars up.
