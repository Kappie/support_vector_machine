A very interesting interview, i didn't imagine that we think so much alike about music and art. Selected Thurston's quote: "I want to write a song, record it, and throw it out for download. Do that for a half-year, and then compile it for the CD buyers." A must-read. 
 Lydia Lunch -- an alternative (ahem) singer, collaborated with  urlLink Sonic Youth  on two songs, co-writing "Marilyn Moore" and sharing vocals with Thurston on "Death Valley '69".
