I am just thinking with so much that are happening now....I just reconsider my what mom said about doing something for the coming month since my internship is forwarded to the next month which gives me time to move and revising my stuff.  My mom told me to wake up, do something and I asked what..to do ...? She said...well if your church gott some program to do ...go and do instead of sitting down and grow fungus . And I thought WOW ! Cool!/  When i 1st accepted Christ , my parents were against it totally , persecution would come up as often as you eat your meals. Furs would fly each time i said a prayer, or read the bible or mentioned anything to do with Christ. I served with Hope of God that time in my college years in Inti College Malaysia and with the fact I am serving agressively in the area of cell, evangelism, misssion and stuff, i got distracted from my studies and therefore not showing a good example which leads to extra admonishing , persecutions and the whole works.   Friends would start to notice the very socialble person who would go the extra miles for friends suddenly changed to a fanatic..Jesus Freak . That is so cool back then and being a young Christian, I am all the more excited with everything that has to do with Christ.  But when i started my serving in SIBKL, the idea of serving God have taken a different turn and show a different side , Ps Chew mentioned that serving is not an act, a holy missions but a lifestyle very much like worship...In fact serving and worship comes hand in hand...with you doing currently what you are doing except with extra fervour and Christlike attitude. That came to me as a revelation and even as I actively do what i do , i noticed that studying is no longer hard...in fact i have learned to enjoy it with the ocassional stressing moments....   In fact i have seen serving is not another part of my walk with God ...it is my walk with God...it is an opportunity for Christ to work in me and I in Him, to do all things. Apart from it , I can do nothing. What really matters is that because serving in SIBKL , have been very encouraging, my friends and family have taken a different attitude towards serving and being a Christian. It have reinforced my principles and the way i act around them.   Just recently my project partner Lee SIok Chye, have accepted the Lord and on the way to become baptised and it never ceases to amaze me. I have prayed to God to touch him even as we started to become good friends as we started our 10 month project. Since then he have come to accept the fact most of the time i have given is to God. But it wasn't my lifestyle.... In fact God have touched SIok CHye is a totally different way far from what i have expected.  During a trip to our graduate training seminar in Perth , SIok Chye have visited his uncle's church in Perth. His uncle, a fervour christian, gave him a bible as well as share Christ by showing him scriptures, the people , and things . As a farewell gift, his uncle gave him a set of tapes from Hong Kong pastors. During this sessions, different pastors from Hong kong would stress on different part of life and the trials that they go through and throughout the entire time...it have been loadful of anecdotes and jokes made.  It was at this time, God have slowly planted the seed and slowly with the people God have called to service from the KL Baptist Church, they took him through cell, services and sharing that eventually lead him to Christ.  So from my view, it is not I , that made the impact on SIok Chye, it is God who have lead him to God. God , even from the Word didn't just showed His example on earth but also from His Throne. And I am truly awed even at the miraculous ways He have in His Sleeves ...to reach to His People.  I am now even more challenged to share God with other people and to lead them to Christ,  Even God is doing the command that He have left and indeed He is God over His words.....SO i challenge you today.,,if God is doing His own Commandments,,,,what the heck are we doing here reading my blog?  Go therefore and make diciples of all nations, baptisizing them in the name of the Father, the son and the Holy Spirit , in Judea, Simeria and the to the ends of the Earth  Amen.
