Why are we taking a "break"? I guess that we have both become very frustrated with everything around us and we've been taking it out on each other. However I'm still very much in love with susan and I would hate for this to be the end I do have my doubts on wether this relationship will continue though. When Susan came over to tell me that she wanted to take a break she allready had all my stuff from her place packed and in her car. So it was a foregone conclusion for her. There are other things that also lead me to doubt our future together however I don't think this is the place or time to talk about them. So I'm fucking bummed about the whole situation. I could use some advice if anyone with knowledge about relationships has any to offer please e-mail me by clicking on the contact button.
