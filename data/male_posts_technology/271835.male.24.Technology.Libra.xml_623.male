The premise of that one is that Bush will pull some surprise move in October which will jack up his popularity allowing himself to swindle the election for a second time. The reader is invited to predict what the event will be.  The  urlLink Osama Bin Lotto  site has decided the event is the capture of Bin Laden. The unknown factor which the reader has to decide on is when will the capture be announced. Note that is the date of the announcement and not the capture itself.   via  urlLink Hal's Stoopid Links
