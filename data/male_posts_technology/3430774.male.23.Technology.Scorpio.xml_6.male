Well, pretty nice designed place and facilities but of course it charged expensively! The service that our company got is call,  Colocation Service . It was a new term for me but after gone thru its official website, learn one or two "KiloBytes" of knowledge about Colocation.  urlLink http://nttverio.com/en_US/index.cfm  A website that will definitely give you more information about it. :P NTT ensures you 4 important criterias, The Quality in terms of info communications, The Security in terms of all type of problems, The Operation in terms of startup and restructuring, and The Low Cost Investment.       urlLink           Btw, here is the MMU open ceremony photo gallery:     urlLink http://www.anr.org/web/html/archive/old/html/output/photo/PN/mmumenu.htm
