My ultimate goals are for 1,000 words written on work days that I write, 2,000 for off days, and an hour at the gym. Of course, I don't like going to the gym, so I don't think I'll push that goal for awhile.  Actually, my ultimate goals are so far away they don't bear mentioning. For now I want to focus on keeping the momentum on my daily writing, marketing the short stories that I've already finished, and finding a job slightly less pathetic that the one I have now. And I need to work on my levitating.
