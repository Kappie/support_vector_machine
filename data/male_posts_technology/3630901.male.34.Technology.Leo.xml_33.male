There were wood chips covering the wall, hiding it. The sky looked ominous, like immediately before a summer thunderstorm, or immediately after. The wall stretched down to infinity, down a hill, into the ocean, but it was not all covered with the wood, just the part near the driveway. My brother was about to sweep off the wall and I asked what he was doing - the wood chips looked good. He said it would be better to sweep it off and maybe paint something on the wall. I commented to S, sometimes he's such an asshole. Then I reflect on how my brother always got the girl that I was interested in. She was my friend, dammit. We'd been friends for years, and I really felt a lot of love for her, even though she was in a relationship with my brother. I moved away from the wall, as the brother proceded to sweep it. I was on the deck / porch of a house and I asked S to come talk to me. I was about to tell her that I wished she were with me, when I woke up and realized that she is already with me.
