Nevermind, but while we're on the subject of  urlLink Arnolds , let's talk a little bit about this California recall vote.  <Dr. Evil>Honestly people, how is this not a slap in the face of democracy everywhere?</Dr. Evil>  If you don't know the back story,  urlLink Gray Davis , the current sitting governor of California is under fire.  Despite being elected to office twice (most recently in the 2002 election), Davis' opponents were unhappy enough to circulate a petition requesting a recall vote.  They obtained over 1.6 million signatures, so we now get to watch a highly rediculous election this coming October.
 
 Now, California does not have an official impeachment procedure.  Actually, I guess you can call this current circus their version of an impeachment.  Basically, a very small minority of the registered voters can ask for a "do-over" if they are unhappy with the outcome of an election.  If you do the math, the 1.6 million signatures is less than 5% of the roughly 33 million people in the state ( urlLink according to 2000 US census data ).  Even worse than the fact that it only took 5% of the populate to recall Davis is what it takes for Davis to successfully defend his position; He  MUST  receive more than 50% of the vote to stay in office.  If he gets even a hair under 50%, even if he receives the  urlLink simple majority  of the vote, even if the next highest vote total is 5%, Gray Davis loses the election.
 
 Now,  urlLink according to CNN , only 29% of the voters are willing to keep Davis in office.  The second highest vote total is 22%, garnered by Davis' Lieutenant Governor, Cruz Bustamante.  This doesn't bode well for Davis' career.  That's fine.  I don't necessarily understand all that has gone on in California during the past year.  I know that California's economy was heavily dependent on Tech Companies, and I'm sure that the tech burst hurt Silicon Valley and the overall California job market.  I also know they've had problems with energy and the environment.  I'm not here to defend Gray Davis as a politician.  I'm here to say that this recall procedure is nothing short of anti-democratic.  If this recall succeeds, and the current numbers suggest that it will, it will become a prime example of exactly what our founding fathers feared most: the overwhelming minority.
 
 Assuredly,  urlLink Alexander Hamilton  was speaking of the operations of the Federal government when he wrote of "factions" (or special interest groups in modern terminology) in The  urlLink Federalist Papers  number  urlLink 10 .  In his paper, Hamilton describes two ways to control factions, or groups of people who are united under a common belief that is opposed to the well-being of the community at large.  You can either remove the causes for the faction or you can limit the damage it can do.  Hamilton elects for the latter because, "If a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may convulse the society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the Constitution."
 
 Unfortunately, the current system of recall in the  urlLink State of California  does not allow for this.  It only takes 5% of the population to request the recall and doesn't even require a simple majority to remove the standing governor.  There's nothing wrong with removing a poorly performing governor.  There's nothing wrong with electing an action movie star to replace him.  There is something drastically wrong if a state allows a small minority to overrule what the majority has already decided.  That is anti-democratic, and anti-American.
