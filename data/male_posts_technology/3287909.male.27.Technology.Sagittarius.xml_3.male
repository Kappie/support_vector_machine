Comments:  a)Before joining the army i had a company setup with 3 more associates. When i was called for duty they broke up the company and started their own. They took most of my stuff with them. Gradually i took everything back now that my service is reaching the end (no fights or anything, we are ok, just don't do business together any more). My Fax machine and a few Photoshop PSDs is what remains to be retrieved which i hope to do right now.  b)My girlfriend bought a used 20 years old Zastava Yugo (Yugoslavian cars with Fiat internals). She intends to get used to driving with it. Although she has her license many years now, she has, virtually, no driving experience. A few days ago, while she was driving around our home looking for a place to park, vapor came out of the hood. Verdict : destroyed thermostat. Lucky we didn't "burn" the poor engine ... I will buy a couple of these AND install a bypass switch for the ventilator so as not to have any such trouble again.  c)A router gone bananas dialed to the internet all day for a couple of months charging a client about 2k. He canceled the phone line and now that the router is fixed he ordered the line again. My task is to do the final check and make sure all is ok.  d)Emailing an update is no big deal ... The problem is that i have to test it first and that is a BORING thing to do ...
