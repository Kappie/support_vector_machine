I have just sprung an interest in sprites (video game character graphics) i just made a thing where i can design them.....its called graph paper. Pixel art will probably keep me occupied at school. Its really fun! Today i will hopefully get started on my first drawing most likely to be Uchiha Sasuke from naruto.  Nothing else is interesting.......
