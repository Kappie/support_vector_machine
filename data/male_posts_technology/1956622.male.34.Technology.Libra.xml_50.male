I asked her what she wanted for her birthday and she told me candy, ice cream, something pink....So I asked her about toys...so she said she wanted a doctor kit, stuffed animals, books, and a big pool for her and her daddy.  I told her we would BBQ and stuff when she got here and she said I want mommy to cook.  I said I did not think that mommy would be here cooking it would be daddy cooking.  She then said she wanted a mermaid for her birthday as well.  Not sure if I can come up with a mermaid   :)    Karissa had to go potty and   FS   was in the bathroom.  I am not sure why it makes me so pissed off to hear   FS's   voice but it does.    On another note the earth moved and the seas shook because   SFW   agreed to the terms of Karissa coming down and staying here.  Of course she has not seen the other paperwork yet!   :)
