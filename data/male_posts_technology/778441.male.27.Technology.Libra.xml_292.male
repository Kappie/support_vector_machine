The Big Blue has maintained a dignified silence through the ordeal as lots of other wannabes have jumped on the bandwagon set rolling by SCO.  Now  urlLink IBM has decided not to bow to SCO threats  as it has released a press statement that is short and to the point. IBM's Unix license is irrevocable, perpetual and fully paid up. It cannot be terminated. This matter will eventually be resolved in the normal legal process. Touché!
