But then i will not leave u all without sharing what i did for the past two weeks.  first and foremost, i went to a concert. Yes, Pandit Jasraj and L. Subramaniam's concert. I struck with one beautiful feeling. Have u people heard an instrument singing a song, or have u heard anybody's voice echoing like an instrument? Yes, i did. L.subramaniam is a renowned violinist and in his play of bow, u can hear the song just as its being sung. To be frank, i dint even know the verses, but i was carried over by the first Melancholy of his performance. His work was getting improved as it usually happens in any concert in the most unusual manner. Pandit JAsraj's voice toh, was so beautifully orchestrating with the thugs and thumps of Tabela and other instruments and at one point, they both merged and made me feel the oneness too. Both are stalwarts in their domain, Jasraj in hindustani vocal and L.Subramaniam an international violinist.   The whole concert was divided into 3 sections where in first panditji perfromed, then L. Subramaniam and then their most awaited "JugalBandhi". JugalBandhi is nothing but, two different artists performing together simultaneously but in sync.   I am already mesmerised by Pandit's voice. First I happened to listen to Panditji's voice in his Mandukya Upanishad casette. It was the first avenue for me in Hindustani music and i was spell bound when i listened to his voice. It is liquid gold glowing all the way it goes. I was infact happy to have made acquainted myself to Devotional music thru' such a rich voice, rendition and hymns.   There are some voices which sound different in different medias, esp it differs between live and recorded one. but great people's voices are always alike and i experienced it live there in that concert. He was fully vibrating with life of music and though he was turning 75 years, his voice is still the same without any haircrack.   They way both were enjoying themselves made the audience to enjoy them also along with music. Panditji has got a smiling face and so he was in full smile after every line..... And so after every play of bow, L.S. also, though looks resolute, gave a mild smile unique but marvellous by its own. When the show was over, audiences couldnot resist themselves and they gave a standing ovation and cried for once more. Never have i seen such a response from audience. Infact when they were carried away by the artists and they lauded it with claps, even it was musical.   And to our surprise, after sometime, it was S.M.Krishna who was amongst us enjoying the show.  Hei i dint tell u where we sat na... When we went to the concert, the tickets were sold out and so we dint know what to do. So we waited to know any means to get inside. The concert which was about to start at 6 o clock started at 7. There were so many musical enthusiasts like us waiting outside. So the manager, made some arrangement. Yes, we were allowed to sit on the dias, just few foot away from the artists. No ticket fare too. I was amazed, since we were the first on the dias and were placed perfectly. God, All the performers and CM of the state were standing just a foot away, but since music seemed to occupy my mind , it dint strike me much at that moment. Only aftersometime, i felt how lucky we had been. good was that evening!  Rest of the events i will blog later Ranjini
