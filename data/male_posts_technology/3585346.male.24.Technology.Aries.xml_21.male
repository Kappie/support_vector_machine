As usual meeting forum guys, tonight with a few of our own guys joining for our usual Friday rounding session in OG. Fun night with my buddy and her bf, not forgetting the sound of Ferrari Modena 360 ringing in ears since last Friday night!  Sound and Look of evos and rexes are making me more high than just having sex! Just like sex best part is still about owning it and feel it while you RIDING it! Woohoo! TPs and Police are all over by the fourth round. Detour when see blinking lights! Thanks to Vern and Bud for alerting me as well. Went to Mohd Sultan, damn bloody commotion had to invite riot police to come down at MS. It's like two buses of riot policeman what the fuck? Some how or rather I have a feeling I may get into accident again if I continue this kinda routine. Mean while just be more careful and most IMPORTANT OF ALL no fast adrenaline pumping music. No Initial D. No Techno. No Trance. No Retro as well to play safe. Surveys show that more than 60% of accident resulted by fast adrenaline kicking music. And I got mine on last year APRIL FOOL DAY!  Tomorrow....I mean later is a casual dressing day to work and I dunno where the shit my Polo Ts gone to....Is not inside my big, huge and overflowing laundry bag...not inside the god damn wardrobe.....I am not gonna wear shirt for Saturdays....Is so sick....  I need lotsa lotsa lotsa money....my lessons...my car...my hobby...I wish I got part time stuff to do .....i got work! and I got work and i got work....i goooott work...laterZ
