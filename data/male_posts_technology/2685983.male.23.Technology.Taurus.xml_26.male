I wonder where they were stuck? Could it be my buttfuck home town?  Once hearing that and dancing to The Rumour for a few songs we left and I ended up having one of the weirdest and most hilarious nights of my life (I won't get into it... yet).  So the make up concert is tonight. I phoned The Pat and they said that the opening band will start at 10:30 and BT will be on about 45 minutes after. Anyway, that's fucking stupid - I have to work at 8:00. I would have to be masochistic to go. I'm usually up until about 12 anyway but I don't want to be tired tomorrow, especially since I haven't completely finished my bout with strep throat. Billy Talent= worth it? Probably not. Tonight is a mystery to me.
