Massive props to the CIA head George Tenet for saying publicly that our lying chief executive is continuing his ways.    I'm not deluded enough to believe that the Republican Congress is going to allow him to be impeached, much less indicted.  But hopefully history will show that this loser never had any business being in the White House.  I'm not saying Al Gore would have been perfect (though I'm sure he wouldn't have raped the environment like the Bush Administration has) but he certainly would have been better than the pretender on the throne.
