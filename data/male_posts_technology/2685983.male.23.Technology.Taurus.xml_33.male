I hope that I can get these days off. I'm going to fly to Vancouver because it is much cheaper than going directly to Seattle and the flight times are more flexible and much shorter. I really hope that works out and it's great that the plan is alraedy in progress. Jenn is going to be so pleased. I hope she phones from the road tnight so I can tell her.
