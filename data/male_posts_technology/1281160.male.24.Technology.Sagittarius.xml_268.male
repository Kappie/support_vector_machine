And we talked and talked and talked and talked standing at the sides in MG Road before dispersing for the day. Sunday was better. Swetha and her sister joined us and we had big lunch. And then we walked and walked and walked and walked and went with Rajesh to his friends home exactly in time for a coffee, and made our way back home late at night after a short visit to rajesh's place.   Me and Ramgopal, did what we have come to do quite often now-a-days -  Buy a book. Whether we read it is a different matter altogether, but it all adds up to the kitty. I got "Conversations with God" by Neale Donald Walsch. And started to read some of it.   Boy!! and did I love reading it...
