Then she offered me a plate - swordfish, brown rice, and asparagus.  It was all very good.  I told Mo about my recent dating activities and that I was concerned that I liked the idea of the people I was dating rather than the people themselves.  She didn't really have an answer for me on that, but that it was something I would need to stay in touch with and determine for myself.  She advised me to watch out for red flags -- to make sure that I didn't get with a woman who was controlling, and to just take note of any things about the woman that I thought were things I didn't like or things that would annoy me over time.  I think Mo wants to make sure that I don't settle for someone, just because I think that I'm not worthy of my view of the perfect woman for me.    After the session, I drove to 500 Blake Street - it was very easy to find, and just a short ride from Mo's house.  I waited just a few minutes and then S showed up.  I greeted her in the parking lot with a hug.  We went inside and got a table and some menus.  We talked a little -- I didn't really feel nervous at all -- I found her more attractive than I expected -- that her pictures didn't do her justice.  We talked and ate, and I think we were both completely honest with each other.  It was refreshing to be able to talk about anything, without fearing something.  We talked about details of some past dating relationships, her family squabbles, and some family history.  We talked freely about feelings of depression and sometimes suicide, religion, and therapy.  We have similar views on life, relationships and religion.  I just felt like we connected so well, on so many different levels.  I like how much she laughs and smiles.  They kicked us out of the dining area, sending us down to the bar, but it was a bit chilly down there.  I suggested we go outside, and we sat in my car for another hour or so, just talking.  It was getting late and I said that we should end the evening because I was getting tired.  She got out of the car and into her car, and then rolled down the window and said, hold on, I want to tell you something.  She then leaned over into my car and I leaned over and gave her a kiss.  It was a wonderful kiss and she returned it.  The only thing I didn't like is that I felt like I had cotton-mouth from talking so much.  I was probably a bit forward in asking her to go camping this weekend. I was probably also looking too far ahead when I mentioned the baseball game on 7/23 - I figured she'd be into it because she likes the Red Sox.  And it would be a good chance for her to see my kids in a casual meeting.  I drove home and couldn't stop smiling.  I went to sleep without an Ambien hoping I would sleep the whole night through.  But I woke at 3:30 - Ivy was having a nightmare and needed to be consoled.  I emailed S, and then I also realized that I forgot to do the SAP backups - so I went downstairs and VPN'd in to do that.  During the day, I received emails from M and P.  I didn't call M regarding breakfast -- I think I'll just email her and say that I've met someone.  I really like S and want to see her again already.  But I was surprised to hear back from P, and I followed through on setting up a date with her for today (Thursday) - a picnic at Boothe Memorial park in Stratford.  I'll make a salad and dressing, and buy a bottle of wine.  She's going to bring some cheese and crackers and some fruit.  After the picnic, we'll go to yoga.  S emailed me back that afternoon, including a poem that she wrote about her father when she was back in college.  Then we talked again last night - for about 2 hours.  It was probably a mistake to tell her about the date I had with P, but I didn't want to withhold the truth or lie about it.  She declined the camping trip (which is probably best).  We agreed to get together on Tuesday next week.  We both thought it was weird that we wouldn't talk for a few days after so much initial intensity.  So I decided that I'd go to her house on Friday, kind of on my way to camping.  I'm not exactly sure where it's leading -- because I'd likely stay overnight.  I don't want sex yet, and I don't think we should rush into it, because it will complicate everything.  It's weird going from getting blown off for a date and feeling so down about everything to meeting two people I felt I connected with so well in the space of a week (or 3 people if I count Lisa from Saturday).  And even after I was honest with each of them about my current life situation, they both want to see me again.  The downside with P is that she is a little older and her manner exudes it, I guess.  I remember her saying on a few occasions that we were of different generations.  She just seems more adult, for some reason.  She's also moving in a couple weeks to the White Plains, NY area, and so she'll be less accessible.  I was originally excited that she lived so close by.  The upsides with P include that I get a sense that she's very physically active -- that she enjoys bike riding - a big plus!    S has knee problems and has some difficulty and pain hiking and bike riding.  That's a bit of a downer for me.  but she communicates on the same level as me, and we have a lot of shared feelings and shared understanding.  So two more dates this week - Thursday with P and Friday with S.  I feel a little weird about the one with P.  I smile just thinking about how easily S laughs.  Of course it's possible that neither is right for me, or that I'm really not ready to be dating and/or starting a new relationship.  Lots to mull over.  Ug.   We're going to the mediator today to discuss financial stuff about the divorce.  All that stuff is still very complicated, but I'm not so worried about it any more.
