Hmm ... the redness and irritation apparently seems to be caused by one of the eye drops I was given. THey told me to throw everything away and they'll give me something else. Can tell the difference between an experienced and less experienced Dr today. The more experienced one would say, "Don't worry. It's nothing serious." "Just use xxxxxxx, and the redness will go away. You'll feel much better after that, guaranteed." Was quite elated lah. But during the checkup my medical docket seemed to have gone missing for awhile. My father made a bit of fuss over this. I just kept quiet and didn't want to interfere. If I did, it might make things worse for the nurses there. Sigh, I pity people in the service industry sometimes.  Anyway, I was given 6 days MC. Looks like my Sat duty need to be swapped with my friend's next month. Drat, and I was hoping to clear up everything before Dec so I'll be a lot more free then :P Oh well. Things are looking up at least. Next checkup due on Mon. Hopefully I can go back to Aikido on Tues and get some last min prep for the marathon next Sun.
