RAIZ have been up to it again. Anyone at the Festival of the Hills fireworks should have noticed the two plans they had circling Borden Park. I wonder who is financing their operations. I’m sure they have not registered as a Political Action Committee.  The latest round of Letters to the editors contained more incoherent babble.  Now the group is erroneously claiming that the City is going to give away acres of Riverbend Park to help the REI development. Where do they get this stuff? I mean just how many lies is Bill Windschief going to come up with? Makes you sick to your stomach doesn’t it?  By the way, to complain about the low flying planes disrupting your weekend activities, please call RAIZ at 248.495.2541 or e-mail them at raiz@raiz.wayne47.com.  It seems the Oakland County Republican Party is still in shambles. It appears the Christian Coalition Neo Conservatives are at it again with L. Brooks almost starting a brawl at the Orion Republican Club debate.  urlLink Click here  for the whole story.  You know… I hate to say it, but Brooks is right. With the County Democratic Party such a mess, now is the perfect time for the Republicans to lure disgruntled Democrats to jump ship. Unfortunately, the Moderates and the Neo’s in the Republican Party can’t quite fighting long enough to get their act together. Just goes to show you that we really need a viable third party for the common sense people.  As far as our own local climate… Things are good and things are bad.  The Good: The City is in good shape financially. We still enjoy the 2nd lowest tax rate in the County and our financial rating is still high.  The Bad: Morale amongst city employees is low and the budget process looks disastrous. The City should have a very simple Mission Statement: “To Serve and Protect”. Unfortunately, our police and fire are terribly under-funded and our roads are falling apart. Yet we continue to purchase $75,000.00 pit toilets for our parks and new vehicles for our fleet! The budget really needs an overhaul but the entire process has become a shambles to the point that I don’t even attend the sessions any more.  The way the process is supposed to work is that the Mayor is responsible to submit a balanced budget to the Council at the first meeting in September. Generally, we have meetings to discuss priorities and those issues with the highest priorities get funded first. Unfortunately, more often than not, we have these meetings, Council provides input and the budget comes back looking like Swiss cheese.  If Council was stronger and more united, they have the power granted by the City Charter to modify the budget submitted by the mayor as they see fit before they adopt it. Granted, this is a very difficult task seeing that the budget must be sent to the County and the State within a matter of weeks after the Mayor submits it to Council, but it can be done.  Unfortunately, in the years I have been on Council, the Council as a whole has never voted down a budget and has never made wholesale changes to a budget before adopting it. As for my votes, I have voted in favor of only one budget out of the last six presented.
