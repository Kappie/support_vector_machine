It was major entertaining because, while I'm still the worst, all the player's level are fairly close to each other.  And we had one intensive fight after another.  It was really really enjoyable and super fun.  In the order of 1v1 strength:  Jeremy - Sheik, Ice Climber, Yoshi John - Fox, Link Jeffrey - Pikachu, Samus, Mario, Marth, Fox  At first, we played FFA, stock 3.  And John soon realize that Fox is not really good in FFA and changed to Link. Most of the time, Sheik or Pika win out.  Thanx to Pika's powerful thunder and Sheik's fastness.  The problem with Link is, although he does gets the most KOs, after either pika or shiek is dead, poor Link still has to duel the remaining player.  And unless he has some major % advantage, it's really a tough fight for him.  Link's cool down time, like pikachu, is too long.  And without a good come-back-move, no wonder he is rather weak compare with others of same level.  Later, we play 1v1 loser out.  Because the day before, Sheik really beat the hell out of my Pika, and I've had some Fox nightmare before, so I was reluctant in starting 1v1 tournment. But it turns out that I can really fight even (or almost even) with Fox!  And if Luck is with me, I can also beat Sheik!!  Pika is not a super bad choice of character after all.  And after the tournment, we all laugh at little turtle's choice of characters - punch-bag Browser and feather-light Kirby.  Smart choice... really... no offence...
