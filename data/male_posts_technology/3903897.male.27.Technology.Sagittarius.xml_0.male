I met some of PJ's friends and we went to play Tennis after the movie.  The courts out by Ebanezer Church are fairly nice.  I noticed they have a rock climbing wall, but it's surrounded by a barb wire fence.   I think it's a bit ironic that they place something that will hurt you in the way of getting to something that might let you hurt yourself.  I guess most people recognize the danger of barb wire, but not so much falling from a 2 story rock climb.    I didn't play much b/c it was so hot out and I'm horrible at tennis.  I need to get my own racket and tennis balls and practice on the half-court wall out there some before I risk the lives of others ;-)     My interview went well on Tuesday, but I didn't didn't get the job.  They called me today (Friday) to tell me that I was their second choice and that the only reason the other candidate got the position was because he had 2 years of experience doing what exactly they're doing now with the county.  He'd been working on that type of stuff while I was in College.   Don Neuner called to tell me that he'd be passing my resume along to another aquaintance and to expect a call from them soon.  Maybe he can help me get another job in town.  We'll see.  I'm still waiting for a call back from Florence School District Three about their job opening.    I got to enjoy a nice dessert with friends at Ruby Tuesday this week.  Melissa, Jenifer, Robert, Jason, Leslie, PJ, and Mac were there with me.   Mac's a friend of PJ's that I met at the movies and the tennis courts.  Stephanie was our server.  :-)    We had a great time.  I laughed so hard, I almost cried.    I'm a little disappointed I didn't get the job this week, but I'm hopeful that Lake City will be a better fit for me anyway given my level of experience.  I'll just brush up on some books for dummies and play around with Linux some at home to prepare for that type of work in the future.  Maybe something better will open up for me, but in the meantime, I'll try to stay positive and just work on other things.    I need a drink.   Stargate better be good tonight!    In Vino Veritas. -- There is truth in wine.        *one is more likely to reveal the truth when drinking*
