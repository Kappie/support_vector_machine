Just don't have the same drive as in the good old days. Don't know what I want from it anymore?   I loved the times when I could come in here and no matter what the shit that went on around or landed on me, I could wipe it off with a smile and keep on going. Now as in the shit landing on me is a minimum, and don't get me wrong if it my mess I clean it up. The point is it never got to me. And basically still doesn't.  Thing is have you ever had the feeling where you are invisible in work. Now how can I explain this, or may some of you can already understand? People see you and talk to you and have a laugh, but as for everything on the business area and around seem like you are not involved. Or to put it maybe a better way "overlooked" and "ignored" feeling... It then comes to the point where nothing sound good anymore. One thing in this place that I always like is they evasive the positive. Now it comes down to the point where you can no longer see the positive anymore, and just focus on the negative.  It at time like this where I thank the powers that be that my personal life is fantastic. Friends Family and Loved-ones. At the end of the Day it is a job and fuck it. Just want to get back on track, but don't know how.......
