What if unlike myself this newer guy does not surf the web on company time?!  Once the mind has opened the box an almost infinite amount of negative what ifs come spooling out.  Of course that meant I could only do one thing, post in my blog about it.  Once I am done with this session of deviance the guilt will force me into an extended lunch break.  Policy and Procedure revisions will update themselves, right?  On the cooler front, the recent upgrade to Active Directory is exciting me in dirty ways.  What starts as a basic upgrade with very naked structure can quickly become a fancy sexy beast of network and identity management that has the potential to give handjobs to nerds and normal users alike.  %windir%\system32\rundll32.exe dsquery.dll,OpenQueryWindow
