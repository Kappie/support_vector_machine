My Playing Test went pretty good, I got a B+/A- (it was like 89.9%). There wasn't any piano on Tuesday - we got to skip it. In science we made balloon cars and I made two. Today is a nice relaxing B day. I have PE (we're playing Badmitton), then English (I have my HMK done), then Advisory (we're planning our lip-sync), then lunch and recess, then Computer Pro (we are making our iMovies, and I'm bringing my DVCAM), then art (we're doing 1-point perspective line drawings), then science (balloon cars). Yeah, I know it sounds like a busy day but most of it is pretty fun. Well, anyway, that's how the cookie crumbles. ;-)
