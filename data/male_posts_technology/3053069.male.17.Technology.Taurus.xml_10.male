One thing i would like to do is most likely not a good thing but it would be fun anyway. I was thinking it would be alot of fun to just grab the person standing next to me in the hall and just throw a big punch right to his face for no reason. Then i would grab the guy behind me and knee him in the stomach. Just as the 2nd guy started to fall i would jump up and roundhouse the guy coming at me from the opposite direction. At this point there would be 3 guys on the ground crying b/c they are to weak to put up a good fight and there friends would start to gather wanting to take me down. Then i see it. The key to my escape. The janitor is walkin by an and he has a mop. I jump up backflipping over two of the hurting guys and landing right in front of the mop. I grab it as a 6ft tall beast of a kid trys to hit me with a strong uppercut, but he misses. I take the wet mop and shove it into his face then swinging around the handle and hitting him across the cheek. the beast takes afew steps back and falls limp against the lockers. I turn to face the rest of the burly men who came to fight but they turn and run in fear. So i throw the mope to the guy against the lockers and walk off into class.
