I was on the mini first I got my frontside axle stall transfers down perfect, and also my disasters are like 100% now. Then I tryed frontside axles on the sides and I have got them too (but not too consistant cos it scary droppin in not seeing lol) I also manged to get my tail stalls right and this has done wonders to my runs on the mini. before i was quite slow and could only transfer like once lol after this for some reason I decided to try some proper spins I landed decent 360's which i am quite pleased with and also a few other people seemed to be impressed with. yey i feel good with myself.   My brother though is spending all the time he can get on my board and it is really gettin on my nerves because when i want to skate i find he has nicked it. Though i have to give it to him he probably will get kickflips before me (though thats all he does these days is practice them) he has the technique that i cant master why why does my foot fall down unable to pull back (I blame being able to kick myself in my head lol)  I wish I had gone to skate extreme yesterday though i would have gone had i known rhys would have been there. well next time BOTR meet i really do need to get some footage including of me and in particular of neil. When shall we meet at skate x next i might not have money to go wednesday but i will try. Dats all from Jon cyaz peeps
