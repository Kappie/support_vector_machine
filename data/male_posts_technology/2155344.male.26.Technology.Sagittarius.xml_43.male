Well, Steve Jobs is recovering from cancer. Hopefully that won't put the iMac G5 off track. Oh yeah, I got an iPod! 40 gig, 4th Generation. Like it but need a skin before I can carry it everywhere.  The iFrame project is shaping up. Will take some pics for you to see how things are shaping up.  I had my annual review at work, it went well I thought.  Nothing much else, am still playing Starcraft. And a little bit of Warcraft. When App allows me access to the desk, of course! :)
