  urlLink   She must have taken a huge bong hit right before  urlLink they filmed her . It really is hilarious how clueless this girl seems. Where do they get these losers. I understand their point with the switch ads, but the only thing theses ads prove is how ignorant some people are about computers in general. What they are basically saying is  " Are you an idiot like these people? Then you should buy a Macintosh! ". I like the Mac, but they are actually discouraging me from buying one by this advertising campaign.
