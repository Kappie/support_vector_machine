We've been strapped by debt and piss-poor credit for over 15 years and tomorrow could mark the begining of our climb out of it.  Our re-fi should fund tomorrow.  Okay, I know we're taking a big hit on interest but it'll pay off all our creditors and give us not only some cash out to finally fix stuff around the house but also, and this is most important, allow us to put away a sizable chunk of change as our emergency fund.  Part of the money, too, will go into a special fund that we will drawn on to offset the increase in our monthly payment.  That fund is designed to last for two years.  After which time our loan will switch to an adjustable and we will be able to shop for a better rate with our much improved credit score.  But most of the money, roughly 2.5 month's worth of our household income, will be banked away.  Well, we might take some of that and invest it.  Finally, we'll be able to act like adults and invest beyond my retirement account. Still, this chicken has not yet hatched.  We were burned once before with a promised re-fi but that one never made it this far.  I mean, we've signed the papers with the notary so our end is good.  Right?  Then what did they mean when they said that it didn't fund today as expected because they had to clear up something with the title?  Oh, please God, let this go through.  Believe me, we have learned our lesson on this one.
