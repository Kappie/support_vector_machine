This involved a lot of shooting of rats, bugs and crabs.   At one point on Tatooine, I was standing next to a mission terminal waiting for my turn to use it when I saw a large wookie run past me, firing wildly over his shoulder as a tiny crab no bigger than a dinner plate chased him through town. How sad, I thought to myself. I spent countless hours wandering the hillsides in search of new rats and crabs to shoot. Sometimes I would inadvertently stumble upon too large a rat and be forced to high tail it back to town. I placed my character in "auto run" and pointed him at the nearest town.   As I sat there staring at my Trandoshan bounding across the uneven Tatooine landscape with some kind of super rat closing in on him, I thought to myself, “This is not how I want to play in the Star Wars Universe.”
