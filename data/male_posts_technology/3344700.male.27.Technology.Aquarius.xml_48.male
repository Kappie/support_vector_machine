This should be an interesting URL for anyone who cannot or does not want to, at this point in time, install the beta bits on their machines but still would like to have access to reference type material for the upcoming features of the next version of Visual Studio .NET and the .NET Framework 2.0.  For offline viewing, you might also be interested in downloading the MSDN documentation for the Visual Studio 2005 Express products. It's publicly available as a 162 MB file download  urlLink   here
