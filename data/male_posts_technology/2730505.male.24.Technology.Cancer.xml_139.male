Well things started out nicely and ended nicely.  People Met:   Krisitin  - Kristin is one of Sam's friends, she's a cutie with an ass and boobies.  Cool girl, she's got that southern type accent but not really southern because she didn't sound stupid.  She was about 5'4, big tits, nice ass, shoulder length curly hair.  Very friendly personality and it jus shows when she talked.  A genuinely nice girl, kinda shy but will still talk to you.  She also had this voice that would just melt you and wow.  If I saw a huge tidal wave coming from afar and she was right there with me telling me that things were going to be okay, I would be as calm as a sleeping baby.  Oh yeah I got her number too!  Yay!  too bad she's in Iowa.  Oh well.   Mindy  - I actually met Mindy some time ago, well the last time I was out there.  She's kinda shy but she's not.  The last time I was there we kinda got off the wrong foot.  I said something as a joke but she took it seriously.  She's got a nice figure with a nice booty.  She's got short blonde hair, that wispy type that drives me wild.  Hmm, she was a definite cutie.  She's got a cute laugh and a sense of humor more my level (retarded and not snobby).  She's also a good sport and enjoys XBOX video games.  Yeah, I got her number too but, again, it's no use since I live in IL and she's from Iowa.  Grrr... Oh well.   Chris  - Met Chris at Hyvee where me and Sam went for some fucking food.  I was hungry and needed to pee and this kid was there.  He seemed cool enough.  Didn't really interact with him much but he wasn't a nuisance either.   Random Mexican  - Dude, this guy came up to me and told me that I was weird.  And then he proceeded to tell me that I was cool and then he was asking for the time (I think he was just scoping out my watch) and he wouldn't leave me alone for like 10 minutes.  Damn fucker.  Needless to say I didn't want, nor get that number.   Waitress from Vieux Carre's  - I forgot her name but she was a cutie too!  Blonde hair to the middle of her back, about 5'4 and she had a healthier than I like it booty.  I asked where other places to go and she was not as accomodating as I would have wanted.  Still a nice girl but really not that much interaction.   Friday   So Friday I ate lunch at my parents house because I had to fix my sister's computer so it could join the network at home.  After eating and relaxing while watching some stupid shit on TV I went on and left to go to Iowa.  I was only doing 80 the whole way.  Pretty relaxed drive.  Thought about what has happened throughout the week from Meghan to work shit.  Well who am I kidding, it was mostly about Meghan and just bullshit thoughts that were going through my head on what could have been, if it was better like this etc. etc. etc.  Got to Sam's place and it was still light out.  Walked in, said hi to Sam and Laura and sat down at the computer and cracked opened a beer.  Played Far Cry and Painkiller or something like that, good games.    Mindy walks in a couple of minutes later and we just kinda laughed at each other as we both said "I don't hate you..."  It was funny.  It was good that things went better this time around.  After a few more rounds of PC FPS, Sam and Laura went to the store to go buy shit for dinner.  That left me and Mindy all alone.  So we talked for a while.  Talked about movies and music and what she liked to do, you know the usual BS small talk.  I asked her if she wanted to go see and movie and she agreed since Laura and Sam were going with.  I then wanted to see if this girl was a geek (since that's what I'm into now) and I think she's just competitive.  We played XBOX and flirted.  We played Need for Speed:Underground.  She's actually not a bad driver either, I was surprised.  We then switched gears to Soul Caliber 2.  She played that too.  She had to learn a little first but she was able to beat me but in a not so alarming ratio.  Who ever loses drinks was that game and she was losing quite a bit.  HeHe, Of course I laid down a couple of times but I won enough to get her juices going.  More flirting ensued with a little shoulder bumping and physical contact.  It was fun.  We ate dinner (good tacos by the way, thanks to the host) and we went to go see Van Helsing.    It sucked.  I didn't like it.  The women throughout the whole movie were damn fine and that was enjoyable.  The eye candy was also breath taking but besides that it was just a goofy ass multi million doller hollywood goofy scary movie.  I would absolutely treasure a night with  urlLink Kate Bekinsale .  She's a hottie.  I didn't like her with her black hair but it was still hot.  I like her much better with her natural hair with blonde streaks!  Yummy Yummy.    After that we played a little three man.  It was funny because at one point there was a rule that said "everytime you say something you have to end it with 'IN MY PANTS'"  Yeah, that was funny.  Just imagine certain phrases that would come out when people have been drinking.  For exaple: "You gotta drink - in my pants" or "Who's turn is it - in my pants"  Well from there I hope people can imagine.  It was funny for a while but it eventually got old and we had to kill the rule.  We played some more three man and switched to asshole.  After that we retreated to Sam's room for a little dance party (with four people, whatever! it was still fun) among other things.  It was too bad that Mindy had to work the next day.  Hah, it was a fun night.  It was as much fun as I had had in a long time.  I hate passing out, it ruin's my plans!  SHIT FUCK BITCH GRRR  Saturday  Woke up around noon.  Mindy was still there, I had to get ready to go visit Bryce so I jumped in the shower real quick, got some Taco Johns (again I manage to spill the contents of my taco onto my pants but this time I was able to save my pants from getting ruined)    I get to Bryce's current residence and he had just woken up and was a little groggy when he saw me.  It was cute.  His hair was all sticking up and he had a sleepy face but it perked up as soon as he saw me.  Hehe, he said "DADDY!"  It was good to hear that again in person.  Man, the boy is potty trained already!!!  2 and some odd months and he can do decide if he wants to go number 1 or number 2 (sorry to the people who don't have kids but for a two year old to go potty on thier own is pretty damn good.  His 2nd birthday was just this past February and he can do this already.  He doesn't even pee on his brand new bed that his grandparents bought him.  Yeah, he's got his own twin size bed to sleep in.  He can walk his sleepy ass over to his bed and climb up and sleep as well as climb down when he has to go potty or wake up.  What a kid!) it was just amazing to see this little person doing things that's not average.    Much love and thanks to the grand parents.  They were nice to me too as they gave me dinner and told me all about the things that he has been doing and learning and conversating about.  He's on this little race car kick.  His bed is all race cars, he's got two big organizers for his Hot Wheels and we played with those.  We played catch out side.  We played kick the ball out side.  We picked up sticks and chased squirrels and birds.  We played in my car, he was pressing buttons.  He also took my toll money and put it in his piggy bank.  He then rifled thorugh my wallet and he took a couple of bills and put it in his piggy bank himself.  I think it added to to like $40 and some change.  That was fine.  He's him with a dollar.
