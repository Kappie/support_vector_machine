Well, here is a summary of the week vacation:      We went camping in Oregon - the 4 of us, plus Anne's sister M. and fam, plus her parents and their 3 foster kids - 17 people total. It was pretty relaxing, even with all the kids, just because this is the first trip where I have made an effort not to act like a jerk; I took some alone time, thought before speaking, and focused on enjoying the good parts of the trip. We went on a  urlLink dune buggy tour , the kids got to play in the lakes, the adults got to relax a little, and we got ice cream on the way home.           In addition, it was interesting from the standpoint that my niece and I ended up having some informal therapy sessions together. She's 15, she was abused as a little one, then went into foster care with (and later adopted by) M. Anyway, she has addictions (alcohol), OCD, depression, and trust/intimacy issues, and is on the same medicine as me. It turns out that we are very similar in the way our problems have expressed themselves on the surface. She and I talked quite a bit during the campout, and I think it was helpful for both of us. I think she feels like there is someone in the family that can understand what she is going through, and that I will listen if she needs someone outside her home to talk to. I also talked to M., mostly about my experience and helping her understand what the girl is going through.          Maybe I have found something worthwhile to do for my next career.          Anyway, we were lazy this weekend, recovering from the camping trip. I did not have any computer time this past week. although I wrote a lot of stuff using ancient tools called " pen " and " paper ". Apparently these tools for recording written information were popular for many centuries before becoming almost obsolete in the last decade. I will share some of these when I get them typed up.          More later.
