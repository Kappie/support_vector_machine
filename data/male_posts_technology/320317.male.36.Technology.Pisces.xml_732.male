Depending on how the sites were originally created, some redesigns were easier than others; however, most of them were still more difficult and time-consuming than they needed to be. As a result, I made a New Year’s resolution to start using XHTML and CSS2 exclusively when building or rebuilding sites. Not only do XHTML and CSS2 result in cleaner, more efficient code, but they also improve accessibility and scalability."
