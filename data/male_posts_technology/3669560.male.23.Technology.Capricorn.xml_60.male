My brother flew in last night and my parents are coming tomorrow, so my time will be pretty thin, picking them up from the turnip truck and playing big city tour guide.  I saw  urlLink The Village  last night and I want to discuss it so damned badly, but I've got a shit-ton of work to do today so I can get off before my brother locks himself out of my apartment and falls into Puget Sound.  I will say this though, I hate movie marketting   more than anything else ever  . The Village is less of a horror movie than even Unbreakable was, yet they decided to market it as that. frustrating.  The movie itself was frustrating too.  I'm not sure why, but I have an irrational devotion to M. Night Shyamalan. Less to his work itself(The Village is slightly better than Signs, which was shit) I think, than to the   idea   of his work, his aesthetic and his storytelling process. He creates modern day fairy tales--fables rich with symbolism. I love that shit. I just wish he'd do a better job of it. I know he has the talent.  The twist, which isn't hard to spot (which you know is coming by default), isn't totally convincing, but it forces you to reflect on the significance of earlier scenes in the way that Shyamalan always does. It scolds you for not paying attention, and makes you remember.   It's just messier this time around, he isn't able to tie all the pieces together.    The acting, I think, saves this movie.   Adrien Brody is a goddamned G   as usual, but his character's subplot is maddeningly irrational. Unfortunately it's also the most important--it's the lynchpin of the whole revelation. That sucks, but it's still decently crafted.  Shyamalan really goes--now that I'm thinking about it--for like 3 or 4 little revelations (I think calling them twists is missing the point a bit--though I did call them that earlier) rather than one big one. I think that might be a good step in his maturation as a filmmaker. If you can't write a great story with an explosive revelation ( urlLink The Sixth Sense ) then it's better to focus more on the story (The Village) than on the revelation ( urlLink Signs ).  So it's good, not great, not Shyamalan good, but good enough.    I wasn't planning on writing this much . . .
