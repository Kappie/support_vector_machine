The friend, Sina Montallebi, wrote that he had been summoned to appear before the religious police.  The next day, Mr. Montallebi became the first person in history to be jailed for the crime of keeping a Weblog.  Gee!! I'm a criminal too!! Maybe I should go and get an anticipatory bail!!  I feel like singing (with due apologies to Anastacia)...  If blogging is a crime baby I'd do my time Whether it's wrong or right You can sentence me Sentence me to life
