I called drummer Greg up and he said he was gonna be there, kids and wife in toe (lol WE ARE SOOOO ROCK AND ROLL!!!), so I invited Sylvie to come to and hang with the kids.  Poor Engineer Greg probably felt like the circus invaded or something.  Anyways, I picked Sylvie up from her work and off we went out to New West.  It was Sylvie's birthday today, so I knew that clan G (greg's family) had a prezzy for her and a card.  After the recording we had plans to go out and see a friend of Sylvie's friend's band play.  At the studio, I was the first one there, other than engineer Greg.  We listened to the songs a bit and picked the best take of each one to work with.  We decided to focus on Bus Stop since I had to leave early anyways.  That way we could spend more time on one song and do it right rather than less time on both songs and do them half assed.  Darren went out and did a vocal take.  He was having a bit of a challenge with the chorus, but he was singing the shit out of it.  We decided that we would use his track and I would record my BG's and that would help with his chorus.  It took me 3 or 4 takes, but I finally got a kick ass one down.  Darren went out and nailed the leads in 4 tries and he sang that shit HARD.  And it was good.  Sheldon went out to do his BG's and had a bit of a challenge nailing the harmony, but that's ok cuz he was more prepared to do the other song.  He got a pretty good take tho, and we kept that.  Then Greg went out to put some percussion on...and Sylvie and I had to leave.  We said our goodbyes and headed out.  Darren told me today that Greg did a rockin tambourine and shaker bit, so I look forward to hearing that...it might add some cool dimension to an otherwise straight ahead hard rock tune.  We had an uneventful drive home, and Sylvie changed to head out to the bar.  She wore some awesome tight ass jeans (woot sexy) and a little tee.  She stuffed her little bar wallet in the back pocket and off we went.  We just missed the bus by our house so we figured we'd catch it at granville.  We set a very brisk pace (we were on the verge of being a bit late) and kinda half walked, half ran to granville street (about 6 blocks).  We got there as a bus was pulling up and as Sylvie grabbed for her bus ticket, she realized she had dropped her wallet en-route. SHIT!  Her drivers license, bank card, and about 40 bucks cash.  Good bye that...Davie st is littered with junkies and street kids, and it was, after all, Friday night.  We headed back up Davie looking for it, not much hope.  Sylvie was some kinda bummed (no doubt).  Nice birthday present that...   I personally just figured she had taken it out for some reason before we left and forgot it.  So off we went up Davie at an even brisker pace than we went down it, scanning for her little flat wallet.  As we crossed Burrard, a woman came up behind us and tapped Sylvie on the shoulder.  She asked if we had lost something, and of course we said yes.  She said she had been looking for us and Sylvie looked like the person on the driver's license.  Holy shit!  There are still some good people out there.  So thanks, lady, whoever you are, for helping a good night not turn into a bad night.  Props to you, and extra special thanks for not taking any of the dough in the wallet.  Good karma coming your way.  It's about time something good happened to us after the shitty couple of years we had, and I personally take this as a big sign that (at least for Sylvie) things are turning around.  So...thanks again.  Not that anyone reads this blog, but if you do...thanks.  So we finally got to the Railway and the band was just about to go on.  The Railway Club is an odd little room...very intimate, with the stage right at the front group of 8 or so tables.  It's narrow and long with kitschy 70's rumpus room kind of panelling and accents.  The room is bisected by the bar about halfway down.  For the length of the bar, it is basically a hallway to get to the back half of the room where there are a few more tables and the bathrooms and a pool table.  We were sitting at the front table, as the piano player in the band is best buds with the dude we were there with.  The cheesy orange/brown carpet smells slightly musty, and the carved up tables are somewhat uneven.  The lights are flourescent and synthetic feeling, but cool because you feel like the band is in your living room.  All in all a great venue to see bands in, and a long standing Vancouver live music watering hole.  The band got up on stage and were all old guys.  Well, 5 old guys and one old girl.  The make up of the band was singer, 2 guitar, chick bassist, drummer, piano and percussion.  Everyone but the piano player sang too.  The main singer guy was hilarious looking.  He had on a pink shirt with a logo that said "Dicks...where  taste IS the difference".  He was an older bald fellow with a really odd shaped skull.  It had some kind of extra bone in the front giving him the appearance of some wierd bastard child of a Diploducus (er...that's a dinosaur with a lumpy head) and a really skinny, short Klingon.  They launched into their set with a bizarre 5 part harmony barbershop kinda thing that was really cool, and man could the singer dude sing.  Well, they all had serious vocal chops, but I guess this is what 30 years of playing clubs gets you...either serious chops or a serious addiction.  Anyways they rocked the joint with a bunch of bizarre cover tunes (mainly song's I'd never heard before with a few exceptions, but all cover tunes).  Now, normally cover bands bore the shit out of me...if I want to hear a band's song I'll listen to their album, ya know?  But these guys COOKED!  Not only were they exceptionally good and fluid players, but they were having a  blast  up there.  Which is what rock and roll is all about really, having fun.  They all played well, but not like schooled arrogant college music playing.  They were just good cuz they do it lots and have done it a long time.  The only way to get truly good is to play the shit out of your weapon for a long long time.  And that's what old guys bring to the table I guess.  We watched two sets of the band and had a really good time and few beers, then decided to head home.  Had a fine walk home and went to bed a bit tipsy but not slammed.  I havent drank that many beers in a long long time tho, so I did feel more drunk than I should have.  I didn't want to stay up too late cuz today is Sylvie's birthday as I mentioned earlier.  And we had plans.  We got up slowly this morning, and left the house around 12:30.  We decided to drive out to fort langley just cuz we hadn't been there for a long long time.  Walked around there for a bit, ate a gourmet hotdog, looked at some antiques and just enjoyed being out of the city for the afternoon.  We were gonna get together with Darren and Diane tonight to play x-box and eat unhealthy food, so we headed back home after a couple hours.  We stopped at Coquitlam center to pick up the Hobbit on x-box and ended up picking up another game as well.  We almost picked up two other games, but one of them was the game that I knew Darren and Diane had bought her for her birthday so I told her two were enough.  Came home and prepared the house then I went and got D and D.  We picked up some mix and some birthday cupcakes and then went to Memphis Blues for some BBQ take out.  If you ever come to Vancouver, eat at this place.  It is THE shit.  Huge assed portions of wonderfully tender and utterly decadent BBQ pork, beef, chicken etc etc.  And the ribs...omg the ribs...like beef candy man.  Completely melts in your mouth.   And fantastic fries too.    So we ate our anti-vegan meal and watched "The Story Of... Metallica's Black album" on DVD.  It was a cool video, and the place where our band rehearses is where they recorded alot of that album so we got to see our room lots.  After dinner we proceeded with the mass killing of monsters in our new game "Hunter-the Reckoning -Redeemer".  Great game for four player...no split screen, all cooperative play and just plain fun.  Pure destructorama with lots of animated bloody bits.    Holy shit this has been a long post...full of nothing too...lol  Oh well time to stop I guess.
