My mother had a few friends from Vietnam for her business and this one chick from Turkey.  It was a fun time.  I was pretty much stuffed after getting there from work.  I had to go get my wasabi and kikkoman from my apartment for the sushi so while I was there I just picked up my XBOX and played at my parents.  I hate playing on my little black and white tv (9") it really makes it hard to pick out people from the background especially on maps where the light is bright.  Went home and dicked around online for a few more hours.  Monday was a lot more lax.  I didn't really do anything.  I was about to do the dished in my apartment but I realized I've beed doing the fucking dishes every Monday for the last mont or so.  I said fuck that.  I don't leave any dirty dishes on the sink because I wash that shit right after using it.  It's about time someone else did that shit.  It was football and rainbow six all day yesterday.  I got my ass whooped in football.  It's a little different that Madden which was what I was used to but eh, I will get better that's for damn sure.  For $20, ESPN is one good looking fucking game!  The stats are so deep, for $20 it's definitely amust have.  Now it would have been a ddferent story if it was $50 or $40 but for $20?!?!?  I think that even non-football fans should buy the damn game.  I guess it's only $15.99 at Target in Iowa but still, $20? for a game that looks this good and the replay value is amazing?  I don't even think I will get Madden 2005.  Black Arrow comes out August 4th and Madded comes out three weeks after that and then it's fucking HALO 2 time.  Just really looking forward to Black Arrow.  It's just too bad I got a bachelor's party to go to that weekend.  DOH!!!!  Every motherfucker will have a headstart on the maps and find the rushed and the fucking camping spots.  Oh well.  I'll catch up sooner or later anyways.  Wow,  urlLink here's  a list of games coming out
