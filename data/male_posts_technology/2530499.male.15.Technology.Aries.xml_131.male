Pictures up now.   That's just the Beta version. The lights, power switch, fan, and reset aren't modded in yet.   That gaping hole where the lights and switches are is where the fan is to be located.   Basically a better picture of the gaping hole. You can see the edge of the power supply, too!   The Power Supply. You can see "Project Instant Tux" written on it from the old Project.   The VERY front of the box, the part that I tried to preserve.   The best-looking picture. The warning says something about a spyware program not properly installed... =]   The FINAL resting place for the PS2 Server. (Still known as ServerTwo.)   Lastly, the terribly terrible BSOD! (Blue Screen Of Death)  Happy am I, for JQ and I are supposed to go to dinner (on my bill, of course. Any other way would make me look like a dirty queer.)  Peace be with you.
