It's like if I said in my bad French "j'capte rien a ce qui m'disent". Something like this was better "Je ne comprend rien Ã  ce qu'ils me disent".  The difference between what I really want to tell you and what you really understand was very important particularly if the language was different. For example, I write my thought on this blog, but in reality, I don't write exactly what I think, because word miss to me. I think I can write in English about 70 % of my real thought (so 30% missing), but (there is always a but) I translate some expressions who doesn't exist in English language (10 %) and sometimes (very often in fact) I don't use the good word (15 %), or my grammar isn't exact (30%).  Ok, let me take my calculator:  ((((100 thought - 30%)- 15%)-10%)-30%)= 37.485 %  of thought you have really understand. Ok, I will try now a feat. This is an understanding test I do now (try to understand): "I like the new design of my blog" If you really understand that "J'aime le nouveau design de mon blog" So You understand 100% of my thought. Yessss Hope it works :D
