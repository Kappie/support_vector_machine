Since Jo is now working full time that means she heads off every morning at 7:30 and I spend the day doing the grocery shopping, or laundry, etc. I really miss the days when she was working part time and we could go out for lunch or coffee during the daytime. Of course I do actually work when I'm at home; it's just a nicer environment to be able to sit on the verandah with the wireless laptop to do my email, or watch TV as I edit course notes. Right now I'm watching the Czech Republic whoop the asses of Denmark in the replay of the last Euro 2004 quarter final. Poor Danes - I am one quarter Danish so I would have liked them to win, but the Czechs look just too good. Two weeks until our wedding reception, really looking forward to it. And the week off afterwards as well of course!
