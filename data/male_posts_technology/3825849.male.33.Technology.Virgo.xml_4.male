The LA Times offers some  urlLink names and dollar amounts . It's really quite shocking (no-fee, login required)  Initially I find this appaling because of the number of people who had to die for these people to make their money. But if that outrages me I'd better re-think most of what I do in life. The fact is, to live is to destroy. On further reflection I still find it dispicable simply because I hate the born-again, manifest-destiny shit of dubbya and company. But are those reasons enough to be upset by warmongers and war profiteers?   No, I think that Livinstone and Woolsey (see the article) bother me because they do the "investment circut" thing.   You see, it isn't just that I grew up Mormon but that I gew up lower-class Mormon. This means that I saw my parents be at the bottom of every scam that blew by the Wasatch Front. I remember my father getting his first bar-b-q grill by attending a time share pitch. He and my mother went just to get the free grill. They would have actually bought one week a year in a shitty condo in fucking Galviston Texas (or name your own lousy vacation spot) if they had any money (it was all tied up in trampolenes and plankton). So to hear about these shit-bags trupeting Iraq investment oppertunities just makes my hair stand on end. They aren't making money off oil or military logistical support, no they are making money off the *idea* of oil and military logictical support.    Bush Politics  gotta love a line like  urlLink this   "The Republicans' campaign is all about scapegoating John Kerry for the ills of modernity. It's about exploiting homophobia, provincialism and cultural insecurity. Or, as they put it, values."  Ok, Washington Post editorials are not exactly "fair and balanced" but they are at least witty. If I can stomach The Wall Street Journal's right leaning surely I can handle some left leaning from The Post. Fox "News" can fuck themselves.
