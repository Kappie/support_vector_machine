I don't know why Iran keeps trying to pretend its nuclear program is for peaceful use and failing to disclose all of its activities to international inspectors.  The country is swimming in oil, and has no need for nuclear energy.  The very few legitimate industrial uses beyond energy production could be more affordably satisfied on the free market, instead of constructing reactors and enrichment centrifuges.    It's just embarrassing to see a supposedly mature government acting like a five year old caught dipping into a cookie jar who says "I was just getting a cookie for you, mommy!"
