I have  only seen an increase in SPAM since the legislation that is supposed to curb and  control SPAM was introduced. If anything it has had the opposite effect. Typical  though when you have lawyers and bureaucrats who have no understanding of what  it is they are trying to legislate making the rules.          Oh well it isone of the bane's that I must bear being  the assistantM.I.S. (Management Information Systems) manager of two  companies.
