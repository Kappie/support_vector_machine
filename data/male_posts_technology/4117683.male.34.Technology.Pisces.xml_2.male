I live in a country where I counld protect the Goverment. ...Then protect them again with the pen!  I could listen to any music, as long as Tipper Gore ain't in office! (FUCK THE PMRC!) I could create elerbrate art projects, as long as the Wholly-than-Thou Religious Right Aint offended.   ...and they always are...  I could Ravt  Rave in the streets. ...as long as I have clothes on!  With all this freedom comes free thinking, which not everyone can handle.  Assholes who thinks that they are Gods vessel. ...and try to force it one everyone!  The chance for debate, ..it doesn't mean that it will be intellegnt.  Different religions, as long as they agree with those who has the money.
