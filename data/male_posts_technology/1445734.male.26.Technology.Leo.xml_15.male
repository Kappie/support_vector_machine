So all set and will be back to Sydney this week. Same people, same place, same but more work on the anvil. Looking forward for a very good experience atleast this time. Atleast would like to have no hassles, tension free trip this time. Hope it works out that way. For my last two trips to sydney weren't as great as I expected them to be. As many of my blog readers know when it comes to Nature, short trips, photography I've enjoyed the most in those 6 months, but they were never tension-free. Hassles, follow-ups and more. To a certain extent life's challenges are good to face and are healthy. But they shouldn't really get burdensome and take some toll on you. That's what has been happening since a while. Looking forward to a good trip. This time around in all probability I might be flying over Kaulalumpur, which is different than last time. Enough of Singapore. Let me see some new place, rather airport atleast. I always loved Malay language. Its more soothening to ears than chinese or japanese somehow. Don't know why. People not sure as yet. Let me see.. Will update once I get settled back in Sydney.   Wish me more luck this time. Cheers....
