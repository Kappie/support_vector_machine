Often his musical compositions had a experimental sound which complemented the action on the screen without owerpowering; particularly  Alien  and  Planet of the Apes . He was a pioneer in using electronic sounds in addition to instruments.   During his career he was nominated for 17 Academy Awards, winning only once for Fox's 1976 megahit,  The Omen . His work on  The Omen  also included an Academy Award nomination for Best Song, " Ave Santini "; which truly captured the evil within the film and is undoubtely the scariest component of the film.   He began hiscareerwriting familiar themes and scoring formany television shows ( Studio One ,  Gunsmoke ,  Have Gun - Will Travel ); he contined writing for television throughout his career ( Twilight Zone ,  The Waltons ,  Room 222 ,  Star Trek - The Next Generation ).   His filmography included the films  Logan's Run ,  MacArthur ,  Coma ,  Boys From Brazil ,  Poltergeist ,  Gremlins ,  I.Q. ,  Total Recall  and  The Sum of All Fears .   He was truly an innovator in his fieldand while he has passed on; his workwill continue to thrill generations to come.
