My boss gave me a strange look about a long lunch (yet again), but didn't argue, and only made fun of me over it a little.  It's not like I don't take the fewest long lunches in my department, or anything...  Fresnos is looking like the most likely victim for our little mini family reunion.  Should be fun; they had a good salad last time I was there, and I'm looking forwards to having it.  Just not in the mood for a hamburger today, and salads are healthier anyway.  Now if I can just figure out why my mother has this weirdness about always calling my wife instead of me, but only if we're at work...  If you hadn't noticed from my earlier posts, my wife and I work at the same place.  It's a financial publishing company, prints books and such.  There really aren't too many of those about, I'm told, but I'm really a bit oblivious about our industry.  I just worry myself with my computers and my programs and my share of the errors out on the production servers, and the rest of the company quietly ignores my ignorance and works anyway.  :)  She doesn't program, though; she's an account manager, and has the incredibly fun and exciting job of getting varying levels of verbal abuse from both sides about how stupid the customers or the tech/laser departments are, depending on whom she is talking with at the time.  We, of course, up here in our ivory electronic tower, are convinced of our superiority, while the customers are absolutely convinced we're a bunch of blathering idiots.  The customers should just be happy they very rarely have to deal directly with the people up here.  "Customer service" seems to be something they actively cull when hiring.  Well, maybe not actively; just incidentally.  So with a little luck, I'll hear back today about my appeal on the degree from my school.  The graduate committee was waiting for someone who got back from vacation yesterday, in theory.  It's probably more likely that they'll reach a decision on it some time next week, or even the week after, but I can always hope.  Hope springs eternal and all that.  In less self-centered news,  here's  an interesting article.  Apparently, they're producing crude oil (or something very similar) from agricultural waste products.  What I find kinda amusing was the comment "The Carthage, Missouri, plant is currently producing 100-200 barrels of oil per day utilizing by-products from an adjacent turkey processing facility."  Turkey processing facility?  Disturbing in its own right.  But will this make cars smell like turkey?  Anyone else remember  this van  that ran on grease, but smelled like french fries when it was driving past?  :)  Well, apparently I actually have to fix a couple of print files now, so I'll close this out and maybe just write another entry later.
