So I decided to copy and paste all my txt files into a blog and just see how far can i bring my blog to.  I know i am a damn late starter in this blog bandwagon, but my thoughts in my mind has been overwhelming and running out of disk space. Blog is one hell'a good avenue to store my thoughts that are over-spewing.  Having spend majority of my life as an individual has certainly shaped my thinking about life. For instance, in my 2.5yrs stint as a student in foreign land, living by myself, managing my lifestyle, has distort my teenage' idealistic ambition.  Therefore, in these few blogs, i am frantically typing away, what's left on my memory bank, in hope to revive and relocate some memory survivals. Constantly, whenever I needed that spiritual morale boosting, my dad, mum and sister appears in my mind, using them as role models to finish up what i set out to complete 2.5 years ago.
