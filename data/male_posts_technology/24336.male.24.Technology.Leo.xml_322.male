Basically, it is a complete rewrite of the Content Management System (CMS) I wrote for the  urlLink daily .  Now that I know the error of my ways from the first attempt at a CMS, I can do this one right.  So far, I have added (or plan on adding) a completely modular approach, automatic archiving, web-based configuration, a database backend and most importantly, the ability to create sites that have infinite depth.  Each template can reference a previous template, which could itself reference a previous template and so on.  Try writing a database for that one!  Other than that, life is good.
