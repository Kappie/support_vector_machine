From the user's point of view, you must have a coherent design philosophy, and I don't see how that could come about from open source software. The person who's done it best is Steve Jobs, and he's well-known for being a tyrant." 

 I like to think if the "committee" or team is very small, and is led by a "Lead Designer" with a thorough understanding of their users is the best scenario.
