This week is basketball camp that takes up 9 to 12 for these 5 days. Next week we have Vacation Bible School that will take up 8:30 to 12. This is one of the reasons Kelli is watching the other two kids. July schedule is crazy, I will have to post it separately.   Yesterday we started a diet. It actually isnt quote unquote a diet, rather watch what we eat and drink lots of water. I drunk 8 bottles of those bottle waters. Let me tell you, I thought I pee'd my brains out. Lucky I work at home and the bathroom is close. Supposedly, by drinking a certain amount of water (dependant upon your weight) it helps you loose your weight. I guess we will see, if I can hold on too it.   Don't get me wrong, it's not like I am obese, but I could lose some. I am 5'9", 180 pounds. So I am drinking my coffee and will hit water shortly. Gotta have the coffee first though. I drink Folgers, dark, black.   I also tried Pepsi Free this weekend. It wasn't bad. I ended up buying a six pack. I have been an avid Pepsi drinker for as long as I can recall. Supposedly this has the same taste  with half the sugar. It wasnt bad tasting, unlike those diet colas I tried. I can just taste that carcinogenic sacharrin in those (shudders).  Your probably reading this and thinking, this guys babbling but heh, I took tylenol PM last night to get some sleep and just drinking my coffee. No on-call this week! yeah !
