There was a rumor started that he was stolen from the hospital at the beginning of this past weekend. It got me worried. I wanted to see him just to make sure that he was ok and doing good up to this point. Because of this rumor, things were said between family and I was sort of put on the spot. It wasn't good. I said what I had to say and took off for the weekend just to be away from this place. I went down to Arizona...Myself, my uncle, and another uncle hauled and rode horses for those two days. It was to dang hot, 120-degrees, but fun. Yea, yesterday my aunt came around and suggested to my mom to look into investigation firms so they can search for my brother's whereabouts. I said to them, "heck before you do that we should go to that place and ask the family on that side if they know anything about what’s going on." I drove out there to my brothers gf's place, knocked on the door..And who comes out to me? My brother..I was shocked and surprised. Altogether I spent about 3 1/2 hours talking with him..My lil brother included as well. It was a great afternoon/evening.  As for today, I'm not sure what I'm going to be doing. I think later this evening I'll be going back to Durango. Right now it’s too hot to do anything outside. Usually I'd be outside in this weather doing a lot of stuff from welding, too caring for the livestock, and building whatever. Since I was out in the 120-degree weather this past weekend im too red and burned to be outside now. That will be my excuse to work on the layout for this blog I created. Cheap but "pretty good alright." :D that’s all for now. Here's a lil something...  *INDIFFERENCE* I now feel the end everything seems so real a sad image to see I walk these dirty lands feeling the hatred of the world I will not follow your rules living life for my own I guide my internal self trying to change my ways look at me following the steps that lay ahead seeking new paths what and where ive been will never return I walk on this path made of ideas everything around me a void stepping on skulls of generations that have not formed to create everything from emptiness to awaken the buried and teach the new  deep and well defined an undetermined but straight path created what ive seen and heard will never return now I live life with indifference Copyright © 2004 SJohnson
