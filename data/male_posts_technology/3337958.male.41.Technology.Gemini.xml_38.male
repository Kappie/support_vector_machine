What strikes as funny, but not particularly surprising, is the comment from the Catholic District Attorney (is all of this capitalization necessary?) admonishing the Bishop, but only because he's afraid it will impede the ability for Catholicism to grow, and, presumably, get more cash and land.  He doesn't appear fazed by losing his vote to invisible ghosts.   He said he singled out abortion, stem-cell research, euthanasia and gay marriage for criticism because they are "intrinsically evil."     Evil , I tells ya!
