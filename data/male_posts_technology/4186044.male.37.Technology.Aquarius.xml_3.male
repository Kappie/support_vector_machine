In fact, I haven't really given a damn about the Olympics since they decided to let professional athletes compete.  Professional athletes get enough television time as it is. I don't want to Serena Williams or Allen Iverson or Brett Hull representing Team USA -- I want the unheralded amateur athletes given perhaps their one and only shot to be in the limelight.  I know Allen Iverson is a great basketball player. But what about the kid who goes to a small Division III college and has managed to escape the glance of NBA scouts? Doesn't he deserve the opportunity to shine?  Brett Hull is the 3rd leading scorer in NHL history. If I want to watch him blast pucks in to the net, I'll watch a Coyotes game. I don't need to watch him at the Winter Olympics. I'd be more interested in watching the kid from Nowhere, South Dakota who plays on the pond and at his small college.  I still watch the events that aren't filled with pros (swimming, mostly) but I can't get into watching the Dream Team play basketball or the NHL All Star team (err...Team USA and Canada) play hockey in the Winter Olympics.  Myabe it's just me, but I think the Olympics needs to be changed back into the World Games where athletic skill, not name brand recognition, is the order of the day.
