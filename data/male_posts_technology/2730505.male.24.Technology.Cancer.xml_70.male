I'm sure there were already some that frequented that bar but last night was ridiculous.  Their IDs said that they were 24 but there was no way these bitches were older than me.  Seriously, they looked young, really young.  Not 24 that's for damn sure.  We played ice basketball with one of our bartender's boobs (Sam you might remember, Heather).  She was working the beer tub and that had some ice.  She would throw ice at our table and we would catch it and throw it back at her.  Except she would lean forward exposing her cleavage as some sort of goal and we would try to get it down her chest.  That was fun.  The bouncers wanted to stop us but Heather said that it was alright so we played for a little while more till someone needed to get a damn drink.   urlLink MSU lost last night .  That sucked.  They were up 10 points at one time and I had them going to at least the Elite 8 possibly even the final 4 if they got hot, they could beat the piss out of Kentucky.  Shit they can't even beat Nevada.  They had a fucking lead.  A 10 point lead.  Ah, oh well.  What's over is over.  Can't do anything about it now.  I still have a lot of shit to move over.  Drawers, TV, computer, computer speakers, shoes, coats/jackets/suits, old liquor bottles, bill bin.  The biggest is the chest of drawers.  I can carry it myself so it's not that heavy.  The drawers are already pulled so all I gotta do is put clothes on the drawers and put them with the actual chest.  the TV, laptop, speakers and a big trash bag of shoes.  I definitely can do this all in one trip.  Meghan is coming to town, I'm happy.  She's helping me move.  She didn't have to drive 4 hours to help me move but she is so that's pretty cool.  After moving the rest of my stuff, we're going to Todai (Japanese buffet, good ass hell buffet) and watch  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind .  That should be pretty good.  I know tomorrow I gotta do some shopping.  We will be going to the Art Museum tomorrow, it'll be my first time there as well.  That should be fun too.  Mmmm, Todai.  Buffet of everything.  Sushi/rolls and Hot Food.  This will be good.  Although I just had a big breakfast, I am still hungry for some Japanese food.
