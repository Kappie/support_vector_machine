I have been a reclusive, non-participating member of this house for far too long. I have not posted in more weeks than i can count (hey, i'm not good with math, okay?) Nor have I taken quizzes or photos which would have included me in the house happenings somewhat... AND I couldn't even manage to get Jonnie's present in the mail before Christmas Eve--and we all know mail doesn't get delivered on X-mas, so he probably doesn't even have it yet... In short: I suck (and while, granted, i DO swallow, that just doesn't count for what it used to).  Anyway, it's been fun, and i love you all (possibly in that creepy, obsessive way that is prominent in stalkers and death row inmantes...).  I will continue to lurk, so watch out... I am blowing kisses toward all of you at this moment-- Lisa
