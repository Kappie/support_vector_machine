The present conflict in the Sudan is the longest running conflict in the world, an ongoing humanitarian disaster that has progressed unimpeded for about 23 years. So why the sudden interest in the Sudan?  I'm beginning to suspect that Sudan has been on the back burner for quite a while. Judging by  urlLink this article  in May, 2001, I believe it was approaching the front burner, until events led us off in a different direction. Would it be too cynical of me to suggest that we had bigger pipelines to seize? In the meantime, the US has at varying times played both good cop and bad cop in it's dealing's with the Sudan. From imposing sanctions, to lifting sanctions, to creating loopholes in the sanctions, etc. Most recently, despite the fact that the government in Sudan reacted "unfavorably" to the Sudan Peace Act passed by the US Congress in October 2002, President Bush, in April 2004, despite the overwhelming humanitarian crisis, refused to impose the sanctions threatened under the Sudan Peace Act, citing a strategy aimed at speeding along the peace process.  On the news front, I have difficulty finding anything making the corporate press about the Sudan until around late June, articles such as  urlLink this one , when I first see a few rumblings from Secretary of State Powell, and almost simultaneously Condoleeza Rice, National Security Advisor. Interestingly, late June is about the time the US handed over sovereignty of Iraq.   The Sudan is probably not at the forefront of most people's minds. But it soon will be. The original trickle of news on the Sudan in late June has turned into a steady stream as the corporate media certainly has been issued it's orders by now. It's only a matter of time before the media shock troops (Hannity, Coulter, Limbaugh) start weighing in. And even the most die hard of liberals will get sucked into the 'humanitarian cause".   Here's your long-shot for the October Surprise. With overwhelming bi-partisan support for the "humanitarian cause", the US enlists the help of the UN to restore peace to the Sudan, and heads up a peacekeeping mission, with the first of our troops hitting the ground in mid to late September. The overwhelming support for this "humanitarian cause", both here and abroad, obliterates the memories of Iraq and propels Bush to re-election.  I'm working on "Sudan 101", a brief primer on the recent history of the Sudan, and hope to have it posted on the over at brotherspeak in the next few days.
