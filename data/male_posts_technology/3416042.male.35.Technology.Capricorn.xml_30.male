I just wanted an adapter that would allow me to use regular headphones with my Treo 600 to listen to music - I have an application that makes it an MP3 player on top of everything else.  The sales guy, Matt, was totally into what the phone did and unhesitantly opened up a couple adapters and a pair of headphones in the store so I could try them out.  When the best choice of adapters didn't quite fit, he suggested trimming down some superfluous plastic so it would.  I asked if that was okay to do, and he said, "Hey, it's all cool, man!  Let's get this thing working before you spend any money on it."  He was looking for an Xacto knife to trim it down, then thought of using a pencil sharpener.  So he opened one of those, and some batteries.  When the adapter wouldn't fit in the pencil sharpener, he just moved on to the next possible solution.  In the end, I walked out of there with the right adapater, modified to fit well on the phone, and pleased with having had a great experience buying something.  How often can you say that?
