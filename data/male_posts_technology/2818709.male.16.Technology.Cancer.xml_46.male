Sing it back. So tell me what do I need when the words lose their meaning. I was spinning free with a little sweet and simple numbing me.  Yeah, stumble until you crawl. Sinking into sweet uncertainty. If you're listening. Are you listening? Sing it back.  I'm still running away. I won't play your hide and seek game. I was spinning free with a little sweet and simple numbing me. What a dizzy dance. This sweetness will not be concerned with me. No the sweetness will not be concerned with me.
