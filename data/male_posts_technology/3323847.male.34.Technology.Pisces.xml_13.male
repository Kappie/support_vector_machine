I like reading Fred's columns because of his raw honesty and his intelligent take on the topics of today.  I can't say I necessarily agree with  everything  the man writes, but because he's such a fantastic writer, I come away having a fresh understanding on the point he's trying to make.  Admittedly, though, his take on things very often mirrors my own.  He's also very funny.  This is the "intelligent funny" one often gets with Dennis Miller, however I find Fred's writings to be higher on the intelligence bar than Dennis'.  Keep your dictionary on hand, though.  This man throws them 10 cent words out there like hot sauce during Mardi Gras. ;)
