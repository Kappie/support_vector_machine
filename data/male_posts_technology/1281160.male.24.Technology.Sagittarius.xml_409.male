But the saddest part is, he's still alive!!!    Hey Sindhu, unnudan, andha Salem rowdy college, pisaasu dept la padicha adhae Madhu dhaan di....Kicha do u know that this Madhu has joined Infy?...  We are planning our visit to India....though not sure, it might probably, be Jan 2004. I'll be coming 2 months before Ganesh.....In that case i'll not register for any courses in Spring.....These plans are highly susceptible to changes.....  This weekend is Vinitha's reception....guess she'll be having a great time.......her parents are here for the occasion.....  Nothing interesting happened last weekend, other than the phone call with my parents......happened to get "samy" movie, after a long time....everytime we go to the Indian store, he used to say, that it's checked out....never cooked...saturday, it was an Indian restaurant...sunday, it was a mexican restaurant....  Tried cooking Turkey(vaan koli) yesterday.....Ganesh only knows abt the taste.....I guess it did turn out quiet good.....that's what Ganesh said....  Are the photos taken at Rini's mrg, processed????.....there are many of us awaiting to see 'em.....  bye...
