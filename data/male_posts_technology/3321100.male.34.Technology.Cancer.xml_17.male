I plug my Camcorder on the card and connectmy computer to Internet by 56k modem.. biiibidibidi...bididididid (it's the 56k connection, wait... wait again...) You are connected ! YESSSS.. And after ??? 200 people was connected to the server...In the 10 first call, nine of us was men (In fact I supposed it was men because I don't show their faces, they played with their... Sure you understand me...) The day after, I called again some people on line (I could be stubborn when I want), and I found Jo.  Jo is a woman (and me a man I know, it's alway like that), living to Delray Beach near Miami. She visited France few month later (with his Husband, ok ?), so we speak about is journey. She undestand my poor english (like you), sometimes I need to speak with my hand (don't forget it was a video conference, I can't do this here sorry). We spoke again the day after, and the day after... Finally 6 month later, we (me and my wife) took plane for miami (I could say that we had prayed to be sure there is someone who waiting us to the Miami airport :s).  I think it was one of my best hollyday. Jo and Scott change my (stupid french) opinion about american people. They are absolutely lovely. Since this time, I had visited other friend over the world and they had visited us. I had many friends now and they are real friends in my real life... I had just a question now... Where I could go this summer ???? Mouahahaha :)
