I can only remember the highlights now but I'll do my best to weave them into a coherant narrative.  I was attending a rehearsal for a production of George Bernard Shaw's  Pygmalion  somewhere up near Lake Tahoe, I believe. Maybe it was an audition.  Anyway, a friend/acquaintance who was somehow connected to the production and I went for a walk and found ourselves in the woods.  We were set upon by two young thugs who roughed us up a tiny bit.  And, while my friend was on the ground, one of the thugs pulled out a pistol and shot him three or four times.  Naturally, I ran.  I then found myself in nice but not great hotel, kind of like the $120/night places in San Francisco--better than the EconoLodge but not quite Hyatt level.  Panicked, I go around trying doors and end up in a room with Janeane Garafalo.  She buys my story of the murder in the woods and gives me refuge.  We end up watching TV side by side on the couch.  Soon we're holding hands and then the TV goes off.  I turn to her and she leans in.  We kiss, a sweet kiss that soon turns more passionate.  My hand moves to her waist and then up inside her t-shirt but she pushes my hand away just as I realize she is not wearing a bra.  Held to first base, but that is still so cool cuz I'm kissing Janeane f-ing Garafalo!    Soon after that I woke up--DAMMIT!--it was about 3am so I went back to sleep.  Next I dream about  seeing  a production of GBS's  Pygmalion  starring some Asian/Pacific Islander guy as Professor Higgins.  The dude was good but just odd casting.    Odd that I would dream so much about a particular literary work, no?  But what is Shaw's play about?  Transformation of a bright but rough young girl who has been cheated by circumstance into the wonderful, desireable, and self-actualized creature she should be.  Such is my hope with my daughter Madeline.  She is in the hospital right now under 24-hour observation, hooked up to an EEG and under constant video survelliance to more accurately map her siezures.  If they can pinpoint the focus of the siezures to a particular point in her brain, as seems likely given that her MRI showed slight scarring in the area wher the previous EEGs indicated the siezure came from, then she is a good candidate for surgery.  A prospect that at once inspires and terrifies me.  I mean, we're talking brain surgery here.  F-ing with the essential organ of being for my daughter.  Just the mere contemplation of it brings tears to my eyes.  But on the other hand, this procedure holds a very good chance of curing her from her epilepsy and probably aiding the coping of her learning disabilities as a result of that. Oh, what she could become if this shroud of seizures could be lifted from her!  I wonder what transformation she would undergo.    Meanwhile, I'm just going to label the friend getting shot and making out with Janeane Garafalo as non sequiter brain dumps.  It's just safer that way.
