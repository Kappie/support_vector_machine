Firstly, they took way too long to setup the story, the hulk doesn't even appear until like more than an hour into the movie. Secondly it was way too serious for a movie that was based on a comic book, the first part of the movie focused on Bruce's problem of opening up to his girlfriend and repressed memories of a traumatic incident in his childhood that was causing him nightmares. I only enjoyed the final hour of it to be honest. Oh ya the movie is 2 1/2 hours long.   Oh and I bought Radiohead's new album today, the limited edition which comes in a booklet, its really pretty and really cheap, only 18.99! Will probably be listening to it the whole day tommorow on repeat, will post a review soon!
