Friday:::::  Left work early to make it to MI early and be able to do stuff.  Actually I left early enough to be able to have enough time to get "certain requests" from Chicago to bring to MI for the dear girlfriends friends.  Jamba Juice was one of them.  Unfortunately, as soon as I (settled?, hehe) came upon this wonderful establishment of fresh juice smoothies, I realized that there was no possible way for me to have this thing stay in it's smoothie state for the 4 hour drive to East Lansing.  I then called the girlfriend to inform her of this unfortunate news.  I then went to a Chicago souvenir store and bought this yellow bag.  Myeh, it works.  Started going to EL but the traffic was terrible.  It was just bad but by the time I reached Indiana, it was smoothie sailing from there.  Got to Melrose around 10 EST.  I brought up the souvenirs that I brought up.  We watched an episode of live action Sailor Moon.  All I can say about that is the girls are definitely cute!  Dare I say, if they dressed up and they're not in their ridiculous sailor moon uni's, they would definitely be spank bank material.  Saturday:::::  Saturday was such a long day.  not long in the sense that it was long because things were bad, it was a long day because I did so many things thus really making the whole day seem short.  It was great!  Woke up at 8:30 AM (yeah, fucking Saturday and I'm freakin' up at 8:30) to get ready and get breakfast for golf with Ted at Indian Hills near East Lansing.  that was fun.  I beat Ted by 1 stroke after doing so well the first six holes, I eventually broke down and had my worst scores for the entire course on the remaining 3 holes.  Ted took his lumps early during the round and eventually settled in nicely with his play.  It was relaxing.  nice weather, sun was not hot, it wasn't humid at all.  the grass was nicely cut and the greens weren't too fast.  I actually think I hit some sort of structure the first drive I hit.  It might have hit the railing on the street.  Yeah, first drive, first ball, out of bounds by a lot.  Yeah, that was pretty funny.  After golf, we then proceeded to go to Chase's place to rendezvous with everyone (Chase, Mark P, Ike, Raj, Geoff, Charles).  the trip there was fun indeed.  I think I broke 110 on Michigan 127 as I squeezed between a pickup and a granny driven Buick as Ted got boxed in by those two.  He eventually caught up and we raced up to 110 and finally slowed down for fear of going to jail (yeah we were more scared of a damn ticket than death, is there something wrong with that picture?)  We got to Chase's and relaxed for a bit.  A little while later, Mark P. got there and we all got back to our nerdy-playing gay-but-we're-really-straight states reminiscent of the good old college days.  That was quite fun.  Ike got there next and busted out Worms 3d.  It was for the PS2.  Fun game, still need to develop and fine tune skills for playing competitively but it's definitely one of the better $30 items one can send $30 on.  See, we were supposed to have a few rules but there was just one instated.  There's a max of people that can play at one time and each team (depending on how many people are playing can have a max of 4 worms on each of their team.  So anyway, the last two players should stay (kinda like winner stays) and they take a shot to "even out the playing field.  Yeah, so that went on a little while.  We reminisced on what has happened the last 6-7 years that we've known each other.  That's fucking crazy! 7 years!  Raj was actually a little lost because he thought we were going to meet at fucking Crunchiest and he called us from there to tell us to head out already.  So we Crunchy's up and headed for Crunchy's in East Lansing.  I was graciously given a chance by Ted Pokorski to drive his newly busted-out-of-the-garage-S2000 to be driven to the bar/restaurant.  Yes, that was fun!  I honestly forgot for a split second there that the way to start the damn thing was by pressing a button.  I forgot and quickly realized but decided to play along to see the reaction on Ted's face.  yes, after we got that figured out, I stalled it out because I forgot the damn parking brake!  So I got that figured out.  We left.  Hell, I was just glad to be able to drive the damn thing that I wasn't even thinking about how it needed to be pinched to the high RPM of 8000 to really appreciate the engineering marvel that is the Honda S2000.  So we got a red light, I was lined up to a beater but it didn't matter for a second.  Saw a cop turn to go the other direction and straight ahead (about 1/8th of a mile) was the exit for the freeway to get to the bar.  GREEN!!!  jumped on the clutch, revved it to 7000, it was asking for more, going 37 mph.  -snick- wind getting louder, engine crying for more revving it up to 7500 and it was still screaming for more, going 55. -snick- pushed to third and we're at the on ramp! going 68 in 3rd.  Yeah...that was quick!  I love how it has to be past 5000 for the VTEC to kick in.  The damn thing is an absolute DOG if you drive it like a normal car.  I'm going to quote Ted's quote that he got from this one guy about the car.  He said that to get the best performance out of the car, you should drive it like you absolutely hate the car.  Yes, absolutely hate the car.  Well, I can do that...EASY!  So we're on the on ramp and Ted tells me to leave it in 3rd gear.  We're going 50 and to leave it in 3rd.  We get on the highway and he tells me to punch it.  yeah, it's still got some balls even going fast.  So going fast, going fast, and we had to slow down since we were going to be going through downtown Lansing and it's only 55 there.  Yeah, slowing down, appreciating the weather.  the sun was out blocked by a few clouds.  We then got to an open area with our exit just a few hundred yards away.  I decided to downshift and push the car a little bit.  -snick- 3rd gear, 65 mph, wind getting louder -snick- 4th gear, 95 mph exit coming up, -snick- 5th gear 110, brake for the exit...slow...slow...slow down to 35 mph.  yeah, I love that car.  I want one.  I want one BAD!  I really had to work hard for the damn thing to have it's tired screech.  I was able to do it still though, harder work but the same technique.  It's seems like a cardinal sin to hear an engine scream like that but scream for more.  Ooooo....that car is great.  we got on Grand River and we're about to take a left turn into the street before Beaners and being the retard that I am, I got the sweet idea to get the ass end loose for a little bit.  So I swung the car around a little as I punched it and it went for just a little bit.  good thing there weren't any cars turning.  There was however a cop that had to turn around because of the noise that I made in Ted's car taking that turn.  OOoo...so close.  Yeah, so close!!!  I didn't realize that the car is so light that really underestimate how much the ass end would go.  I was a little surprised therefore I let go of the gas and wasn't able to completely straighten out.  Good thing since, again, the damn East Lansing PD squad car was right there!  needless to say, we were lucky, very lucky.  We ate Crunchy's, listened to a few jocks cheer loudly as it seems that their lives were complete after a certain team would pick their choice.  Yeah.  Still fun.  We talked about Caf-to-Go and how it was such an invaluable tool in having fun at Brody.  So much wasted food.  It really didn't stop there, I still hear stories of how things were just as bad at Mason Abbot.  yeah, open windows are just a bad idea when you live around the caf I suppose.  After a much needed medium well crunchy burger with everything on it.  we headed back for a little nerdery and drinking.  Ted drove on the way back.  I really wanted to relinquish the ability to kill ourselves in a two seater convertible that I really really really want and want to drive fast!  It was just the smart thing to do, or was it?  So we're both full and I figured Ted would be the one to be the safe on.  Ooops, guess not!  He was doing well for a while and then we got to the 70 mph area on 496 and he just let it rip.  WOW, WHAT A FUCKING RUSH!  Yes, we were hauling assssssssssssssssssssssss.  Top down, nice weather.  ZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMM!  132 mph.  132!!!!  Yeah.  It was fast.  It's definitely a different feeling to go that fast with the top down.  the wind gets louder and as you reach 120 with the top down, the wind slowly quiets down.  You really can't hear anything else.  it's just silent.  There's a clear area in your field of vision and everything else is a blur.  Wow.  It was exhilarating.  We passed an Impala going 132 and the Impala was looking like it just stood still (at about 65 mph) yeah.  Crazy shit.  We actually had to wait till after we had passed the bridge and passed the dip before opening up the car.  Who knows what's after that bridge and bump, a car going slow, a car changing lanes, a cop on the side of the road?  A lot of shit could have happened if we were being stupid about it.  Good thing we really weren't.  If you going to go fast, go fast when no one is around.  Don't kill anyone else because you're being stupid.  Do it on your own and make sure no one else is around as to not be collateral damage.  Needless to say, we got from the outskirts of Lansing to Creyt's Road in about 80 seconds.  Yeah, fast as fast can be.  We got to Chase's and Ted was still shaking.  It was funny.  I guess he hasn't done that before.  he just stuck around the 120 mark (which I did manage to reach today driving back from MI).  We had a beer and everything was fine.  Hehe.  I'll never forget the sensation of everything being a blur and shit not having a sound.  It seemed as if things we're in slow motion, even though I was in the passenger seat!  Much nerdery was to follow. yes, way to much.  Played Worms 3D.  I named my team MIS and named my worms various IP addresses (local host, a machine at work, my weblog, default IP for a wireless router, broadcast IP address etc.) yeah pretty nerdy.  It was great.  we played and played and drank and played and played some more that was drank some more.  I eventually calmed down and decided to work on pop and water so I would be sober enough to meet Meghan's friends and watch "Into The Woods"  Drove back to Meghan's and met Leslie.  She's pretty cool.  Laid back.  Knows the Simpson's so it's definitely a bonus.  I took a shower and headed off to meet Jaime and Annie at Wharton.  we got there and found our seats.  I met Annie and Jamie.  I then told Jamie that I was sorry for not being able to bring Jamba juice to EL since it would have probably turned into some sort of liquid juice by now and not a smoothie.  I really didn't have a lot of time to interact with them since they had their own thing going.  I was just there observing everyone.  have you ever been in a situation where you don't know anyone and they're all talking and you really don't know what to say because you really don't know what to say and didn't want to look stupid.  yeah, it was one of those scenarios.  It was alright, I'm glad the musical was shared with me.  I enjoyed.  I really did and I would go to another one if given the opportunity to do so.  It was a parody on all a lot of the fairytales and I tied them all into one story.  From Cinderella to Jack and the bean Stalk.  It was great.  I liked the dialogue.  It was smart and funny.  I also liked the delivery of the actors.  They were pretty good.  I liked The Baker the most.  He was good.  Baker's wife also complemented the Baker nicely.  I also liked Little Red Riding hood.  She seemed to steal the scene every time she was on stage.  Cinderella was just not there.  Her voice sounded hollow and not enough air was going through.  Overall I thought it was entertaining, I was smirking and smiling a couple of times during the musical.  I would recommend it for people to see if they want to see something different and good.  After that I drove Leslie and Meghan back to her house so that the dear girlfriend can drive me back to the guys so I wouldn't have to worry about getting wasted and having to drive back. How sweet!  It was totally out of the way too and she had to be rude to her friends and leave them to pick me up.  That was really nice and I want to tell you that I appreciated that.  Thanks again for picking my ass up.  After that, I was glad that we were going to be hanging out with Jamie and Nilesh (Jamie's BF) and Annie and Leslie (well Leslie was sleeping already).  That was fun.  We played "The Typing of the Dead" for dream cast.  It's pretty much typing to shoot your gun at the zombies.  Yes, lame yet ridiculously fun.  I suck at typing but I get by at work.  It's all good!  We then played SORRY!  That too was also fun!  Man I can just think of so many ways to transform SORRY! into a drinking game.  I don't know if it would be fun but I am sure willing to try.  Annie won.  She got the lucky 7 and split the moves to two pieces and BAM! she won the whole thing.  Me and Meghan were actually the ones winning.  She was so close to winning and I was just a little bit behind (in board positions).  Yeah, that game started out slow but it got faster.  That was the first time I had ever played SORRY!  Cool board game.  I want to play again.  This time, for real!  After everyone had gotten tired and decided to go home, Meghan and I just spent the rest of our waking hours talking and unwinding.  It was relaxing.  Sunday:::::  Woke up and ate pizza, played some more typing of the dead and after Meghan had beaten the FINAL EXAM (which was hard, you had to kill 100 zombies and it's not just words you type, you also have to type random letters, phrases and sentences.  Wow!  It was hard for me but eventually Meghan was able to get it.  Good thing I don't need to type that fast or else I would be dead in the water.  We then used bit torrent to "bit-torrent" the latest episode of Smallville and we watched that.  It was where Chloe had some ability of being able to get the absolute truth from people.  Sounds like a fun ability.  Too bad you die in like 4 days or some shit.  Myeh.  She did more studying and I watched the Cubs.  (Cubbies won!!!) and after passing out for a nap, we went to P.F. Chang's and had Chinese for our dinner date.  Good food, I'd eat it again but it's really not the place if you want to have a nice talk during dinner.  I felt bad for Meghan too since she was severely affected by her allergies.  That sucked!  she had to take allergy medicine to be able to study and function but it made her all weird and a little off.  We then went back to her place so she can study some more and me to flip to channels (it's really all I do on Sundays, be it that I'm in Michigan or IL).  Watched a little bit of Futurama and Spider-Man.  Yada Yada.  We went to sleep.  Monday :::::  I got up early to go to work.  Showered and kissed Meghan good bye and went on my merry way.  Got to the gas station and looked in my wallet and no credit card!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  GREAT!!!  no fucking card.  Looked around the car maybe I left it around there somewhere but nope, not there.  Looked at my wallet again and not there still.  I gave up and figured that I must have left it at the restaurant last night.  Called the girlfriend up to inform her of the news and she was kind enough to let me stay till the place opened.  Fell asleep and woke up around 10.  Meghan got ready, I got my card from the restaurant and drove the Michigan girl to Wells hall for her classes.  Kissed goodbye and off to work I went.  Nice drive, weather was nice, I was able to spot the cops cars like crazy and yeah, I finally got my car up to 121 mph.  On this lonely stretch of highway on US 69.  A Saab 9-3 Aero came up behind me and I was already doing 85.  I just decided fuck it, no one around, it's straight, the lanes going the other way is blocked by trees, eh, let's go, so I downshifted and punched it.  Got up to about 95 and had to shift to 5th and got that sucker up to 121 until I came upon some traffic a little whiles ahead.  I didn't want to risk it anymore so that was that.  Got to work and my punishment was to work the rest of my 8.5 hours.  So here I am working till 10:30 PM.  If anyone is out there, gimme a holla.  Peace out.  I had a good weekend, I hope that you did too!  Thanks again to my wonderful girlfriend (yes I am gushing) for everything this weekend Thanks to all of the nerds and geeks of the Dungeon Crew (again I am gushing) for a fun night at Chase's place.  I enjoyed quite thoroughly as well.  See I told you this was going to be a long entry.  Sorry for that by the way!  Have a great week!
