I love their accents, I bet he's popular with the ladies... no really, I bet he is.  I wish I was Australian. Not cause I want to be popular with ladies, one is enough, but it'd be cool to have that accent. Maybe when I'm older I'll move there so my kids get the accent, you know, living my dreams through them.
