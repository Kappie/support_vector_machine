Not that I have stopped listening to chick music ( urlLink Tori ,  urlLink LTC ,  urlLink The Sundays ) or punk ( urlLink Bad Religion ,  urlLink Millencolin ,  urlLink Pulley ,  urlLink Guttermouth ).  Lately, I have been listening to  urlLink Sloan  and  urlLink Radiohead , and a lot of rap mixed in between.  Laura and I spent a good hour downloading and listening to a bunch of old school rap songs.  Check them out  urlLink here !
