Right well its nice to know your all dealing with all this 'pre-exam stress' as well as me, and are as on top of all the work. I have been fairly busy, last week genrally was not good, you could even say it was bad. saturday i spent the whole day i ,mean like 14 hours solidly building my electronics project. GOOD LORD WHY DID I TAKE ELECTRONICS. and today sunday, i spent at AMF partly to see my mate, mainly to attend my cousins birthday party (she is 5) that was all very good fun, and while i was there i broke my current ten pin bowling top score (which now stands at 141) (without barriers) as if any of you actually care! Anyway i have to sleep now, another great day of school to dream about tommrow. Talk to you all soon. Dave
