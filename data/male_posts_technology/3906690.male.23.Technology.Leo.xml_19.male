The beginning of this entry was the only sentence I wrote. Well like the intro of this paragraph, this past week has been a busy one. Can you imagine 50 hours in four days? :P It all started with locations pressuring to their maximum and then finally bursting, making a huge mess which had to be cleaned before word got out to Navajo EPA...cover up jobs.  Tuesday, was the beginning of these so called crucial jobs. We got to the job site and there was a strong odor of H2S. There were oil and gas everywhere, puddles of it. We had our tailgate safety meeting, planned what to do in case if something goes wrong, and finally chose an escape route. We started with connecting hoses to the vacuum truck and pumped as much as we could into the truck. After this we disconnected all flanges and valves that connected to the Skim Tank that blew. Oh yea, the skim tank bursting is the reason why we were out there in the first place. After we unbolted all that needed to be, we started blinding off lines, and changed around valves because there was a section of flow line that was taken out of the entire set up. This took us the entire day into the evening. I got home at around 9:00 or so, soaked in oil and H2S...  On Wednesday we continued work at the same location because all we did the day before was unbolted lines, flanges, and switched valves. This is the day we started the actual clean up and it sucked because there was no other way to get all that mud oil out but to use wheel burrows and by hand. I didn't really mind because I had a good workout, even though it sucked. Again, Thursday and Friday was a continuation of the job at Area 6. Only this time it was sort of laid back because the past two days before these days we got a lot done, but still, a lot of hours.  Yesterday I turned 23. I didn't do much except sleep in, then head into town just for a drive and to eat out. Kinda funny, I ran into people whom I haven't seen in the longest time, family included. I got back...oh, and I talked with Ana for an hour or so, maybe more. I got a beautiful gift from her and a card included. Just as I got off the phone with her, my brother came around..."yea, we were told to pick you up" and I was like "ok." I ended up at my aunt's home, and she had a cookout for the occasion...it was good. During the Lil celebration I got called out to work. I needed the hours so I took the call.  And now that I'm back from work, at 2:30 in the morning or so, I've decided to continue where I left off when I started this entry, seeing that it's been five days or so since I wrote anything. Hmm, I guess I could write more but I'm too tired to write anything else, and anything else probably wouldn't sound good in my condition...I'll just post something along with this entry. This piece isn't done yet...and it doesn't have a title as well.  *ABC-123* Finally our time has come to kill off the less fortunate and take whats ours  You better watch out cause here we come destruction using the mind  *my mind, my mind, my mind* *yea*  you tell me im wrong but look at you all i see is envy taking what was once yours  what do you have to say? nothing comes from your mouth this is how its going to be destruction using the mind  *my mind, my mind, my mind* *yea*  what you see is what you get its time to get use to the new destruction using the mind welcome to my world Copyright  2004 SJohnson
