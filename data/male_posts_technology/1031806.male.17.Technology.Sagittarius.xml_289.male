In her Feb. 3rd post she has an overview of the whole pro life / choice issue from what seems to be an unbiased standpoint. I haven't read much of her stuff (indeed, not even all of the abortion write up), but what I've seen I like. Most of the people that comment on her site are far left liberals, but I like some of what she herself has to say. Go check it out and tell me what you think.
