You see the issues they have, the strange and painful behaviour those issues cause, and you understand it, cause similar shit goes on in your life. Sometimes it drives you insane. But you can't get too upset about anything they do or say, cause you know your own issues lead you to do and say things that must be at least as maddening to them.  I have... had... I don't know... a friend like that. Sometimes more than a friend. At the moment, we're barely talking. I don't know if things between us are going to get better, worse, or just fade away completely.  Maybe it'd be better if it did just fade away, for her at least.  Or maybe that'd just lead to her taking even more codeine and ending up dead from overdose.  As for me? I have no idea.
