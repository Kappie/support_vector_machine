It was a sunny 73 degree day with a slight breeze that was just strong enough to keep me cool but not slow me down.  I wore the shoes of yellow majesty and they wisked me along effortlessly.  I went way further than expected as I tried my best to run to the Coffee Emporium to visit Sarah.  Unbeknownst to me, the CE is easily more than 5 miles from my house making for a run that is significantly longer than I had anticipated or desired today.  I stopped short of the CE and probably still covered just over 7 miles in about 65 minutes.  I felt surprisingly good and the only thing that I noticed was a little tiredness mixed with a slight knee pain near the end of the run on Madison.  It was okay though, I had the wonderful sounds of !!! (chk chk chk) to carry me up the hill on Madison and all the way home.    A lot of what kept me running today was the excitement of running the NYC marathon in November.  In case you haven't guessed, I am dang excited to run the marathon that inspired me to start running in my favorite city on the planet.  Go NYC!  The final thought of the day comes from the energizing sounds of !!!. "Now get on down...  And shake that butt!"  Have a great weekend and enjoy this weather!
