Apparently, the technology’s growth has been hindered by Libertarian crack smokers who don’t want the government to know what they buy with their credit cards or what porn sites they visit on the web. Oh, and they do take a stab at Bill Safire. To a degree I think TIA is a good thing and certainly worth investigating. Stopping at the possibility because it could be dangerous is, in this day and age, just ignorant.
