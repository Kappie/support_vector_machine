But yeah, he did one Trek movie, so he's set to do the convention circuit for life.  And he was there this year.  And I met him.  And my life will never be the same.  I am a changed woman.  Because I met Alan "Cameron Frye" Ruck.  Among other famous people.  But I will post all about that on my LJ in due time, just as soon as I quit cruisin' down the Lortab Highway.
