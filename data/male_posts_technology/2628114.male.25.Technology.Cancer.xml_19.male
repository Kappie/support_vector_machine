With the combination of stress, sleep deprivation, and residual knee and lower leg pain this run was not much good at all.  I would still have to classify my "after drinking a pitcher of beer" morning run as the worst so at least there are some standards.  The run started out somewhat bad as I struggled to find a good pace or rhythm or something.  I stopped for frequent walks (5-6 in all) as my body just wasn't feeling it today.  I probably completed 40 of my planned 45 just with a lot of walking and low motivation.  Even though it wasn't the best run today, there were still things to learn.  For starters, as hilly treacherier as Eden Park and Mt. Adams are, they are sweet runs with all sorts of fun options.  Secondly, for those who use mp3 players or radios on runs, if you are ever listening to show tunes with dialog from the show, try not to mistake the voices on the song with real people and almost step off a curb or run into a sign.  Not to say that any of that happened?  I think that's all for the update today.
