Thank god for Orla is all I'll say :)  Anyway, finally getting the cafe together, got chairs today, have pretty much decided on a colour, have a load of flooring to put down as soon as time allows and then all will be right with the world or some such..  Got the office sorted out too so I can actually do some real work during the day! Woohoo!!  K, my nearest and dearest (Orla) just walked in the door so I finally have something better to do :)  bbye now :)
