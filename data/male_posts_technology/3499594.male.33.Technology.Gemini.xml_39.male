A circuit went out that wiped out all Quest interfaces. This effected over 4 hospitals (on quest).   Seen on this mornings Fox News 35 bloggers are at the DNC party this week. Fox spoke with one of them. He wasn't to articulate but he did manage to state the fact that it is a persons unedited form of journalism.  I did get to see the discussion of Michael Moore and Bill Orielly last night. Talk about two separate worldviews. The discussion was basically like a hot potatoe being passed back and forth. Seems the only way Bill was able to get Michael to speak was to corner him and they did it that same time. I think Bill won the argument.   51 people killed in a car bombing in Iraq this morning in Bakubah. It was so bad, to effect 6 buildings. How horrible for those over there. I wonder if it will be brought up in the DNC, or will it be off their radar.   I am still waiting to hear a 'why' we should vote for Kerry. Seems they are not so much as making it a dichotomy of Kerry-Bush, rather Democratic-Republican. I think the non-bashing is baffling the news people, but I am not really surprised. Don't they recall Bush has been saying you can't run a Nation on hate. ( because of all the Bush bashing this year ) So it only makes sense they are trying their best not to present themselves as hate-mongers. Too me its too late. But I am sure there are those out there that will be duped. I get excited to hear people up here in PA that sees the facts, but amazed at some that still believe in the craziness of the liberal ideology.  Hopefully tonight I can sit with a peer for a dinner. He is also remote and in this week.
