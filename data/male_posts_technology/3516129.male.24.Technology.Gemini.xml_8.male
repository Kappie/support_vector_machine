Apart from the dreadful constant that is being a game tester, it's been a whirlwind around here. Rina was nice enough to stay for awhile and just a few days later, Shelly came home from school.   Having Rina here for about a week was fun as hell. We both had a great time and shared dozens of laughs (as you can see in her detailed recap!).
