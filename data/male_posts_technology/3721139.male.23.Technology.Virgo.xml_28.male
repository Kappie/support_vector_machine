Redemption.  My Father has given me such a rich life; He has watered my heart, and shown me how to change and grow.  You, O Lord, keep my lamp burning; my God turns my darkness into light (Ps 18:28). I trust in your unfailing love; my heart rejoices in your salvation. I will sing to the Lord, for he has been good to me (Ps 13:5-6).
