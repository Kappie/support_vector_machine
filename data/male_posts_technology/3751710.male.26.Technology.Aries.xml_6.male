This implies that about 40% of the pants were crumpled down around my ankles.    For me to earn my stripes as a Grease Monkey, the main job of the day was to change Aaron's front disk brakes.  On one side the pad was completely worn down and the  urlLink rotor  nearly destroyed.  On the other side the rotor and calipers were still usable, we just needed to replace the pads.  Without boring you with the details, I learned an important fact:  Something as small as a single nut can add many hours to an otherwise simple job!  Problems like this can be avoided by taking care when doing routine maintenance on your car, and by not over-tightening nuts and bolts.  So because of a very stubborn nut, which Aaron had several choice words for, a job that should have taken 2-4 hours ended up taking two days.  There is also a remote possibility that my presence might have slowed down the progress a little bit...  But once I figured out how to use the floor jack I was off and running.  I also have to brag that at one point I sprayed brake cleaner into my eye.  Just a word of caution, but getting something that dissolves grease into one's eye is not a pleasant experience.  I thought surely this act of bravery would earn me credit as a Grease Monkey.  I was wrong.  It turns out that everyone agrees that this is a stupid thing to do.  The final rite of passage for becoming a Grease Monkey is actually far worse.  It is something that would make even the most hardened Navy Seal quiver.  Just the sight of it would kill those with OCD.  The path from tinkering amateur to Grease Monkey is completed by one thing (brace yourself):  Eating without washing one's hands.  I did this.  With oil, brake fluid, brake cleaner, new grease, old grease and other car guts all over my hands and under my fingernails I ate dinner.  In a garage there is just no time to clean up for meals.  And thus I earned my stripes.  We also changed the oil in both our car's, but to a Grease Monkey this is as trivial as ordering tacos.  I would like to thank Ford, General Motors, Saturn, Autozone, Spring Hardware, and my advisor, Aaron Chilcutt for making this possible.  Jacob Foshee G.M., M.S.
