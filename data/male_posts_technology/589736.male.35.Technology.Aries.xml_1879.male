It has already started this morning with Lieberman calling out Dean on Meet the Press concerning the course of action Dean wanted to take with regards to Iraq.  Does anyone else that Bush is starting to resemble Reagan with his ability to get through/around political trouble?  Remember the Teflon President?  I'm asking whether you agree with either's politics, as I know most of you don't.  Just whether you see any similarity.
