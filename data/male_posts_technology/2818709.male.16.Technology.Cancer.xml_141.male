Could be because the bed support thingi was sharp, i dont know. It exploded. It was all like *SPARK!!!!* and we were all like "OMG". And then we saw the wire. yeah, it lit up the whole room. Eric started to grab the wire, and i said "OMGWTF!!! YOU IDIOT!! UNPLUG IT FIRST." That would just make my day perfect. Watching eric be electocuted. Good times.
