So effectively, i have 21days, before my final academic battle ends. After that, i am going to party like hell, drink like hell, create a wreakage, here in Melbourne. But wait, my parents are coming on the 26/6/04 early hours. So, if u do a little bit of maths, i have 29hrs to party like hell, drink like hell. Pathetic? Well,i work try to work things out somehow.  In order to refrain myself from watching too much tv, i had done the following,  1.stick motivation poster on the tv screen  it works, coz i am too lazy to walk up and take down the motivation poster.UNless it's Jerry Springer show,Oprah,Queer Eye for the straight guy,Something about Miriam.  Recently there is this reality show i am rather plugged into, thats "Something about Miriam". Its about this girl, whom there are suitors going after her, but miriam isn't a girl by nature. Cool huh? i have been trying to analyse anything going on down there. But sadly...ain't see  anything..  Anyway, after exams, my parents are coming, so perhaps we are going to the snow mountains, to Perth, hopefully, i can get out of Melb,(by myself?heh) to somewhere.. Perhaps after 2.5years of academics, its time for me to take a hard-earned break. I need it. Please dun take it away from me. I implore.  Went to revision lecture today, nothing much gained, coz i haven started on that subject yet. Its about .NET technologies et al. Misssomeonebackinsghopeeverythingturnsoutwell.  That's it.
