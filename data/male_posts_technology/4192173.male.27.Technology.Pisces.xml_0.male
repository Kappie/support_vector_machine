Upon returning home, I go and transfer a ton of files to the tower computer, which is pretty much maxed out as well. Everything works in it ecxept of course for Cubase. I'm just happy to have my baby back. Then I go out for a few hours come back, and around about midnight, while moving some files out of it, it crashes again. I almost crapped myself with disgust. Of course this happen when I'm leaving for Chicago tomorrow and LA on Tuesday. I can't win.  I'm off to apple literally right now. Bastards.  F
