It wasn't so bad after all except I was getting a pretty good stitch on my right side. I was surprised I wasn't severely fatigued after, which I was expecting to be. After that the rest of the class he devoted to stretching, and I'm feeling pretty refreshed after it - good change after all the fighting training I'd been doing. :)
