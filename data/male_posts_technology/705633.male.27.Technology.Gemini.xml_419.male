We are in Banff a month ago on holiday, and a waitress brings over our breakfast. She says "Okay, be careful guys.. these plates are really hot" Scott looks up and says.. "Give me your hand a second?" so, like a fool, i do.. and he presses it down hard on my smouldering hot plate. I'm crying in pain and laughter, the waitress shoots us a look like we just beamed down from a mothership.  Anyway we were winding each other up coming back from lunch today, pushing each other into walls, tripping each other up, etc. generally acting like eight year olds. One of our security cameras captured a special moment of male bonding between us.  urlLink Click here to see it.
