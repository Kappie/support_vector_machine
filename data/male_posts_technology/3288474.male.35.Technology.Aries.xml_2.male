Weather was perfect, and this is the second time we go to the safari, we planed the schedule very well and make the full day exactly finish all of the attractions in the park(Drive Through Game Reserve, Jungle Playground, Parrot Paradise show,Elephant Roundup demonstration, A scenic railway tour, Pets' Corner, Birds of Prey flying demonstration, take a cruise aboard the "African Queen"), only thing left out is the water play which Burwin dose not like. Even the food in the Mombasa market restaurant we enjoy it and not too expensive.  After the whole day tour, we are exhausted and I am afraid we would be too tire to play like this every day.
