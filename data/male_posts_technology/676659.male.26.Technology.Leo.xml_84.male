After hearing the local and world news reports it is no wonder the hearts of unsaved men and women give into fear of the near future.  Dearest Saint, we want you to know that prayer and faith in the promises of God can change things!   They will hold us firm and steadfast, like an anchor for our souls, even in the midst of turbulent times. Here are some of those promises made by the Almighty     "If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways;                                    then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land."    ~ 2 Chronicles 7:14- ~  "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways."   ~ Psalm 91:1-7, 10  11~  As we join together with Pastor Benny and Suzanne Hinn  while watching the March 3rd program praying for a visitation from Heaven, let's believe for God's mighty hand to stretch fourth and perform signs and wonders.  Stand on His promises of supernatural protection and provision for you and your loved ones.   Remember to pray for President Bush as the leader of America and the leaders of the nations of the world, as well as, praying for all the men and women in the military who are placing themselves in harms way for us all.  Last and most important, that Jesus be glorified through it all and that a great multitude of souls will be saved as a result!  Thank you for your prayers and support.  May goodness and mercy follow you all the days of your life.  In His service,    urlLink Benny Hinn Ministries
