I put in a lot...but do not know where it will bring me to. It's scary and frightening and even stressed when there is nothing to do.   I want to talk to someone always but time is always not enough for me nowadays. I have nice weekends playing mahjong for the past three weeks.   Working can be very sad when everything do not work out. But when it is your own business, no matter what it has to work out. Perhaps that is it keep me going! I want my own first pot of gold!!!! Worth it or not is still too early to say but decision must be well made.  Let get this over and done with so I can go another step higher than ever before. 5 more months! The faster you climb the harder you fall...I used to hear this from someone. But I hope 5 months is not to fast huh? Fast or slow depend on individual's context.   Anyway the most important thing is. I got nothing to lose.
