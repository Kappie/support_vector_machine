Had an absolutely amazing weekend.. Friday night myself and Orla went for Drinks.. Started out with a little light shopping for Orla and Siobhan and a little light drinking for me and J-Money (Yes, the great Ash.. I haven't seen him since the fire of '03..) in Capitol.  Then me and Jonny met up with Orla in Ba Mitzu, A few drinks (and the now fabled "Dave" turning up) later and all is slightly fuzzy with the world.. Off to chips and a quick stop in Ri-Ra to realize just how drunk we are.. I get sappy when drunk and apparently I was drunk from the chippy on.. I have only Orlas word for this so I assume she lies and I am just too damn sexy to resist when drunk so she took me home.. Again I was drunk so I refute the accusation that I collapsed into bed and crashed comatose.. I think I was a sex god and she just doesn't wanna admit it..  Then on Sat we were just too damn hungover for anything more than the basic activities of the day.. Spent the evening watching DVD's and relaxing really.. Again.. VERY nice :)  Hmm Sunday.. What did I do sunday.. Ah yes, Sunday went up to my mothers for a little while then went on to Dinner in Coopers and a movie (Second Hand Lions, Bloody brilliant movie if you want something a little different..  Monday then was another relaxing day. Did home stuff with the GF.. (I love doing home stuff with the GF..)  Then today I had my last battle with the Dentist, Last tooth out and I am finally done! Wh0ot!  K, I think my Blood is ALMOST dry so I am gonna go put on another coat..  See you all Spoon.
