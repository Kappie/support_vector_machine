What happened to all these 100-page reports, where is that Dick Cheney report? Why is every single issue treated like they have never thought it would come up? What's with the juggling of people and ideas about how to form that "interim government"? Why does it feel like they are using the [lets-try-this-lets-try-that] strategy? Trial and error on a whole country?     That's an interesting perspective from someone living inside the country.     Can anyone tell me what the return of children to schools really means? ... I mean there are a million more pressing issues for these committees meeting daily than getting children back to unsafe schools.    He's paying $5 an hour for Internet access. I think if everyone who reads his blog regularly gave him $1, he wouldn't have to worry about the price of Internet access...  Scott
