If the name sounds familiar, it's because it is loosely based on the Akira Kurosawa film  Shinchin no samurai  (Seven Samurai), a story of 7 samurai warriors who band together to defend a village against bandits.  The Kurosawa story is set right smack in the middle of feudal Japan. Samurai 7 doesn't mention where or when it is set, but it appears to be "modern / immediate future" in a modernized, albeit feudal Japan.  The series, so far, kicks an enormous amount of ass.  Try taking a look for episodes. If you're stuck, send me an e-mail and I'll help out...   urlLink fnord_523@yahoo.com
