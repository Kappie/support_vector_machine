As for the "bought" team that wears the gayest colors of any football team anywhere from any time ( not counting any teams from NFL Europe because those just don't count  for anything) they will have a disappointing season as usual.  The best team on paper will not get it down on the field.  I am looking for alot of injuries or egos that get in the way of them doing anything this year.  Once again Dolphins will never win another Super Bowl again!   Look for the Buc to return to and win once again the Super Bowl.  There team has not changed much and no one can do anything against the best "D"  in the NFL.   Or dare I say 49'ers???  AFC MVP: Ricky Williams or Tommy Maddox  NFC MVP :  Jeff Garcia   Week 1  ( Predictions By me) Thursday, Sept.4 N.Y. Jets at Washington, 9:00 pm  ---->  Washington by 7 Sunday, Sep. 7  Arizona at Detroit, 1:00 pm ------->N/A Baltimore at Pittsburgh, 1:00 pm ------>Pitt by 14 Denver at Cincinnati, 1:00 pm -------> Den by 10 Houston at Miami, 1:00 pm -------> Miami by 14 Indianapolis at Cleveland, 1:00 pm -------> Indy by 17 Jacksonville at Carolina, 1:00 pm -------> N/A Minnesota at Green Bay, 1:00 pm -------> GB by 8 New England at Buffalo, 1:00 pm -------> New England by 3 San Diego at Kansas City, 1:00 pm -------> KC by 7 St. Louis at N.Y. Giants, 1:00 pm -------> St.Louis by 10 Atlanta at Dallas, 4:15 pm -------> ATL by 14 Chicago at San Francisco, 4:15 pm -------> SF by 20 New Orleans at Seattle, 4:15 pm -------> Seattle by 6 Oakland at Tennessee, 8:30 pm -------> OAK by 12 Monday, Sep. 8  Tampa Bay at Philadelphia, 9:00 pm -------> TB by 14
