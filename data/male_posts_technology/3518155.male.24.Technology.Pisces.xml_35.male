Not as picturesque as Yosemite, but pretty and enjoyable nevertheless.   urlLink    View from the ridge ...  Tried very hard not to sing durign the hike, but couldn't hold back towards the end. Turns out one needs to be in pretty good shape to hike and sing at the same time ..  Also, next time I'll remember to wear shorts that don't keep wanting to fall off. Or just wear a belt. :-/
