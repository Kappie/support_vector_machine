I was really worried over the last couple of weeks that summer has decided to leave us but in the last week, the weather has had bouts of beautiful sunshine. It's absolutely stunning outside now and I'm thinking that my thick wool t-shirt today is not the wisest of moves [as trendy as it may look]. Oh well. I'll change at lunch.  Aarrrgh the beauty of living close to work.  There's no real news or anything, I just thought I'd dribble a bit about my current fitness. Much to Kristen's annoyance, I would sit on my arse for several months doing nothing but skinning up but when I decided to go for a jog I would then do 3kms without too much strain.  I'm not sure which part of my family I got my health from, but I do count myself lucky that I tend to be pretty fit normally. I may not be lean and cut but I can run faster and longer than most people.   Over the last couple of weeks I have tried to improve this by actually getting more proactive. The fact that the weather is so beautiful is just more of an incentive to do things.  This is one of the beautiful aspects of England. When the sun is out, you appreciate it so much more and feelthe need to do something. So I'll be playing my regular wednesday game of football tonight. While I'm no Beckam, I at least am running back and forth and can prove a pretty effective wall. Things get kinda messy if I lose focus and start treating it a bit like AFL at home though. Apparently, you can't actually hip and shoulder people. And climbing their back for a header is a definate NoNo .. .. .. .. .. .. .. or so I'm told. Crazy Brits.  Apart from the football, I tend to be playing a couple of rounds of golf a week as well. Nothing special, just a pitch and put which is to say a 9 hole par 3 course. You can do it in about an hour. If the weather is good, it's a glorious way to spend in the sun. Not very strenuous in any way, but very enjoyable.  I also managed to go indoor rock climbing this week.  Before I left Australia, I had a list of last things that I wanted to do in Adealide with my friends and family. It's funny, I can hardly remember what was on the list. There was somethingl ike 15 items but I'm buggered if I remember what half of them were.  I DO know that one of them was to go indoor rock-climbing which I did. It was just brilliant fun. I couldn't have enjoyed it anymore. Nothing like using your body to do things that it's not used to. A friend of mine [Hello US Claire] mentioned that there is an indoor rock climbing place at Brookes university. So we got together and she gave me a tour. Fantastic stuff. We were there for about an hour and a half. I didn't get on the ropes. I just did the bouldering which is climbing the wall about 4 metres high with no support. Well, apart from the foot thick mattress that the place is covered in. I couldn't believe that half an hour into it, I was just drenched with sweat. It's strenuous but I didn't remember sweating that badly before.   Will try and make it a regular thing I think. Good clean fun and somthing to add to the weekly list of things to try and fit in.  Long Live the Summer.
