I know you will miss her....But the quicker you come home, the sooner we will all be together again!  Today has been a hectic one indeed, as I sat at the table out the back in my robe, with a cup of Earl Grey and a packet of Marlboros, the cleaner (Cecilia) and the gardener boy (Warren...I know bad name), we very busy at work! The lawns, front and back are looking sensational and swept, and the house, well what can i say, is spotless! Thank god for the help!  Not too much to report, life has been consistently good, whilst quiet. My new little job is great....worked three days last week, Im still not really sure what I do, as I havent really done anything yet other than turn up late, leave early, take long lunches (1 1/2 hours!!), watch television, play on the internet, make personal phone calls, and drink coffee and smoke ciggies....but as I see it, that really is more than enough to keep me occupied and as long as Im getting paid then I am happy.  Well, as I prepare to go and get Kai, I must say that I am glad that K had an engaging time with each other! We knew you would!  All love and best wishes to all readers!  jamesy  Ps. Just got a text from my bastard of a brother Timothy, 'just arrived@windsor castle w/ holly 4 Wills bday..haha..wish u were here. TRDD.'
