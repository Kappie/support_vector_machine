Lauren woke me up this morning around 8 or so, bursting into the room yelling "Happy Father's Day, Daddy!" Then she told me she drew some hearts for me and had a card. "Daddy, you have to come down and see your card, now!" It was one of those pop-up cards like a kids book where the animals move when you turn the pages. It was a bear giving me a hug.  We're also in the middle of a move right now so there are boxes all over the place. Angie didn't have a chance to get some wrapping paper for my gifts so early this morning she decided she'd put my presents in a box and decorate the box. She drew hearts and flowers and Lauren colored them in. Lauren also drew a picture of me and her holding hands. Best wrapping paper ever.  Best Father's Day presents ever, too. I've been wanting an electric shaver again for the last couple of years but I just haven't felt like spending the money on it. Last time I bought one I didn't really like the way it worked. That may have been a birthday present actually. It was a Norelco with the Nivea goop dispenser. Just made for a messy shave... and it didn't shave close enough without the goop. I don't like the rotary systems. My first shaver ever was a Braun back in 1994. I think it was a gift my mom bought for me before my senior year in high school since I needed to start shaving almost every day. That thing came in handy during basic training the next summer! So they got me the Braun shaver that has that cleans itself with some alcohol based cleaner. I shaved with it this morning already. Yup, I like it. Actually, I hadn't shaven since Thursday night with hopes that I was getting this shaver today. I hinted that I would like to get it and it worked.  I've also been wanting to get some nice beer mugs too. You know the kind. Big heavy glass mugs with a handle big enough to lift with a full fist. The kind you don't store in the cupboard but in the freezer. I'm not sure why I haven't ever just gone out and bought these but I just never did. So she got them for me for Father's Day and they're perfect! They're being washed now and I will be trying them out this afternoon.  Best Father's Day Ever... and it's not even 10 am yet. We're off to Bob Evans for breakfast...
