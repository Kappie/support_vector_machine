The first time I've not been overwhelmed or been self overbooked. It feels strange. Now I've been thinking about what activities I want to pursue. I think that I'll make a Saturday morning tee time each week and I think I'll try to devote some more time to the GOP. Of course, I can't leave out developing things I've been forces to overlook at  urlLink DL  as well. Any other things that I should try?
