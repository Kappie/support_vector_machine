So it's been my 4th day in a row on 4 hours of sleep and I definitely felt it.  I went to my immigration agent to sort out my trip to NZ and he basically said don't bother because it will definitely delay the processing of my permanent residency. So obviously I'm not going to do THAT.  Anyways a friend called up last minute asking for help to move because she had to move out by today (complications with the landlord), and as usual moving is never what you expect it to be. Plus public transport today was absolutely horrible and I ended up missing a training session with Danny Green (WBC Interim Middleweight Champion) at our dojo because of that. Oh well, better luck next time...
