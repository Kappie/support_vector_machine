Last night my roommate bought a little oven roaster for his dinner. He put it in the oven, and then our friend JB roped him into going to Adams Morgan to pick up her credit card. This is because they went out Friday night with our other friend SB (man, using both initials sounds better than using one letter nomenclatures) and she got a bit tipsy. If fact, I called her last night to make fun of her for being stupid drunk and she said she didn't really remember much.  So, it's Friday, my roommate and SB and JB were at Madam's Organ partying it up. SB took one too many and started to pass out on the bar, so obviously, they got kicked out (hehe). But, JB had a tab running so they had her credit card. They went back to get it last night (JB and roomie, not SB cuz she was at work). JB and roommate stayed out late drinking I guess because he didn't wake me up going into the kitchen. The chicken was left out on the counter like I had left it before. I offered to put it away because I am a nice guy, before he left I was like "hey, want me to wait until it cools and put it in the fridge?" but he said no. I don't really know if this is bad or not. It isn't cool because it sat out all night.... but how bad could it be since it was just one night and I am sure he would eat some for breakfast and put it away? I really have no idea. I think it is kinda gross, but that is it. Only thing that bothers me is the food particles left sitting out on a plate after the dinner is finished. Not just one night but for days at a time, which I try not to do but roomie doesn't seem to mind that much. Sometimes, when you do this, new life begins to form (and smell particularly awful). I like to imagine what interesting kinds of protozoa there are on the dishes before I rinse them in scalding hot water, which hopefully kills them all.    In other news, I saw the woman I like to affectionately call "crazy lady" on my way home yesterday. She just yells at anyone who cares to listen (which is often no-one) as she walks down the street. I find it strange because it isn't curses or something like that. It is bad things that have happened in her life (or what she "thinks" happened, thanks to KM for bringing this to my attention because, I mean, the woman is pretty crazy). She was yelling about how her mother was killed in 1998. I suppose that if something were to trigger a schizophrenic episode this would be it. Anyways, this is like the 3rd or 4th time I have seen her. Usually I see her in the morning so this was a "rare" sight for me. She is becoming a familiarity with me. I think I might say hi or something if I get the courage to get close to her. It is almost like the yelling is some Tourette's syndrome reaction where she yells at cars and anyone who passes by or no one in particular. I wonder if she would put the chicken away after coming home late...
