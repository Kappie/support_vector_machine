Why are we talking about Homosexual marriage? The whole phrase is a misnomer. There is no such thing as Homosexual Marriage. There never will be. By definition, marriage can never be homosexual. This is not homophobic or down on individual homosexuals. It is nothing to do with that. It is entirely a matter of definition. Marriage is about a man leaving his father and mother and being united to his wife. The two will become one flesh.   But I pretend to be naive. Of course this is a big deal. Allowing homosexual marriage (even if it is a misnomer) is another attempt to normalise behaviour which is contrary to God's order. Enough said I think. One day I might get arrested for these statements.   Ok, completely off the topic, but just back on to the mandarin topic. How long do they actually last? I can swear that it's longer than a week, because they are still looking sweet as, and that post was a while ago, and they were about a week old then. Hmmm. I might try one of them now. Wait on for a second or two please. Ok, that one tasted perfectly acceptable. So it is definately longer than one week. I shall continue this experiment and let you know the results.
