The talent show lineup (as best can be remembered by Armaan): 1. Josh R playing piano 2. Alex sticking his hand in his mouth, putting both legs behind his head, making himself sneeze with a Q-tip  up his nose  and licking his elbow (holy crap) 3. Carissa (spl?) playing piano 4. Megan, Patrick and Brandon playing / singing *doesn't remember* 5. Jen, Gwen and Adri singing  Into the West by Annie Lennox  (all looking cute and sounding wonderful, I might add) 6. Derek and Joel tearing up the stage with a sweet sweet sweet bass / drum duet (they are so friggin' good) 8. Megan and Ali singing  Goodbye to You by Michelle Branch  9. Andrew and David singing an ode to the word "sick"  After this, I said goodbye to everyone for spring break and went back home to collect my computer etc. to set up at Jon-Mark's house for the big all-night LAN party. Now that party was fun... total geeks hanging around each other, having a good time. In attendance were Jon-Mark, Deren (duh and duh), Ryan, Ryan, Brian, Zoo, *someone else that had to leave early, and consequently, I didn't catch his name* and myself. StarCraft all around... I brought food... Wired, Henry Winehard's Cream Soda, chips, and  3 pounds  of Reese's Pieces (lol) Man, we need to have another of those really soon, I wanna hang around those guys more often... so funny :) LOL, One of the Ryans can bend so far backward that he can remove his glasses with his feet! It's great.   I took some video with my camera... will put it up on the web as soon as I pull it off... I'll prolly pull some pics off it too... Speaking of pics, I have a background changer that changes my background picture every so often, and it happened to be on this really cute picture of Gwen and Danie from the banquette. One of the guys saw it and was like "Oh my gosh, they're hot" so I turned off the background changer and it's still my desktop right now (LOL)  Zoo is soo crazy at Starcraft... he creamed every single one of us even when the remaining four (after several had been annihilated) allied and worked against him.  LOLOL We actually had so much load on the lines that we killed the power to most of the lower floor of his house around 10am Sat... We never did figure out what the problem was though we're thinking it might be a GFI somewhere that we couldn't find. Hope they get that fixed.  Anyway, I finally left at 12:40 on Saturday and Steven  Becky called me as soon as I got in the car... Looking back on that I'm quite glad they did... kept me from falling asleep on the way home. LOL, I wonder how that conversation went... I was so tired I don't remember any of it, and I doubt I made much sense to them either. :)  Later that night, after I got 3 or so hours of sleep, I picked up Steven, drove Beaverton Transit Station and we took the MAX out to Portland where the Columbia Symphony was having a concert. There were only two pieces, a symphony and a masse, but they were each about an hour long. I don't get how my mom can play for two hours straight... Id' get so tired (lol). The masse was cool. Aside from the orchestra, it involved a 200 person (it looked like that many, maybe I'm remembering wrong...) choir, four soloists, and the pipe organ in the sanctuary that it was performed in (which is actually two pipe organs, one on the back wall, and one on the front).  Afterward, we all went to a really nice bar for a while that a lot of the orchestra members go to afterwards and finally succeeded in getting a hold of Becky (we’d been trying to call her but the line was busy, then we got on aim from my phone but she wasn’t on, so we just waited and called a couple more times). We left and went back to my car because the restaurant section of the bar was too expensive (go figure…). After driving around for another hour trying to find some place that was open (it was past 11), Steven and I went to a local Sherri’s and had dinner.   After I took him back home and got back home myself, I tried to get to bed and get to sleep but I was too restless to do so… I finally got to sleep after 7am (LOL) and woke up today at 5:30pm (wow, my body clock is going to be messed up because of all this) and I’m meeting my uncle to do something tomorrow at 10am so I need to get to bed at a decent time tonight… erk
