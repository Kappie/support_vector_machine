It was a funny and interesting film to watch, especially the portrayals of realities in life (plight of foreign going indians). if only more movies like these were taken by our film world..    I may not be able to blog today as I am leaving for a visit to a client's place. Might be late afternoon or even evening when I return.     Here is an intersting bit of news:  urlLink Indian boy hatches beetles .  See you later,
