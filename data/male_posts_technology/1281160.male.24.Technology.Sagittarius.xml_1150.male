My trip was fine...Had a great time, with my parents  a few of our friends too.....Most sickening part after a long trip, is the catch-up work!!......My brain was squeezed beyond it's capabilities, for the first few weeks......Now i'm back to stream....  Congrats Manny, Bala  Xavier for your new jobs!!!....(Though late, not too late, right???)  Rini, great that Srini, has reached safely.....Is there any plans for him, about flying to the east?....If so, i can invite him to our place, for a weekend.......BTW, I live in the middle east.....there's three hours time difference, between mine  Srini's place......Sanjose is the head quarters for Cypress......it's a very nice place....place ought to be visited in US......You could have made up for this trip Rini....can't you take an absence of leave or something like that?  Kavi, Do you ever check your off line messages?.....I've been sending you messages every now 'n then....but no response from you at all......  ok guys, see you later
