I will probably be moving out there between the end of June and mid-July.  I'm not sure yet.  There is so much I want to accomplish before moving, so many people to see and say goodbye to, it's overwhelming.  Today, I went car shopping.  I think I found the one I want, but it's a bit pricy for someone who won't be seeing that first pay check for at least two months.  I could wait, but I want it now!  ::whine::
