With sumis perseverance I got up by 4 O clock. When I started my vehicle it was 6 sharp. Except 2 or 3 milk valas and five to six buffaloes I am the only awaken living being. Filling my tummy with a tumbler of milk and my bike with 3 litres of fuel, I raised my throttle.     Dhianalinga  was erected at the foothills of vellingiri. Mind started expecting too much as it does always. I Imagined myself driving in to the deep woods with BSA Slr advt lion crossing the other side. Cool breeze ended up in drizzling.I became a bit confused when I was unable to select BPL Mobile, my home network itself. Later I realized it was BPL Mobile, Kerala and not Tamilnadu. Only when I quivered, I found tat the road beneath is of stones and not tar. For sure I am out of Coimbatore.Other than twice to reaffirm the direction, I gave my victor no chance to have a deep breathe.   Thou enthused by the travel,   IS IT WORTH IT?   clouded my mind. The second my wheels touched the mud road, the environment was immediately painted with green. At one moment a big crow crossed my head from left to right. Only after applying the brakes to check how big is the crow, I found tat it is not a crow but a peacock. Peacock and lion both are wild animals I told myself and added more value to my travel.  When I stopped by a tea shop and asked for dhianlinga temple eyebrows raised and exclaimed who sent u in this direction? Annoyed, I was about to turn my way back. Bulb glowed in my brain when I heard only Siva temple is 2 kms away and rolled my wheels towards Shiva temple (As) Dhianalinga.   There were sacks tied to every tree and with markers it read please use dust bin. Good to see people had followed. Between the leaves of the trees, like a smaller sun was the yellow doom of the temple. A security in uniform, dressed like that of a corporate one welcomed. After verifying if this is my first visit he conveyed the same to some one over the phone. He also asked me to wait until ji comes. Ji (must be in his later 20s) greeted and took me to a small museum kinda room. He xplained me the history of Dhianalinga.  Dhianalinga was erected by Sadhguru, who claims to have attained divinity. He guided a virtual tour of the temple thru a portrait. He then took me to a tank of water filled with Lotus and wanted me to take and offer to Dhianlinga, if I wish. After showing me the places of needs he left me at the entrance and posted me a constraint of maintaining silence.My first sight inside the temple landed on four to five symbols of various religions.   only Hindus after this line   in Madurai Meenakshi temple flashed in my mind. Steps were not enclosed by copper, instead it gave me the feeling of being massaged. Ji have quoted me that the steps would open the inner valves of the foot.   The temple was built encircling the Linga. The roof was a semi spherical structure built with bricks and dust from the forest. If true, that it is built without concrete it is a miracle then. Interesting, to see mother forest worshipped. The chamber where Linga is placed is the temple by itself. Except a mercury lamp hanged high, there were 9 oil lamps . No poojas, no iyer, no bells but an appreciated temple of Coimbatore.   At the point where the spherical roof ends, there were hovels to comfort a 6 feettall or a 3 feet fat person. They are meant for practicing meditation. Though I was unable to talk to Linga as conveyed by ji I understood   meditation soothes  . An hour have passed when I completed meditation!!! and examined the temple sculptures (hardly 3 or 4). When a team of college gals wondered how good the temple is, a girl in saffron rushed to keep them silent. The weather was as pleasant as it begun for the day. My travel, the environment, the linga, the nature, the meditation thou unable to make out which, something has given me peace and a sense of accomplishment. Supplied with handful of pamphlets and information on the forthcoming Shivrathri events I walked to the parking lane. Once I turned up to see the yellow doom might be to convey  I will be back  To my surprise I had 4 idlis and 3 dosas on the way and they collected Rs.10 for tat and that is a different story. I am mulling over a question and want you also to.  The question is Meditation is always associated with God, isnt that different from divinity or is it not?
