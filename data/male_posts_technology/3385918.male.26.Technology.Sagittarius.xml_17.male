What is known is that she is a model that decided to go to California to make it big in the porn industry. She arrived in L.A. in mid-March from Montreal, on a ticket paid for with supposedly borrowed funds. All she wanted to do was perform in enough scenes to create a "nest-egg" that she could take back to Canada where she would go on with my life and leave that type of life behind her. Three months later, she is now broke, jobless, HIV-positive and part of a HIV Outbreak scare that is breaking apart the porn industry.  Around February, Roxx had been performing (mostly for Canadian-based Internet sites), when she met Daniel Perrault, who later became her manager. Originally, Daniel Parrault had reservations about managing Lara. She had been taught since she was a girl about sexually trasmitted deceases and was very apprehensive about having to do "anals" and sex without condoms.   The pron industry sells fantasies. Condoms break with that fantasy. So many times, adult stars are ask to do their scenes without the use of proper protection. Sometimes, protection is used, but later removed for scenes involving anything oral.  Perrault brought Roxx into contact with director Marc Anthony, who was reportedly in Montreal scouting for talent, and he in turn introduced her to his actors. Among them was Darren James.   Darren James had recently returned from a trip to Brazil where he told Roxx he had been with several women. While she had taken some STD tests, she didn't know that it was commonplace for performers to show each other their tests before beginning a scene. Hence, she never asked if he had taken one after the trip.   Most adult performers prefer to stay away from working in Brazil. There are a lot of HIV-positive cases there. Some performers can buy a fake test for $10.  Lara was told that she was going to do a double penetration with Marc and Darren. It ended up being a double anal. She reluctantly agreed, feeling suckered into it by people she taught where her friends.   Roxx developed rashes and a case viral pharyngitis, for which she visited several doctors. Eventually Daniel Perrault learned that Darren James tested positive for HIV and told Lara. Her reaction was as expected.   She became part of a list of over 30 adult performers quarantined who needed to be tested for HIV. On April 15, Lara Roxx tested HIV positive. She was the first.  Currently, several performers are awaiting their results with dread and fear. Already two performers, Miss Arroyo and Jessica Dee, have tested HIV positive.   To this, a stunned Roxx said: "It totally made me realize how I trusted this system that wasn't to be trusted at all, because it obviously doesn't work."  This has sent shock waves across the pron industry and has open debate for new, better HIV testing procedures and work related health safety precautions. Oddly enough, most porn companies are still resisting the idea of using condoms in their productions. To the extent that many are actually threatening to move away from California if legislation is passed enforcing the use of condoms.   One studio executive even went as far as to compare watching a male performer using a condom to watching a movie where a stunt man in doing a dangerous stunt and you suddenly see the safety harnes.   Pretty smart people in the pron industry, no?  Currently, Lara Roxx is planning to sue several American producers for "several million dollars".
