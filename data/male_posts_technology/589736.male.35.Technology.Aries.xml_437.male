Fast forward 15 years, and I still owe him money.  Truthfully? Ben and I went to high school together, then worked together at King's MuthaFuckin Dominion ( always  use "MuthaFuckin," people). Way back shiznit. Ben used to DJ at parties at my old apartment when I was at VCU, and we made a pilgrimage to Memphis and Graceland in the mid 90's. Jonathan (I think) contacted me a few months ago after finding a reference to Ben and an old school photo on  urlLink my website . Wasn't long before I'd check in on this page every so often.  Not exactly glamorous, huh?  As for me, I won't take up space here, but my site should explain quite a bit.  urlLink The video of me humping a rocking chair to the Beastie Boys  probably best represents my lack of touch with reality.  That was not a joke. It's on there.   Seriously.      What's your story? Are you the rock star?
