I can say that I'll be someone different if I haven't met her. She alway push me to be better in my job and in my life, she alway said how much she was pround of me.  It's right that since one year things are different. I'm not his hero, but I did things for that... So tomorrow is an important birthday for us, and I have no idea for a gift :s I must found something nice, last day was very nice with her, I'm happy of this even if I know "Up  down" was not finish yet. I need to positive the situation !
