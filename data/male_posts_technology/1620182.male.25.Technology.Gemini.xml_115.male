 I'll admit it.  I don't know if it was the flashy clothes or the catchy tunes (written by other, more talented song writers of yesteryear), but I bought into the whole Bad Boy group back in the day.  I think the year was 1999 and yes, I bought Mase's first CD.  
 
 Mase dropped off the face of the planet that year.  He had a couple of hits, cultivated by Sean Combs, aka Puff Daddy, aka Puffy, aka P-Diddy, master of the  urlLink Bad Boy  empire which went into rapid decline following the murder of Biggie Smalls.  Where did Mase go?  He apparently went spiritual, pursuing his relationship with God by becoming a pastor and forming his own church.  MTV says he needed to recharge his batteries.  Well, they must be at full rev now, because he's back.
 
 I couldn't help but laugh out loud when I saw this video last night.  Welcome Back is the title of his first single, obviously appropriate for the situation.  It's pretty catchy, but it's hilarious to see Mase again, looking the same as he did in 1999 when he disappeared.  For those who don't know any better it appears he just stepped out of a time machine with the same style of clothes, jewels, and dance moves...utterly unbelievable.  My favorite part of the interview is when "Mase addresses all the MCs who copped his style while he was away..."  This stuff is classic.
