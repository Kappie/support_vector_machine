 I really am.  I'm getting excited because I'm hopefull about this new book.  I had 3 tiny (custard) bowls of the pasta salad tonight over a period of probably 3 hours. I'm sure I could have eaten faster, but why push it.  The pain I described in the last post was very brief and only with the first bowl.  I have left-overs and I think that will make a great lunch tomorrow. 

 Right now I'm sitting in front of my computer in a dimly lit room, typing in my journal and drinking chamomile tea (another suggestion from " urlLink Eating for IBS ").  I am turning into a bonifed tree-hugging hippie, albiet a yuppie one.  I guess that makes me a yippie. I spent my afternoon in a vitamin store, my evening cooking a "whole foods" meal, and my night sipping organic tea.  If I were a woman I'd stop shaving my legs right now. 

 This tea is really very tasty.  I don't remember if I've ever had chamomile before, but I'm so used to tea being bitter.  This isn't at all, its very sweet.  It tastes a little like honey.  Hmm, that sounds good.  I'll add some honey to my tea tomorrow.  I'm a little concerned that sipping this tea will cause more belching and gas.  I guess its a wait-and-see scenario.  I hope, at least, that belching chamomile will taste like chamomile.  That wouldn't be so bad. ;-)
