Entertainment-wise I give it 4.5 of 5. As a documentary I give it 3.5 of 5. Instead of trying to put into print how I feel about this movie, which could take days to really express it all, I'm gonna quote heavily from some of the reviews of the movie that I've read.  From  urlLink James Berardinelli's review :  Moore's reputation robs [parts of] his film of its potential power. Because we don't know how much of this is real. Maybe it all is. /.../ But his past argues that he might not be playing things straight. Moore has a longstanding history of manipulating the truth, and we have no way of assessing whether any doctoring has been done /.../ Moore's reputation demands that we regard everything in his films with a healthy portion of skepticism.  From  urlLink "Fahrenheit 9/11": Nay! by Stephanie Zacharek :  People who consider themselves basically in league with Michael Moore's politics but dislike his movies often feel compelled to defend him as a concept: "He's a much-needed liberal voice," goes one argument. "He raises issues that need to be raised, that no one else is raising," goes another /.../ In the Moore universe, noisy tub-thumping is deemed more valuable than stringent logic; presenting crucial information in a manner that's irrefutable (by naysayers of any political bent) is much less important than drawing a comfortable little circle in which we're encouraged to congratulate ourselves for being on the "correct" side, for having the good sense to recognize that [the] president is "bad" and the Iraq war is "wrong."  /.../ But even though I'm part of the choir Moore is preaching to, I can't help blanching at his approach: In this increasingly treacherous political climate -- particularly as we approach an election whose impact may resound more thunderously than any other in recent history -- preaching to the choir just isn't good enough. "Fahrenheit 9/11" shows evidence of being better researched than any of Moore's previous films. /.../ But Moore's case is undermined by his jokey, faux-populist self-righteousness (a quality the left seems to despise only when it's exhibited by those on the right) and by the slapdash connections he makes between various facts and events. The issues at stake are too serious for a spotlight-hungry manipulator like Moore to be mucking around with.  /.../ [T]he Bush administration has exploited the tragedy of Sept. 11 to foster a culture of fear in the United States; [the] president then roused /.../ fearful Americans into support for, or at least a numb acceptance of, a war that he has justified only with false allegations.  /.../ Moore uses /.../ yuk-yuk tactics to poke impish little holes in the Bush persona. But these minor deflations don't do much to emasculate George W. If anything, they suggest that Moore underestimates him, carelessly characterizing Bush's smug and reckless disregard for the American people as just a slightly rejiggered version of avuncular, Ronald Reagan-style cluelessness.  /.../ At the very least, that's the conflict of interest Moore claims it is. But Moore never fits the info nibblets he comes up with on the Bush-Saudi connection into a coherent whole. Moore says that, in the days immediately following 9/11, when not even celebrities like Ricky Martin were allowed to fly, prominent Saudis, including members of the bin Laden family, were secretly hustled out of the United States. He interviews an FBI agent who says that they should have been questioned before they were offered special protection. Here's the problem: As the New York Times reported /.../ [that] the FBI did interview and clear members of the bin Laden family and, as the 9/11 commission has reported, the flights did not leave before U.S. airspace was reopened. In "Fahrenheit 9/11" Moore may have been more careful than usual with the facts, but you still can't help wondering how much he tinkered with them to suit his arguments.  /.../ Moore shows us footage of grievously injured Iraqi children or, more arresting yet, their corpses. Many of these images are graphic, and I don't believe audiences should necessarily be sheltered from such pictures. But there's something wily and disingenuously wide-eyed about the way Moore uses these images to make his points about the horrors of war. Similarly, he expresses surprise and dismay that the military recruits heavily among African-Americans, Hispanics and other minorities, as opposed to trying to attract rich kids. Stop the presses! Innocent civilians are killed during wartime; our armed services are made up largely of young men and women to whom our society has offered limited opportunities. Moore unveils these revelations with a flourish, relishing his role as the great teller of truths. What planet, exactly, has he been living on? /.../ I've heard even die-hard Moore detractors defend "Fahrenheit 9/11," claiming that its flaws don't matter because it speaks to a higher truth. The thinking goes, I suppose, that we need every anti-Bush voice we can get, and Moore /.../ is likely to wield more influence than most other voices coming from the left. What's more, even though "Fahrenheit 9/11" isn't journalism, Moore presents his findings with an air of authority. Moore believes the press has let [the people] down in calling Bush on his fraudulence and falseheartedness, and he's right. Still, the tradition, craft and standards of journalism have to count for something: Should we really be holding up cheap shots, inference and sloppy reporting as gateways to the truth?   From  urlLink "Fahrenheit 9/11": Yea! by Andrew O'Hehir :  "Fahrenheit 9/11" is an enormous film, an angry film, a flawed film and often a very, very funny film. There is anguish in it and death, and not as much coherence as there might be. /.../ [Moore's] true calling lay not in journalism but in storytelling, or, more specifically, in the dangerous and difficult territory that lies between them.  /.../ Moore's case against the Bushies and their Saudi allies /.../ is largely circumstantial. Some of its particulars may not be true or fair, and very little of it approaches a legal standard of evidence. On the other hand, Moore never suggests anything patently outrageous (there's no "Bush planned 9/11,"), yet the picture that emerges here, at minimum, is of a government engaged in a systematic campaign to bewilder and mislead its own public, and dedicated to a messy military adventure whose costs and aims have never been made clear.  /.../ Moore's individual factoid nuggets can be gasp-inducing (was George W. Bush's early career really funded by the bin Laden family?) and his side trip to his Michigan hometown to examine the Iraq war's effects there is genuinely heartbreaking. But "Fahrenheit 9/11" is more like a drug experience than a political documentary. It's a mind-bending, half-digested mass of video clips, interviews, statistics, rampant speculation and /.../ cheap gags.   Lastly, I include the following link that I think is  very  interesting. I have only looked at it briefly, but I fully intend to read it all:  urlLink Fifty-nine Deceits in Fahrenheit 9/11 by Dave Kopel .  -->
