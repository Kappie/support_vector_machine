Justin thought that it meant that we had arrived early in Copenhagen. When we were all ready, we went to the cafeteria with all our barang barang (luggage). That's when we realised we were really an hour and a half away from arrival. Alamak, we could’ve gotten an hour's more sleep. But it wasn't exactly a bad thing. Being up early, we decided to use up all our Norwegian currency and coins on breakfast.   0900+ hrs  Arrived in Copenhagen. My first impression is that it seemed livelier and nicer than Burgen. First thing we had to do is to get to the train station to purchase tickets for travel to Stockholm 2 days later. My next impression, things were still as expensive as before. The tickets cost us 673 DKK (about £67+). I made an initial estimate of my transport costs within Scandinavia so far and it seemed to have already hit about £230. I think it's even possible to travel by flying at this price. This obviously only shows how poorly estimated our transport costs were. But since we are already here ... sigh.  At the ticketing office, after we had paid for the tickets, we immediately realised that Justin had lost his bag. He had placed his bag in front of his feet (between both feet and the counter), a relatively secure position I would say. Naturally, it's been stolen. We searched around and even went to the station's toilet to see if any bugger was hanging around there rummaging through a familiar looking bag but all to no avail. We suspect that it was as we were all leaning forward to talk to the counter staff and checking details that the thief made his move. Even so, Justin had only left his bag down for a few mins. The lucky thing was that he had all his documents (passport) and cards (credit and debit) on him when the bag was stolen. He did lose his new £200 credit card sized Casio digital camera (with MP3 playing capability) and about £30 worth of cash though. The really inconvenient part was that all his clothes and his glasses were in the bag as well. Naturally, Justin felt really sian about the whole thing. We went to the Police station located within the rail station and made a police report.  We still had to grab some chow. We came across a buffet serving Indian/Mediterranean food of sorts and decided to have a try. It wasn't bad at all, but there wasn't a great variety. After dinner, we went on to the famous Tivoli Gardens. I originally expected Tivoli Gardens to be some sort of botanical garden or park. Imagine my surprised when I realised it was really an amusement park. It wasn't particularly expensive either considering that we're in a country of such a high standard of living. The place was bustling with people and activity. Featured rides and all that weren't like state of the art or brand new but the atmosphere sure was one of the best in the world. It definitely lightened our mood a bit given the incident of the day.  Allow me to go off-track for a while but at that moment I was wondering how come Sentosa can't enjoy the same kind of atmosphere or popularity as the one I had seen in Tivoli Gardens? Justin pointed a few possibilities to me. Most events held at Sentosa seemed more catered for the teens and young adults. The locality of Sentosa was a bit too much to the south, but considering Singapore's small size so that's probably more of an excuse for people not to visit Sentosa than a good reason. But Tivoli Gardens is situated in the heart of the capital itself. It closes at 0100 hrs but in Singapore, only certain special locations do so and they are more like pubs, discos, etc.  We are quite lucky as there will be a free concert tonight. We don't recognise the singer (she was a Randi something) but her vocals sounded pretty good. Music was nice too. As Justin isn't in a perfect mood, he wasn't particularly interested in the concert. We left Daniel at the concert while we went to the arcade/jackpot. He did pretty ok and won some credits but he had no idea how to retrieve the tokens from the machine. Ultimately he used up all his credits instead. I did have a go on a swash-buckling samurai game. It's the first time I tried and it was quite fun. I tried to apply some simple things I learnt from weapons work but after awhile, I realised it was pointless. There was so many loophole in the game compared to the real thing. It's still a game after all I suppose. O yea, Daniel, the ever-ready-rock-climber had a go on a machine which simulated a rock wall. A crowd always gathers whenever someone has a go on the machine. It just seemed interesting lah. Danish girls here have really pretty and outstanding features. Lots of blond around (dunno if they're natural blond or what). Anyway, they really stood out.
