The other project is another blog which is a very different template but that is before i found this one.  The latest blog used up most of my working time while i was monitoring some critical servers. Purejoycell.tblog.com is my best work utilizing the site pictures sharing , i am able to tell more stories using photo stories,...this is my cell Pure Joy from SIBKL ...where these are JesusFreaks ... Yeah cooll.....can't wait to tell them tonite...
