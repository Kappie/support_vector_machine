I got my "Pager" script working for the most part which has been a big boon for me, as I've been stressing to finish it for some time now. It felt like my progress on it was going too slow. Afterwards, I played Hearts with Kristi and Jared on Yahoo! games. We played for several hours. It seemed totally foreign to me at first, but after awhile it started feeling familiar. I think I probably have played it with a group of people many years ago. Kristi left as soon as I started to get the hang of things which was disappointing.  I woke up early so that I could take a shuttle to Chicago. My work group had a meeting with a group at the University of Chicago which works there. I didn't really participate much in the discussion. Much of it was presentations. I got a lot of clean up work done on my Pager project during this meeting. That was satisfying. I left around 3:30pm and was dropped off at my office building 221. I stayed there for a few minutes and then went home. I slept for many hours. After I awoke, I worked on implementing a sorting algorithm that I've been toying with for a few years. I call it Lazy Sort, but it'll probably fall victim to change. I returned to sleep around 1 or 2am.  You'd think with all the sleep I got, I'd be well rested and ready for work today, but I wasn't. I got up around 10:30am and didn't get to work until 11am. Probably got 2 hours of work done today. I mostly fiddled around with my sorting algorithm. After work I ended up IMing for an hour or so with Heather, Kristi, and Steven (all separately!).  I spent several hours IMing with Peter. I was hoping to play some more Hearts with Kristi, but that hope has fizzled now.
