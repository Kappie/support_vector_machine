It is a portal engine I am toying with using as the basis for the new site but it has most of the functions I want in the site already built in. If ppl could read the news posting on the first page it has a list of things I need looked at and there is a poll on the homepage\forum where you can add comments to let me know what you think..  Check out  urlLink afterhours.ie , you know you want to :)
