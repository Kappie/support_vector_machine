Our delicate work that we are always attempting to perfect, to make just right, is all too often wrecked by a careless hand, swept away as if it's something that's easy to recreate. And it's common. That sweeping hand, that delicate piece of work, are our worst nightmare and our greatest accomplishment. It's always being destroyed and rebuilt, and only the strongest survive. Too often do I find myself on a clear night, looking up into the sky, at the stars, and wishing They were with me, that I could hold Them, that They could experience with me what I love, and to understand the most simple but most powerful of emotions. But that's where the sweeping hand comes in, that wrecks that thought, that emotion, that drains you of your energy, until you have nothing left but the remnants of your masterpiece.
