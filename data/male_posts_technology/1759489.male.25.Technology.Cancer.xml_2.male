I started thinking about the General Post Office on O'Connell Street in Dublin and the bulletholes in the pillars.  I don't know why, but I did.  The bullet holes remain from when the Post Office was the headquarters for the 1916 uprising.  In case you are rusty on your Irish history, like me, then the 1916 uprising (Easter Uprising) was when the Irish Citizen Army proclaimed the Irish republic.  But then, suddenly, I began thinking less about the bullet holes and more about the big spike.          Street fighting on O'Connell Street during Rising          O'Connell Street 1940's         A 134-foot pillar, topped by a statue of Nelson and inspired by Trafalgar Square, dominated O'Connell Street for many years until it was blown apart by the IRA in 1966, marking the 50th anniversary of the uprising.  Recently, and to replace Nelson after almost 35 years of sad emptiness, came the  urlLink Dublin spire ; yes, a 120m tall silver spike.  It is 3 meters thick at the base and only 15cm at the top -- ouch.  It was still in construction when I saw it in 2003, and three years late for the millennium celebrations.

This wouldn't surprise me, considering it is a 120 meter metal rod in a country with frequent storms.  I'll have to try it out myself.  Of course, in good Irish literary tradition renaming monuments is a fun pastime.  Here are a few unofficial names for the spire:    The Stiffy near the Liffey  The Stiletto in the Ghetto  The eyeful tower  The Gleaming Tower of Pizza-land  Bertie's Erection       Now the Dubliners have a tendency to dislike tall building and rightly so because there are so few in the city.  So, it seems strange that they would choose to build a 120m spire in the centre of the city, and draw attention to it by lighting it up at night.  Especially considering that the tallest building in Dublin, Liberty Hall, caused a general fuss over its height and ugliness, which resulted was a law restricting the maximum size of any new buildings in the city.  If you look to the right, you can see why this law might have been passed.  Regardless, the spike seems to have been accepted and I, for one, can't wait to get electrical thrills from it.
