I intend to propose a topic for discussion... this was going on since morning in our BB.. so just felt like knowing what all of us have in mind too...  This is was the post in our BB which started it all...  Here goes... Drop in your views if u find the topic interesting...   Hey dear guys and gals …..    This is not a silly question. It’s very tough to answer. Easy it may seem, but given a second thought it could raise a big debate. What according to you is the right age to marry? Is it in the early twenties, when you are full of the so called “josh” or should it be in the late twenties, when u have gained experience of how to handle life. Whatever you may feel right, may feel absolutely wrong for another. Doesn’t matter though, coz it’s always free to express your opinions.    Now the importance of the topic – Why should it be a concerned issue?  If you must have read last Sunday’s supplements of Times Of India, you will agree that yeah… people do choose career prior to family. And when their career is all glory, they turn to family. But then its too late. Either there aren’t too many books on the shelf, or you may havta pick what you get, not what you want.  On the other hand, we also see cases where kiddos fall in love and marry right after college. They don’t realize the responsibilities and duties involved in a married life, and often end up in disasters.  Many a time, the not so forward Indian parents come in between, and they set a deadline, which could be as late as 30 or could be as early as 20. Now again, the average Indian youth, doesn’t have the guts or doesn’t feel it proper to stand up for their choices especially, when they are against the parents. Some may call this discipline, some may call it orthodox, some may call it obedience, some may call it fear.  Tis not easy to bring a trend among a social culture. And very often, the beginners of the trend are often branded as the maggot in the apple.   Open your views, and let’s see what the Bulletin Board has in mind. Keep the ball rolling
