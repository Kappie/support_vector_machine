Saturday I went out to the gun range for a while before I needed to get back into town to go to A Perfect Circle concert. The show was awsome. They were just as good as, maybe better than, when I saw them back around six months ago in Tampa. Needless to say, the concert tired me out, but I wasn't done yet for the night.   After the show we went downtown to say happy birthday to Bill. He got a pink fanny pack and pink party hats. Good times. Had a couple beers there and whatnot then headed home to get some sleep. The problem is I ended up plopping down on the couch and found a cheesy movie to watch that kept me up till 4am or so.  The next day I decided to sleep in a little and not go to the gun range as was planned the previous day. I was just too tired. But around 2 or so my friend insisted so we go out to do some skeet shooting and target practice so out we go. While we were out there, I somehow tore a muscle in my shoulder and it didn't help that I was shooting a semi-auto 12g shotgun either. Also I managed to get a shard of something in my left index finger and dehydrated myself while I was out there.  So in other words, "ouch". I might have more interesting stuff later.    -intX    I've fallen, and I can't get up...
