One possible downside, though, is that concentrating them and giving them "on-the-job-training" might amount to a sort of terrorist college, sharpening the capabilities of the survivors while culling the inept.  I'm not sure I want a bunch of experienced and competent terrorists running around.  On the other hand, it may be that terrorists had been used to getting away with a random bombing here and there, but have decided that their lifestyle is now more risky.  And, judging from the fates of Saddam and much of Al Queda, terrorists might now be thinking their efforts really don't accomplish what they wanted.  We can only hope.
