Everyone says that when they become a (step) parent, but you never really know what they mean until you experience it yourself.  My step-daughter gave me a hug and kiss goodnight for the first time yesterday.  Tonight I got another.  I've been walking around with a stupid grin on since.  I think she just made my month.  Kids rot your brain, I swear.
