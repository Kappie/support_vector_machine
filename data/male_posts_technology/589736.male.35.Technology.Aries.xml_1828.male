Stephen Phillips, the comic strip's talented young artist, is also hit with the evil ego whammy, thus feeling a bit too talented.  Could Stephen's selfishness bring about the end of the comic strip-and of Bibleman?  Or does God have a plan for Shattering the Prince of Pride?"  and  "With his scheme thwarted by the Bibleman Adventure team, Primordious Drool retires to the sewer from which he came and is replaced by another hopeful villain, The Wacky Protestor.  With plans to drench the world in a hopeless cloud of despair and darkness, the Wacky Protestor uses his Spasmodic, Meteoronic, Wacksonic Cloud of Darkness and Despair to discourage youth group member Corey Standridge and give him deep feelings of isolation and despair."   be sure to check out  urlLink images  from the "bibleman live tour", which looks for all the world like a combination of "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" and "Logan's Run".   if i were a christian, i'd seriously consider adopting another creed, just to distance myself as far as possible from this sort of foolishness.  what maddening, utter drivel!
