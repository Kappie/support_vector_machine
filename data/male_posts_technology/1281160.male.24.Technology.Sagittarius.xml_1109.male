You can become a great scholar, a great professor, a great philosopher ? just playing with words which are all borrowed, arranging and rearranging thoughts, none of which are your own.  The intellect is absolutely bankrupt. It has nothing of its own, all is borrowed. And that is the difference between intelligence and intellect. Intelligence has an eyesight of its own, a capacity to see into things, into problems.  Intelligence is your born quality.       - Extract from some mail..... **************************************************** Few more insights into the difference between an intellect and intelligent is given by writer J.Krishnamoorthy. Here is it!  Intelligence, not intellect: There is a vast distinction between intellect and intelligence.  Intellect is merely thought functioning independently of emotion.  When intellect, irrespective of emotion, is trained in any particular direction,  one may have great intellect, but one does not have intelligence,  because in intelligence there is the inherent capacity  to feel as well as to reason;  in intelligence both capacities are equally present,  intensely and harmoniously.  ***********************************************
