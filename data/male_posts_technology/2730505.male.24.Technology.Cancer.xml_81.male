I suppose that has already rang true in certain aspects of my life and I hope that the worst part is over.  For some odd reason I just want an uneventful pleasant week where not a lot of things will happen, something to the effect of a "down time" week where I can relax.  That's probably not going to happen with my professional life but that's quite alright.  Yesterday was full of revisiting old projects, updating them, finishing up loose ends and the sort.  Not too bad, I suppose I got through my work day without making a splash, definitely a good thing.  I went back to my parents house to pick up the TV, speakers, and TV stand converted to a computer table.  I also got a couple of spring jackets, the guitar and a bunch of little things.  I also put all my clothes in some order in my closet and chest.  Today I will probably go ahead and purchase an iron and pick up the ironing board for the parentals.  I should probably pickup the empty liquor bottles from my room and put them somewhere but I am not sure where.  Maybe I should jus throw those out already.  I don't think the "frat house" atmosphere is appropriate anymore, it kinda got old.  Now it's time to pick up some posters or some art.  The room is bland.  I am not sure if I like the walls to be bare and just be peaceful or have some posters or art to make it more colorful.  I guess time will tell.  Laundry night is tonight so along with an Iron, I gotta get some laundry detergent.  Sheesh, I thought the buying stuff part was over, I guess not.  I have finally gotten my room to the way I want it and I now think it has a better flow to it.  There's more floor space available for other things in the future (golf clubs, coat stand, etc) as well as a better path to the door.  I was reading some  urlLink Feng Shui   online and found certain things to follow when arranging your bed to comply with Feng Shui principles.  BANNED IN BEDROOMS  If you want to ensure your bedroom does not suffer from bad vibes that bring heartache, illness and loss, do observe these simple bedroom basics.  - Never have large mirrors that reflect the bed in the bedroom.  - Never have live plants in the bedroom  - Never place water features in the bedroom  - Never keep live fish in the bedroom  - Never hang peony paintings if your husband is above middle aged  - Never place clutter under the bed  - Never hang pictures of hostile animals.  - Never have reflective surfaces directly facing the bed    EIGHT MANSIONS FORMULA  Try very hard to sleep with your head pointed to your best sheng chi direction based on the KUA formula. If this is not possible then try to sleep with your head pointed to one of your good directions. In doing this, do ensure that:  - Your bed is not located at an angle to the wall  - Your bed is not 'floating " in the center of the room  - Your feet or head are not pointing directly to the door  - Your feet or head are not directly pointing to the toilet  - Your bed is not sharing a wall with a toilet on the other side  - Your bed is not situated underneath a toilet on the floor above.  - Your bed is not located under an overhead beam  - Your bed is not being hit by sharp edges of corners or furniture.  - Your bedhead is placed against a solid wall.   I don't necessarily believe in this crap but it was still fun to read and try to follow.  So I guess I have everything checked off.  I slept early last night, midnight maybe (or a little before that) and I woke up around 5:30.  I feel pretty good.  I woke up feeling better than when I woke up yesterday morning.  Maybe it was because I didn't really sleep till early morning but none the less, I still feel like I had a good night's sleep.
