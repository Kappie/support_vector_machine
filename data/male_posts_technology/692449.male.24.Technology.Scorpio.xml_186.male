Which inspires today's quote: "Every jury in the land is tampered with and falsely instructed by the judge when it is told that it must accept as the law that which has been given to them, or that they can decide only the facts in the case"    --Lord Denham, O'Connell v. Rex (1884)  p.s. Sam I'm a little confused you say the jury nullification is bad news but the article you pointed to supports jury nullification. Do you support jury nullification?
