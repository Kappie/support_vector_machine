Today , what happens is this................................................................................and all good things must come to an end and well this is what happened.  Hey people , stop gawking at the blanko cause nothing much happened today and i got bored so i decided to blog about nothingness today. Say today is the day that wai nyan is alone at home having most of his family in church camp .....and too bad i am not there to organize a guy's nite out at this house....Not sure whether his parents will approve of that .  So wai Nyan, if you are reading this or if your "best friend" is reading this, well  Alone at home is one good thing,,,you can do whatever you want and have "visitor" as long as you want and to that friend of wai nyan **hint * hint....now is the time.....to pay a little visit....bring along some fruits/ manisan/ potato chips and a dvd or a vcd to be used as an excuse to accompany him so that he won't be lonely... Give him some love people....and if you happen to read this....give our man some love...  I mean i would do that....if i was there....and stop using your vivid imagination , you all who read this...to make it clear, our friend is tired after the whole day in Kemanyan, it is time to show him some life....make him relax and start having fun ...  Got new "eyes" and well soon to have new tooth tomorrow so that i can see perfectly the chick i have been targeting and smile that perfect smile....ahh.....the bliss of it..  Oh well blog u next time and  Ps: Hey Lechurn , read your mailbox and plan some stuff ....for the reunion ...remember must bring active participants...like chicks....not counting renny's one..
