Spending time in a beautiful place makes me feel like that thing, along with the laundry list of things I've already thought of, would make me happy if I just had IT. But life is not built in a way that allows me to love anything for long unless there is great effort expended in loving that thing. If I had a beautiful place I could always have, I would simply get used to it and not appreciate what I had, unless I spent some energy in reminding myself of what I had been given and tried to use it as best I could. There's the answer to a lot of problems I have, like wanting to spend money, wanting to leave work to go up in the mountains and hide--I simply need to look at the things I do have right now and be glad for them.
