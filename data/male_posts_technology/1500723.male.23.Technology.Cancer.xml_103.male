And this temple is built and maintained by an American who converted to Hindu changed his name (carudas Pronuncuation is : Karudas) and his wife (vaibhavi devi) is also Hindu converted American .. These people look interesting.. And temple is beautiful located in the remote village (spanish fork) of Utah and has a cool sceneries around it... and he also has some llama's...
