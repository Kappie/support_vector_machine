Right! In the outset let us see Who said this? Again a white skinned man called "Bertrand Russell"... Why this quote when there are too many satires quoted by intellectual Indians? why this obsession? Do you need a white man's quote to authenticate your stand point? and this is what Francois Gautier has qutoed in his write up as ...  "Obviously, colonisation has frozen the Indian mind in certain patterns and the British made sure, through Macaulay's policies, of leaving behind an enduring inferiority complex among Indians, by constantly harping on the flaws of Indian culture and inflating them. That is why today Indian intellectuals repeat like parrots what their masters had said before them..."  In retrospect, this is infact the mind set that has been sowed deep inside the indian minds...And I won't agree that Francois is a racist...had u read the writings of Francois, you might not be in a position to brand him as a racist and as a constant follower of his writings I wont agree upon the facts put forth by kishore that he's a racist.  I dont want to further quote some quotes as if quoting some IPC sections here now as it makes this discussion more like a court script...Instead the objective of francois was to discover the unknown inferiority of the majority of the indian minds (if not the whole of indian minds)...right!  :: Mahendran
