Tmor is my final assement day for my PE, i have got to do a swimming and rounders assesment, the swimming involves me swimming up and down a pool showing off my front crawl, back crawl and brestroke ! I have to also make sure i do the correct turns and the correct entry into the pool. The rounders involves me hitting, catching and bowling a ball ! Wow wot fun ! But becuase of this it means that i dont have to wear my school uniform all day and i get to miss french and science ! yippii, the bad thing is i will be doing around 3 hours of sport tmor cause we also have PE last ;lesson ! argh. On friday i also have my Trampolining assement which will be good cause that is the only one im good at ! Oh yea do any of you guys/ gals know whether we will be having good weather over the weekend? please say we do if not i will have to pray to the weather gods ! lol toodles
