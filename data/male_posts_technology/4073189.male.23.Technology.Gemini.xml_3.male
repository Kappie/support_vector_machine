With my mee and chicken wing, watching movies one after another.   1st movie: Identity (English)    2nd movie: Zatoichi (Japanese)   Switched on my Xbox and played "Red Dead Revolver", an action cowboy type game until 1930hrs. Had chicken rice for dinner and started to encode "Around the World in 80 Days" DVD I bought. I was told that it was protected from copying by the sales person. Haha... My rules says, "Nothing is copy protected!" Successfully ripped it and making another legal set as my computer can't play the "so call copy-protected" disc. What the heck those people do so much to protect their movies... protect until my PC can't play and then I had to decoded  re-encode it~!!! So much for supporting ORIGINAL~!!!  Brain's sleepy and had to plan tomorrow's day tommorrow...     ORD countdown:   63 days    Why is there a timer for my ORD?     NS is a waste of time... And I serve 16mths with a rank of CPLÂ…
