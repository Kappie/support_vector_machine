Basically, a tight and twisty course is constructed of cones in a large parking lot.  You rarely go over 60 MPH so this is not a high speed sport.  It focuses on cornering and smooth driving.  I'm definitely not good enough with the manual to consider doing it this year but I plan on checking out a few events so that I know what to expect next summer.  Anyway, check out some of these  urlLink course maps  and you'll get a better idea.
