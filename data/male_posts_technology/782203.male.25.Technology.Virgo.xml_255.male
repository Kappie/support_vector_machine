Was out with a gal and we were sitting down and chatting; it was around 2:30 am in the morning , and suddenly my phone rings. I answer it and immediately heard my mom shouting over the phone asking me if I knew what time it was; apparently the clocks at home weren't working. Anyway she continued on asking what the hell I was doing out so late etc. etc. After I hung up I could hardly look at my date in the eye; if I had a gun I would have probably shot myself there and then.
