He also started training hard amid hopes of leading his country to a medal at the Athens Olympics.    From me:    In somewhat related news, it appears the Spurs are trying to get as many foreign players as possible.  On the one hand, they've got Tony Parker. On the other, Rasho Nesterovic...  I guess if they hit 50% with their 4 foreign rookies they won't be too bad off.      Fantasy Impact     Manu had 10 ppg, 3.5 rpg, and 3 apg last season. He was listed after the departed Hedo Turkoglu on the depth chart, and showed progress last year. So, he'll probably be the starting SG for San Antionio. However, the Olympics will surely deplete him - being the star of the Argentine team, he'll be working hard. He'll certainly improve on last years numbers - everyone knows he's just waiting to blow up all over the court. He's still young enough that the Olympics might not take too much out of him. If you take him, don't count on him towards the end of the season.    Count it.
