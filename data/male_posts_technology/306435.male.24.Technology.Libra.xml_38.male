I have'nt actually done much at all this weekend...and it feels good.  Every once in awhile nothing is exactly what needs to be done.  Well to be honest I did do quite a few things.  Wednesday after Ann called, I went to Dana's urlLink   with her roomates and had a blast.  Thursday I worked later then usual and with the heavier traffic didn't get home til 6:00.  It is a shame too because Maressa and Carol had invited me to go to dinner with them.  I did watch all m shows though.  Hey speaking of Thursday night must see tv....the show Inside Schwartz has a Ryan connection....okay so it is not a huge one, but better than most.  The ex-girlfriend in the show is Maggie  Lawson was a frequent follower of the St. X way of life.  From what I know she dated Chris Burke and her brother was two years below me on the baseball team.  Maggie was also our local Fox Kids announcer.    Friday I hung out with Tom and we watched Brain Candy by Kids in the Hall and the allustrious Big labowski, which I may say to Mr. Matera (who probably will never read this) was not as good as it had been built up.  I mean it was just a story about Dude.  I mean how good can that really be.  Justin got back today.  His hair is really long now.  He looks very creepy.    Ann comes home tomorrow.  I miss her.  I am talkig to her on IM right now.  I miss her a lot.  It is funny how three months ago things were so different.  Now I can't seem to not think about her everyday.   weird huh?    okay I am done for the night...until then
