Their tagline was  Pay It Forward .  Now,  Pay It Forward  is one of my favourite movies. So, I've decided to be nice and give away the 3 Gmail invites I have for free. The only condition being that you do the same when you get those free invites.  Of course, I have no way of ensuring that you will actually send those invites for free, but I will trust you.  Because people are nice.  Leave a comment here with your e-mail address and name. The first 3 will get the invites. And more when I get more invites to send out.  [ Edited on June 21 ]  I have got more invites now. Send in your request as a comment on this post with  Full Name  and  e-mail id .
