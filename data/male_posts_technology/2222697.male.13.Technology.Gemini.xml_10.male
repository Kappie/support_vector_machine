I need games for my gamecube becuz i only have 2 and one of them sucks. I need to get pikmin [thinks about having many plant friends to help him in world domination] yeah that would be fun. I posted a thread on the XPLAY message boards about Anime-related video games. I want to see how many nerds like me will respond. Go to the bottom of my blog and you will see a link to the techtv blog ring. You may want to check it out. Final Fantasy X-2 comes out on tuesday, but being poor really makes you wait for it to be less. Yeah I'm going to pull out weeds in my backyard and see if they help me in world domination. BYE!!!!
