We went to west Texas today "The Hill Country" and hiked in a couple of miles on this trail to some waterfalls.  There my roommate, his girl friend, and her 2 little girls, a friend of my roommates and I hung out for the day picnicing and playing in the river.  It looked like it was going to be kind of a crappy day but turned out quite nice.  I called Karissa from the river but she had just gotten to the park and did not want to talk.  Which was probably OK I did not have that great of a signal.  Well time came we hiked out and we were going to watch the bats come out from under Congress Bridge in Austin but the kids were zonked in the car and we had about an hour to wait for dark so we opted to leave.  Ran out of gas on the way back.  Roomie and his GF hiked to the gas station.  I fed the kids, as they had woken up, and awaited their return.  I called Karissa again.  Things were pretty loud sounded like there was a party of some kind.  I can only assume that the party was for my   X  .  Needless to say Karissa did not want to talk and when she did she did not say much.  I would say "were you at the park today?" and all I got was a no or nothing so it was time to let her go.  I wanted to tell her about my day.  How fun it was for 2 reasons:  1.  I did have fun 2.  I guess deep down I wanted her to think daddy's house was fun to.
