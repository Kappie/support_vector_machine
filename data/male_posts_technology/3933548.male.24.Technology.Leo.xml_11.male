Or If you believe that you are an open minded person completely, can you assure that you have told each  thought or act of yours to atleast one person?   I believe that we should be completely open minded. At least try to do that. Its like the feeling we will have after a confession. We will feel  relieved once we are open minded. And no one can ever cheat you after that. Beautiful will be your mind. We can imagine the whole world to be full of beautiful moments    No one will try to suicide in such a world No will fell lonely. Try to have a  beautiful mind
