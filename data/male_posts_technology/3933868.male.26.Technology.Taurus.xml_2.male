Am losing my strength,...am lost my focus and my concentration...i dont know why...and i dont know how....maybe too much struggle with this kind of job make my mind and body tired...i just try to be a best,...run more fast than anybody...i just try tocompleted all my task...they giv me a 10..i finished a 10....hell i know in this kind of job...determination,stress-resistance,and high soft skill is a must!...    Last night i read a book...an sun tzu book.."100 strategist of war"...i learn a few things from there...hope i can implemented tht kind of strategyin here...just for survive...    But hell...am so fuckin tired of all this,..maybe i need a rest just a bit.well...few days after this day,..they send me to jungle again...this time not to vacation..but to fight..coz we just like a tools that used for fixed anything..., (hmm...sound's like complaining huh,..sound's like a pessimistic man...)but that not much like me...usually am always lookin for a good fight....    ...it's look like am loosing my will of fightin...i need something to make me able to fight again...  i always try to say.."stay cool..keep frosty..dont get it burn.."...it's easy to said..but it's so fuckin hard to do...    Maybe i must change my way of thinkin...from re-active...become more reflective.....  because......., Action = reaction doesnt suit me well.....
