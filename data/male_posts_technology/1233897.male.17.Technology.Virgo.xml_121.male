I woke up the first time around 7:10 this morning and drifted in and out of consciousness for around 2 hours, and finally got up when my dad got back home from a meeting.  He took me out to get a haircut for my school’s upcoming retreat to Wi-Ne-Ma on the beach. I got home around 11:30, took a shower, ate lunch, and headed back out the door for a piano recital. I came into that fairly unprepared, but surprised myself by doing a better job than I thought I would. I got back here about half an hour ago, and immediately got into Youthfire Chat (chat.christianlinks.com #youthfire, or  urlLink here  for all those people out there without an IRC client). I'm signed in for about ¾ of every day as The_Fire_Breathes.  Let me see here... *sits back and tries to recall the events of the last week or so...   The trip to Wi-Ne-Ma is next Thursday and Friday. For both the trips per year, one of the upper classes hosts the dinner on Thursday night. The fall on is the seniors, The Spring one (this next one) is the juniors.  It was quite funny last year: I was only taking two classes, and naturally, I wasn’t as up on the proceedings of the school as everyone else was, plus a lot of people didn’t know me. So, when I wandered into the meeting room that the juniors were setting up, no one questioned me, and I had no reason to assume that I wasn’t supposed to be there. I just hung out the entire time that they were setting up, and it took me until after all the other classes were formally ushered in, to realize that I wasn’t supposed to be there :)  Anyway, the juniors have been confining themselves into one classroom during lunch, more often than not over the last three weeks, and I’m really interested in what they’re going to have set up.  Josh and I might make a Piccolo-Pete bomb and bring it, but we don’t know yet... I got a new 1,000,000 candle power spotlight on top of the other identical one, and the 3,000,000 candle power one that I already have. I might get a 6 cell MagLite, and high intensity LED headset before then too. Oh, yeah... back to pyrotechnics... modded lighters, WD-40, small street firecrackers, and possibly some air horns (not really pyrotechnical, but they’re still stinkin’ fun).  Student council elections were several days ago, and I wanted to run, but I decided not too since I still wasn’t sure if I was going to be a junior or senior next year. (I have finally decided to take a huge burden off my shoulders over the summer by not graduating a year early, but I didn’t decide until two days after the elections.) I’m going to hate myself throughout the entirety of this upcoming school year, for that decision, but I think it’s for the better in the long run.
