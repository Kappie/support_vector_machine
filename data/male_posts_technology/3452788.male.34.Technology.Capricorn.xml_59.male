I didn't need a perfect dad, just one who could be there.  I don't have anyone who can be strong for me in the rare moments when I can let down my guard.  I don't really have a rock I can lean on.  My best friend is the closest thing I have to a rock, but she is so far away, and she has her own life.  I have to be strong for everyone else around me, whether at home (emotional strength, dependable, provider, parent) or at work (dependable, trustworthy, productive).  I don't want to be any of those things, but if anyone else is around it is never OK to let myself be quiet, vulnerable, scared, sad, sick.  I only give myself permission to be that way when I am alone.  I think this is part of why I am so scared of people - I always need to put on a face for someone, including at home.    When I need emotional support from Anne, she has a hard time giving me what I need at that moment.  She loves me, she cares for me, but she won't talk to me when I really need it.  Last night I came home from work a nervous, anxious emotional wreck and basically cried myself into a nap.  I told her this later, and she kept right on quilting, acting like I had told her the car needed gas, or we were low on milk.  I poured a big glass of scotch and went to bed, passing out at about 10pm.  Later, around 2am, she woke me up to make love.  Sex feels good, of course, but more than anything I needed to explain why I felt like such a failure and why I almost ran away yesterday and why I miss the Dad I never had and why I need her to TALK TO ME!!!
