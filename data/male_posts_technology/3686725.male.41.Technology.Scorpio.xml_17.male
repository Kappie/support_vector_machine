Here's one of my favorite quotes:     "Three-quarters of the ads aired by Bush's campaign have been attacks on Kerry. Bush so far has aired 49,050 negative ads in the top 100 markets, or 75 percent of his advertising. Kerry has run 13,336 negative ads -- or 27 percent of his total. The figures were compiled by The Washington Post using data from the Campaign Media Analysis Group of the top 100 U.S. markets.  Both campaigns said the figures are accurate. "  [emphasis added]   The article is also critical of Kerry's misstatements about W but notes that the Bushies are not only far, far more negative but also far more WRONG or misleading.  Well, I for one am  urlLink shocked, shocked  to discover such shennanigans coming from the Grand Old Party.
