Sister, I'm telling you this place is crawling with it. Ironically, I am now working at the costume shop that made the white Elvis-style jumpsuit for Britney Spears' Las Vegas concert PR campaign (she sent us a signed poster of herself in it recently). So much for the highbrow artsy theatre stuff. Sigh.
