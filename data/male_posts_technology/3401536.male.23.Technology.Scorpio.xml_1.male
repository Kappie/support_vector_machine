If any of you have ever worked in the service industry, you know what I am talking about.  In the process of finding a new job, I thought about teaching. While i wasnt expecting to do much, since i dont have any teaching experience or certification, i was just looking to do something in the community where i could pass along some of my computer knowledge. After a couple phone calls and emails, I am now going to teach a computer class at Pikes Peak Community College (PPCC) here in Colorado Springs (SPGS). From the first phone call to the offer, it was about 2 hours. I was completely caught off guard, but am excited.  The class is basic computing and only a 100 level class, but it should be fun. Also, it is on Peterson Air Force Base. I understand that PPCC has a remote location there. And, it will be a bit of a consentrated course. For the four weekends in October, I will be teaching Friday night and all day Saturday. It doesn't bother me too much; the experience will be great.  Ciao
