He asked me what he could do to help me increase my productivity. That's business speak for put up or shut up. So I guess this is the cosmos once again telling me something needs to happen. Either fake-happily do my job like I used to, or radically break from my circumstances . . . it'll more likely be the former.    So I'll have to split my time between painstaking self-analysis and trying to figure out what this strange meter is supposed to measure and why the readout looks to be full of cod-liver oil. For that matter, why does this cautery transformer reek of burnt human flesh? Oh, right . . .that's what it's for, charring human flesh.
