I also didn't want to fire up any consoles to play games either. I wonder what that means. Oh well, I'll be getting Warcraft III today with The Frozen Throne expansion, so that should keep me busy for awhile.   I can't wait to see the backyard! The little hobbit hole you guys made for yourself (while quite small) is really cool. I can tell that the backyard did look really good once before, but you're right...when you have a business, you have precious little time for anything else.   I've been having trouble sleeping. I find that it takes me 30 minutes to go to sleep (or at least, feel like I'm going to sleep). Maybe I should take those vitamins that you were talking about. I exercised yesterday and that felt really good. Consequently I feel really good right now...but I think the vitamins would help out a lot.
