 I'm posting a little late this morning...uhm...afternoon.  I woke at around 8 as usual with pain in my stomach.  I drank some water and went back to sleep, rising eventually at 11:30.  I had a package of swiss cake rolls when I woke up simply because I had a craving. Minor belching followed.  Just now at 1:40 pm I had half a cup of Silk Cultured Soy (Soy based yogurt).  Again, minor belching.  I'm trying to eat little so I can train tonight.
