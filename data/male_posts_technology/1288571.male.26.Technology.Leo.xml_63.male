I know you're probably thinking "Big deal. It's only one day" but I'm so pumped over this game, its unreal.  It looks so goddamn cool that it makes me go adsoifha;lsdkfjadsf;jklfdsjak;lfdsjl;kfdsa  Yes. Really. Exactly like that. lol  Anywho I'll be picking it up for Xbox over Gamecube me thinks. I read a review over at  urlLink IGN  and it said that its a little easier on controls due to the fact that Xbox controller has one more button. Whoopy!  It'll start to round out my Xbox game library with my GC one.  I have SSX Tricky on GC anyway.  Going to make a few calls to see if I can score it today rather than tomorrow. Wish me luck!
