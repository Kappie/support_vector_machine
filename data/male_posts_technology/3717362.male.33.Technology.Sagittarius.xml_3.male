This is taking a victim who is begging for their life, and sawing their head off with a knife.  Inhumane, mercilous, sickening, dispicable.  My heart goes out to the families of these victims, as I cannot fathom the imact on them.  Just attempting to imagine it is overwhelming.  I pray that they find peace through the Comforter, the Holy Spirit.  Only God can judge a man's heart.  But actions in this life earn consequences in this life.  May those consequences be swift.
