I dont blog too often because there is nothing to blog about, I tend to say my own opinion on what someone has said (like i just did above). I got one valentine card, from Nic.J (can tell by the handwriting). I will blog once every two or three days, as there is no need to blog everyday. I just come on sometimes to look at recent posts.  The film will be good tomorrow, but I need to walk to Daves first (cant b assed to get the bus!) YAY! Then on Sunday i'm going bowling/croydon with Nic.J!!
