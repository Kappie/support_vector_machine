For those who are intrested, it was a presentation on Performance Management. Also known as 'How We, The Company, Will Shag You Up The Ass And Convince You That It's Actually Quite A Bit Of Fun. No Really.' Anyone working in a reasonably large company will no doubt be familiar with performance apparaisals. Ie, when your boss takes you aside and tells you how crap you are at your job and how you don't, in fact, deserve a raise. What struck me as a bit funny was how the presenter used charts and shit to show that most employees were dead average, and just did their job. Hello? That's what you PAY us to do - our jobs. Nothing more, nothing less. Now don't get me wrong, I'm all for enjoying your job, getting some sense of satisfaction out of it. But in the end, it  IS  merely a job. Very, very few of us get the opportunity to really be involved in a job that we are passionate about. While I like my job (Systems Analyst/Support), it's far from my dream job ( which is probably writing, or working as a journalist, specifically one in the IT and/or PC/console gaming industry). I do it for the money. As such, the only thing that's going to motivate me is money. Period. And if companies are going to liken 100% effort as merely 'average', and use this excuse NOT to give us more oney, how can they expect carrer-workers to 'give that little bit extra'? It's like a vicious cycle : Employer demands 115%, but only pays if workers work harder. Workers will work harder, but only if employer pays. It's almost like the old cowboys flicks, we have two guys on the street, each waiting for the other to draw his gun. Difference is,  neither  party IS willing to bite the bullet and draw first.  Anyhoo, I have this coming Monday off, so expect yet MORE skippage then. Bah, why am I making excuses, I'm sure the few of you who bother to read this trash wouldn't give a flying fuck at a rolling donut if this blog just died tomorrow. So the hell with you.  :D
