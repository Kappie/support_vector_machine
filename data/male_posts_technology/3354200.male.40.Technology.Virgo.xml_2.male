Lyn and I usually try to put together a Christmas Newsletter to send out with cards, but we didn't make it in time last one, so here is our recent history.  We have been living in Sacramento, in our current apartment for 2 years now, its a little small, but we get by.  Lyn has not been able to teach, with the recent layoffs of teachers, the ranks of the substitute pool have swelled larger than is practical to even attempt to get work.  Lately she has been helping her dad take care of her mom, who has been feeling a little under the weather.  Bev broke her ankle trying to get out of bed, then got a bowl obstruction.  She was scheduled for surgery Sunday, it wasn't supposed to be as involved as Lyn's was, they should be able to keep it to cauterizing adhesions laproscopicly.  Unfortunately, the surgeon couldn't keep it laproscopic, and ended up having to do a full resection.  We don't have all the details yet, but we'll update when we do.  I have been handed a change at work.  I had been working at Mercy San Juan Hospital for over 4 years, when I got the call that I was moving to our Regional office in Rancho Cordova to work in a new position as Tier 3 support.  What this means is I will be mostly working on projects, and Helpdesk tickets that have been escalated beyond the site support technicians.  I will have a service area over much of northern California.  Well, that's it for now, I'm still getting a handle on what I will do with this bloc, I suppose the first thing I should do is tell people about it !!
