Why me alone I think because I am, I think because my Dad told me to, and I think because I'm paid a tidy sum of money to do so on a monthly basis.  However I  don't  think now is the time to acquiesce, for not thinking is exactly what other people thought wouldn't get them into trouble (and it did).  So if I have to decide whether being such a thinker is a blessing or a curse, I'd have to say I'll get back to you because I'd have to think it through.
