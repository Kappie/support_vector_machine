OK Time for a semi serious blog :)  I got some news today about the ole' Family tree but before I tell you all about it lets have a Mikes Family tree 101 class ;)  First of my Dad. A few years ago my old man was looking through some old photo albums and he saw a picture of himself standing with his older sister.. Only problem was he was 30 something and she was only 10.. Turns out Granny had a fling with my Aunts God-Father (Wonder what the church would have to say about that ;P) and Daddy dearest is the product of the affair so to speak :) So right there it turns out all my Aunts and Uncles and Cousins on that side of the family are really all halves if you get me. Also turns out I have a whole load of relatives I have never met.. Interesting eh?  With me so far? Good, now to talk about my "immediate" family.  My Mum Married my Dad (as you do) and they had me and my two sisters. About 18 years ago they got seperated and that was that for the moment :) Then about 7-8 years ago my Dad decide to have a child with an ex of his (at the time he was to be the sperm donor for someone who wanted a baby, but he was going to do the AI the old fashioned way if you get my drift ;) but of course all this with an ex... They end up getting back together before Little Bro is born (David, he kicks ass)  So Current state of play: Me, Linda, Claire (my two sisters) and my Half-Bro David.  Anywho a couple years on and my Dad and Davids Mum Mags have split up and Mags gets together with Barry (The Ferryman for the Island they live on..) They are very happy together and have a daughter together, Niamh.  How does this affect the family tree? Hard to figure out exactly but basically I have a half brother called David, he has a half sister called Niamh but Niamh is no relation to me.. (At least best I can figure she isn't..)  Phew, this is starting to hurt my head..  Anyway.. The reason for this blog is my dad called me the other day to inform me of another knot in the family tree.. Turns out his girlfriend claire (no, not my sister you sick sick people) is pregnant so I am due another little brother\sister in about 6 months time..  Someday I am going to try and draw this nightmare up and see what it looks like, I just can't figure out how to put 3 mothers and one father in the same family tree diagram, let alone how I am supposed to figure in Davids other sister and the extended families there...  EEEEKKK..  Anywho, that little blog should keep you lot happy for the moment ;)
