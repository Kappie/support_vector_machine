I think I'm going to increase my distance per workout. Sure wish I had numbers from my previous workouts to know just how much I should/can increase. The article also made it clear that if I want to go farther, I might want visit the pool more often. I'm training for a November tri with a  really  short swim of 500 meters and I don't think I could cover that distance today. Pretty sad, really. Well, nothing that a little hard work can't fix.
