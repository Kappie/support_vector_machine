           
      I spoke with my "boss" (I just use the term because the working relationship is more complicated due to the bureaucracies of large organisations) today about my scheduled trip to perth next week and according to the schedule it will be quite full-on next week with audits of parramatta and hurstville sites.  I was hoping she would say I wouldn't really be needed but I know for a fact that both sites together have 500-600+ users, so it wouldn't be fair to leave them high and dry - especially my colleague, who is unfamiliar with both sites.  Oh well, I'm obviously disappointed because I was all hyped up to go and now I'm not. Plus I have to re-book my ticket AGAIN. Looking at ticket prices, I'll have to settle for a weekend trip to Melbourne to fit my schedule and as to not pay any extra for difference in fare. There's still a $66 re-booking fee though... *sigh*
