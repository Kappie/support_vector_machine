 Just as i finished watching it for the first time, a guy named Eli called. He saw my ad at  urlLink Musicians  and offered me a job as a pianist in a cover band in the mega-fabulous  urlLink Herod's  hotel in Eilat. 4000 NIS after taxes + free accomodation. Not too much, but then it's fun. Makes you think...
