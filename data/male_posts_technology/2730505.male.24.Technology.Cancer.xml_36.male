Hell Yeah the  urlLink Cubs  and  urlLink Greg Maddux  have agreed on terms for a contract that will bring Greg back home to Chicago where he started his big league career.  This just means that the Cubs rotation is looking like the best in all of MLB.  Sure there's still offense but it's pitching that wins games.  Opening day rotation would look like this.  Mark Prior, Kerry Wood, Greg Maddux, Carlos Zambrano, Matt Clement.  The highest ERA of all those pitchers belongs to Zambrano with a 4.11 ERA.  That's not great but it's good enough to be the number 4 starter.  With Patterson back and Derek Lee added to the mix, with Sosa and Alou still hitting with the rest of the role player line up, this is a good looking team that figures to be playing in October.  I can't wait.  Chicago will be buzzing NL Champs if not the World Series.  Oh yeah!  This just makes me want to go get some summer time food.  Imagine this, it's 85 out, on a Saturday in Chicago.  The sun is out but there is a gentle breeze that makes the weather enjoyable.  You are walking down Clark coming from a brunch to go watch the Cubbies.  You walk up to the entrance to Wrigley Field on the Clark Side (in front of the Cubbie Bear) and look up at the marquee " urlLink Wrigley Field, Home of the Chicago Cubs "  You watch all the people walk around with smiles on their faces carrying food and beer looking for their seats.  You walk up the stairs and see the Ivy that is growing on the outfield wall, then you see the green grass, then you see the in field and then the pitchers mound.  You make you way to your seats on the first base side 15 rows back.  You are close enough to see their numbers and somewhat makeout their faces.  You sit down and take in the sun.  You look around and see all the people.  You feel the electricity that you only get when you put a old building with a lot of people out to have a good time.  It's fun.  Ahh, late March, season opener.  162 games till the playoffs.  Go Cubbies.  In other baseball news,  urlLink A-ROD (Alex Rodriguez)  has been traded to the  urlLink New York Yankees .  The best player in baseball is now playing on the biggest stage and the most storied franchise in all of sports.  I guess it was inevitable after New York saw Boston trying to get A-ROD, the Yanks had to make sure that this deal won't have the possibility of happening again.  I think this is terrible for baseball.  It just shows how the rich get richer and the small market clubs don't have a chance in hell to land players like that.  Their payroll is approaching $200 Million and that's unheard of compared to say the Cubs who only have a $60-70 Million payroll.  That is insane.  4 Yanks have $100 Million or more contracts.  So tonight, I might wander over to the local Blockbuster and rent ESPN Baseball or Crimson Skies have a few beers.  ESPN Baseball is thought to be the best of the crop so far this year.  I also like how if you do have XBOX Live, the games automatically update the roster accordingly.  That is badass.  It's too bad that the next XBOX has no harddrive so this sort of functionality will not be available.  Well that's it for now.  You - Good luck with your exams sweetie.  I'll call you later
