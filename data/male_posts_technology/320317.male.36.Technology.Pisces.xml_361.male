Despite Apple's secrecy fetish, all the really interesting stuff was well known before Steve stepped onstage. But if they read between the lines, I think the Mac faithful got some big news from the computer industry's last rock star."

 I am not sure that if any Mac users really care. The biggest applications I imagine Apple users need to worry about is Word, Internet Explorer, and maybe Excel. There are certainly a lot of alternatives to them. However, I would be curious to know many macheads use MS software considering they hate them so much.
