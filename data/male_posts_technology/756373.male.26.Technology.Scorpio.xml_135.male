Rumsfeld: " I was with the Polish minister of defense this weekend in Istanbul, Turkey at the NATO Summit.  And in the course of that, he pointed out that his troops in Iraq had recently come across – I’ve forgotten the number, but something like 16 or 17 – warheads that contained sarin and mustard gas."  Is this enough, yet, to convince the US's detractors that there were, in fact, WMD's in Iraq?  Somehow I doubt it.
