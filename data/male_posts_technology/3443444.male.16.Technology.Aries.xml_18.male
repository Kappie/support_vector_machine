I haven't heard anything since that time. So, its been 18 hours, for an under 2 hour journey, and according to their tracking, it hasn't made any stops yet. I am befuddled.  I do however, have some good news! First off, Cait said that she was gonna come over and bring me pizza and hang out for a while, this is such great news because I haven't seen her it what seems like forever and I really miss her. And also in October, the 11th-18th to be exact, My Mom, my Dad and I are going to Las Vegas. We're gonna be staying at the Stratosphere tower hotel since its really cheap, but I think its just so my Mom can always find out hotel...It should be fun there, with all the hookers, and celebrities etc. I have only one thing that would be nice, a fake ID so I could sneak into Bellagio's poker room, or at least watch a poker tournament or something!
