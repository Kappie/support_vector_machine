Things like "We have seen a change"  "what can we do to help" came up. To which I replied "I bet you have"  "How's about a company car and an expense account". Well it was worth a shot, but no!.   So the meeting went fine, she asked and I answered. Laid out everything that was bothering me, e.g. "customer satisfaction" crap. The shit that has been forced down our necks for WEEKS!!! So, all in all we talked and apologies where given for their slip ups and areas of focus will be focused on. Time will tell.   The rest of the Weekend in Nutshell form. Don't ride the Luas unless you want to be squashed! Don't go to town on a Saturday unless you want to be trampled. If your really don't want to take the Girlfriend to the zoo, fake enthusiasm for shopping. But be prepared for head splitting boredom in payment. And when the button says "DO NOT PRESS" DON'T TOUCH IT... Hoo god me hand!!
