Traveling the powerful roads of adversity that within its own soul brings unique challenges to my competitive psyche. At one time, it was different, the whole game was different. I was virtually a whole other person until one day...sometimes, you just can't help but feel it. Its sweet melody pulsates through your mind like a Bach cantata, or perhaps a Brahms lullaby. The pure innocence of the mood masks the dirty, foul, rancid truth buried under years of assumed intelligence. After all this time, I thought I realized this...but life was soon to prove me wrong.  Foreshadowing? Naah, it hasn't happened yet, but it will. Call it a sixth sense, if you will, but after all this time, a man knows how it will all end. Even now I sit here waiting for her. How ironic to abide in the drivers seat when my world is out of control. Even now she dresses in warm clothing, fancying up for what is supposed to be a romantic night on the town. It would be nice, this romantic fling into the city... Even now there is a fore under my shadow, a precursor to the revelation of our legacy, proven only by action, denied not by foolish creedence or petty undulance...BE STILL MY RAGING SOUL!  "I thought you had bigger breasts than those!"  Verona shrugs me off, "You always think too much nigga."  "Hey where's that shirt I bought you? I thought you were wearing it tonite?" I inquire. She made no attempt to respond right away as she covered her half-exposed upper form with her scarf while promplty sliding her miniskirt back close to her knees as she gets in the car.  "Hey playboy, I thought I was driving tonite," she begins.  Feeling instantly insulted that she ignored my question my next thought was to say nothing, even thought her amazing physique made me reconsider. "Playa when you help pay this car note, you can go anywhere you want." Money. Something she didn't have, something she wasn't in a rush to obtain. Something she very rarely got from me, which begged the obvious question...who was giving it to her. Parents? Naah...stingy  tight-lipped. Ex boyfriend/ sugar daddy/ splackavelli on the low? Drug pusher? Street whore??? Who knows. It worries me though, and I think about it all the time. Fortunately, she's not my girl...never has been, never will be. But one day I need to tell her that, instead of leading her on.   By this time, I had eliminated nearly all of my sins, the latest being my willful desire to fornicate. Before that, I gave up...well, I can't say that I no longer lie because...well, i'm living a lie. As the ministers say, the truth is not in me. Some have even come to question the very term...what is truth? I don't quite know what it is but I know what it is not. My life does not reflect the spiritual integrity of my intended virtue, which makes me shallow  inconsiderate. However shallow, i'm far from indecisive. But I spent that time with her. Now I sit with someone new, someone with a similar aura...whose future could very nearly mirror my own. Mirror me then, don't mock me. Don't play me for a fool. Never sell me short! I stand 5' 11 not 1' 5. Mirror me...  Once all these things passed me there was but one remaining sin...my last sin. Quote the good servant, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want." Of all sins that face mankind, I dare not face this one alone...     TO BE CONTINUED
