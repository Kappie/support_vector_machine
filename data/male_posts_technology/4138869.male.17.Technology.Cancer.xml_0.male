The Newton physics engine seems quite capable of doing much more than I originally wanted, and implementing it is far from a hard and tedious task. The Irrlicht engine and Newton fits perfectly. The tech demo let me throw boxes around and play with ragdolls. Fun fun fun!  Now, it was my intentions to test SpiderMonkey too, but for some reason I can't get it to compile yet. I will retry it when I get back to my own computer where I actually can install and run things without doing creative things with my limited access rights. I have to work around my denied access to the command line here by using a batch file as a proxy. Tedious.  I should also test Crystal Space very soon.  Oh, and Dev-C++ works quite well. Not as polished as the new Visual C++, but it sure works and it's free. If VC++ didn't have its price tag, I'd buy it.
