Those familiar with video games will know that they're the producers responsible for the 2K3 series of sports games. After a few weeks working here, I've decided that this isn't the exact industry I want to learn about.  Oh, and I'm sure many of you out there think that testing video games is the perfect job. This isn't exactly the case. While video games are ideal for an hour or two of mindless enjoyment, the fun can wear off when you're stuck playing them hour after hour after hour, etc.  I'm lucky that my coworkers make my job bearable. Well, getting baked before work doesn't hurt either. Hehehehehehe... (stoned laughter).   Game Plan  (tentative of course): 1. Apply for grad school to study advertising. 2. Take the GRE. 3. ?
