I have finished 3 1st, 1 3rd, and a few out in the last few days. I am going to move up to $10 for a hand or two. Try and take some bigger pots.   I still stink at .50/$1. I keep falling into the bad play trap. I see people taking huge pots on A high, and suddenly that becomes a great hand! All in baby! At least I am limiting myself to $5 at a time.
