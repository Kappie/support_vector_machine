I was fortunate to meet her Tuesday, and visited again last night. She is an interesting individual. She has gone to school/college most of her life and can speak 5 languages. She has a hard accent and at times has that confused look as to what your trying to convey to her, but you can also see she is definitely a warm, well knowledged person.   I was able to speak with her a bit during lunch Tuesday, about the main dichotomy of here and over seas. She said society in whole, school system and just from one town to the other as differences she see's. Their main means of transportation is by train or bicycle. Gas is horribly expensive, and with only the short distances of travel, they mainly cycle it.   I am on support starting tonight throughout the weekend. The family will be able to go out to dinner with her tonight and I hope to be able to discuss with her again. I find it fascinating to hear first hand of others view. My wife was able to spend some time with her during the week. But I feel she could have more time with her, were it not for her Aunt's hoggging her friend.   I will ask my wife to see if we can have her spend the night prior to her leaving.
