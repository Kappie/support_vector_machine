I wanted to write pages to this blog, but now all that's left of my thoughts are a few scattered memories.   School seems so bittersweet now... It's like I don't care at all about grades anymore, prolly because I feel helpless and incompetent. I'll never be good enough, I'll never be good enough. - That’s what I keep telling myself about both my schoolwork and pathetic, lovesick musings. Truth is though, with the new ADD / Dyslexia program that I'm on and support from my parents and most of my teachers, I probably can overcome the schoolwork issues and pull my GPA up from something like 1.1 now to at least a 3.0. Even after that though, the other problem still remains and in truth, for that I really don't think I'll ever be good enough.  Why oh why does this world have to be so cruel? Why do I have to keep torturing myself with all these emotional politics?  Holy crap, I need Cameran there at the banquette with me so I'll have a little support to fall back on... Hope he can come.
