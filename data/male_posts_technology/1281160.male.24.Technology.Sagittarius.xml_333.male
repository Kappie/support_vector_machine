But it shud not become like msitmmb where everyone exists but still no one gives a damn. For example, (with due respects to everyone concerned) sangee's status has been "pending" for quite a while. If joining takes an eternity then I wonder if she wud really be interested to contribute. Someone can please check with her if she's really intersted in participating.  My only point is, the growth in size must not dilute the existing tenacity...
