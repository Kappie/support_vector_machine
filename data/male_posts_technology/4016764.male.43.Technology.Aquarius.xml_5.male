First and foremost, because they do not want responsibility for the demise of western civilization and culture, and for the destruction of the very family they are so proud to tout as their contribution to the nation. Without the religious nuts and conservative puritanical approach to life, the family certainly would've been wiped off the face of the earth, right?   Quite the opposite is true. If these people would step up and take some responsibility for their families instead of carting the kids off to daycare so they can make a huge combined income to fuel their Hummer, and maintain their Lexus, and 16 bedroom house for their 3-member family, and play 18 holes every night, not to mention pay the bill for theViagraprescription for Grandpa and the short shorts for their teenaged daughters... you get the idea. If they would own up to the fact that they have allowed their families to deteriorate because of their selfish pursuit of stuff, and actually teach their children that their are better ways to spend their time and money than on bimbos with their legs spread and every venereal disease known to man, they wouldn't provide so much fodder for the porn industry. Instead of changing laws and trying to force the business out of business, focus on the real problem. Look in the mirror.
