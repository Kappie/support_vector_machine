New company is going really well (Have a look at  urlLink the site since we tweaked it ;)  not much has changed but there are a few things..) and we have just moved into real offices! Our new guy started on monday too.. Seán is wierd, very wierd, must get him a blog!  Aynwho, all this means that I have gotten myself set up in work at last and as long as our new phone lines go into the office tomorrow (Please please please..) I may actually get the occasional chance to blog from work soon! If not I will at least try to check in semi regularly.  Anywho, Catch you all later ;)  Mike  P.S. Jonny has a small penis Jonny has Crabs, Jonny gets really crabby when his PMT kicks in Jonny likes to hump dead animals in the sitting room pretending they belong to a "friend" (You know what I am talking about Jonny.. "Bah Bah Black...") Jonny likes it when people call him Joanne.. Try it ;)
