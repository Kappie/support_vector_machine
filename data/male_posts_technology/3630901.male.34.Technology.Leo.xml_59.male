Otherwise we don't need you.  not a productive member of the company?  terminate him.  maybe he'll be more productive somewhere else, for someone else.  But he should stop wasting our time and our resources.  everyone seems so involved, so buried in this illusion.  why is that?  none of this is real.  none of this matters.  reviewing data that leads to improving the quality of processes.  think about it.  ten years from now, what will it have mattered that you've wasted your life as a wage slave, improving processes?  some people say they work 70 hour weeks.  what a bunch of bonehead.  i work to live or i live to work?  there is no I in team.  Yeah, but there are four I's in individuality!  this hotel room, this tv, this bed.  none of this is real.  The elevator is not real.  the car is not real.  that bus is not real.  though it would have a real effect on me (whatever 'me' is) if it were to hit me.  It might be the end of 'me'.  the job is not real, the company is not real, the work is not real.  Or at the very least, it is meaningless.  Truly.  Think about it.  What's real is relationships.  What's real is love.  What's real is creating meaning between individuals.  Experiencing.  All these wage slaves around me are so involved in the illusion.  It's just scary.    Why go to work at all?  It's not real.  It's not meaningful.  it was very tempting this morning to say fuck it all, and just go hang out at the beach.  And why not?  well I guess there would be the real consequences of possibly losing my job and then having to find another job.  I would lose the real paycheck, which allows me to pay bills and live the life I'm currently living, maintaining the lifestyle I'm living.    If I didn't have kids, I'd be sorely tempted to sell all my crap and move to an island paradise, at least for a few years.  enjoy life for a while.  forget all this business speak.  it's very hard to stay focused on the illusion, once the veil has been removed.
