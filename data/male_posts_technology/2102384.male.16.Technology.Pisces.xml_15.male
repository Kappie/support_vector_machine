I also know Perl and some Visual Basic commands.  I can easily alter Perl scripts and I have made some of my own.  I do not know Perl very fluently but I know if well enough.  I only know some Visual Basic code because I have developed a few Visual Basic programs.  The VB project I am most proud of is  urlLink Network Message Send .  I currently know bits and pieces of Unix shell script, DOS, and any other language similar to the ones I already know.  I haven't been able to program and design much recently because I've been busy with school, swimming, water polo, and illness.  I am going to learn Java next year in a class in high school.  I am not too excited about learning Java but it is the only language they teach at my school besides Visual Basic.  I believe Java will not grow online anymore.  It is almost obsolete on the internet and the only place it is really used is cellphones.  I self-taught myself all of the other languages I know so I am not sure how they will teach the course and if it will be easier to learn from an instructor.
