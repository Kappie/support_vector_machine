Every little thing then adds a bit to that mound of hope and this continues till the mound grows to form a hillock... then a hill and finally a mountain. All this while you are wallowing indulgently in a make-believe world.  And then... suddenly without any warning... something happens that blasts this mountain, that you've created, to smithereens!!  Jerked out of the dream that you've come to think of as reality, you grope around trying to find familiar people and objects, that never were! Thats when you realize the futility of it all!  Why does everything have to end so badly? ... you wonder!! But there are no answers... only questions!!   Then it all crashes down And you break your crown And you point your finger, but there's no one around Just want one thing Just to play the King But the castle's crumbled and you're left with just a name Where's your crown, King Nothing?   'nuf said!  have a nice weekend, folks!  cheers!  P.S. : with many thanx to Hetfield, Ulrich  co.! :-)
