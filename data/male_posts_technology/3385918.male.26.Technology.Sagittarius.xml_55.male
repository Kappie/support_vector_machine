Besides that I've been working on several items for my blog, but I've been so swamped with work, I haven't had time to finish any of them. Proof of this is my recent  urlLink Fangoria  article. While I've published it and the article is finished, I still need to do some work on it. I am linking the names of the movie to their entry in the  urlLink Internet Movie Database .   I like doing this because when I write about a movie, I probably don't add too much info on it due to limited space. Some of the stuff I write is pretty long and if I add more info, it becomes never ending. This way, people can follow the link and get more info on that particular movie.   Someone suggested that I should just like the movie directly to  urlLink Amazon  and maybe earn some cash in the process. I have a pretty good job and I really don't need to do this. I prefer people get a link that gives them more information on the title, not a way to purchase the title.   I will, on the other hand, be making a horror DVD shopping list. I will do this nearing October where there is much more interest in buying horror films than in summer. There I will add links to both Amazon and ebay so people can acquire those movies. Even then, I will avoid joining any money making programs. I'm not in this for the money and, again, my day job pays pretty well.  Next item on my list is to watch several movies I have bought. I recently purchased  urlLink Zatoichi  ( urlLink Takeshi Kitano ),  urlLink Anna in Kung Fu Land ,  urlLink Silver Hawk ,  urlLink Protege de la Rose Noire ,  urlLink Warriors of Heaven  Earth  and  urlLink Drunken Monkey . I bought all these movies on DVD for the incredible price of $47 (including shipping and handling). Well, at least I taught it was good.  The Silver Hawk DVD came damaged. I was going to return it for an exchange, but yesterday I found out that it would cost me more than what I paid for it to send it back. So, I decided to keep it. It's playing but the inner ring is scratched. Still, I'll keep it and, if I see that it's good, I'll buy it again. Problem solved.   Of the films that I bought, I've only been able to see Protege de la Rose Noire and Zatoichi.   Protege de la Rose Noire was very disappointing. Had it's moments, but it's just to silly and uneven. It's also surprising that it's a  urlLink Donnie Yen  film, yet it doesn't have any real martial arts except two scenes which, frankly, where played for laughs. Donnie Yen did pretty well choreographing The Twins ( urlLink Charlene Choi  and  urlLink Gillian Chung ) in  urlLink Twins Effect , which is why I really was looking forward to this movie. Total let down. Not even  urlLink Ekin Cheng  was enough to save this movie.  Takeshi Kitano's Zatoichi is something totally different. This movie really blew me away. It's no surprise that  urlLink Miramax  is trying to release this gem of a movie in the summer. I hope they do and I hope it gets a big audience. While slow, it features first rate performances, a witty script and some awesome swordplay and gore that will make splatter hounds sit up and take notice. It's no surprise that this movie has done pretty well in several international film festivals. I've hear people talking about this movie left and right and, now, I know why. Don't walk, run and pick up this movie on eBay, or be sure to see it on opening day when it slides into theaters (if it gets into theaters, Miramax is no inconsistent with dates and oriental releases).  A side note, you can also try to pick up the great  urlLink Azumi . Another  excellent swordplay movie that is nothing less than a breathtaking epic. My only gripe with this movie is that it has a lot of bloodshed, but very little gore (unlike Zatoichi which, while a smaller movie, has both in spades).  urlLink Ryuhei Kitamura  ( urlLink Versus ) such restraint in this movie, but it works, letting the performers out shine the violence. Worth getting but, beware the Chinese release of this Japanese movie. The DVD is buggy.   I've also recently bought the Operation  urlLink Operation Scorpio  and  urlLink May  DVD. I haven't see Operation Scorpion yet, even thought I did see the trailers and it looked sweet from a martial art's fan point of view. I did see May. What a fucked up movie !!! I loved every single frame. Fangoria has been raving about this little movie and Angela Bettis, who plays the main character, has been winning people over left and right. She is brilliant in this movie, which makes me even sadder that it didn't out shine 28 Days Later for horror movie of 2003. 28 Days Later is good, but not great. It's not great because it's not original. May is great because it is original. It is disturbing and well made.   On the personal side of things, I am working on a horror screenplay with my best internet friend. She is from Singapore and we meet up on a daily basis and hammer out ideas of the script. And, boy, is it coming out real scary. When we finnish, we will shop it around and see if it gets made. I am betting it will !!!  Also, looking forward to watching wrestling on Monday. The show has gotten better. A few months ago it was Monday night trash, now it's work in progress, but with potential. Enough reason for fans to stick around, as long as it improve and the WWE stops feeding it's fans bullshit.  Oh,  urlLink Spider Man 2  took in $40.5 million on its opening day to set a record for a Wednesday debut. I hear it's very good. Heck, it even has a high rating at  urlLink Rotten Tomatoes  (about 95% last time I checked). I plan to see this movie on the weekend, even though that people are rushing out to see it and it might be wise to keep some distance until the madness dies down. When I see it, I'll let you know what I though of the movie.   Well, that's it for me. Time to look for more Bush jokes. Till the next time we meet.    urlLink Sailor Ecchi
