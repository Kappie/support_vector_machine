It just sucks, i'm friggen broke and i have $10 to go travel on, wow..thats gonna make it far there willy. Just seems like no matter how much i overwork, or try harder the less i stinkin have at the end of the week.  I suppose i should get off my crapper and do something about it, but right now at the time i feel tired after work, and i think its BS to have to work 2 jobs to have another 40 per week if needed, hell maybe i need a roomate, maybe i can find one in the city if i move, till then i'm stuck here in Ada, with like $10 a week to live off of, hardly anything to do, and a suck ass view of life.  The more and more I look into moving, the more inconvient it seems to my so called 'bs contract' with this place, and moving back in with my parents is out, as well as my sister to secure a job in okc. Fark i just feel like im doing this all alone, oh yah i am.  Broke sucks.. i think i'll make some koolaid and hope that someday equality in a roomate will help me out, till then , since i have 3 months left, i might look into options of another job, less time with people, ah love that idea.  More to bitch about later  =WCKED
