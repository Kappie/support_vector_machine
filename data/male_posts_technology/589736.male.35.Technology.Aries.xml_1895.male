He is about Bush (but not necessarily Iraq), and he is about health care (because he's a doctor).  But in terms of gun control, abortion, the environment, blah blah blah, he's really no more left that the other candidates, if not leaning a little more towards moderate in such areas.  And I think he's a fiscal conservative as well.  He just likes to talk Bush-smack to get people all fired up, even if some of their non-foreign policy political ideologies are not so deeply divided.  That's just what I gleaned from watching him the few times that I have...I just like him because of his health care reform.  Being that I'm a non-senior-citizen with a disability, there aren't a lot of options for people like me, and I like his ideas on how to fix that.  *shrugs*  Bush-smack sounds...dirty.  Sorry.
