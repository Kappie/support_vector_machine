But we made a good start for the bad weather and even that soon cleared up and it turned into quite a nice day.  We were semi-attacked by a heard of starving llamas at one point but they seemed more interested in Joel than anyone else.  Ben was suffering from quite a nasty toe injury he started to feel last night. He had to go off and find a doctor who gave him a few pills which will hopefully let him carry on the walk. We met up again at the next stop and tried to look for somewhere to stay. We found that the best place would be a barn four extra miles on. After covering twenty miles we weren't keen on the idea but moved on regardless and made in fairly swiftly. "Like ripping off a plaster quickly" as Joel put it. We made it to the barn and it's very nice.  We are eating much better these days; a little more than the two table spoons of rice we've had some nights. We have some crazy plans for the last few days that we are talking over and I might go into them at a later date.  Leo has rod chafing near his "special area".  Ciao.
