My thanks to you anyways Joe. Read more to see the ideas.     First off he suggested more random/casual/frequent interaction with the more famous NPC's in the book. I had actualy been avoiding using to many of the more famous characters. I guess some of darths complaints about FR having to many NPC's rubbed of as a comment from people in general. I think this is a situation I will quickly remedy unless anyone has a problem with this.  Second suggestion. More descriptive dungeons for the adventure. This I will say is my fault. Its hard to find that balance between nice descriptions that keep it interesting yet not so long that they start killing the flow. The entrance to the random dungeon on the sword coast was given as an expample of something I did well. Unfortunatly the worlds crappiest dungeon followed after. I will also try not to procrastinate to the point where I just don't have time to derive adequate descriptions.  Finnaly there was a request for more two part adventures. So far we have had a nice over enveloping story. But each week has also been self contained. This suggestion is one that I would like to hear all your opinions on. Sometimes a multi night adventure can give things a more epic feel, but it can also make that adventure feel less whole. So let me know what you think of the "to be continued" adventure.  On another note, as you all have now become to strong for the average random encounter on the road I am going to try and replace those with more random side quests. Last week you found out a young dragon was cuasing some problems, mabee next week there will be trolls rampaging. Basicly I will offer these for some mindless slashing fun, but you will have to look at them. Head on down to the tavern and ask for some info, look for the town buliten board, see what jobs are availible. Whe knows, some of these may even help you complete the main campaign.  I really apricitate this kind of feedback. Make sure you all let me know what you like and don't like. It can only make things better.
