Reminds me of the  urlLink monkey.org page for Ann Arbor , but Amazon has almost 800 menus to monkey's 45.  

I wonder if the menus are ever updated, considering places like  urlLink Waterfront Grill  changes their menu nightly.   Well, I just checked the menu for Waterfront and it advertises an event on July 16th, 2002, so that answers the question about updates but also poses the question of how long has Amazon had this feature?  What else does Amazon offer that I have missed all this time?  I know they do  urlLink movie showtimes , oddly enough, as well.
