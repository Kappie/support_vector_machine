Monday afternoon the cousin-in-law joined us for a couple of days.  It was nice talking with her and learning about her industry...News.  She works for a small newspaper in the south.  I got a little burnt the first day and have been avoiding the beach ever since.  I like the beach, but I'd prefer to just sit and sleep on the beach without any distractions.  Of course with 4 kids that's not possible.  C (wife) would say she's done the brunt of the work her anyway.  I've made sure that I've spent some alone time with each child, giving them things, talking and walking.  I've enjoyed this the most of all.  Tuesday we celebrated, father-in-law's 75th birthday.  Uncle B reserved a place called the "corner cupboard."  We had steak and crabcakes.  It was delicious and a very nice place.  The ambiance and company were wonderful.  I ate too much though and had to get up for a walk.  I kind of felt anti-social but explained that I just ate too much.   We've had Grotto's pizza all week.  It's getting a little old.  Besides I'm psyching myself for the diet I'm going on for the remainder of the summer.  As has been expressed to be my my own children and nephew, I'm fat.  You wouldn't really guess it from looking at me, but I have about 40-50 pounds to lose.  I hope to lose 20 by the end of the summer.  When school starts in the fall it'll be harder since the routine of life will begin again.    Sounds like a great week, doesn't it...But how come I'm so miserable.  If it wasn't for the kids and family I'd have bolted a long time ago.  I can't stand the constant lack of affection from anyone other than my kids.  Tomorrow is C's birthday.  I'll try to make it as nice as possible, but I doubt she'll have anything to do with it.  I'll let you know in the next post.  Last night I told C that I'm miserable.  She doesn't touch, love, talk or anything else.  I know she's depressed, but refuses to let anyone help her.  I've been through therapy and all I've learned is that happiness is a state of being.  What? you say.  Basically, choose to be happy, choose to be angry, choose to be depressed.  I'm choosing to be happy, in spite of all the crap in this shitty situation.  C just went to bed without a single pat on the back, "good night", kiss or anything.  This caused me to stay awake for several more hours before I finally went to sleep.   Shit, just kill me now.  As I sit here drinking coffee writing this blog, C's on the beach with all the kids.  She's probably wondering how great I have it by being alone and not being part of the family.  Bullshit...misery is misery.  I've been avoiding due to the lack of anything from anyone.  I think I could really go for a bottle of whiskey.  Good thing whiskey tastes horrible and drinks like fire down my throat.  I could never be an alcoholic.  Perhaps, I'm pushing C away.  But, I think it's mutual.  We both hate each other right now.  No talk, no touch, no sex, no nothing.  Who can live like this!    Now, I'm back to the beach to spend time with the kids and family...put on a fake smile and let everyone know how well I'm doing... Run now...run!   I don't know how people leave their kids, but I could run off somewhere, serve hamburgers at McDonald's and just chill with no responsibility.  Anyway, here we go.  Happy Birthday C!  I do love you...Get better.  K
