Going by past deeds, 'disruption' by al-Queda means blowing up trains, restaurants, embassies etc.  The trend is as clear as day. Al-Queda targets governments it thinks terror attacks can topple. It targets people it thinks are weak. They tried it with the USA - and failed miserably. They succeeded with Spain. SA foiled the attacks before they could begin.. but what if they had succeeded? Would SA have gone the way of the USA? Or Spain?  MAybe some will realise after this that al-Queda's agenda has never been terrorism for the sake of liberation. Their plan is the globalisation of Islam. It may sound nuts, but their plan is global domination. Through fear. Sympathy to their 'cause' and appeasement does not work - it only makes one appear weak in their eyes, and thus an easy target.  I, for one, will fight these slime to my last, dying breath. It's time to wake up to the threat of Islamic terror, Africa.
