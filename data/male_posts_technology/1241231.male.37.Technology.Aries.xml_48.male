The concrete block is off the side of the road but end-on to the oncoming traffic. "When someone comes off the road and they hit this," he says, moustache bristling, "they would be wiped out. Nothing would be left of the car. This is a classic landmine."  Their focus on these inadvertent instruments of death and injury reflects an increasing awareness within the road safety community that roadsides are the next big thing in the battle against the road toll - and that they require a different approach from the assault on speed. With speed, the focus has been on the individual - to change aberrant behaviour through blame and punishment. With roads, it is assumed that average law-abiding individuals have faults and frailties but that when they make errors they should not have to pay with their lives.  The other significant difference is that while one approach raises money, the other costs - a lot.
