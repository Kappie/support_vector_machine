Listen to this:        urlLink Al's  speech         Al rocked the democratic convention last night, in what was one of the best speeches so given so far. I truly hope he will join the Cabinet at some point in the future.    In other news, flies have invaded my home. We slayed no less than 234 house flies last night. Our personal discovery is that a vacuum cleaner makes a great execution tool for the little bastards.
