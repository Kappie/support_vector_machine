You Civil War buffs out there really know what I’m talking about when I mention the Iron Brigade :) Anyway… on with some of my political views.  I am a proud believer in the 2nd amendment and the rights therein. See?, my first politically incorrect statement, DEAL WITH IT!!! I am a gun owner, and believe that Americans should educate themselves further in their use and purpose. An oppressive government seeks to un-educate, and even brainwash people into thinking that guns are evil, are only used for bad purposes , and only bad people carry them. The proof in that statement resides in the Press’ Media) use of negative connotation when presenting crimes involving use of a gun. We don't see many cases of people killing with a sledgehammer, an ice-pick or a knife. Statistics prove that far more people are killed annually by drunk driving than with firearms. Just on the news the other day, the local news did a report on a gang bust. The guns taken from the felons were normal everyday firearms that any law-abiding citizen can purchase at their local gun store. The media decided to use inflammatory words and illustrations to describe the availability of these weapons. In this case, the weapons used were a 9mm Glock and tactical flashlight, fairly ordinary items sold at a gun store. The Media claimed that these weapons were only for law enforcement use, and were really only available to law enforcement individuals. Now... two false ideas have been conveyed to the general overly sensitive and brainwashed public here. One, guns are bad and are only used by felons. Two, these types of guns can only be gotten by law enforcement individuals, and the general public has no purpose or business purchasing such weapons to defend themselves. Many local governments actually believe and profess that the public should rely on police as their sole means of defense. I don't know about you, but when someone breaks down my door in the middle of the night, I may not have time to wait for the police arrive. Ok, I've put in my two cents worth. Since my blog is going to be politically oriented, I guess that means I'll have to start doing my homework....heh
