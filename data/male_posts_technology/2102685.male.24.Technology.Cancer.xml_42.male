How cool! hehe...  actually, I've never understood why  urlLink Blogger.com  didn't already provide it, but such as it was there was the option of Third Party TM  options! So I chose  urlLink BlogComments , a fairly simple alternative. It works and looks alright, som I'm happy! Besides, its ASP, so I can easily edit it... :)
