Ganja... reliance offer oothikicha... DAE offer enna aachu... BusinessWorld 'la pottu kizhi kizhi nu kizhichuttaan...The weather is pleasant here too in the past week or so...  Valli... I'm not an avid novel/story reader, but one thing I would say is... if u understand everything in a story then its not a story... u should not understand them, still it must make sense... (whatever that means)... so I think jax has scored on this point...  and its good to see two thangachis fighting for their beloved annas... (but the annas never seem to bother...!!)...
