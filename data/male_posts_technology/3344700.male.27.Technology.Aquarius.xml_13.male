I spent 3 full days during that trip (for this I took one day off) and I really enjoyed the trip to fullest. It was a amazing trip and it will there in my memory for long.   I covered almost all the must see places in New York City, here I need to thank all my friends for their support and kind. I took lots of snaps to be specific there are around 140 snaps that I took with the help of my first Digital Camera Fuji Fineplex 3800. All photographs came amazing...
