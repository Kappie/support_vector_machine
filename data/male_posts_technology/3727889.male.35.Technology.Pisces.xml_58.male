I was dealt AA and got sucked out by a flush draw even though I bet HEAVY into the hand before he made the draw. I was kind of pissed about this. Ok fast forward to earlier this afternoon. I am watching the kids and playing some 25NL. I have mixed feelings about 25NL. It is probably because I am not very good at it. If I have patience I do well, if not I will call alot of potential bluff hands and lose. For me it is more a game of luck. VanburenUCB is to the right of me. I beleive he raised the pot slightly and I call him with J-10 soooted. I do tend to be a bit of a flush runner. The flop is all rags, BUT two diamonds. I check.  VanburenUCB makes the correct move and bets $5. I think a while and call. I was up a little and wanted to see another card. Next card is a rag. VanburenUCB KNOWS I am on a flush draw and wants to knock me out. He bets $10 on the hand. Now I think really hard. I say to myself "This is a horrible call but I am going to make it.". Bam Baby! Diamond on the river and flush running river rat Sir beats .. you guessed it .. AA! Poker is weird. I was beat on AA with a Diamond flush draw a few days ago, and I beat someone with the exact same draw today. I appologized to VanburenUCB. Several times. At the time (I think) he was so mad at me he did not say a word. Either that or he was stunned by my bad play since he reads my blog. At least he was still up. Later in the night he caught me playing a little more solid on a .50/1 table and told me I owed him his own post. I agree.
