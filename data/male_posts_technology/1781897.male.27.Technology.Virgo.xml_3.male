My dad is a man who is so out of touch with himself, that he has his head burried up his ass when it comes to how he feels, and his past.  Here is a man (who I can not relate to, and furthermore, he cannot relate to me), bitching to me about how is father is "unreachable" and "disconnected" and he expressed how that made him feel sad, and frustrated.  I found this to be quite ironic, because here is a man, faulting his own father for "being an island" and unreachable, and telling it to a person (me) with which he has never had a real connection with.  When I asked my father why he doesn't speak to his dad ("Joe the bad" for those who don't know of him), he simply stated that "God has given me the ability to forgive my father".  It is funny, because in the same conversation he indicated that it was in fact an issue, and he cannot draw the line between forgiving someone, and getting closure on an issue you have with somone.  Perhaps, this blur on his part is what prevents us from having any manner of meaningful relationship (I have daddy issues).  Any way, it was a real eye opener....I feel like I have grown further than he ever will!  I tried to illustarte to him that while he is bitching that his father is a "closed" person, he is the same in relation to me.  He is so afraid to talk about things....its funny, cause here my dad was this intimidating person growing up...such a bully....and here I sit as an adult...realizing that....he was never anything but a paper dragon!  Oh how insight sets us free.....Dad....I forgive ya.....shit......I feel bad for you......
