Here are some hightlights from the run:    I get a race number that is gold. Now, I don't know what this means, but I'm the only one I see who has this "golden" number. People keep coming up to me and wishing me good luck and what not...giving me long stares. Turns out that they choose 100 people of the 15,000 to be eligible for a drawing for a trip to HI. I didn't win, but shit, that's the closest thing i've come to winning!  Drank 5 memosas after the race! :o)  Got naked in a parking lot.  Went the wrong way down a 1 way street to save 5 minutes in driving time. (I think i have the road rage)  The Whop came out of hiding.   All in all, was a good time.    I should also mention that Friday night was one of those nights where i go out and come home with like 10 people who all crash at my house. Friggen party central. I need to start a party email list to give peeps warning in the event that they wanna that they wanna join.    Have a Monday folks.
