Previously i talked about Ken, well suprisingly I thought about it and hey this is what i experienced so far. 1) Ken holds the missing links where he will enabled me to get in touch wif my best frens in ministry and school. Andrew Yeow, Kevin Goh.    Some of my cell members like Jenniffer Lee and church mate Andrea also links to this community. 2) David Tan Whay Hun, enables me to know James Chew and his Fellow Penangnites,..like Kenny, Clinton, Sabrina, Angela . 3) Wai Nyan enables me to get in touch with Jonathan Chua..erm..Ps.. 4) Janice Chin, currently a youth worker with Basel KK, gets me to know back Tjer-hann,  5) Le Churn with Michelle, Jessie Teh, Bernard Janz, Hung Teong and Warren Wong. and etc..etc..  Yeah it just shows that God is indeed one that plans your plans...  I got to get in touch with another friend who have shapped my live . This fren is my best fren from primary all the way to college...being the influencing factor in me accepthing Christ...who taught me guitar...who helped me to serve in CF in Nilai...joining church together... After 5 years...of not seeing one another...when i heard of his name, i longed to see this dear fren of mine and to find out whether is he still on fire for the Lord.  A lot of frens that have been on fire with me , have their fires extinguished because work, life problems, their own needs, their integrity got in their way and dismissed their passion in Christ Jesus. I have this desire to get to know them again, encouraged them with my live , with God's word and wanted so much to see them light the fire again and do great things for God.,  My passion is this...Btw, Passion OF Christ, a film that is both funded and directed by Mel Gibson, the most controversial movie movie that chooses to deny the modern teachings of Catholics and Jewish, but chooses to get the source directly from the Bible have been released.  Hopefully can get a pirated copy here in Malaysia, cause there is no way it can come to Malaysia uncensored .or censored.
