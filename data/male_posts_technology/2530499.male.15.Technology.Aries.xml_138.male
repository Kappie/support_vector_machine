I tried it once or twice before, but it looked really shitty. Then, I got the VP150m drivers, and set the res to 1024x768x24@60Hz, and the display IS SO FUCKING CLEAR. Then, I go online and read that the VP150m is in the "Professional Series" (Think! ViewSonic PRO 150 multisync) It goes E2 series, Graphic Series, X Series, Pro Series (WOOOT) and A Series. It's a real clear monitor. The best part would have to be the true colors. That means that if the picture is all-black, then every single live pixel will be the exact same black. Anyways, it's really awesome. Ken Hinds and his kids came over, we went swimming, and then I got on Fedora Core 1 (YARROW) 2.4.22.nptl and did some updates, I'm looking to get Kismet up and running soon. Also, in three years, (that's when I'm 18) I'm moving to Saskatoon. th4t's ju5t s0 my l33t 4zz c4n pwn j00 cuz j00 r teh f4gZ0rZ!!!!111  Random.  Kel(z0rz) you better NOT take offense to that. Please. It's Counter-Strike derived. Much love to JQ, in teh Lask of A, and Kel(z0rz) to whom all inspiration of...z0rz related objects including Zorks from Half-Life excluding HGrunts because they always try to waste the Barneys and that's just sad because the Barneys are so retarded when fighting off the Headcrabs who never get eaten by the Barnacles...whoo...I just gave away the plot to Half-Life 2. Looks like a good game. Hey, JQ and ROZ, remember releasing that hamster of your brother's into the wild?? Heh-heh-heh...  CURRENT CLIPBOARD CONTENTS: Woot!
