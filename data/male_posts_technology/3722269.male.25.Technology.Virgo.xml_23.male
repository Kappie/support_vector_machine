I believe whatever good you put into your life you get back tenfold.. and likewise for bad things. Today I shouted the old man lunch, nothing major we both just were in town, and there's this place that does the best fried onion rings.. mmm.. gorgeous... I bought a copy of the Davinci Code by Dan Brown, and a copy of my favourite magazine, and we headed home, after talking to a friend online and lamenting on how Mizone Tangerine had been taken off the market, I go across the road to notice as I'm making my purchase, three bottles of.. you guessed it.. tangerine mizone, hidden on the bottom shelf behind the counter.. turns out its the dairy owners secret stash, so I haggle, and leave with three bottles, destined for my friend. It makes me genuinely happy, to know that I've made someone else smile, or that something I'm doing will eventually make someone smile.. and in that sense I guess I'm doing it all for selfish reasons - because I get as much out of it as they probably do. The other nights apricot and cream-cheese stuffed chicken breasts with a chicken curry pasta was such a success I decided to encore it tonight, with the added bonus of blueberry danish, the last of which I'm about to go and raid as a midnight snack. Awesome stuff.. loving it. My life is simple, but I love it. Good friends, good family, good times. Smiles. And to top it all off, the sun shone. Ka Kite folks.
