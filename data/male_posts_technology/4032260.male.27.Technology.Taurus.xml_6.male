It seems to me that the word 'judge' in this verse is referring to "evaluating how righteous or faithful a person is." I say this for three reasons:  1.) The issue Paul has been addressing is that the Corinthians were making a judgement as to who was more spiritual Paul or Apollos. 2.) I read the transition from 4:2 to 4:3 like this: "It is required that stewards be found faithful, but God is the one who determines that, not you Corinthians." 3.) In v. 5 Paul again says that God will reveal the heart: "I know of nothing against myself, yet I am not justified by this; but He who judges me is the Lord. Therefore judge nothing before the time until the Lord comes who will...reveal the counsels of the hearts" (4:4-5).  God will reveal whether or not a person was righteous in their hearts. A mans actions, even though they may seem righteous and holy, may come from a corrupt and selfish heart. The point Paul is making to us is: we are not to be the judge of that... God is. I love the fact that Paul says he does not judge himself, I tend to to do that a lot... judge my own actions trying to figure out whether or not I'm doing things with the correct motive. It is true that we are not to be selfishly motivated, however, in those situations where everything gets fuzzy, I'd say: make the decision that looks like you're loving the person... and let God be the judge of your motive.  How is this different than in 5:3 where Paul says: "For I indeed, as absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged... him who has done this deed." This situation does not require a judgement call on a person's motives. This is regarding a person who is committting an undisputable act of sexual immorality. There is no question of guilt and the person shows no repentance or remorse about their actions. Therefore "deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus." (v. 5)
