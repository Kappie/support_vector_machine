Yesterday, the small 3rd world African country in which I reside (much to my everlasting chagrin) switched back from Daylight Savings, to Normal time. What a pain in the ass. Trying to get up an hour ealier in the morning is  hell . Those of you who don't live in countries using Daylight Savings - thank whatever respective deity you worship. Daylight savings is a really  bad  idea. I don't know who thought it up first, but he/she should be publicly flogged.  What has this got to do with Windows XP, you may ask. Absolutely nothing. Just thought I'd waste a few minutes of my time and a few kb's on whichever server is hosting this blog, to expound on what a decent OS it is. Installation was really effortless, it looks and runs quite nicely., it's stable...what more could you ask for? Seems like MS finally got it right. Granted, I'm late to jump on the XP bandwagon, but I figure, what the hell, time to embrace the future - you can only live in the past for so long.
