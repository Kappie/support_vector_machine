I haven't really played at all alone.  I played co-op with DaftApeth, and with six other players during a LAN party.  Playing on Normal level, I got through Pillar of Autumn and partially through the next section.  Then SWMBO came down and fussed at me for playing too much.  Looks like tonight I will be balancing the checkbooks.
