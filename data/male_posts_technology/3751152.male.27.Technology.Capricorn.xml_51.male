I'm always a little wary when people ask for my bookmarks because...well frankly not everything I see I want to share.   However I like most of you so I'll oblige with just a few of my favorite daily stops. Now just so you know I'm a news guy, I'm a sports news guy and most of my day revolves around my career, which comes through in my links.    Newspapers:  All the news that's fit to print.    urlLink The New York Times:  The gray old lady is still going strong. I usually hit the front pages and the Arts section after I get up and wash my face. Occasionally I'll check sports if Bill Rhoden has a column or Chris Broussard has a notebook but usually I check sports at...     urlLink Newsday:   Newsday is the only other non-tabloid in the New York Metro area (they are based out of Long Island). The  urlLink New York Daily News  and  urlLink New York Post  are the most famous tabloids in the world excluding Europe. The Newsday gives me the information I need on the Mets, Jets, and Islanders. A lot of the baseball stuff is reaching as the Times has all the good baseball writers, but they try. And also they are the best source for anything Amy Fisher.     urlLink The Ledger:   It's the local paper. I'm pissed because they still aren't sure if they are going to pick up my column and at times the stories are so single-focused that anyone outside of Central Florida couldn't relate. However a lot of my friends work here and they are good people.     urlLink St. Petersburg Times:   St. Pete used to be the best in Florida but now they are merely the best in the Tampa Bay area. Excellent features and business section.     urlLink Knight-Ridder Election Coverage:   This is links to all things 2004 election from the Knight-Ridder group of papers (Miami Herald, Philly Inquirer, etc.). They should be getting active in the next few weeks with the conventions kicking up.     News-Based Websites:  All the news that's 90% correct half the time.    urlLink  CNN:   Cable News Network is still the best and most respected in the business. It's not quirky and tacky like FOX but CNN doesn't employ Sean Hannity and that's a good thing.    urlLink  Google News:   I prefer this over Yahoo because they link wire and newsprint stories (which are usually copies of the wire story). And it's separated by topics. For Google updates you can check the unofficial  urlLink  Google weblog  .    urlLink The Smoking Gun:   The gun is as good as anyone in finding the great odd police blotters. It's where I found much of my material in the Debra Lafave sexual assault case.     Sports:  It's what I'm all about.     urlLink ESPN:   It's chicken soup for the sports lovers' soul. They are roughly three minutes faster on breaking sports news than the Associated Press because AP has to get clearance from their National Wire Editor before posting a bulletin.    urlLink  CBS Sportsline:   Not as good as ESPN but they have many more free options and a free rumor mill, the little things that ESPN makes one pay an insider fee for.     urlLink Sporting Fools:   This is my site that I run with AP Writer Mike Branom. We'll throw some current sports news up there and occasionally relay our opinions.    urlLink  Ralph Wiley:   One of the best sports/culture writers of my generation. Wiley passed away in June, a week before I would be able to see him. I can read his ESPN.com archives here.    urlLink  Bill Simmons:   Bill Simmons, once known as the Boston Sports Guy, is part sports, part entertainment. One of the last remaining NBA fans on earth and he enjoys The Karate Kid and gambling as much as I do. ESPN.com finally gave him his own page.     Entertainment:  Because Man Can't Live on News and Sports alone.      urlLink Electablog:   The best political blog on the net. It's run by Dave Pell and it's a cross between The Daily Show and Hardball. Excellent stuff.     urlLink Drudge Report:   I can't call this news because Matt Drudge is a Bush-flag waving jackass who can't break a story for shit. Despite Matt's pathetic attempts at being a journalist (all the while being an hourly insult to those of us who work hard in the profession) some things on his site are pretty funny. I take him with a grain of salt.     urlLink IMDB:   Whenever I'll looking to see if my proposed Billy Zabka/Frank Stallone/Charlie Sheen movie project will ever come to fruition. I look here.     urlLink College Football News:   I really can't call this sports because it's a fan site. However it's got Fox's backing and the webmaster is writing stuff in The Sporting News on the side. Overall it's a very impressive fan site dedicated to college football.     urlLink Soul Sides :  GREAT Audioblogger for the obscure lover of Hip-Hop, Soul, RB, Jazz and anything cultural from this era and the older days.     urlLink Whiskey Bar:   Political discussion disguised as bar discussion. Billmon was a lot more fun until he got caught up in the fraud known as the Bush Administration.     urlLink Warchant:   When I want to discuss the athletics of the greatest school on earth -- Florida State University (Nah, I'm not bias).     urlLink Talk Left -- The Politics of Crime:   All things for the bleeding heart liberal in all of us.     urlLink Air America Radio:   All things for the bleeding heart liberal in all of us, but who's too lazy to read the words on Talk Left.     urlLink Blog Maverick:   Mark Cuban's weblog. Cuban is a self-made billionaire and the owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks franchise. His tips on business skills are often useful.     Games:  You all know, I play a little.   urlLink  Joystiq:   It's all about the video games here. Updates on new games, new systems, some demo shots.    urlLink  XBox 2:   Unofficial weblog for the upcoming Microsoft system. I am an XBox owner and it is the greatest video game system on earth. I will not argue this. However if you perfer...   urlLink  Playstation 3:   ...that buggy, slow crap from Sony. I like to read up on the enemy as well. Generally these two weblogs have similar information.     Travel:  /o~/I'm an everywhere man...I'm an everywhere man../o~/   urlLink  Cheapo Vegas:   If you know me, you know I love Las Vegas. I've actually been able to call my last few Vegas trips work as I've covered boxing events there. Cheapo Vegas is a funny, informative site that gives you the real dirt on all the hotel/casinos in Sin City.    urlLink  Las Vegas Advisor:   This is Anthony Curtis' tip site. I pay the few bucks a month to get an actual newsletter because they include many deals and coupons. I actually stayed at Mandalay Bay for $59/night one time thanks to a secret deal uncovered by Curtis. The free site is fine, check out the top 10 deals.   That's about all I look at everyday. Hopefully you'll check some of them out.
