While YaYa's name sounds quite gay indeed, he was a foreigner from Camaroon, Africa.  It was his given name, it was not a gay pet name.   2.   The "Anchorage gay-bar" incident has been referred to vaguely. Here are the facts - When YaYa and I arrived in Anchorage, we went into a bar that we were not aware was a gay bar.  The bartender kept giving me free beer, so I was happy to stay.   Then when I went to the bathroom, I noticed all the gay literature that was posted (my name was  not  posted there, contrary to house speculation).  I told YaYa, "Hey, we should go.  This is a gay bar". Which freaked him out a bit.  Apparently they don't have them in Camaroon. A few weeks later, I called a cab to go to a job interview and YaYa became concerned - commenting, "You must be careful.  It may be gay taxicab".   3.   Documentation -     This is in Valdez - No indication of gay body language at all.     Campsite - I'm sitting by a girl, not by YaYa. And I'm looking at the jug of liquor, not at YaYa.  I hope this ends any speculation.
