In fact It was not until after 5:00 when I called Karissa and heard   SFW   say tell your daddy Happy Fathers day in the background.  I thanked Karissa and told her it made me very happy to hear that but what I was thinking was your mother is a B****!  Anyway Karissa and I talked she told me she found her color crayons and she was going to color me a pretty picture.  They were hidden in a drawer in the kitchen according to her.  She said I found a ladybug and I will send it to you so you can see it. Then you have to send it back daddy!  I told her she probably should send me a picture instead since the ladybug would miss it's family if it was sent to me.  She also said she was going to be making a ladybug cake I assumed that was for her birthday but could not make it out on the cell phone.  Jimmy was being himself.  He was yelling at Jeremey in the background saying how he hated playing a game with him because he was a "freakin cheater"  Something came up as Karissa gave me hugs and kisses real fast then proceeded to hang up.  I did not want her hanging up but all in all it was OK considering the conversation was pretty good and I needed to go into Wal-mart.  I got up this morning and did some more cleanup work on the yard so at least I have a backyard again.  Now I have an area near my AC outside that I have to clean up that will probably be next weeks project.
