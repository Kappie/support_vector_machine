I'll put the thought forward to them about doing it right after the exams instead. Anyway, it'll be summer by then and we should be expecting better weather and temperature also.  Haiyar! It's no wonder I was told to reduce the suaning for 1 of my housemates. Coz she just got together with David recently. Alamak, I should've known. I was finding it rather suspicious also. How come he can suan but I cannot suan ... hmmmmmm  . Now I understand lah huh. OKOK must give my brudder some face haha.  And my finances / budgeting this term has been a real mess. I think come Apr I really gotta get them updated. Still have enough cash lah, just don't have an idea of exactly how much I'll have for each month. And I really should keep track of all these so that I won't have any problem with planning for trips later. Basically I can just easily look and know whether my cash is enough or not. It's a good habit that always seem to get mess up when I reach the 2nd term.  Gonna have to skip Aikido tonight and tomorrow. There's suppose to be a weekend course this coming weekend. Had to give it a miss. If I'm lucky, I can probably attend the on with Chiba Sensei around the end of May. Keeping my fingers crossed now.  Tentative plans will prob be like: Apr - Easter holidays and study for exam, postpone trekking to after exams - Email SPF asking about intake dates and contract details May - Check with Pauline Sensei about the possibilities of uchideshi programs in UK - Revision lectures + Exams Jun - Exams may end in 1st wk. May go trekking for few days - Visit Marcus+Ivy in Karlskrona, Sweden - Visit Karlskrona Aikidoklubb (wooo, is dat swede/dutch language) - Return UK collect results - End of school - mid Jun, pack and start shipping stuff back to Singapore - Visit Gary?? OR Uchideshi program (3-4 wks) Jul - Convo (16th-23rd) - Parents coming either juz b4/after convo Aug - Return S'pore latest early/mid Aug
