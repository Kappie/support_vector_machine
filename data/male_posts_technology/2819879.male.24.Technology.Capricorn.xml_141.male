I'm not a perfect person (and I don't know any perfect person), and I don't mind myself to have defect here and there. Sometimes I even enjoy my weaknesses, and if possible, I try to fix my problems like everyone else.  Back to the dream thing...  Probably because of the ice cream she treated me last night, I was rather moved by the ice cream (???), probably beocoz I haven't had any girl treating me so nicely since... a long time ago.  Ken was right. Even if I fail, I get something else invaluable in return... tho I'm still not sure what it is... or it's hard to describe in words...  Anyways, in my dream, I was fooling around with Claire...in my room back in vancouver, but the scene outside the window is still in taipei. And then, at some point of the fooling around process, I was going to praise her, for she looks really cute in my dream.  But then... I said my ex's name instead of hers...  She was furious to the degree that her whole body is shivering...    and I really really hate myself.
