I can categorically state that  urlLink Red Mill  brand  urlLink Transform-A-Snack  crisps are  not  pre-assembled in the factory.     Background:    The retail bags of these items contain three main components; a spaceship, a space hoop and a meteor ball. As suggested on the face of the bag, as what I can only imagine is a serving suggestion, one could take four space hoops and attach them to the spaceship component which would then act as a chassis and thereby create what I believe it's reasonable to assume is a "space buggy". For some years a great debate has raged over whether, during the factory production of these extruded maize treats, great quantities of workers were employed for the sole purpose of building these space buggies to exacting standards before they were dropped into the bags where they immediately fell apart again. One can explain the existence of the seemingly arbitrary meteor ball component by assuming they were added as a complimentary gift from the manufacturer to the customer or were included as a result of over-production from the  urlLink Tangy Toms  line.   Proof:   I have done quite an amount of research into the matter, and found that, in a detailed description of  urlLink Transform-A-Snack production methods , there is not a single mention of the pre-construction of space buggies. I hope that this should be enough to put the matter to rest once and for all.  It is now important that you play  urlLink Snack Attack . A space invaders game that is somehow relevant to crisps.
