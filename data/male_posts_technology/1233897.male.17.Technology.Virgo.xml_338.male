I was crying for a variety of reasons almost the entire retreat - rarely actually in tears but my soul wept the entire time. Winema is always emotional for me, but this one was a thousand times more so. As I told someone, "I love/hated it"   Holy crap, I thought I was done, but no. (I'm crying again)
