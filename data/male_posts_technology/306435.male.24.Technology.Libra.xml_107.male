Well I don't have to wonder anymore as that is iexactly how work felt yesterday.  It was the company picnic and not technically being part of the picnic, I had to sty and watch the phones.  No one called at all.  It was amazing.  I thought for sure that I would be swamped.    After work I cam ehome and watched TV with Tom until going to see Wit's End perform in Newport with Elizabeth End and Greg LeSaint.  Wit's End is an improv comedy group.  It was a good show, but not great.  Elizabeht did manage to confuse the guy at the door enough to let us pay $3 instead of the posted $5.  If you just hand them money and walk in they don't really count it.  The group seemed very disorganized.  They also didn't follow the rules of the game they were playing too well.  Yeah it is impro, but just from listening to Ann I have higher regards for people who follow the rules of improv.  I can tell that Eliabeth really wants to perform more and is hoping someone puts together a group.     When I got home at 11:30 (that is right the show was two and a half hours long), Justin was there....which is weird because his car is dead.  In fact he got a new car.  A 2002 Nissan Sentra.  I didn't want to tell him how my dad had a Sentra that I had wrecked and then had died on my dad a few years later.  That is all from here...
