Instead of our usual mindless dribble, we're opting for a more strict format.  I'm going to set out themes, which will be announced the week prior to publishing.  Here's the schedule for next week:
 
  Monday  :  urlLink CNN , Firestarter by  urlLink Sword Victualer 
  Tuesday  : The Decline of the Star Wars Empire by  urlLink Sword Victualer 
  Wednesday  : Something Thought Provoking by  urlLink Sword Victualer
