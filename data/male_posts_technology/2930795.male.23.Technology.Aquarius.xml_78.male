I had a conversation about my looks with a recent acquaintance who shall remain namless, and we disagreed on my position in the absolute  (national, not LA or bay area) 10pt scale.  In order to settle this dispute we agreed to turn to the ultimate scoring medium, hotornot.com, using the only picture I seem to use online (as seen on this page, friendster, and orkut) .  Feel free to click the following  urlLink link ,  but vote honestly,  a wager of drinks rests on the outcome after 200 people have rated me.  Have no worries,  I will neither be crushed nor get a swelled head, afterall, I know what I look like
