It was about me and my x-gf and Ken and his gf all went out to a summer vacation trip.  We ended up in a grand hotel of some unknown island, the sun is shining and there's no cloud you can see in the vast blue sky.  Anyways, it was a beautiful dream to start with.  But while I was sleeping in one of the hotel's room (Yeah, I dreamed about sleeping), all of a sudden I woke up and decided to take a stroll in the hall.  It was a couple hours past mid-night and there I was loitering in the hallway doing nothing.  When all of a sudden, all the doors starts to open and close and open and close on me.  Of course that scared the hell out of me so I ran to the escalator trying to get out of this haunted hotel... and somehow as I ran, I can see my friends outside of the window, on the grass, eating and chatting and having a great time by themselves.  I was desperate to join them and even more desperate trying to get out of the building (the doors are still opening and closing), and that's when I wake up.  I can still remember what the hotel looks like and I'm sure it's nothing I've seen before.  Weird dreams as it is...  Jeffrey. Out.
