We are shooting to work out at least 5 times a week (more depending on work load and possible visitors) and we are going to track our progress.  Currently, we take a notebook with us to record the exercises, weight and reps.  When I get back to work the next day, I update an Excel spreadsheet with the data.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the information, but never fear.  I'm a huge dork; I'm bound to make charts and graphs representing our progress.  

Since we also play racquetball every day, we sometimes don't get enough time to do as many exercises as desired.  Yesterday we were able to get through bench press, leg press, rope tricep pushdown, lateral pulldown, left and right obliques, hamstrings, and abdominals.
