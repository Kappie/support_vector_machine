Ganguly's decision to throw the ball to Zaheer Khan for the final over turned out to be a successful move ( especially after the 21 run rollicking that Jayasuriya gave Zaheer in his 4th over ). And as we know... nothing succeeds like success!! :-)  Chalk one up for, arguably, the best captain in the world of cricket today.
