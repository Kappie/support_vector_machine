I need to score at least an 83 to keep up my average but if I could get an A that would be fantastic. Of course no matter what my average is if I fail the final I fail the class. So I need to start studying for that as well. Sorry I'll stop ranting about school. So Imperial America is gearing up for an invasion of Syria. The excuse is the same self-defence of course we still haven't found chemical weapons in Iraq.
