Today we go to visit Denise's maternal grandparents, uncles, aunts, etc.  I haven't seen this part of her family for several years now.  She hasn't generally gotten along with them, something which I think goes back to before her mom and dad were divorced.  Since then, Denise has not been very happy about the way they act toward her mother, but there have been some recent changes for the better in that department.  It is her grandparents' wedding anniversary, so we are going to mingle.
