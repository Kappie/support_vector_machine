I got into making  urlLink FreeSoftwareReviews  and I needed to use Windows to review software.  I kind of got stuck in it after finding some new software and leaving my Linux distros to obsolete themselves.  I'm debating about which Linux distro to use as my main system.  I have a ridiculous amount of hard drives and I'm hoping to buy two more this summer.  I use a  urlLink Lian Li removable hard drive bay  with 8 removable hard drive drawers.  At the moment my hard drive status is: [Windows 2000/98 (120gb)], [Slackware 9.1 (8gb)], [Mandrake 9.2/Slackware 9.? (80gb)], [Mandrake 10 (8gb)], [SuSE 9.0 (80gb)], [Longhorn (120gb)], [no OS (300mb)], [empty drive drawer], [empty drive drawer].  I think I might try Linspire (aka Lindows), Fedora Core 2 this summer (I tried Fedora Core 1 already).  I think I will be switching to either Mandrake 10, SuSE 9.1, or Slackware 9.1.  I had a little crashing problem in Mandrake 10 (probably because I multi-tasked a  little  too much).  I would love to switch to Slackware permanently but I'm not very familiar with updating my system regularly, patching it myself and such.  If there was a service I could use to do this while in Slackware (or a website that recommends what to update frequently) I may give it a try.  If Fedora Core 2 impresses me more than Core 1 did, I may even switch to it.  Any suggestions are welcome (*hint hint*).
