Yeah me and my really itchy hands. Thank god I had an angel to help me out , he probably heard me sniffing away in desperation in the server room.  Man that was a scary as hell experience.   Met an acquaintance from JC (well he was in Tampines JC for the first 3 months anyway) but I kinda forgot his name. I have such a hard time remembering names, its freaky. Especially names of guys, gals I usually have no problem. I wonder why.
