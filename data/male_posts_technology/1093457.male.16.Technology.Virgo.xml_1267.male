I don't mean to offend anyone but I've given up pointing out exactly what you point out because no one listens and no one stops saying it. Its not as if I sit there and actually mean the computer is homosexual. Blame it on the society we live in today. Everyone says 'proper good' and 'gay' as general terms now. I really don't think people are out to annoy you. So sorry for saying it but my computer really is the most annoyinly bitch ever. IT NOW TURNS ITSELF ON RANDOMLY. WTF is up with that???? So bad to start to a worse day. I couldn't find half my book sthis morning and paniced. Wooooooooo! I have a full days of lessons today, I am supposed to bring all my stuff in but to frank with you I cannot physically carry 3 folders, 3 sketch boks and about a hundred other random books in because I will DIE.
