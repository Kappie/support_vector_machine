Several Democratic members of Congress, including Senators Carl Levin and Ted Kennedy, have recently assembled compilations of George W. Bush's lies leading up to the invasion of Iraq.   The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace put out a report in January that presented a good sampling of the best--or worst--of the Administration's false remarks about Iraq's WMD and the al Qaeda-Saddam relationship.   But the prize goes to Representative Henry Waxman, who has just released a report that identifies 237 specific misleading statements made by Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, and Condoleezza Rice in 125 separate public appearances.  For more, read David Corn's new Capital Games  urlLink http://www.thenation.com/capitalgames/index.mhtml?bid=3=1321   And don't miss Corn's best-selling book, The Lies of George W. Bush, for a full account of the falsehoods, fibs and fabrications of the Bush presidency.  Also worth reading is Corn's recent Cap. Games posting explaining why anyone who gives a damn about politics, policy, and public affairs ought to wish CSPAN a very happy 25th birthday.  urlLink http://www.thenation.com/capitalgames/index.mhtml?bid=3=1312   For info on The Lies of George W.
