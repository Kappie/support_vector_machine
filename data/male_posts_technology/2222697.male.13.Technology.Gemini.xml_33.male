I may mod it, so the interface will be almost identical as a mac. Only for a while though. Now i have more time to doo stuff on the comp. Like post blogs. You NEED to check out harrison's forum.    http://chibisamurai.proboards25.com/index.cgi . There is noting else to say. I will post later. Aim-samuraipanda5 Yim-samuraipanda5 Bye!
