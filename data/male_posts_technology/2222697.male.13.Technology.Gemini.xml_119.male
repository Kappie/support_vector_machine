You can beat the game in less than a minute and is completely TEXT-BASED!!  Staring at Joe's xanga I wonder how he is so good at photoshop, html, and xanga templates. I am usually the one really involved with computers in my school, but his stuff is amazing. My dream job is to either be a programmer or the owner of the first gigantic anime store.  Also author of "How to rule the world with an internet connection" would be pretty awesome.  Hmm, I am gonna play with photoshop for a few minutes and show you what I get...  Nothing...I couldn't even change the color not to be a shade of gray.  I usually use a cheat program to make my sites. Netscape Composer is the easiest. Most of my sites are without tables which makes them very simple.  Well yeah, I suck at these things. I need to get my dad to teach me some photoshop and php.  If you don't read my forums (and you should) then you probably do not know that I beat that visual novel last night... So much for 20 hours of gameplay It takes 3 or 4 at most. I say "Don't buy this!" Phantom of Inferno was extremely boring, so I guess I will stick to rpg-based ones or just rpg's in general. I wan't more descision making not WATCHING MY DESCISIONS BE MADE!  Maybe AnimePlay will have some better ones soon.
