Ok, I know it sounds cliche√©, but hey I can't help it...this is what happens when you pass your entire childhood in front of TV; eventually you're bound the become like them...yes THEM...you know those characters in those generic shows that only change names from time to time, but in reality they're all the same...we know them as the people in Friends, Felicity, Ally McBeal, Sex In the City, The wonder years, Perfect Strangers, Family Matters, etc.... Have you ever wondered what your life would be if you could shape it the way you wanted it to be. Well, I for one know what I have to expect in life. Absolutely nothing. I do know that I want to have enough money to be comfortable to not worry about it..oh and if you say money isn't important, yeah like you wouldn't want that :P, Then there's the job issue...well, before you used to hear, what you have to do because it's your job...these days, you hear, do what you like, not what you should do...well the way I see it...it has to be both...I mean if you're having too much fun at work...then you'll always want to be at work..doesn't the word workoholic comes in mind anyone? So it has to be fun, yes...but not too much, let's have a little of both.  Of course with all the thinking I was doing, I was not looking where I was walking....well like in many TV shows, I seem to have ram into a pole...again...Believe it or not yes it does happen in real life... At that moment I seem to recall all the moments that I have ram into something..you know like those flashbacks you see in TV shows..like the one where you see Homer Simpsons yelling 32 times Doh! and seeing them all in sequences. In my case, I recall ramming when I was a kid and even know into electrical poles, light poles, people, dogs, walls, doors, patio doors, cars, bicycles, stop signs, stop poles, steps(the one for aerobics training), glass wall, parking meter.... but I don't know how that happens..it seems to always happen in unnatural ways yet coincidental...like the sun blinding me while I walk and someone walking in front of me, then all of sudden the person would step aside to dodge a pole, and of course since I'm blinded by the sun, I wouldn't see it so I would ram into it....these kind of things.. :S you know it's not fun to ram into poles, and it may sound funny...but it's all fun till someone gets an eye popped...ok that sounded kind of exaggerated..but I did get cuts before on the forehead :P and people seem to be very amused by the notion of other people ramming into poles...what's up with that.... I see it in their eyes; I can picture it right now, if I were to fall in a conversation with them... Little girl walking: Look, there's an adult that just rammed into the stop sign Mom: oh he's just playing around with his friend and pretending little girl: no look, he's alone and he's bleeding.. mom: oh wait..*almost laughs hysterically little girl: wow, I hope he does it again! mom: yeah me too....what a funny guy... me: owe!!!..Hey look, I'm bleeding profusely. some one call 911...(ok...I wouldn't say that) but i'd say, ow that hurts.... mom: are you ok? me: well I think so... mom: oh ok, just don't ram into poles like that oh yeah like I do that purposely..what's wrong with you... me: yeah..i'll try *chuckles. mom: oh you're quite a character! *laughs me:....yeah....sarcastic look she's probably thinking..what's with this guy, he is either blind as a mole, or he's as dumb as I sound...(ok she may not have thought about that last one...but i'd like to think she did)  anyhow....as I came back home, I sat there cleaning my house, and wondering if I was the only person ramming into things without wanting to... We all know it happens on TV, but have you ever had you were in a TV show...or like in those super commercial that sells those "just like in TV...." products.  Maybe I'm just too nostalgic about the 80s and its TV shows. either that or I'm too deep in my thoughts hence loosing all consciousness of reality and consequently ramming into things. oh and kids, , don't try this at home...i'm a professional.
