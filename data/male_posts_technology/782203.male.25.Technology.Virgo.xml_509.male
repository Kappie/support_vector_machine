Have to start learning a few key phrases now just to play it safe.  If anyone can help me out with translating the following, I would be very much grateful.   1. Sorry I am not gay. 2. How much for an hour of pleasure? 3. Hey beautiful, would you like to take a ride on the indian stallion?  4. It looks delicious but no dog meat please, I'm on a strict no pets diet.   5. Please don't hurt me, my grandmother was chinese.   Yes in case you don't know, my grandma really is...or was. RIP granny.
