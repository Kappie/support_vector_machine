You know, it seems harder and harder in these dark times to find the true object of our hearts desire, and when we think we have, it is lost or taken away from us for reasons known not to ourselves! Perhaps then, these grief and demoralising occurenses are tests from a higher (or lower) power? If so then certain questions must be answered, such as ' Why did this have to happen to me!' or ' 42 is the answer, but what was the question?' It is important then, to remenber that we are merely human and therefore are subject to the hurting ways of unwanted change in our lives, whether we had influence over them or not.   Through life we will experience heart breaks and suffer from the effects of gross body fat, our very souls are nibbled at by the cruel and punishing earth on which we inhabit. The spirits within call to us to strengthen ourselves against these attacks, and thus fuel the desire to be other than that which we are. We are left wanting to be someone or somewhere else, maybe even in a different time.  It is imperetive then that we must do our best to suffer no longer from the truely evil malevolence which plagues our lives every day. It must then be urged that we all go out into the streets and buy guns, knives, flash bang grenades, toilet paper, rubber chickens inside big plastic bowls, stress squeesers, ping pong balls, or any other items which will make us feel protected against this harsh reality we call life....................... Well thats it for todays show, tomorrow we will be discussing gay narcoleptic migets and their strange relationships with their dogs. Till next time I thank you and GOOD BYE.................(music fades in).............ogy ogy ogy ogy..........clap clap clap.....Baity, Baity, Baity........clap clap clap........fight fight fight fight.............clap clap......ogy ogy ogy.......clap clap.........(fade to black).
