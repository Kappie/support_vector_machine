But I did, go shopping for food, I cleaned up Feibie's shit on the porch, and I send out the paper work from the lowes jobs from this week. Other than that nothing!  Man, the last 2 days is getting weird! I Have been "Hit on" by two gay men. I told ya'll about the bus boy... Well this afternoon I get IM'ed by this guy.. He lives in like the next town, we were bullshitting for a bit(like an hour)and I forgot what he said but it caused me to ask what are you getting at... His reply was simply you know...Well then I went in the basically the same thing I told the guy at the bus stop... Well he seemed a lot more proactive.... Well I told him to call me on Tuesday, and see what I am doing...  whatever.. Next!  Well I need to sleep...  nite lates!
