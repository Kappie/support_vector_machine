However I still must go in to put up my art exhibition and take it down the next week so if you get a chance please come along and see everyones work:  Wednesday 16th June, 4.30 - 8.00pm . It'd be cool to see you there. Very very hot today. I may have to go and sit outside in the sun or I may not. Maybe its too hot? I want to go down to the park but no one to go with. Oh :(   Good luck with any exams you all have left!
