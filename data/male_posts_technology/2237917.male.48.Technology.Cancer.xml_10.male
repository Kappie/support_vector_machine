I know, I know � you may have heard the same thing before from those that think it�s cool to hate Microsoft; but I�m not one of those guys. I�m actually an MCSE and I happen to like quite a few of Microsoft�s products. Rather than lump me into the Microsoft-basher category, consider for a moment why you use the browser you use, and humor me by entertaining the notion � if even for a second � that switching to another might be worth your while. My argument is simple: the benefits of using IE are too few - and the faults too great � to put off the adoption of an alternative any longer"
