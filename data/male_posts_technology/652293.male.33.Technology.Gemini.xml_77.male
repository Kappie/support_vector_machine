I'll save for it, but my bonus will go to debt reduction, paying for Claire's school, and maybe a mobile phone/service for her, since she'll be on campus quite a bit.  Let  urlLink me  know if you know of a good service.  Not Sprint.  I already know they suck.  I will allow myself 100$.  Of which I will probably actually spend 75$ on me.  That is more reasonable.  Just need to make more money.  Maybe the  urlLink Steak 'n' Shake  is hiring...
