But combined, the two of you made me spend like $60 on shelving - to house the extra speakers, and to create a shrine to the Dolphins, which now includes the beer stein and plaque, as well as the bobblehead doll you gave me for housewarming/birthday last year.  Speaking of those speakers, because I only have one headphone jack, I went to CBIT to see what I can do about it.  I figured I had two options: either get a splitter and have five speakers deliver 2-channel stereo, or fork over some change for an external sound card.  So some fucking Asian dude comes up to me and asks me if I need any help.  So I tell him I got these speakers as a gift, and I just wanted to know what I can do to hook them up to my laptop.  The guy gives me this arrogant fucking look and says, "That's why you don't try and get surround sound with a laptop."  Then he proceeds to bash my system of choice.  Then, the motherfucker has the audacity to try and sell me a new PC, not 60 seconds after he just insulted me.  The problem with places like Computer Boulevard is that you need a ridiculous amount of computer knowledge to be able to do the job.  Unfortunately, 98% of the people with that knowledge have no discernable social skills to speak of.  Fucking dorks.  I just wanted to kick the living shit out of that guy so he could remember how it felt to be in high school again, where there wasn't a counter and security cameras between you and some guy you thought you were better than just cause you have a PC.  Wow, now that I'm done with the tirade, here's the good news: when I went to get hooked up with Shaw Extreme today, I asked hem about NFL Sunday Ticket.  They said they don't have a price yet, but that it should be in the $20 a month range.  Which, of course, settles it: I WILL have NFL Sunday Ticket.  So if you're in the mood to watch the Dolphins, or the Falcons (or at least ONE Falcon), or, God forbid, some shitty team like the Seahawks or the Packers, come on down.  And don't worry, there's a corner store right across the street from my place, in case you forgot your Pro-Line.
