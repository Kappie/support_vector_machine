The only time I have to venture into a branch is when I want to do something really obscure like foreign currency exchange.  A couple of months ago, I noticed a strange service charge on my account. Normally, I don't scrutinize the charges, but this was big enough for me to care. So I called the bank's 1-800 number. The lady on the other end reminded me why the fee was deducted, and as soon as she told me I was satisfied. But just when I was about to hang up, she asked me if perhaps I'd be interested in their lower fee account.  "Hold on a second", I said. "There's a lower fee account?" Yes, it's a new product they introduced a year or so ago, that would reduce my bank service charges by 66%. Instead of paying $15 a month on my business account, it would be less than $5. Nothing else would be different. The things I pay extra for now (Internet banking) would be included free.  Of course, I took the lower fee account. But why wouldn't they just charge me the lower fee to begin with? Why do I have to accidentally stumble into finding out about this new account type? If I qualify for the lower fee, call me or send me a letter ASAP! I want to be notified right away!  And today, I was talking to my cable company. Again, by accident -- there is a problem with my cable connection. As I'm speaking to the rep, he asks if I would like to switch to their bundled service. Huh? Oh, you can save $10 a month and it would be no different to what you're already getting. OK, switch me to the bundled service then.  The moral of the story, I suppose, is that people who subscribe to a service (cable, phone, bank, etc.) and leave it alone generally don't save money. If you check in with the 1-800 sales reps every six months, you can save some real money over the long term.  I might just phone my phone company today and see if there is anything they can do to lower my bill. And the cell phone people.   Scott
