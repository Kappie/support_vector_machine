CompUSA has a copy and I'm debating about getting it.  Christie and I have finalized everything on the wedding.  We are going to have the ceremony at our church,  urlLink Northwest Hill United Methodist Church , and the reception at the  urlLink Witte Museum  in their Prassel Hall.  Our caterers are  urlLink Absolutely Everything Catering  and they have been extremely nice about everything.  I think we're looking at a Pork carving station and Chicken Cordon Bleu as our primary meal choices and a good deal of other little stuff.  I like what I have seen so far and I'm just glad we're actually starting to put deposits down and getting everything finalized.  I hope that I can make this wedding that Christie wants.  I will be posting pics soon of Christie and of a few friends.  ILY
