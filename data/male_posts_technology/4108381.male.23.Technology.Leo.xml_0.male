For a few seconds I thought I was stupid, but now I really enjoy it. It doesn't hurt at all hardly. It feels like I have a rock for the end of my nose.  I keep getting worried that it is plainly visible. It's not but I'm paranoid. This type of thing would probably not go over well here at the office. I hate being a "grown-up."  Back to the salt mines.
