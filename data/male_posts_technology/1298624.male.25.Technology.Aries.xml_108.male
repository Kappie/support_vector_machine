It's not the matter of why do I suck, it's the question of, why are you making such a big deal out of beating me. ME, I've NEVER played Unreal Tournament, nor Unreal Tournament 2003, only VERY LITTLE Counter-Strike, and the only FPS game I actually spent time on is Halo, which, of course, I owned you.    Now you, on the otherhand, played all those games I mentioned and more. In fact, I don't suck, because when I played CTF online, I got 4th, then 2nd, then I made 1st place with a 50 point lead over EVERYONE else.    So, come home and I'll challenge you. If you don't chicken out because you're too busy watching those oh so funny videos you get at fazed, then I'll be waiting.
