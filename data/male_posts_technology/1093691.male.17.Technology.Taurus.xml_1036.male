Because you didn't babysit last night, and you didn't do the weekly text thing I completely forgot Changing Rooms was on!  I MISSED IT. O how depressing. I think I shall fall into Hamlet mode: 'O that this too too sulied flesh would melt....' Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Yay for the trampoling thing though. An I don't go on about it, only mentioned it once because of the hand signal convo. Thats it. Its like my geology class. Every lesson its usually Beckett who brings it up but the subject of Dean and I always comes into conversation. And the room always goes quiet just as we aretalking about it so then either the whole class join in or we're told we are a bunch of gays by Seward. Ahhhh.
