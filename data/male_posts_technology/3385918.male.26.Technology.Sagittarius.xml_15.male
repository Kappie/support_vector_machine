So when I saw it at my local Borders I jumped at the chance to but it. When I got home and started to read it, I remembered being very disappointed. The problem with this book is that if you are a novice to horror or rarely read  urlLink Fangoria  magazine, but like horror movies or have a keen interest in them, then this is the book for you. Now, people who literally grew up reading Fangoria will find nothing remotely new in the book. Most of these movies have already been  introduced in the pages of the magazine. The book also doesn't contain much information on the selected movies, except a summary of what is the movie about, main cast and crew, and some small bit of trivia and information about each entry. This last part is where the book should have shined.  urlLink Fangoria  should have enough information and contact info to have added a lot of insider stories on each movies. Heck, a collector of Fangoria magazine would know more about these movies than someone who bought and read only this book. This is sad, especially for  urlLink Fangoria .  I would add, on the other hand, that some parts of this book have grown on me. Mostly some of the selections made. Some are very good, others are questionable. Also, there are some films that should have made the list which are harder to find and better than some of these entries. I will write more about that at the end.  Of the 101 movies, I have only seen about half, even thought I am familiar with almost all of the entries with few exceptions.   I will write here about the one's I have seen and about a few others which I believe are worth mentioning. I will not touch upon the info or trivia of the book or list all of the entries. For that, you will have to buy the  urlLink book . While disappointing, it makes for an interesting coffee table book and, like I said, the less you know about  urlLink Fangoria , the better.  I would like to add that there are many choices in this list that seem like a request by the author for people to give those films a second chance. I can live with that given that some of the selection do deserve a second chance, even thought that would make the title a little misleading. When you read "best horror movies you've never seen", you tend to think that they are so obscure that not even hardcore horror fans know about them. A found very few entries that fit this bill. Heck, most of these films are very accessible to any person that has a video club near by that still stocks old horror vhs or that is buying all those wonderful  urlLink Anchor Bay DVD  releases. Sure, there are exceptions, which I will note below.   (I decided not to put too much detail into my opinion of these movies and their content. I've tried to focus on important elements of each movie and whether or not I agree with the inclusion of movies on the list).  On with the list...      urlLink Alice, Sweet Alice  (A.K.A. Communion)  One word: Scary.  A good start, given that this is the first entry in the list. This movie, to my knowledge, is currently unavailable.     urlLink The Beyond   This is a film that if you are an avid reader of Fangoria and don't know what it is, you should just shoot yourself in the head. Many consider this  urlLink Lucio Fulci's  greatest film. This entry is more for someone who knows very little of horror.   Currently, this movie is available thanks to the efforts of  urlLink Quentin Tarantino  who fought to bring this movie to theaters in a limited release.  It is currently out on DVD thanks at the good people of Anchor Bay. This would most definitely make an awesome addition to your horror collection if you don't currently own it. A very gory film that is full of creepy atmosphere, surprises and a bizarre ending that will either shock you or have you scratching your noodle.  Surprisingly, this is the only  urlLink Lucio Fulci  film in the list. I would have probably added or gone with " urlLink House by the Cemetery ", which I believe is also a great horror movie. Horror film buffs know " urlLink The Beyond  ", but might not know or have seen " urlLink House by the Cemetery ". This would probably have been a better choice.  Other standouts from  urlLink Lucio Fulci  are " urlLink Zombie " (an unauthorized sequel to George Romero's living dead masterpiece " urlLink Dawn of the Dead "), " urlLink Gates of Hell " and the very underrated " urlLink New York Ripper ".     urlLink The Blob  (1988)  Interesting entry. I recall that this remake of the 1958 classic had some wild, gooey special effects. While I don't think this a worthy entry, comparing it to others in the book, I can see why the author would want to add it. The movie does deserve a second chance, especially now that is widely available in DVD.       urlLink The Boneyard   I like this movie. It's fun, gory and silly. Maybe a little too silly for most (even taught it's pretty grim to be a . Still, has some creepy moments and the creature effects are very good. So, if you want to see a horror comedy about dead children and killer mutant puddles, this is the best way to go. Available on DVD.      urlLink The Borrower   I know I saw this movie, but I don't remember anything about it. To my knowledge, it is currently unavailable on DVD, but you might track down a copy of it in VHS.     urlLink Brain Damage   The  urlLink Frank Henenlotter  cult classic. This movie is sick. From the deranged mind of the person who brought you  urlLink Basket Case  (a movie that should have probably been included in this list, but wasn't) and  urlLink Frankenhooker .      urlLink Castle Freak    A real surprise seeing this here, even thought it deserves the honor of appearing in this list. From direct to video master, Charles Band. His company, Full Moon Entertainment, took the horror world by storm back when it started releasing movies.   This was by far one of their best entries, which is not saying much given the amount of duds Full Moon was putting out. I remember when the studio started putting out movies.  urlLink Subspecies ,  urlLink Dollman ,  urlLink Puppet Master  and  urlLink Doctor Mordrid , among others. Then the sequels came and the quality of the films dropped big time (that's what happens when you start a business with heart and then settle for getting quick cash). This movie was really Full Moon's last cry for glory, but by the time of it's release nobody gave a damn. Full Moon had put out so many clunkers that it was hard to tell the good from the bad. Unfortunately, this was one of the good that seemed to have been overlooked.   One of my favorite Full Moon movies is Stuart Gordon's  urlLink Pit and the Pendulum . I think that if Castle Freak got to be here, this one too should have made the list.      urlLink Cemetery Man   I remember reading about this movie and thinking how much I wanted to see it. I managed to record the R - rated version of the movie that was playing midnight on Showtime. During the entire day, I recall moving from place to place watching the movie little by little as I moved from around the University. Back then, they had a lot of places where you could get a small room and watch movies. Of course, this was supposed to be areas designated for the study of film art, but I wasn't going to tell them that I was going to watch a European zombie movie or they would have never let me get access to the rooms.   Half way through, I was thinking that this movie was such a piece of shit. Decided to stop watching until I got home from the University. At home, I finished watching it and I realize that the final half of the film was brilliant. Too bad the first part was lame, slow and stupid.   I would like to see this film again cause I believe that I will like it more second time around, but it isn't available on DVD (unless you buy a region 2 version dvd) and I lost the vhs where I recorded the R-rated version. I know you can track down a copy of the R- rated version, but I am shocked that with all the trash that is being picked up for distribution no a days that no one has taught about releasing this movie. Hey, Anchor Bay, what are you waiting for?     urlLink Cherry Falls   Released on DVD state side on a double bill with a bad John Ritter horror movie, this little gem didn't get much exposure. It was supposed to have a wide release, but it would have received the dreaded NC - 17 rating. It dropped from the radar, but appeared again in a mangled cut made specially for the U.S.A. network. The DVD version has a few more scenes than that version, but it isn't the nasty complete version.  To see the complete version, you will have to buy the region 2 DVD. Again, Anchor Bay, what are you waiting for?     urlLink A Chinese Ghost Story   Boy, did they drop the ball on this one. Don't get me wrong. It's a great movie, but it has no right being included in this list. This movie is more fantasy than horror. And, if you are going to include this film, you might as well add "Mr. Vampire" and "Bride with the White Hair" to the list, which are excellent examples of Chinese fantasy movies.   You can get all these movies through  urlLink Tai Seng  distributors.      urlLink Cronos   This is another movie I saw during my university years. Pretty good, even taught I don't remember it very well. It is currently out on DVD. I will make it a point to seeing again real soon and see if my recollection is correct.     urlLink The Day of the Beast   Strong concept, bad execution. Some of the fx are good, but this film is such a mess. From the creator of the bigger mess " urlLink Accion Mutante " (even taught I taught it was much more entertaining).     urlLink Day of the Dead   Huh? What's this doing here? Okay, I know that this brilliant film has been unjustly ignored, but couldn't you add someone more obscure to the horror fan, like  urlLink George Romero's  " urlLink The Crazies "?  A lot of people hated this movie cause they taught it was slow and had over the top acting. I think it's fantastic. Great special FX too.   For those who have no idea what this film is, it's the third installment in  urlLink George Romero's  excellent living dead trilogy.     urlLink Dark Waters   Saw it. Don't remember. Let's more on.     urlLink Death Machine   Silly movie, with some good FX and some tense moments. If you like this type of movie, a better choice for this list would have been " urlLink Split Second ".     urlLink Deep Rising   Okay, not a bad movie, but a "best horror movie you've never seen"? Please !!! It's an entertaining movie, but it isn't something to write home about. Some cool FX and funny jokes, but we've seen better. Another dud in the list.     urlLink Def by Temptation   Saw this when I was a kid. Thought it sucks. Probably would think the same exact thing if I watched today.     urlLink The Dentist   Okay film. More gruesome than scary. The concept is good. Corbin Bernsen as the crazed dentist is superb. But, again, not a movie to include in a list like this. I mean, if it wasn't so accessible to the horror movie fan, why is there a sequel to this movie? Also, this movie played on TV. I'm sure more people know about this movie than it's given credit for.     urlLink The Devil's Backbone   Fantastic movie. Not really a horror movie, even taught it had a lot of creepy elements. From  urlLink Guillermo del Toro , the same director of  urlLink Cronos  (see above),  urlLink Blade 2  and  urlLink Hellboy . This is the director's best, most artistic movie.   While I understand why this rarely seen movie is on the list, if you watch it hopping to see a horror movie, you will be very disappointed. Has a few scenes of terror, but nothing more. Still, forth seeking out, especially since it's out on DVD.     urlLink Dolls   Before Charles Band's  urlLink Puppetmaster , there was  urlLink Stuart Gordon's  Dolls. Great choice to add to this list. Rarely seen and hard to find unless you buy the region 2 DVD.      urlLink Event Horizon  I love this movie !!! One of my favorites. Shining meets Hellraiser in space. Nice combination. Trouble is that this movie is more accessible than the author gives it credit. Sure, it was a flop in the theaters, but more people have seen this movie in video or in the sci - fi channel than, for example, The Devil's Backbone or Day of the Dead (for that matter). I believe that it was added to this list cause it is very underrated. Deserves a look.   If you like this movie, you might want to check out Pitch Black, an excellent alien clone with a cool concept and killer main character.      urlLink The Evil Within   Interesting movie. Very rare. Not really scary. Has some gory moments. I can accept it as being part of this list, even taught there are a lot of better movies.   For killer baby movies, you're better off with "It's Alive" (surprisingly,unavailable on DVD as of this writing).     urlLink The Exorcist III   Hey, it's better than the second installment, but that ain't saying much cause the second one sucked big time. This one has some pretty scary scares and some sick stuff. Worth watching. I'm not sure if this one is out on DVD. I think not.     urlLink From Beyond   Like Dolls, another Stuart Gordongemm that has yet to be seen of DVD. You can track down an old copy in vhs and a region 2, full screen import DVD.   Hey,  urlLink Jeffrey Combs  is in it. Also, from the same director of Re-Animator. Need I say more?     urlLink Ginger Snaps    One of the best, modern day, werewolf flick. Good story and an interesting gimmick. Has a goth feel to it. Plus the acting is first rate.   The sequels is out too. While the opinion on the  urlLink sequel  is mixed, I liked it very much.   Released in America in a very bad, full screen DVD by Artisan. Fuck Artisan, get the Canadian DVD. Much better, plus a whole mess of features.   A movie about werewolves that came out a few months before Ginger Snaps is also worth mentioning. " urlLink Dog Soldier " premiered on the Sci - Fi channel and quickly moved to a DVD release. Another excellent concept. Very good FX and a fun story that has some good scares and gore.      urlLink Hardware   Good sci - fi horror movie ruined by an extremely slow first half that seems to have no end. Some surreal and bloody images. Still, overrated, but worth a look (try to get the unrated version).     urlLink Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer   One of the most disturbing films ever made. Not an easy movie to watch. This is one great horror movie that you should actually not see. Very hard to forget. This is not a nice movie. What makes it scary? Cause it's based on real horrors. The type you see in the news everyday.      urlLink Horror Express   I'm actually surprised to see this movie in the list. They give it on TV very often. Interesting movie. Entertaining too.     urlLink Humanoids from the Deep   Oh come on !!! A movie about horny fish rapping women? There is a reason people haven't seen this movie. Cause they avoid it like the plague. You should too.     urlLink I Spit of your Grave   This is a revenge movie. Granted, a very good, violent, disturbing revenge movie. But not a horror movie.     urlLink Jack be Nimble   Jack be crap. Overrated. Avoid at all cost.     urlLink Jack's Back  I recall this being a scary thriller. Would like to see it again. I'm not sure if it's out on DVD. I believe it's not.     urlLink The Keep   Saw this movie years ago. I taught it was very creepy. Worth a look, if you can find it.     urlLink Lair of the White Worm   Saw it years ago. Didn't impress me much, even taught I have a feeling that if I see it now, it will probably impress me.      urlLink Last House on the Left   Revenge movie. Not horror.  I believe this was Wes Craven's first movie.     urlLink The Legend of Hell House   Creepy. A must see for horror fans that like their horror with a lot of atmosphere and mystery.      urlLink Let Sleeping Corpses Lie   Good zombie flick. Released on DVD by Anchore Bay. Be sure to add this gem to your horror DVD movie collection.     urlLink Manhunter   First film incarnation of the Thomas Harris novel, Red Dragon. Better made, but less seen than the newer, crappy version.   what's the difference? The director. Manhunter has a talented director behind the cameras, Red Dragon doesn't.     urlLink Maniac   Good, gory fun. Not great, thought. If I recall correctly, has a cool cameo by Tom Savini. I believe he doesn't say a single word. He just gets his head blow off.   The late, great  urlLink Joe Spinell  plays the title villain. Man, can he pull off acting like a crazy fuck.     urlLink Maniac Cop 2   This is a case where the sequel is better made, better directed and better acted than the original (or the second sequel for that matter). Lots of crazy action in this one. Dammit, urlLink Anchor Bay , release this one !!!     urlLink Mute Witness   Nice thriller. Spoiled by some silly humor to ease the tension. This is one of the best entries in the book.      urlLink Necronomicon   Based on an H.P. Lovecraft story.  Piece of shit. Let's move on...  (For Lovecraft inspired fun, you are better off with " urlLink In the Mouth of Madness ", " urlLink Re-Animator " and " urlLink Dagon ")     urlLink The Night Flier   Excellent concept and story, but the success of this movies is  urlLink Miguel Ferrer's  performance. Worth a look.     urlLink Night of the Comet   Interesting concept, lame execution. Starts off good, self-destructs half way through.  Why not try " urlLink Day of the Triffids "? This is an oldie, but goodie.      urlLink Night of the Creeps   A very underrated horror movie. Has a little of everything. Every horror fan should experience this movie. Plays a lot on television. Has like three different endings. A must see. Anchor Bay, take note, another movie you should release.     urlLink The Ninth Gate   Good, but slow. Not really scary. Shouldn't be in this list.     urlLink Open your Eyes  (Abre Tus Ojos)  Good, but not a horror movie !!!! Grrrrrrrrrrr !!!     urlLink Opera   Excellent  urlLink Dario Argento movie. Sure, it's very uneven, but the cinematography and camera tricks are awesome. Lots of gore, too.   This was actually the first  urlLink Dario Argento  movie I saw. It's my personal favorite, even taught Suspira, his classic, is a better movie overall.   Which, btw, funny how Suspira isn't in this list, since many horror fans have yet to learn who is Dario Argento (except those that read  urlLink Fangoria  Magazine).     urlLink Pin   I recall it being very boring.     urlLink Prison   I remember I liked this one. Would like to see it again, but it's not available in the U.S.  There is an uncut, region 2 DVD on sale at eBay.     urlLink Private Parts   I saw this movie when I was a kid. It was on a double bill with " urlLink Carnival of Souls " (a movie that should have also made the list, but didn't). Not a bad movie, except it's not a horror movie. It's a movie about sexual obsession and perversion.    urlLink Pumpkinhead   definitely underrated. Nice choice. Doesn't play much on TV. Has a  urlLink sequel . Stick with the original. Available in DVD.     urlLink Ravenous   This odd little movie is a must see. It's very experimental. More like an art house horror movie. The musical score is crazy.   Sure, not very scary, even taught there is a lot of suspense. It's the type of movie that is gruesome and disturbing, without being gory. A must see.   This was a terrible flop in the theaters. I recall I saw it in the movies and taught it was one of the best movies I had seen all year. It has gain a cult following on video.      urlLink The Resurrected   Slow and boring, but has atmosphere and a bizarre third act.   Based on an H.P. Lovecraft story.     urlLink Screamers   This is another surprise. I don't think it should be here, even taught it's not a bad sci - fi / horror hybrid. Some cool stuff in this one, but you could do better.     urlLink Session 9   Moody and creepy. Builds on character development. A little slow, but that helps build tension. Setting the movie in an abandoned hospital helps too.   Shot on High - Definition video.   urlLink Blair Witch  fans will enjoy this one.  Speaking of  urlLink Blair Witch , there is a very good docu - horror movie that was made before Blair Witch that should have been included in this list. It's called  urlLink Last Broadcast . Very well made, very unjustly ignored.      urlLink The Stepfather   Good stuff. Very creepy. Has a sequel. If I recall, the sequel is very good too.   Don't know why, but this film reminds me of a very good thriller called "Flowers in the Attic". That one is also very creepy. Highly recommended.     urlLink Stir of Echoes   Very underrated thriller that has some creepy supernatural elements. Good acting and directing. Some good scares too. Highly recommended.  If you like this movie, you might also want to see (if you haven't seen them, which I doubt very much) "What Lies Beneath" and "The Others". And, of course, "Sixth Sense" too.   urlLink Kevin Bacon  is really good in this movie. Good performance.    urlLink Swamp Thing   Crap !!! What the fuck is this doing here. Nooooooooooo !!! Not a horror movie, dammit !!! Not even a good movie. What the hell is it doing in this list? Taking space !!! That's what it's doing. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr !!!     urlLink Tombs of the Blind Dead   Moody Spanish chiller with some creepy cinematography and music. First part in  urlLink Amando de Ossorio blind dead series (four in all).   Of all four movies, I prefer number three (" urlLink Horror of the Zomb ies") because it was the first one I saw. Very creepy too.   urlLink Anchor Bay  has released this film on a double bill DVD with " urlLink Return of the Evil Dead ". To my understanding, this DVD has been discontinued. I have heard rumors that both movies are missing scene in the  urlLink Anchore Bay 's edition.  urlLink Midnight1  offers both movies uncut.    Well, that's it. Haven't seen the rest, even taught I have a feeling that I've probably seen a few others.  I also made some alternate suggestions as to other movies that should have been included on the list or that you might like to seek out if you liked a particular movie that was on the list. I would like to add some more alternatives below.   Okay, off the top of my head, here are a few films that I would put in my personal list of horror movies you've never seen.  (These are small descriptions on why I like these movies and think they should be on the list. Not really a detailed review.)     urlLink Audition    urlLink Takashi Miike 's film might be slow, but it builds slowly on the suspense and hints always that things will turn dark and menacing. Ends in a truly horrific way. Part of the new wave of Japanese thrillers and horror movies that are slowly filtering into America's shores. A must see.      urlLink Battle Royale   Okay, not really a horror film, but a must see none the less. Since the original list featured several movies that didn't fit into the horror mold, I decided to add this sci - fi action film that is a brutal satire on the survival of the fittest mentality of modern Japanese society. It's " urlLink Lord of the Flies " meets " urlLink The World's Most Dangerous Game ".   This controversial movie hasn't been released in America, but you can order the international version from a few sellers at eBay. Trust me, you won't be disappointeded.   Btw, there is a sequel of this film available, but while entertaining, lacks any of the original's flair. Stick with the first movie.      urlLink Bad Taste   This was  urlLink Peter Jackson 's (the director of the Lord of the Rings trilogy) first movie. It's an ultra low -  budget splatter movie about aliens that come to earth to feed on human vomit. A true gore classic. Very well made, considering that it was a labor of love that took almost four years to complete. And, I bet, you probably never even heard of this movie until now. One of the reasons is that this movie was never, to my knoledge, featured in Fangoria (it was mentioned several times and I believe that the VHS anAnchorre Bay DVD release of this movie were reviewed in Fangoria). The movie was featured in Gorezone which was an old gore magazine that was compitting against Fangoria. Aviously, Fangoria won.  Another little gem that you might want to seek out is Peter Jackson's second movie, the muppets on drug flick " urlLink Meet the Feebles ". Not perfect, but funny non the less.   And, of course, there is  urlLink Peter Jackson 's ode to zombies, the hilariously gory " urlLink Brain Dead " (A.K.A. Dead / Alive). Seeying these three movies, you will recognize the director's true potential, but wonder how in the blue hell did a movie studio have the balls to trust this man with $300 million dolars to bring the Lord of the Rings trilogy to the big screen. You might want to seek out Peter Jackson's excellent " urlLink Heavenly Creatures " (for which I believe he was nominated for a "Best International Film Oscar" award, but didn't win).     urlLink Cannibal Holocaust   The definitive cannibal movie, mostly shot in documentary style. Lots of gore, with some actual shocking footage of animals being slaughtered to add to the gruesome impact. Sometimes you can't even tell what is real and what is fiction. This makes this movie the more disturbing.   This controversial movie can be found in different DVD versions on EBay. It is curently unnavailable in the U.S.      urlLink Cure   A stylish, Japanses thriller that gets under your skin and surprises you as it twsit and turns. Some scenes are shot with such visual impact that the burn in your memory. Grows creepier with repeat viewings.      urlLink $la$her$   This little gem is an example of low budget filmmakers thinking big. Good concept, nicexecutionon. Mostly due to the director,  urlLink Maurice Deveraux . I'm willing to bet that if this guy plays his cards right, he can easyly become the next  urlLink Sam Raimi  or  urlLink Peter Jackson . While this movie is no " urlLink Evil Dead " or " urlLink Brain Dead ", it still shows a lot of promise. Worth a look.     That actually is the last item on my list. I can think of a few more ( urlLink Ju-On ,  urlLink Evil Dead Trap ,  urlLink Eko Eko Azarak ,  urlLink The Eye ,  urlLink Versus ,  urlLink Tomie , ect), but I think it best to leave it at that for now. I might create a new list combining the original list, my suggestions and a few other movies that I haven't mention this. If I do, I will be sure to publish it here. For now, I'm going to sign off and go to sleep. Goodnight everybody !!!    urlLink Sailor Ecchi
