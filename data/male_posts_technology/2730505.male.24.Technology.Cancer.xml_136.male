When I first started, my schedule was from 8:30 to 5.  That was 8 1/2 hours everyday of work.  So I stuck to it.  get in at 8:30 and leave right at 5.  Well I guess they didn't like that.  They wanted me to stay longer, to see if there was anything else to do.  So I started working from 8:30 to 5:30 PM.  I was doing that for a while and then there was another person who got hired.  So we both were working the same hours for a couple of months and things were going well until one day around 7:15 in the morning, "the shit hit the fan"  So there was another change.  Well it was also since my boss and the other guy were going for thier certs that they thought a schedule change would be good.  So, for the sake of convienience and IT coverage, we went from 8:30-5:30 to alternating days of 7:00 to 4:30 and 9:30 to 6 PM.  Basically they wanted someone here from 7 to 6.  An 11 hour coverege.  So My early days (7:00 to 4:30) would be Tuesday, Thursday and every other Friday and my late days would be Monday, Wednesday and the Fridays that I wasn't early.  So it was confusing for a little while there but we all got used to it eventually.  So that has been going on for the last six months.  Now, since there's no more school for those two, another decision regarding schedules has been made.  I don't know if I want either but here they are.  One option is for alternating early weeks between the two of us.  See that's not too bad but I don't know if I can deal with getting up that early for a whole week considering I stay up pretty late.  The other option is for me to stay as the late guy, no more switching.  That could also prove bothersome considering I go to Iowa every month and I have a couple of trips to Michigan planned for the summer (relax it's not for Meghan, she's in Japan, this is for Weddings and what not).  My work is pretty flexible where I can switch my Fridays but I just don't like the idea that I can abuse something and jeopardize my job.  I dunno which option to take, they're both equally flexible and the other guy likes to get out early anyways to avoid the traffic so being the late guy all the time is a viable option.  I guess we'll see how being early for a week works out.  Besides, if I have to leave early one Friday I can switch anyways.  I guess we'll have to wait and see on this one.
