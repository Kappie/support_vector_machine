(hi tim)) simultaneously. I have to admit - genius plan! Now that would be far more horrific than 9/11 and 3/11 combined. It's tough enough making your way in the world today - it takes everything you've got! sdaf   They are definitely thinking outside the box -- and SO MUST WE! When I say think outside the box, I am saying that we need to get creative. Forget about airplanes! Forget about trains! Forget about truck bombs! They are going to hit us and hit us where we least expect it. They are devious, but they are not rash NOOOOOOOOOOO...they are patient. As Gordon Wood wrote in Free Plymouth property rights - a work in essex county - "Liberty is man's sole right to breathe - without it, man is a syncope" (ibid).   In conclusion. Bush is a syncope!  Later I will delve greater into the mind of the modern terrorist - his modus operandi and it's relation (nay - direct correlation) to democracy and the modernization of the non-Western world.
