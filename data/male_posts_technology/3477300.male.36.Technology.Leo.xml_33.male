Hey, now you know I really am a geek!    Anyway, he's got a new book out:  urlLink Cartographica Extraordinaire   Here's what they say on Amazon about it;      Cartographica Extraordinaire alluringly presents the highlights of a remarkable collection of historical maps. What makes this book stand out from other published map archives, though, is its reflection of the generosity, energy, and intellectual curiosity of David Rumsey.   Not just yankie maps, found some really good old French ones.  Incredible resolution!      This image of  Cap d'Agde  one ...      Is a zoom in of this picture of South West France ...          Incroyable n'est pas?
