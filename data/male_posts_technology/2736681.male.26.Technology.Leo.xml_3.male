Web Services made me nervous from the start, because no-one could ever really tell me clearly what it was. The WS-PickAName trend was more worrying, because the PickANames looked so much like stuff that had been talked over in the CORBA and Java spaces, and for all I know, in the COM, DCE and other spaces. The OMG is running a similar risk with its MDA stuff, although I personally think and hope that its a little more novel.  Of course, as a researcher, this should be great for me, because its a green field to republish old ideas reapplied to new technology domains, and to get work publicised in standards fora even though its still preliminary research. In reality, I'd rather not, because it isn't intellectually satisfying, and makes me feel just a little dirty.  Oh yeah, and I'll quite happily put my hand up as having been a bit guilty this in the past.  urlLink HUTN  is a case of the same problem - research, and student research at that, published as a standard without implementation. I'll plead youth and inexperience, and that someone else had already issued a request for proposals.  The problem of reinvention in the markup community is further discussed by Dare Obsanjo  urlLink here .
