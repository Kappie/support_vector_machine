Later on the "Pop on the Rock" concert began. The crowd had really started to fill up - despite the weather - and Ian Van Dahl came on. I thought i'd make the best of some decent music so I ran out into my friends front garden, scooted up the wall and onto the roof of his garden shed, which overlooked the couple of thousand people that were watching the concert going on next to the house. I began to strut my funky stuff, and even got some crowd participation and cheers. The security guys ran over and were motioning for me to get down, and I gave them a subtle and polite reminder that it was private property (something like "Iz my facking shed! Feck off!! *burb*)  Louise Nurding - sorry I upstaged you. You should have gone on naked. :)
