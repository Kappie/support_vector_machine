The sense of being among professionals backed by the synergy we had created for years is what which keeps me ticking in the blog. If suppose it was an X blog with unknown members and the same kind of discussion prolongs for sure I would not be so interested...   I cannot go to US for their economy is growing good and feel happy. Rather I am appreciating the growth of India being in India. did I make sense?
