I`m getting the usual 'regret' feeling where i think "I could have completed this if i had started early". It`s Typical me alright...  Sri Lanka 2 out of 2 Yup! the lions are in the lead taking 2 consecutive wins, Sundays one was quite a game, `cos indians against the sri lankas are a game to see, That reminds me...a friend of mine who used to adore india, I used to tease her all the time, she was totally attached to the indian team (and India), not that i have a grudge against the indians or anything like that but... i`d like to make an exception when it comes to my li`l indian friend (trust me she`s li`l :p). anyways lets see who picks up the money bag in the asia cup... signing out.
