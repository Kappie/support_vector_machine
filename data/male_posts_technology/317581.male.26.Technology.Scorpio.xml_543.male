But I have seen people that I thought would never be together in the long run, continue to make choices to stay together. They're obviously no longer in the honeymoon stage. It's just weird, maybe I haven't had a honeymoon stage, or maybe it's that I self protect. I dunno if any of this makes any sense. I need to work. Peace- T
