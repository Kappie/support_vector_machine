It's probably not that hot but it's felt it to me.  Yesterday we went out and did a little walking around Granville St and then West 10th ave just for fun.  By the time we got home later in the evening I was in the throes of full blown heat stroke; headache, nausea, everything sore, and constant lightheadedness.  Now personally, I think heat stroke is worth it; I usually get it the first uber hot day that I get to play each years, and it signals the start of the summer for me.  I did indeed drink about 3 litres of water, so I didn't dehydrate, and I did have my hat on, so I took my precautions.  But still I got uncomfortably warm.  No biggie, cuz I probably won't get that again this year.  A hot summer day in Vancouver is a beautiful thing for people watching.  Everyone is feeling groovy and happy and walking with a smile on their face.  The beaches are jam packed with beautiful people wearing small amounts of clothing, and the parks are full of people having fun.  The buildings and colors of the city are all fantastic too.  Everywhere u go you see people having fun, and even the streetskids seem to be in a better mood.  I dig it.    I don't seem to have anywhere to go with this little bit of writing, so I'll stop here I guess.  Gotta get ready for work anyways.
