This weekend I was a monster with the drill and screwdriver and i mounted shelving , setup some closets with ClosetMaid stuff, put up hanging racks in the basement, setup washer and dryer, and setup our new entertainment center.  Bob Vila Eat your heart out.  I have to say that now I understand how people with houses always have a list of things they should do.  And how they can eat up a whole weekend of decently hard work fixing all this stuff.  I also understand how rewarding it is to have it all done and enjoy your new home :)  ROCK!
