I did wake up toward the end however, and that was a touch on the twilight zone side.  If you have ever been under sedation, then you know what you feel like upon first waking up - confusion.  Imagine the confusion coupled with three strangers staring at you with this awful sawing/drilling noise in your ears - not a pleasant way to wake up.  I must have gone back "asleep" soon after, because I don't remember them stitching me up at all, and the next thing I remember is being lead to the recovery room.  I vaguely remember the doctor telling my wife that everything went pretty good (although I should have gotten this done around 15 years old).  From there it's pretty hazy until I got home.  Then I remember my entire FACE being pretty much numb for another half hour to an hour.  Oh yeah...and the mouth full of bloody gauze.  But, I'm not in as much pain as I thought I would be, and have actually been able to eat some soft foods (like scrambled eggs) - but only after taking some vicodin (good stuff that vicodin).
