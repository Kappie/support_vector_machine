You never know. Talk about consciousness,   * classical music, design flaws on everyday stuff the TV remote,   * the list is endless...  *  * Discussions have taken various skins, there is this 'awe'   * skinned discussion where the group talks about, the beauty   * of Thamarai's lyrics in his/her recent song. There is no denying  * no arguments, just each one's version of why it appeals.  *   * Then there is 'combat' skinned discussions. Each one trying   * to prove a point across. Well this post is about these two   * types of discussions.   *  * Now, to the 'combat' skinned, What is each one trying to do ?  *  * Its like standing on two ends of the spectrum trying to make   * the other 'understand' the 'situation'. The highlight is, the   * discussion is among peers, if one of them considers the other   * a fool, there is no scope for discussion, there could be some  * argument but when one argues with a fool, people may not be   * able to tell... So its among people who dont think the other   * is a fool, its a "Let's find out what he thinks about this   * idea of mine" attitude. If the other doesnt agree, Is one in   * a position to take it ?  *   * If the other doesnt agree, or is simply on a parrallel   * plane of consciousness which won't meet , what is the state of   * the communication now ? Has it broken down ? Psychological   * maturity allows subsequent communication (read more such   * discussions), the lack of it gives scope for a better sense   * of judgement about oneself, the level of tolerance to alternative   * perspectives one can handle.   *  * All this in a flawlessly initiated communication among peers.  *  * Now introduce a flaw in the premise, that the communication had   * a seemingly small bug, that the initial topic simply didnt reach   * the other side, but the points used to substantiate it did.   * In other words the core of the discussion missed, but the   * discussion grew on the examples or illustrations or whatever tool   * was used to communicate the core idea. What is the state of the   * communication now ?   *  * The discussion has lost focus on the core but is now focussing   * on the illustrations. The flaw I am talking about is this, the   * illustrations the more interesting they are, the more easily the   * topic gets deviated. The human brain probably lacks the tools to  * arrive at THE ILLUSTRATION for a thought or feeling.  *  * How do I keep the underlying core idea undisturbed by an   * attractive illustration ?  *  * Engineering freaks might come up with a feedback cycle, a constant   * check on progress made in getting the idea across.. na kills   * the fun in the communication, but does it get the task done ?  *  * Think of other communication tools. Something like a piece   * of paper or a drawing board to illustrate ideas on a serious   * peer chat.  *  * Phew.. all this for a harmless chat ?!!  *  * Now to the core idea behind this blog, what if a discussion   * was initiated with an intent of being 'awe' skinned, but turned   * out to be a 'combat' skinned. Does this introduce a strain   * in the relationship ? Is this lack of common ground good on   * a long term ?  *  */     ps: Was sick of this '0 comments', now no-one (..well except blogger.com) can say that there are no comments in this post.
