I'm all for helping out those that are physically unable to work. I mean those that have lost both arms and both legs, really, totally, physically unable to work. Not the "I hurt my back so I can't be a mechanic anymore" people. Fuck you, get a desk job.   Now, I'm resigned to the fact that welfare isn't going to go away anytime soon. But, if we institute some changes, the appeal of government handouts will lessen and people would actually begin to be contributing members of society again.   Actually, I'm only proposing one change. Instead of handing out money in whatever form for them to spend on housing (read stereo equipment), car payments (for the new Caddy), groceries (steak and Pepsi), etc, hand out the groceries. I'm tired of seeing people in front of me at the grocery store with food stamps in hand and a cart full of Coke, shrimp, steak, brand name cereals. That shit ends with my plan.   You need government help to get groceries, fine. Here you go - here'sa fewbags of groceries all the essentials you will need for the next week (better make it last cause I'm not coming back till next week). There's no steak, or soda. Milk, bread, oats, eggs, flour, off-brand stuff, etc. That's what's in them grocery bags - no more steak. You want steak - get a job.   Oh, you need help paying some utility bills - No more sending a check to you, that check goes right to the utilities company. You need a car you say? No Caddy for you, you get a 1970's Pinto - it may not look pretty but it runs well enough to get you from point A to B and back again. You need clothes? What size do you wear?   Bottom line, why are we allowing the excess in our welfare system? All we need to do is revise the plan so there is no excess. ZERO extra dollars for anything. Here you go, here's what you need to live.   True story. My brother is married with two kids and is the sole income provider for the house. He has an okay job with a little health benefit (not much). His daughter (less than a year old) had to go to the hospital due to an illness. His insurance covered all buta nice $3000 chunk of the bill. After receiving a 2nd notice about payment, he went to see if he could get any help from the government.   He pulled in behind a guy in anewer Cadillac Escalade (my brother is driving an early 90's Buick he bought used). He got in line behind the driver of the Escalade. The driver left, apparently receiving the assistance he needed. My brother gets denied. You see, my brother is working and making just over the amount that someone has deemed the maximum for any assistance. Does the driver of the Escalade REALLY need help? If he does, then he should sell the damned Escalade.   How do you expect people to WANT to become contributing members of society again if you continually give out all the handouts? And then, if you are fortunate enough to have a job, but make somewhere between what it takes to make a decent living and poverty, you get nothing.
