(lol)  I woke up at 10:15 from a phone call from Andrew who had just woken up too. (We were both planning on getting up somewhere in the area of 9, and we did, but we both went back to sleep again - LOL). I got ready as quickly as possible, but right as I was heading out the door, I was stopped by my dad who declared that I wasn’t going anywhere until I cleaned my room, vacuumed the house and washed the dishes. I weaseled my way out of that, but it still seemed to set me back about half an hour more… Andrew just eventually met me at a McDonalds by his house. We at brunch there and headed off to the mall (illegally, yes… in Oregon you have to have your license for 6 months before you can even drive one person under 20, outside of your family. – dumb law, I think, but I guess there are enough stupid kids my age here to warrant passing more laws to restrict them.)    urlLink   Andrew at McDonalds.    Once we got to the mall, we met up with Ddee and Kristy and headed over to the bus stop. Little did we know that would be the start of the first many, many loooooong waits at bus stops all day… (but it’s all good, that’s when we would talk the most – waiting for busses)    urlLink   Ddee and Kristy waiting for us at the mall      urlLink   part of a wall of mirrors that always reflect straight back at you – I was a ditz and used the flash.      Once the bus finally got there (like ½ an hour later), we rode it to a transit center in downtown Portland, but before we got off, we met an interesting couple that seemed rather... high. We (the four of us) had been talking about fire and explosives, specifically my friend and his dad blowing up a microwave in some random field on part of their property. These two college students who had just boarded the buss set about trying to convince us not to become Unabombers, but if we were going to, to become artistic Unabombers. The guy started going off on how the world needed more art and culture and less hate, while then girl started letting phrases she must have heard from a stoned professor somewhere fall out of her mouth like, “positive aura” “less negativity means a better life” and “peace not war, love not hate”. She was doing this is perfect combination with the rather elaborate movements her arms kept making at random intervals. HAHAHA We all burst out laughing for a full 30 seconds or so, as we drove away from the stop at which they had exited.  After waiting for another… ten or so minutes downtown, we boarded another bus which took us to the Oregon City Transit Center. In this bus we met another quirky, if not quite so amusing fellow who seemed to take a little too fond a liking to Ddee and Kristy. O, btw, he was drunk too. We were sitting at a right angle along the side and back of the bus, with Andrew one seat ahead of the guy, Ddee and Kristy two seats behind him and me two seats to their left. I was seriously thinking about just getting up and sitting between the guy and them since he was seriously making me nervous, but Andrew beat me to it by moving our stuff out of that seat and sitting between them and me. The guy procceded to give us a rather lengthy life story about how he was too rich and too smart to work, and how he grew the best pot in the state, right in his own backyard. I think we got him to think he wanted to get off at a sooner stop than he would have by how many times we asked him which stop was his, but who knows… maybe he did live there?  Once we got to the Oregon City Transit Center, we waited for another half hour or more for the next and final bus to arrive that would take us to what we have now dubbed as the POC (Piece Of Crap) Fair.  While we were waiting, Ddee and Kristy pretended to fight for at least 20 minutes. I took what would have been some better pictures of them doing that, but my camera SUCKS so none of them looked anywhere near good.    urlLink   I think Ddee just kicked Kristy, but I’m not sure.       urlLink   Kristy rushing Ddee.      urlLink   This thing is seriously attached to his head. (lol)    Once we got to the destination, we quickly realized it wasn’t as … [insert gratifying adverb here] as it was made out to be. We thought at first we should name it the kiddy fair, but we liked the other name better. I had a headache, so I just acted as coathanger while the other three went on the grand total of two rides (the only ones that weren’t geared toward the 4 foot and under crowd). I got some … fairly good pics of them on the first ride.    urlLink        urlLink        urlLink      (Ok, so one fairly decent pic of them, two fairly good pics of the ride – lol)  We spent a whole half hour of quality fun time at the fair and then proceeded back to the bus stop, where we waited for... over an hour for the next bus. The stop happened to be next to a building which had an overhanging roof over a porch. This was good for poor Ddee who was far too hot in a sweatshirt, in the blazing (relatively) sun.     urlLink   Andrew looks like he’s got the whole ape thing goin’ on, but don’t worry, he’s just on his cell.      urlLink   If this isn’t Hickville, then I don’t know what...      urlLink    My question is how to get the vehicle up there to begin with. Who knows, maybe YEEHAA’s 4x4 enough (man enough in the truck world)    After the bus finally got there, we had to share it with four rather intoxicated 20-some-odd year old guys who didn’t seem to have a problem spreading the news that yes, you will get drunk in the beer garden.  After we got back to Portland, we ate dinner in the lower food court of Pioneer Place 2. (I wish I’d gotten some pictures of that place, the fountains make it look sweet. :)  We had an uneventful bus ride back to the Washington Square (mall that we started at), and decided to browse around for a while, in search of a game for Andrew’s friend who’s b-day party I was taking him to.    urlLink   Andrew and me in the WS Summit bathrooms... see Ddee, this has nothing to do with showers ;)    HAHAHA, somehow I lost my key to my car at the fair (at least I think I lost it at the fair), so I had to call my parents and have them come give me a spare key. Once they left, I took everyone home, well everyone but Andrew who I took to a restaurant which preceded a sleepover he was going to. He had KrispyKreme for breakfast the next day (lucky dawg).     urlLink   Is she yawning?? I can’t tell.
