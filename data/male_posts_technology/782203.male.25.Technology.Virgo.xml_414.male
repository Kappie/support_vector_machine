First somehow I need to come up with a Flash presentation thingy, and I got absolutely no experience with flash so its gonna be really interesting. I borrowed the Flash MX book from library so hopefully that will give me a head start.   Really wanted to go out last night, I was supposed to meet my sister last night but she was too tired.  Gonna meet her next week but today with another cousin of mine. Who is cool but I actually just wanted to spend some alone time with her and just talk, we haven't done that in a while. Oh well.   Nothing much else to update.  Life not very interesting now.
