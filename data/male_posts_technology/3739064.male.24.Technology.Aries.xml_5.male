So, here is where you'll get the answer to why you had to repeat yourself 3 times before I acknowledged the Earth around me actually existed.   Oh, and yes you know my mind is elsewhere when I respond to you in a mumble.  One other thing about me is that I have concluded that I can do two complex tasks at one time. Sometimes three, but usually two. SO thinking and working is about it. Don't expect a clear response out of me while im working. Now, things get complicated when I'm doing two things at the same time that do not involve my brain. Because when queried by another individual during this moment, many disasters may occur. For example driving my car. I can drive my car and talk on the phone at the same time. But, the second the back-seat driver kicks in, that third job will result in:  A) A completely useless response such as, "Cardboard", or "Rammstein" B) I give you the time of day and run a red light resulting in crashing or vehicular       manslaughter. C) You get lucky and catch me in one of those 3 things at a time moments.  Well theres the mystery of the day about Dave. Check back tomarrow for more about what the hell is going on with me.
