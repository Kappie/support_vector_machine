Now for some answers to questions your sure to ask:   How was the move?  A week of living in boxes.  3 Days of lifting / packing / unpacking...   In short.. annoying.   But its over now.  And the fun times are ahead with setting up a new place.   We dont have as much closet space, but the place is bigger than we used to have, and its coming together nicely.   Neighbors?  We have met a few.  All seem nice.  There is this "gaggle" of high school kids who hang out on our street.  *shrug* They dont seem to rowdy, so im sure it will be fine.   Our condo neighbors are very nice.  THe couple next door to us already had a party (the night of our move) and Chris and I went over to meet their friends and welcome them into their home.   Also it didnt hurt to have a beer or two to ease the sharp pain in the back :)  I havent met the other condo neighbor, but chris has and she says hes nice too.   What did you unpack and setup first?  Contrary to every other move i have made, the computer was not the first thing to be set up.  This time it was Tivo.  It was Chris's idea.  I am so married.   Hows the cat?  Our cat was decidedly unhappy.  After sticking her face into a hidden corner of a closet and not moving for about 2 days, she has begun to move about without the fear of 3 short strong hispanic guys popping around corners (our movers).  She has made it to first and second floors, but the basement will have to wait for a more secure time.   Whats next ?  Its been a long few months.  Married..buying a first home...being sick... moving... It will be nice to settle in and get back into a normal routine.     Thats all for now.  If you havent gotten an email with our new address and phone number,  urlLink email me .
