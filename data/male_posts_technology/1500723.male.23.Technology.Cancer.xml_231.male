In fact im fearful that i might forget to post some of the wonderful ideas i get, that i decided to prioritize them. This one came to the top of the list today. Here goes...  Preamble: 	I had this huge cruch on this girl from school days. From 7th grade to 10th. Her name is KALAIvani. (The word KALAI is capitalized because of another reason. I love that word as much i love women. It follwed me my enire life. Well my first crush's name has it. My favourite person cum teacher in the world is KALAIchelvi. My mother's name is KALAIarasi. And my college crush... her name do not have KALAI in it. But wait a minute... I felt miserable and asked the Gods why not. The answer came: She fell in love with a guy named KALAIko. Life was artful again! Now u know one of the minimum criteria i would impose for my to be wife. Okay, now to the subject..) The first cruch(fc). It will always remain in ur minds, doesnt it? Like a scar. Like a curse. Till the grave. I still remember her face and poise so well that i can close my eyes anytime and her delectable face is recalled in seconds (nothing close to Hannibal Lecter). She often comes in my dreams(not those kind of dreams) wearing the same smile and the same perfume, and i go crazy once again. If i had an guardian angel i would know how she would look like. I never told her anything abt my feelings because i was too shy and withdrawn. By God, how i regret that? Today morning, i had this dream.  The Dream: 	I was back in my school. Kalaichelvi madam was teaching Physics like she always does. My school friends were also there sitting besides me. Even my current roommate, S.P.Bala was there: we were discussing a mathematical problem. I immediately realized that im dreaming. So i turned around to the see whether she is also present. Yes, yes, she was there.. as ever, as beautiful, as sweet. My heart was filled with a sense of euphoria even though i knew she isnt real.  	The teacher interupted and announced that she had corrected the Physics exam papers and she would like someone to distribute it. Kalai popped up and collected the papers from the teacher. She started handing out the papers, and when she came to me with my paper, i thought "She is more beautiful the closer she is to me". Then the teacher turned to me and said "you got the first mark". And i think she heard it as well for she had this distinguishably pleasant smile. After she finished with the papers she turned towards me and sat next to me (wishful thinking, i suppose). I was trying hard to see my exam papers while my heart beat was skipping and i broke into a sweat because she is near. She saw my paper and said "i got that problem wrong, can u explain how u solved that?". Even i dreams this was a rare oppurtunity. I grabbed. I was very excited and i wrote all the steps even the ones which i didnt bother to do in the exam. I didnt realise how animated i was getting while explain the things to her, but the teacher did. She came close to us and said "Why dont u two keep your romances outside the classroom?". As i was able to appreciate the teacher's subtle comment, when she went back to taking the class, i turned to kalai and said "May be we should give it a try. The romance i mean." Only after the words came out of mouth i realised how it might have sounded for her. She was stoned by the teacher's comments itself it seems. Mine petrified her. I dont know what to say now. I collected myself up and waited for the class to end without another word. After the class (it was the last class) everybody started to go out and i caught her outside in the corridor. She still refused to see me in the face. As i have never suggested my feelings to her before (even in my dreams) i wanted to find out what she thought abt this(or is it what i think she would think abt this, remember this is my dream still). A drop or two tears formed in her eyes as i muttered something like "sorry...". I went weak in the knees. She looked up and started "You.....only...."  Thats when my roommate decided to increase the voulme of the TV. I woke up with a start and swore under my breath first thing in the morning(i havent done this until India lost to Australia in the world cup finals). Then after my thoughts returned, it struck me that i'll never find out what she thought abt me. It is a curse upon me. The mind can only think where the heart is willing to go. Im still not ready to hear her answer positive or negative. That is essentially the love i have for her. And one more decision was in order.   The next time i see her in person(in reality) im going to tell her everything.
