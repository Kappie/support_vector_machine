From the article: Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry said on Sunday he did not anticipate sending more American troops to Iraq and hoped to bring "significant numbers" home during his first term. Promising a fresh start with U.S. allies "burned" by President Bush, Kerry said, "I would consider it an unsuccessful policy if I hadn't brought significant numbers of troops back within the first term. And I will do that."  If this isn't just a campaign ploy, it's the best thing I've heard from the Kerry camp so far. Of course, I don't really think that's the case. I think this is Kerry trying to get more votes. The lack of details is telling. He also says, "during his first term," which means 2008 at the latest. 4 years is a long time. The war in Iraq has only been on for a little more than one year. Having troops home 4 years from now isn't that great a goal, but at least it's a start. Maybe he's starting to realize that his luke-warm approach to us isn't working too well. We'll see.
