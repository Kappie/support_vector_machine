Unfortunatly Railtrack or Network Rail or whatever on earth our train network is called at the moment, have moved a few stations around and in the doing so, they moved the train that goes to Alton Towers. So now, not only is the journey longer, but we get less time in the park, and they put the price up! The cheek of it! There is a big difference between £33 and £38 for a day out. So I'm giving cheques/cash back to people because I don't think it's really worth it any more. Grrrrrrrr. Flipping trains. The next birthday I believe is Jackies? 23rd or 24th of July? Followed by Max's on the 23rd or 24th of August. All these people with nice summer birthdays! Lucky things you are. Don't know how good they've got it, do they Nicki? ;)
