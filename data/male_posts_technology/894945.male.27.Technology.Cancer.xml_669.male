Firstname: Adam Surname: Currie Email: toaster@toasterfiles.com  Subject: Heinz : Contact Heinz ( Email Ref Number : 27782) Comments: On a visit to my local Safeway I was rather surpised to see that Haunted House tinned spaghetti was no longer sold. I haven't really noticed before, but all I could find was the Tweenies and Barbie spaghetti. I grew on Haunted House spaghetti, it was my favourite, even more so than alphabetti spaghetti. Do you still make it? I know they all taste the same but somehow Haunted House was king. I will feel like a small piece of my childhood has died if this product is no longer produced. *sniff*  Warm Regards,  Adam www.toasterfiles.com     And the reply...   Dear Mr Currie  Further to your recent communication regarding Haunted House Spaghetti, our records show this product is manufactured by HP.  Their contact number is 0800 072 4090.
