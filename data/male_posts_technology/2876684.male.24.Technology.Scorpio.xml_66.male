I ask around and no one else caught the message either, so everyone was like, "yea whatever".  Anyways a bunch of us head down to get some fruit juices and smoothies around the corner and as we walk out, a few policemen (one handling a sniffer dog) walk into the building -so I joked with one of my colleagues about how he shouldn't grow "plants" in the office.  Couple of minutes later as we're walking back to the office we hear the building alarms go off and people start streaming out of the building and head toward Martin Place. Apparently there's a suspected bomb in the building... so much for my audit deadline!  So yea after lots of drama and the police and fire brigade cordoning off a good block of George St we were finally let (cautiously, i might add) back into the building. As I walked back in I noticed a photographer taking pics of the crowd (should I say herd?) going back to work.  Hey I might be in the Herald tomorrow! :P
