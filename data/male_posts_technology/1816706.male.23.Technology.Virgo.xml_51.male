My two bottom ones were growing in sideways and they had to cut them in half and cut around the nerves.  Oh man did it feel great.  They kept giving me shots in the mouth too so that by the end I couldnt feel my face, and I couldnt feel it the rest of the night.  But they gave me some meds to knock me out, so after the swelling and bleeding stopped and I got to sleep, it wasn't TOO bad.  Today was a little rough - eating lots of mash potatoes which are good, and getting some little crap done that I needed to do on the computers.  Thats about all.  Don't get yours taken out unless you have to.  My teeth are Pau (Hawaiian for finished)
