The very same evening he is drawing two sky scrapers in a restaurant onto a place mat depicting the New York sky line… I’m sorry for the people affected by the sniper, but far more people world wide were effected by the attack on the Two Towers last year. That single moment depicts you, Baitey as a hypocrite. And I think you should apologise to Alex for the unkind remarks which you made when you have done FAR worse only hours afterwards. Just because the September the 11th incident happened last year doesn’t make it ok to poke fun at. According to your own moral standards, you are completely out of order.  :-)
