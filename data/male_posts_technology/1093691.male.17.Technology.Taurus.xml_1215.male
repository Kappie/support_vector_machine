I ust got in from work and I am sooo tired. I ache all over because I've been doing delivery today and its all very heavy. VERY heavy. Tomorrow I'm doing full day then 2 nights during the week. I would say gah but I actually volunteered for extra hours. Next Saturday I have swapped shifts so I'm working afternoon so I get a lie in. Woo! I feel so bad when I moan about feeling tired after a 4 hour shift. Well, 4 and half. Especially when people like Paul work all day! Like proper all day. Awww. I see Paul tomorrow. Wooo! :P
