I let her go on the premise that daddy will call her later today.  About 12:30 I recieved a call from   SFW   she wanted to go over the drop off and pick up times for Karissa.  She of course wants to know evening or morning and shit like that.  The 17th-24th of this month I did not care it was not a big deal.  I told her morning.    Now here is where I truly appreciate having an soon to be ex-wife like her! She says on Sept 1st you realize you have to get a babysitter don't you (our mediation date is that day) and I said why I figured I would be picking her up after that.  She says "that does not work for me"  I say OK then I guess I will be picking her up that morning then.  Unless you want to let me pick her up the night before?  She says well if I drop her off on the 31st then I want her back the evening of the 7th not the 8th.  I said well I would like to keep her through the 8th if you don't mind. Of course here is where I get it....DRUM ROLL PLEASE.....She says "So I am just going to let you have her for 8 days out of the kindness of my heart!"    First, I would like to state that I doubt there is too much kindness contained within   SFW  !  Second, You have to have a heart to have kindness in it!  I simply said I figured I would be picking her up that afternoon/evening?  She simply says that does not work for me!  So I say why is it that I am a mile away from you and that does not work for you (which really I had no reason to ask, nor did I expect an answer it just came out)? "It just doesn't thats all!"   So I said well since the evening is not convenient for you and I think it will be a little rough on Karissa to get her up and get her to a babysitter all in time for me to meet you at 08:30 that morning whatever works best for you is fine by me!  So she is dropping Karissa off on the 31st and picking her up at 18:00 on the 8th.  Hopefully if things go well she will be visiting on the 8th not picking up!
