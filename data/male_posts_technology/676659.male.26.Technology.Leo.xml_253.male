After the elections, when the battle's between the three heads: GMA, FPJ and if Ping would have caught up with them. I'd go for Ping na lang! (I have my own convictions)  Local elections: Bing was declared a winner locally, but not yet nationally. Some people are speculating and I hear rumors about pressing charges? What?  Template stuff: I changed it, again! haha No, it's not random. Just love to experiment that's all. Question again,  what is your favorite Blogger template  as of this moment?  And oh my, I've seen Eddie Gil over Wazzup-Wazzup (sp?) and in local shows. As one survey goes, Do you think Eddie Gil should go for showbiz instead?  Therefore, my conclusion is, PRAY FOR THE PHILIPPINES. (Huh? Connection?)   Welcome to the new RR-ers, by the way! :) Rock on! hehe
