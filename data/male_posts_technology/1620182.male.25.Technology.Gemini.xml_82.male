 What I really need is an office.  With a door.  That I can shut.  Maybe if I could shut my door it would keep my team from delivering bad news, which would in turn make the bad news go away.  Maybe.  But you know things are not going so well when your boss starts a conversation with the phrase, "Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse..."  Honestly, I don't think things are that bad.  This is just a company of change and you have to be flexible.  Like a gymnast.  Like Gumby.  Mmmm, Gumby's.  Pokey stix.
