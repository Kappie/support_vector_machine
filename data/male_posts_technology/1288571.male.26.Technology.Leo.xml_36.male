I've really been looking forward to them.. my constant headaches are a real pain in the...ass? haha I had to pause in thought for a split second when I thought that. That analogy doesn't work very well eh? Then again, some might say I talk out of my ass a lot, so maybe its more fitting than I think.................. nah. :)
