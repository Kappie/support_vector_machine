Finally after much deliberation, the details of my australia trip have been settled. From the 10th to the 28th of July, I will be  in Melbourne programming up a storm, possibly having a vb or two, and augmenting my speach with such gems as mate, and no worries.  If anyone has suggestions of things to do in Melbourne, or any friends in the city please leave a comment.
