           
      I started the day with a 1 hour ride out to my new training grounds; an area of hills and mountains between Salinas and San Jaun Bautista. Unfortunately, I missed my turn and instead of going for a hill climb (4-6%) on San Jaun Grade, I spent my time spinning over the rollers of old stage road. I guess I really could have turned around and headed for the hills once I realized I missed my turn but I didn't.   Then, this evening I did my swim workout without my training partner. I did somewhere in the neighborhood of 1200 yards but didn't keep track of my distance. My intention was to do 2000 with sets of 300 yards but I didn't.   Having failed to achieve all of my training goals for the day, I'm sitting here trying to figure what went wrong. A little training retrospective, if you will. Here's my conclusion:    1]  Self deception is the real enemy, not failure.  2]  Have a plan and a purpose for each workout.  3]  Plans are meant to be broken, but only after much reflection.    You don't have to plan to fail; all you have to do is fail to plan.    How do you deal with failures? How diligently do you plan?
