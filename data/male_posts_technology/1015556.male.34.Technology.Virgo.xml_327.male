They were really excited to hear about what we are doing with students, they love youth...  For the past 2 years or so, they were in Charlotte, getting some training.  Awesome to connect, and best of all, they are British!  They will be speaking at 4th service next Sunday and I'm trying to line up some of the student summer teams to help dish out some ice cream.  It would be a great way to connect, have the students hear about Italy and have the McNishs catch a glimpse of SPACE.   urlLink Here  is more about them.
