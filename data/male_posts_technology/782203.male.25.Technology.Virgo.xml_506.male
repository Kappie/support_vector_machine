Yes I will readily admit that I have always wanted to see her naked; as much as I dislike the crappy pop songs that she churns out I think she's hot as hell. Well except that Toxic song which is actually kinda cool, love the way she grinded her ass on that guy's crotch in the video. I wish I was that guy's crotch.   Information taken from  urlLink Fat Guy for the SKinny Guy .  It's amazing the  urlLink information  that you get from blogs. I bet you didn't know that the song "There She Goes" by Sixpence None the Richer is actually a cover of a song by a band called the LA's and it's about heroin addiction! The ironic thing is that the band is supposedly a christian band.
