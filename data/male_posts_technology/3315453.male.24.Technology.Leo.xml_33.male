All I have been doing for the last week is going to work and looking for another part time job.  I do have to say that my work has been rather brutal.  It seems that I am the last to leave each day.  Yesterday I had to unload this truck that was full of boxes that were about 4ft X 6ft X 4in and they were all about 60 lbs.  Let me just say they were a pain in the butt.  This was at the end of the night and the last trailer on. That’s work for you though.  Becca has a job for the next couple of day’s just making photocopies, so by the time I get home she is in bed and I am still sleeping when she wakes up.  Other than that we have not had the time to do much of anything.    Tomorrow is our 5th wedding anniversary.  I think that we are just going to go on a ferry ride to celebrate due to our funds being a little tight now, but it will still be a lot of fun.  We are also going to see one of our friends and their new baby boy.  That should also be very fun.
