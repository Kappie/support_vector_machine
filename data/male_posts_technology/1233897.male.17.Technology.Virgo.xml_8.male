So far, I've not done much useful, but there is a webserver running. So, if my computers on, if you head  here  you should be able to see the basic debian "your webserver is working" page. Which is pretty nifty, if you ask me. (right now it's down, because I decided I wanted to reinstall it).  In other news, my PC has yet another interface, and is very pretty (in my opinion):     Pretty Interface
