Archives could be a drop down box, and I feel 50% is less space for posts.. may be it should be 70% the least. After all, thats our primary area of concern, the others are value additions... But am not sure if any other part will be affected on increasing this size... suggest, atleast try to increase to a more possible extent... and also one more good thing would be name at the top like "Jax says...", that really adds flavor to the blog...  The Rock says... If u smellllllallalalala... what the rock... iiiisss cookin....
