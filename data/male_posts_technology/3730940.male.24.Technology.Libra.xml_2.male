She showed me her holiday photos from a couple of weeks ago, and got really angry when I didn't fawn over them like they were works of art.  I should note they consisted almost entirely of her in a bikini with another guy (thankfully not in a bikini).  It was easily the most exciting break-up I've ever had.  There was shouting, swearing, door slamming, housework(?!) and even punching (although certainly not from me).  I just want to find a girl that isn't crazy and actually likes me, two things that seem to unfortunately form some kind of universal paradox.  Colin took me to see a Bon Jovi tribute band to help take my mind off things, something of an expedition considering my current state.  It was worth it though, Jon looked like a gay hairdresser and Richie was uber-cool and wore a cowboy hat.  I want to be a cowboy.
