Sigh it's kind of sad cos I really believe there's a ROCK in every one of us. Just that sometimes it takes a bit of digging to bring it out .  As a acquintance once used to say , "ROCK NEVER DEATH!!!".   Hell look at me, up to Junior College I was listening to and very much in love with Mariah Carey. Ace of Base,  Take That, that kinda stuff. My absolute fav was Mariah Carey, had all her albums till Daydream. But a friend introduced me to the acoustic sounds of Nirvana Unplugged with his guitar and I was hooked. Never looked back since then .
