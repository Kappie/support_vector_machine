People here are incredibly angry at him and they didn't want the US media to have a nice photo-op moment showing how loved Bush is in England, America's best friend.  And the march slogan was simple: "Go home Bush!"  The protest was awesome!  Over 200,000 people were there.  I think that we got the point across that Bush is not welcome here.   By the way, why on Earth would you topple down statues of Chirac and Schroeder?  For not siding with the US in an illegal invasion of a country?  Were you too busy eating Freedom Fries to realize that countries have the freedom not to side with the US when it does bad things? (On a side note, "French" fries were actually invented in Belgium.)
