A time to do bookkeeping with my parents in what i and how i spend my money in Australia and have to explain to them what have i spend on.  Opps i forgot and have to make a note of it.  At last when i come back , i found out that someone have sebar all those stories and suddenly the entire college knows about it. Haiyah...(sigh)   Just have to make it known that hey that is just one of those times...it have gone now..after all , this years  I have supressed it. Just have to focus on God's will. Anyway she is coming to cell now ...i mean other cell...she is just visiting..so can please anyone who reads this , not make deal out of it...or like when u see her, u guys are like Wow, i know her from...joshua's blog.  I mean ....now that is set aside ... we can focus on God's will and plan for us all.
