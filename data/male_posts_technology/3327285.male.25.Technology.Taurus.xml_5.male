There goes my ego, deflated and bruised.  Ah, anyway, I guess a brief introduction is in order for all those who choose to view this atrocity of a blog (is this even a word?).  My name is Josh.  I was born, raised, and probably will die in Indiana.  I live a pretty normal life.  Well, I guess that's an exaggeration.  My life is quite unique.  I am blessed with the ability to sponge up any and all useless knowledge and store it away for use at a later date.  This is especially helpful when I pop into a pub with the fellas and someone rants on and on about a particular line uttered in a movie or what kind of music a particular media icon might enjoy.  Some brandish me a know-it-all, but I like to think of it as an eccentric breadth of knowledge that they are too jealous to appreciate.  Perhaps I'll be on Jeopardy one day.  Anyway, I work for a major, international diagnostics company based here in Indiana.  I make a good living, earn good money, live in a great apartment, and have a very beautiful girlfriend.  Oh, I'm 25...just to clear that up.  Yeah, I know...I should be living in a house.  Well, that's another story for another time.  I think I have summed up the basics that will get you through these posts....oh wait, I almost forgot.  I am a rambler by heredity, so these posts will probably be pretty long-winded and bounce all over the place from topic to topic.  Dammit, I'm eccentric, get over it.  Also, I am a pretty funny guy.  Most people say things like that and really aren't, but I seriously am.  I crack myself up sometimes with the words that fall out of my mouth.  Perhaps some of that will spill over into this........then again, this is just a glorified diary...the only comedy in that is the pathetic attempt at trying to make yourself seem witty when all you really are doing is talking to yourself, pretending someone will actually read this and think, "Hmm, this guy is pretty cool, I wish I was like him."  Sigh, why do I even bother.  Perhaps I shouldn't have done this after all....curse you, insane curiosity.  Why do you torment me so?!?!?!
