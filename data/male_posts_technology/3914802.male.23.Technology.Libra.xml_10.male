I have been trying to figure out which one is better. I am not really a morning person, at all. It isn't that I am grumpy or anything, I just don't think that my brain works that well in the morning. It works okay in the afternoon, and sometimes even when I stay out late, but the morning is when I like to space out. It reminds me of in "office space" where the main character says that he comes to work and spaces out for about an hour. I kinda do that, but I just slowly read my e-mail, because nobody really ever calls in the morning. If they do it is usually because they forgot the password to login to their machine and can't do anything. You  would think that since people know they have forgotten their password before they would write it down somewhere, but I guess most people think we know their passwords or something. I try to not memorize people's passwords since I have my own to keep track of. (:-P)What was I talking about? Oh, the schedule.... We also have these new schedules that allow for one day off every two weeks if you work 9 hour days (AWS or CWS depending on the people you talk to). We aren't supposed to do this of course. My program manager asked specifically if we could, but our asshole of a government contract manager said we couldn't. S0o, we keep it on the hush. (sshhh don't tell anyone hehe)   I think it is funny because these people are gone (not with that much frequency mind you since we only have like... 6 people of which only four ppl are on the AWS/CWS) and we cannot tell anyone it is their day off.Luckily the government workers are not really suspicious or they just don't care enough to see what is happening.  At least with this week I could go out to bars if I wanted. It is hard to go out at night when you get tired at ten o clock. I like the night life baby. Who knows where this will lead me? I certainly don't know at least I will have time to work on my term paper this week. The topic? systems engineering and the system of government, in Russia. It really is interesting when I was researching it. The hard part is making it relate to systems engineering. I figure I can say that Russia's former system of government (a.k.a. communist) failed due to lack of engineering practices in its making, giving away to a systematically created democratic government. Or something like that, it is due Friday so I guess I will see how it turns out! 10 pages, wish me luck!
