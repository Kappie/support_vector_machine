Anyway, James and I are home at McLachlan St, doing what we do best; hanging out as a team, watching Bridget Jones and drinking from a sweet, sweet cask. Just spoke to the amaxing Kaia and would love to call Gede but, as James rightly pointed out, he's working hard for the money (a ha, a huh).  We love and miss you both!  And now, back to the cask!!  Love Caz and James xxxxx
