He has proven this by researching the Bible, cuz we all know a 2000 year old book has a pretty good handle on where things are going.  Now this guy predicts that on June 6th a cloud will form over the earth, and that on June 11, 21 and 24 ELE sized asteroids will strike the planet.  How the cloud relates is beyond me; I would think the cloud would form AFTER the Extinction Level Event.  Anyways he did indeed say that there would be an major sighting of an earthbound asteroid on June 3rd, and that did happen.  Of course, that happens somewhere in the world pretty much any day.    But just to be safe, I will spend the next two weeks amassing huge debt loads, tasting all the foods I've never tried, and having unprotected sex.  Cuz if the end does come, I wanna be able to say I enjoyed my last hours to the max.  Maybe I'll book a flight to Thailand and do all three in one stop.  Tomorrow it's buy buy buy. Sunday I'm going to sample heroin, just to say I did.  Monday, flip off a cop.  Tuesday steal a gangsta's sport utility.  Wednesday, the aforementioned flight to Thailand for sexual tourism, new food, and to get away from the gangsta.  Then whatever happens, I can't say I didn't experience stuff.  And hey, the heroin thing...I know I'll be able to kick when the nuclear winter hits for 3 or 4 years.  Poppies don't grow in the snow.  Seriously though, who gives these doomsayers oxygen to breathe and teaches them how to read and write?  Some poor sap is probably seriously screwed up right now due this guy's website, and how many people who went there are now gonna breathe a sigh of relief on June 25th when they wake up in their comfy old bed with a blue sky and the flowers still there?  I don't understand it; people who make claims like this are just wak; they see no future so they douse everyone they see with their gasoline of negativity and then throw a match at them.  Lit.  Maybe there should be some legislation.  Make a doomsday prediction once and be mistaken, you are forced into positive mental attitude training.  Do it twice and you go to a psychiatric hospital.  Three times and you go to jail for being an emotional vandal and just general shit disturber and menace to society.  The comedic value from these guys shouldn't be relevant in their sentencing because it would be even funnier to see them have to live a couple months with Bubba, the homosexual convict.    Well, not really...I wish no ill will on anyone.  But let's say doomsday does come this month.  Who will be the king in the new reality afterwards?  My guess it will be the best swordsman and pharmacist.  See, all the rednecks will shoot each other lots in the first days after.  And shoot others, I guess.  Eventually they'll run outta bullets, and with total destruction about it may be difficult to find a sporting goods store to buy more at.  The militia freaks will all go hide in the mountains somewhere and wait for orders.  Killing anyone who trespasses.  Eventually they'll run out of bullets too.  The common folk will be dying from things such as paper cuts and the common cold because all the little medicines and such we've used for a hundred years will be hidden; infections will abound.  Of course the hunger won't help their immune systems.    So the person who is king (or queen) will be the guy who knows how to use and maintain his sword best, and who has the foresight to rob every pharmacy he sees of any kind of infection killing drug such as penicillin and all that.  Plus aspirin for the aches and pains of formerly lazy desk and couch potatoes forced to work for their food, and other drugs while he's there.  Of course while he's robbing the pharmacy he can stock up on chips and twinkies and canned goods, so he'll have food for a long time too.  As the rednecks run out of bullets and dwindle due to attrition and the militia guys hide and await orders, this samurai pharmacist will attract a very loyal group of followers.  He can teach some of them how to battle with swords as well, and maybe even make some swords for them; i don't imagine we'll instantly forget how to make fires and forges.  Of course, he'll have the only really good sword since he was the only one with the foresight and vision to grab one.  After a few roving bands of marauders get schooled by this guy and his cold steel blade, the word will spread not to mess with him.  And as we move forward he will just naturally become king.  He will have little bands of jr. pharmacists who will go raid drug stores everywhere, supplying his people with aspirin, band-aids, chips and Gatorade.  He will have a defensive core of jr. samurais with slightly edged metal clubs who will do his bidding.  And eventually he can order the militia guys to come out of the mountains and join his little commune.  Of course shortly after that total chaos will break out as militia men are notoriously bad and dealing with undisciplined behavior, and of course there will be lots of that.  Also, the militia colonel will think HE deserves to be king, so the Samurai Pharmacist will have to lay down the law, probably in battle.  He'll win, of course, cuz he's been working on his swordsmanship since the meteor's hit.     Well, enough for tonite...got to go research swords now.
