Of course, they were trying to blame it on my hardware not theirs.  Other than that, another day gone and a new one starting...  I can't wait for this work week to be over because I am going on vacation next weekend.  That means after Tuesday, I have 5 days off! Woohoo!  I'll be heading over to Louisville, Ky for family day at Ft. Knox.  Should be fun.  The whole trip cost me around $450 for round trip tickets, A 3 day hotel stay, and a car rental.  Not bad if you ask me.  I got all this through  urlLink www.hotwire.com .  They were the cheapest I could find out of the multitude of websites that offer their services.  Blog at ya'll later...
