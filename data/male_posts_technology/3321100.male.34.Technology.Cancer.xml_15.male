It's so exciting lol So Saturday, we tried to made Muffins, we tried many different recipe with cinnamon, chocolate , maple syrup, honey, banana, etc... 12 muffins for the morning. We spent all the afternoon in town for shopping, and on evening, we tried another recipe for muffins. 24 muffins more. We made a BBQ the evening, we watched a great film (The schindler list) with tea and muffins of course. Sunday Morning, I had tried a new fabulous muffins recipe found on the internet. We made only 12 muffins this time. I ridded my trial motorcycle the morning, we had make a BBQ again (with a nice Tsatsiky sauce) with my wife's family. We worked on the garden the afternoon, and I play a little to game computer (dungeon siege) before the evening BBQ. We had took tea with muffins watching Soccer on TV French / England, shouting against English who doesn't really play soccer (Ouppsss) and shouting more when France win in the 3 last minutes of the match (Yesssssssssss). Sorry for English people I really love :D.  I forget to explain that we have made love many times (perhaps coz the 17 th birthday), but I'll give more explanation in an another post (mdrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr ) So it's a great week-end, this evening, I'm sure we'll try a new recipe. Does someone like muffins ??? PS: Its the real pics of our muffins. Nice isn't it ?
