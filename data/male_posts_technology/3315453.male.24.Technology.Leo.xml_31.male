The show started at 7:30pm, so we got the bus schedule to get there.  As the bus was turning on to the free-way we noticed the traffic was completely stopped.  By the time we got downtown we had missed the movie.  We were bummed, but decided to go see something else, however nothing good was playing or worth paying $20 for.  We decided to try and see Harry Potter yesterday. Well we made it down there, even with bad traffic, but they were sold out.  We were determined to see this movie so I bought tickets for today yesterday and now we just have to make it there in time.  We are leaving a couple hours early just to be sure.  Anyways I am not sure if we were meant to see this movie or not, but we are going to do everything we can to see it and it better be worth it.
