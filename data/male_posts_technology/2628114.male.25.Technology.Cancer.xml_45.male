We probably ran about 4-5 miles down Clifton from the Brick House, down through the gaslight district and right by Mt. Storm.  It was muggy, a little warm, and my dang knees still have not recovered fully.  My body warmed up and stretched out over the first mile and we were done with two before I even knew what happened.  I didn't notice my knees really at all until we had turned around on our out-and-back.  As we climbed the Clifton hill, I could really begin to feel an ache in both knees both on and around my kneecaps.  I hope this is still just remnants of the marathon and not the sign of an injury onset that will put me down for any more time.
