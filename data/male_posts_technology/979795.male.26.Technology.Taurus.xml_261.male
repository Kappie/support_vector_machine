We're discussing about what we can do to help out with the money situation at home now. Very vexing. Even worse, my dad likes to lament on the fact that I extended 1 extra year of study for my degree, over expenditure in Norway, etc. Nothing I can do about it now but he seems to enjoy the finger pointing exercise from this. Sianz ...  Looks like I'll need to be doing some parttime job soon. Probably gonna do some waitering at a cafe or tuition. May need to inform Sensei that I seriously can't afford to pay him for Aikido anytime soon. He was kind enough to say that he's ok with waivering the fees for students who can't afford it. All I need to do was help him out in the dojo and maybe some demonstrations here and there.  Lotsa shitz to handle. Need to try and send out more resumes now. Oh man ... so much woes as a fresh graduate. I just hope I can enter the Police Force soon. Or at the very least get some kind of confirmation. If I don't, might just have to settle for a boring IT job for money's sake. Also, seems like my Dad not very supportive of the idea that I'm going into the uniform service. He is OK with the govt sector as long as it's non-uniformed. I dunno leh, that's exactly what I'm working towards. But will need to be very sure before I decide.
