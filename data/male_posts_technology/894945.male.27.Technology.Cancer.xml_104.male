Some of the fellas were in kilts, I can't wait to wear mine at Dan's wedding. I hope I get one of those little commando knives to tuck into my sock.  Check out this cool  urlLink wireframe skeleton man  i've been playing with.  Some interesting people read this site. I've had hits from sites in the US Military, Hungary, Mexico.. and a special hello to the person on a Apple Mac in Belgium that reads the site every day :)
