I was asked by her husband Pat to write a song for the occasion--nothing profound, mind you, just a fun novelty ditty.  Well, I did and it went quite well.  I've heard that the Kitty, the birthday girl, played that portion of the video many times and sang along.  Now, fast forward to about a month ago.  She wants me to return the "favor" to her husband on his 50th.  I've been so consumed with re-financing and pool installation and a particularly busy time at work that I've done nothing for the Pat's song.  Kitty came by last night to brainstorm some ideas and work out some of the event scheduling (oh, I'm emcee-ing this shindig as well).  I've got a draft of the first stanza so far and the party is tomorrow evening.  I'd better get pretty damn creative pretty damn soon.
