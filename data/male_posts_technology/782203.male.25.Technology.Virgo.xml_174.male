When we finished talking I remembered that i was having a dream but as hard as I tried I couldnt recall it. Just know that there was a lot of people in it.  *Burp*   Just came back from lunch from my malay neighbour's wedding at the void deck of my block. We had briyani , satay , fried chicken and red bean soup for dessert. The food was great and I am full as hell. Think I am gonna take a short nap now.  Stuff to do today:  1. Email 2 friends. 2. Send the two letters to Mindef which i got way back in Jan. 3. Email superior with report.
