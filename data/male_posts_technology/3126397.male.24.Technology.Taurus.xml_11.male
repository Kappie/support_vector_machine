The malicious program then pops up porn adds etc every few minutes.  I thought I'd been hearing an awful lot about spyware being installed lately, but good grief!  Could Microsoft open the gates any wider?  To make matters worse,  urlLink apparently 80% of spam  comes from infected Microsoft Windows PC's!  Once again, I beg all literate self respecting computer users to PLEASE use  urlLink Mozilla Firefox  for web browsing and  urlLink Mozilla Thunderbird  for email.  If not for their own sakes, then for the good of humanity.  It is probably also a good idea to keep a copy of  urlLink Adaware  handy, or at least sanitize your computer with it if you have ever used Internet Explorer  In other news....  The bards are still dreaming up songs about Reagan despite the fact that he  urlLink doesn't really deserve much credit for ending the Cold War , increased the deficite to never before seen highs,  urlLink sold arms to know terrorists , etc....  Here is a  urlLink book  about him by a *local* author.   urlLink Cowboys may someday be replaced by wi-fi , so could I be a wi-fi-cowboy?  Would I have to wear the boots?  Meanwhile... the Bush administration  urlLink apparently   urlLink favors   urlLink torture , and are trying to use  urlLink legal manuvers  to get around The Geneva accords against torture (formed because of Hitler I believe).  NPR has a 52 page  urlLink leaked memo  on the subject as well as an  urlLink interview .  What ever happened to "what goes around comes around"?  Maybe they are trying to incentify our soldiers to fight to the death since they know they have no right to except humane treatment if captured.  Despite party affiliations, Senator Craig (from here in Idaho) is quoted as saying something intelligent.. "I hope that in the end, Saddam Hussein will not have taken away from us something that our Constitution, in large part, granted us, and that we have it taken away in the name of safety and security."  Maybe I will have to re-think my opinion of him.  Saddam has become a more potent "terrorist" in defeat than he ever was while in power, even when he was our  urlLink friend .  Of course he was never actually involved in the 9/11 thing at all, so mostly this is the Bush administration jockying for power.
