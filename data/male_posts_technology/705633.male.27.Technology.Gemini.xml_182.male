I was getting out of bed and I didn't notice a spring from the matress had broken and was sticking out of the bed. I slid out and now have a 'rainbow' style red motif across both my ass cheeks. Och. Good job I don't have a digital camera at the moment or i'd stick a picture up on here, and ruin your lunch.  Custard and Baity are off parachute jumping this weekend in Poole. I wouldn't be surpised if Custard packed an anvil into Baity's backpack instead of a 'chute. That'd be kinda funny.  All you Hotmail users, listen up.. I'm fed up of hearing my friends moan about getting nothing but "Enlarge your penis now" mails. Do something about it. Sack Hotmail off, go over to  http://www.netaddress.com  and sign up for a account there. It's only about $20 a year and you never get ANY shite in it. Also be senisble where you give out your address. If you think the place your giving it to my pass it onto others and give you penis-enlarging info or Japanese schoolgirl pr0n, use  Sneakemail . They create an alias for your real address, when your alias starts getting spam, delete it then create another one.
