One of my programming projects (the Library book management program) will require some research, so I will see if I can contact someone at the library that can give me some information.  The big step, however, is in getting started on my first history paper.  I need to do a 4 page paper on creation myths, and I did my first rough draft today.  I put down some thoughts on what I will say, but it needs a lot of elaboration.  And then with a little polishing, it should be ready to submit by the end of the week.  The odd thing is, I feel guilty.  It feels as if I am avoiding working on the novel.  I am at a point in chapter one, where I will need to start writing dialog.  This, of course, scares me, so it is natural that I will tend to put it off.  However, school work DOES have priority over other projects.  OK!  So, if I can get the paper done by Thursday, that should give me some time to work on the novel.
