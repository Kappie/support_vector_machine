Here the brake down:  Friday: Mad as hell and want to use one for the cranes across the way to pick Heavy Objects and drop them on the Office. Leave the office and head with Rick to Gambl0rs Caf√© for some much needed shooting fun in the form of my new love FAR CRY. So from about 7:30 to 11:00 I shoot the SHIT out of every living thing that could not out number me. Drove a Buggy like a lost maniac and generally enjoyed the much killing and maiming. The Bubs took the driving seat as he said for "only for five minuets".. Nerves on high alert and itchy trigger finger aside saw Bubs AHUM! Five minuets turn in to almost two hours. Rick nearly having kittens in anticipation of his go and Bub steps down. He replaces the mouse and keyboard for Paint and roller and tried to get me to help... HA! Well after much yakking on about the issues of whatever. Where drawn attention by Rick for some amazing screen shots of two guys he kill which could be only described as the vertical Missionary position.. He's a sick man???? I kid! So four phone booths down and much screams and shout of frustration from Rick and the Game I pack it in and headed home. One killer of a head ache from playing the game (god I'm getting old).  Saturday: Nice and relaxing day. Fart around the house. Watch Sings on DVD and once marvel at my TV. IT'S big... It's a Guy thing. AND NO IT'S NOT TO COMPENSATE FOR FAILURE IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS. Ah fuck it what do I care.. I got a big TV screw you!! Ok off the beating track, eh! as usual.. So head to the GYM around about 4 ish and have a good work out. Get out the about 6:45 and then just remember I have to be in town to meet D for dinner after her work. Ho god the rush. Fly down the road, fly in the door, drop the GYM bag. Much spraying for Deoderant, fresh top and out the door to Town. Well it's all good D is stuck in the store still locking up for half hour so I get away looking the tardy one he he. Down in Judge Roy Beans for some chow and here the Piece of SHIT euro song. Man we didn't even deserve 7 points. Off back to D's and of course She is asleep in Five minuets.    Sunday: More relaxing but with a difference... It feels like a REAL Summer WAHOO. Over in D's for some drinking and frolicking in the sun. Nice way to wind down the weekend. Oh one thing... For anyone who has heard the sound of a Fox Screaming you can appreciate this one. I think it was 3 O'clock on the morning and I get the living shit scared out of me when no more than three of the little fuckers start shouting into the nigh. Could not get back to sleep for ages  So here I am Monday morning tired with enough luggage under my eyes for J,Lo to go away for a MOUNT! Life is good! No really it is... Just can't figure out why???
