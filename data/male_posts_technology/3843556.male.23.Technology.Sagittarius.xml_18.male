Pups,kosu,bonda,goat and stan are a few to list. The early days of my childhood were in Madras. I then spent a good ten years of my life in Yercaud. I call it the place of dreams. After which I moved back to Madras to pursue my Bachelors in Engineering. Spent four memorable years there before moving to Boston for my graduate studies. I would hence divide my life thus far into four. My roots trace back to small villages in Kerala. My father grew up in Kalpathi, a small town in Pallakad. My mother was born in Madras as my grandparents had moved to there from Mookuthala in Kerala. I have visited Mookuthala a few times but never been to Kalpathi. My life would be incomplete if I failed to. My father's side of the family has produced legends in carnatic music. Pallakad Mani Iyer, Pattamal and Nithyashree are a few to name.   I am the only child to my parents. Don't mistake that for me being a spoilt brat. My family and friends mean the world to me. I can get very defensive if they are harmed in anyway. I am passionate about what I do. There is a romantic side to me and I dream a lot. I love nature and until date regret for not pursuing my dream of becoming a bio-technologist. Well, that does not in any way mean that I don't like the career I have chosen. Sports has been a big part of my life. Played soccer and table tennis during my younger days and I still do find time to play them time to time. I was not the best in either of them but was good in my own right. I am a die hard fan of Barcelona FC. Watching them play at the Nou Camp would realize one of my long lasting dreams. My choice in music covers a wide range. I will close this post for now. More of me would come in the days to follow.
