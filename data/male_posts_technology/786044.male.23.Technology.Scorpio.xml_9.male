Without webcams eyes exercise extrasensory perceptions except when dissention among the stars leaves half the world in the dark.  And maybe it was the plan for "I don't see it" to mean I don't understand. Cause I don't see the money, honey, but I know they're putting a check for 5 grand in your hot little hand.  And it's no coincidence that the instant I switched this side of my brain on the strain on my eyes increased leading me towards sleep.
