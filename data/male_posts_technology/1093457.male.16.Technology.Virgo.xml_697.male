But anyway, it's really funny watching all theboys who get completely trashed then dance around madly to Electric Six and Led Zepplin. Extremely funny. I left about 11pm, but everybody else 'crashed' on the floor at Bennett's house over night, havign done a midnight raid on Tesco's with  "a spot of bush jumping", as Paul so delightfully put it. Anywho. Today I've been to Caterham and the library and stuff, got a supply of alchohol for Thursday (good or bad!), and got this wicked album out the library: "Ether Song" by Turin' Brakes, it's great! Also just discovering The Thrills and The Vines, they're pretty good tooooooooo! Thursday is drawing ever closer, trying to fill up my time to forget about it! I think I might take a trip into crodyon tomorrow to go to Beano's and get some more music, wander a bit, then I'm going to the cinema in the evening with Paul to see 'Pirates of the Carribean'. Yay! Tonight I am going out to a friend's house for a catch up, so no thinking about GCSEs! yay! Hmmmmmm! Just heard that Andy's party is hawaiin themed, so better go think about that one! ttyl guys!
