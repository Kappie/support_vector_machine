Each particle can store a bit of information and together they can be packed onto a disk drive at much greater density than is possible using existing hard disk manufacturing methods.   Interesting!... very interesting! We'll soon see the day when we go to out local chemist's shop with two prescriptions... one for your flu and one for your computer's memory! ;-)
