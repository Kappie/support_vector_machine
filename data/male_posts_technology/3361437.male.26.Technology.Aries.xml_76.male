Warfighting Laboratory, have developed a    small, throwable, remote-controlled prototype robot      designed for surveillance in urban settings, several of which are being sent to Iraq for testing. The robot, known as Dragon Runner, has the ability to see around corners and deliver information to Marines while keeping them out of danger in urban settings where human access is impractical, dangerous or unsustainable.  And of course to look for Sarah Connor (Terminator, just in case you didn't get the link).       Don't let my manager know about these... She will have one following me around the office...
