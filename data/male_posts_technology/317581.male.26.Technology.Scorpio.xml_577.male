I can't figure any man that is threatened by a woman who thinks for herself?!?! Why would you want that? I don't understand wanting to mind fuck someone or just not be challenged when you're making a dumbass move. Why would you not want to consistently improve yourself?  Anyway, I think I need to go catch up on some sleep. (Work: 10 hours today, 9 hours tomorrow)  Goodnight- T
