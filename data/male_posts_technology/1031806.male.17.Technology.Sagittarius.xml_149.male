I got up late, and found the address for the DMV on the way there... (lol), waited in lines for a while and finally got assigned an examiner. You know how they always tell you not to engage in small talk with the examiner while taking the test... it’ll only distract you? Apparently “they” weren’t thinking of me and my instructor. We were chatting the entire time... Topics ranged from to the weather, our jobs, buildings being demolished on the side of the road, and even random rodents running across the road at odd times (in the middle of a city...¿). LOL. After that I went back inside, waited in more lines and finally took the test on the computer, got my picture taken and received my license.   I drove back home, got stuff for work and headed over to work, arriving at 11:15 (I usually get there at 8:00). I worked for an hour, talked on the phone with Gwen’s mom for another hour while programming PIC chips and starting my lunch break (lol), took another half hour for the rest of my lunch break, and got back to work. Stuff was going smoothly until a technical rescue vehicle, followed by an ambulance pulled into view. (As my other posts say, it turned out that my boss’s wife has a major insulin reaction. He blood sugar level was 239ish around lunch, and dropped to 29 in three hours. Anyway, they gave her an IV and she was fully conscious within a few minutes.  I got off work at 5:00, went home, chatted on IRC chat.christianlinks.com #youthfire for an hour or so, ate dinner, and headed over to Mid-Week. (I was going to drive over to Cam’s house, but I thought Steven might need a ride back from Mid-Week, so I had my dad take me there and back – I can’t drive anyone under 20, outside of my family for 6 months, with Oregon driving rules). The funny thing is, Steven and I didn’t even end up seeing each other and didn’t know the other was even there until we talked about it later on the same chat room listed above.  Then, at 9:22, Gwen called! (lol) I was beginning to suspect I’d have to wait for her to get back to talk to her next, but no, she was sweet and called again :)  My dad and I ate at Carl’s Jr., and he told me about a walk he’d had with my mom earlier. That’s cool – ‘twas the first time they’ve done that in... a long while.  Oh, btw, I’m gonna have to leave youth group really early tomorrow night, since I have to get up at 4 the nest morning. (Lori’s coming over at 6, and we need to be checked into the ASE Mid-Summer Conference by 8:30 in Corvallis). My mom’s prolly going to end up spending the night down there, since it’s easier to do that than to some back up then go back down and back up again on Sat.   Well, see yah all on the flipside (and I fear for  urlLink Ddee  and her platinum hair.... *shudders* - lol)
