I find I would like to stay in the same field and in fact feel rejuvenated. I like working with computers.  I also know that loyalty to a work place is an illusion so this time around I will look out for myself. I can even have fun doing it because I don't feel the need to advance at all costs.  I can see now that I let others push me into things I didn't want to do. Why go into management if you don't care if the company lives or dies? Right?  I will pursue my own interests and see where they take me. Let everyone else flail around in misery. I want to live laugh and love.  Who cares who's president or if there's a war on I can't change it so I'm not going to worry about it. This country deserves a 911 attack every week. If they want it let them have it I can't change it so I'll keep my head down. Enjoy, I'll be making a pesto pizza!  Hey now! This is liberating, I like it man. A second adulthood on my own terms.
