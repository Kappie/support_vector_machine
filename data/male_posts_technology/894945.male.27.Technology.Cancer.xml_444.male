Joy.  I can't believe the amount of 'friendly fire' deaths in Iraq. The first few days, the coalition lost one Sikorsky, two Sea Kings, a Tornado and some nutcase throws a grenade into the command tent. Talk about fuck-up. Given long enough, I think the allies would probably blow themselves up and Saddam won't have to do a thing.     Here's some Friday morning chuckles for other disgruntled office workers...
