Nice and boring. My younger sister is havoing me run her and her friends all around town. Its crazy! Wow in writing this post i realized that these are boin. I might have to step things up a notch. maybe post a short story or something else stupiddly entertaining. But hey ya know, whatever. Or maybe i could i am super depressed and talk about killing my self in here. that would be a fun thing. not that i would ever do that. i could leave my email with the message asking for help and see if anyone trys to help. That would be fun. But then i would feel bad for the nice person who wanted to help. And i would go off in a depressed manner and kill my hamster. but then the realization that i dont have a hamster hit me and i woould become more and more depressd pushing me to the limit, over the edge, so then i would be forced to start taking all kinds of thing that just further depress poeple. At this piont i would be so depressed that if you were to put the sun inside me, its light would not show. Now that i think about, i probably should not write a post about killing because i dont want to be that depressed. Thas it. see ya later. i am gunna go kill myself.
