Now bottled by the Coca Cola company, it still remains my favorite cola to this day. Last year, I was delighted to discover that it was available in Indian stores across the US, sold in the same, questionable-looking, recycled glass bottles that I have grown to love over the years.   I must point out that Thums Up, unfortunately, has enjoyed very little success with my non-Indian friends, with reactions ranging from " umm ... interesting " to ..  "..it has this, rancid, cola-that's-been-sitting-in-a-damp-room-for-a-while taste ". Too bad. They'll never enjoy the pleasures of a hot samosa and a chilled Thums Up ...  A few days ago, as I finished off another bottle of this fine cola at an Indian restaurant, I noticed that it was one of those rare bottles that carried a  Nutritional Information  sticker on it. (Nutritional information is non-existent on Indian food labels, or at least was a few years ago...). " 375 calories " it said. "Wow", I thought to myself, "I clearly remember seeing a similar sticker on a Thums Up bottle not too long ago, but one which claimed that it only contained 50-odd calories, and I KNOW that there ain't no such thing as a Diet Thums Up...".  So when I stopped by a  New India Bazaar  the next day, I made sure I picked up a bottle with a nutritional info sticker on it. And sure enough, " 57 calories " it proclaimed !!  Here are the conflicting labels. I have no idea what to make of them. A 318 calorie difference is quite puzzling..   urlLink    urlLink    If I have to justify consuming a couple of these every day, I think I'll be forced to go with the 57-calorie figure.   * shrug * .. * gulp * ... * ahhhh ...* ..
