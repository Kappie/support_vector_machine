"The Friendly" is the place to hang out in  urlLink Zionsville  home of Jim Russell and the Russell family.  I headed up to Indy with K$ and lil' Beth.  The next morning we went to the  urlLink Indianapolis Race for the Cure .  Carol's mom is a breast cancer survivor and has a team run every year.  The race was early and a 5K.  I was able to  urlLink run a mile  and then walked the rest.     I am in no way close to being in shape, but it was fun and I finished 4075th.  Not bad out of 35,000 people.
