I paid too much for it, and it needed repairs before it was road-ready.  I kick myself for not looking at that other guy's toyota.  Anyway, I was at the dealership over the weekend, and the salesman gave me a "fuck you" price of $200 for the trade-in.  I told him in that case I wouldn't be trading it in.    I then talked to another guy today who said that well, the first guy didn't really give it an appraisal, so it wasn't really accurate.  I told him Kelly Blue Book said $1300 trade-in value, and he said "we'll see".  I think I'll hold onto it.  I saw the 94 tercel advertised for sale in the neighborhood of $2k, so I think it's worth it to sell it privately.  Or maybe just hold onto it for whenever I need a spare car or if my parents come to visit.  It's worth more than I thought it was, and maybe I'll sell it after the divorce so I can keep the money.    I also test drove a mazda3 (5 door), and I thought about the new 2005 Ford Focus (5 door).  See, I got kids and it's a lot easier loading and unloading them for a 4 door car than a 2 door car (Tercel).  And the hatchback is good for hauling gear.  Someday I'll really go on a camping trip.  The Mazda was a little more expensive but peppier.  The focus has an mp3 player option, better financing options, and is a little less expensive than the matrix.  But I'm reluctant to buy American - Japanese just seems more reliable to me.  Anyhow the ford dealership doesn't seem to have the five door in stock, and I'm tired of waiting and shopping and second-guessing.  I want to buy now.
