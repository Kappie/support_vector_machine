You probably think life sucks for me when I'm not with my family, but it's still pretty good. I just learned how to appreciate being around caring, loving people. But still, it's sometimes good to be alone and just watch DVDs or play video games without anyone bothering you!  I don't have much of a DVD collection, but I do treasure it, especially my South Park seasons! I'm a huge fan of South Park, and when I talk about it, I laugh at myself because I sound like a total nerd! For example, my girlfriend showed me a background of Cartman sitting in a chair, and I immediatly said something like " Oh yeah, that's from an episode in the sixth season when the kids were having a contest to see who would take Kenny's place after he died. " After I said that, I just stood there and thought about what I just said and I just started laughing so hard at myself. I'm a master of poking fun at myself. I'll usually go out of my way to make people laugh at my expense. Just ask my high school classmates. Pretty good period in my life, even though I failed miserably in one class for not going... Another story for another time!  I must sleep, for tomorrow I have to go get my cap and gown for next week's graduation! I'll post pictures of that later in the week. Just in case you didn't notice, I set up a  urlLink moblog  (Web log of pictures) that hopefully I'll fill with pictures this next week. I'll see if I can fit pictures from my apartment, my room, my workplace, and just about any other places I find interesting. That'll let some people come into my world, and see some pictures of probably one of the most beautiful places on Earth, Puerto Rico! It's probably not much, but I love my little island :)  I would really like people to read this, and also that they enjoy it, because I don't want to think I'm wasting my time writing for only myself! In any case, it's good just to vent out your frustrations or express your happiness out to the world, even if it's sometimes. I've been posting a lot lately, and I hope to post at least once a day to keep this active. Once I get Internet at my apartment, I'll really be posting a lot of stuff! So good night everyone, and for those of you in other time zones, good morning / afternoon / evening! Have a fine day tomorrow!
