It has been a long day and I need to go to bed.  My wife and daughter were in bed long ago (lucky them).    Well, I am a Network Engineer with a large Insurance company in Portland, Oregon.  I love what I do and where I live.  We have a nice house 10 minutes out of Portland and both my wife and I love it.    Work is busy.  Many, many projects.  One of the major ones is a conversion of our firewall from a Solaris "software" firewall to a PIX "hardware" firewall.  The rules set on the PIX is up to 600 lines long.  Believe me, that is a BIG config by any standards.  It looks good though and should be a pretty painless cutover.  In future blogs I will cover other projects I am working on.  On the home front we have been spending our first two years in this house whipping it back into shape.  Not there yet ;-).  Spent a hour and a half mowing the lawn today.  It got rather long do to the rain and filled up the bag on the mower a number of times.  I have also planted grass in "no-mans" land and spend a great deal of time carefully cutting it.    Hmm... Probably not the best first post, but it will do. I am sure my writing will become more fluid and conversational after a while.  For now then, I'll see ya'.
