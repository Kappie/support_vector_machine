I had called her house a couple times before 10:00 or so, but it was busy so I got online and she got on around 11:30. I asked if she would mind calling me when she got off, and she did later. We talked for a total of almost an hour (she called twice) and in that time I basically explained to her how I'd been feeling all this time and everything (mainly that I am in love with her) and that seemed to take her by shock. As far as calling her, she doesn't want me to stop, but maybe do it slightly less frequently. Oh, btw, I did inform her that I was perfectly content with being 'just friends' and she seemed relieved by that. I want her to be happy, and she is, so I am too. :)  The same night my friend Danie (short for Danielle, not Daniel) introduced me to a couple of her friends named Becky and Mandy. (... well more like they started talking under the false pretence of being her - lol). That Becky’s the one that confused SS’s Becky with her comment on the message board (lol).  I'm under some level of stress concerning a huge presentation I have to have to give on Sat. for my apprenticeship. Please be parying that I'll get everything done well and on time. Oh, btw, I very much doubt that I'll be online much, much less blog between now and then. And... I'm gonna be gone all of next week, so don't expect to see me online for a while. Ddee, I will be back before the 30th, but most likely I'm already attending a key signing party at Mikminamen's on the waterfront. Linus Torvald (however you spell his last name) might be there! I'm excited. :) :)
