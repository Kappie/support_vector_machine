Kerry was questioned this morning after reporting that he had driven his car off the Chappaquiddick Island bridge the previous night.    The body of Mary Jo Karpinski was found in the back seat of the vehicle by divers called to the scene.  Although in Massachusetts, a manslaughter charge is always given when someone leaves the scene of a deadly accident, John F. Kerry said that there is precedence for notable public figures and their families to receive little or no punishment in cases like this.  "I attempted to open the door and window of the car but I have no recollection of how I got out of the car. I came to the surface and repeatedly dove down to see if the passenger was still in it. I was unsuccessful in the attempt. I was exhausted and in a state of shock and I recall that I was able to get back to some friends who had a car parked in front of the cottage. I asked someone to bring me back to Edgartown. I remember walking around for a period of time and when I suddenly realized what happened, I immediately called the police," the younger Kerry said.  Kerry had been driving back from a party on Chappaquiddick, with the young, attractive Karpinski. Kerry's wife was home with their children and had not attended the party.
