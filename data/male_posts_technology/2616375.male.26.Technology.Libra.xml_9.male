Though Yahoo has made public announcements on the 100 MB space my yahoo account is still the old 6 MB. Yahoo plans to implement the 100 MB space only in the summer!  Here are some of the interesting things that I thought make sense:  1. On  urlLink CNET.com  I read an article that said - GMail will be reading all the email that flows in and out of the GMail mailboxes. On further investigation from the GMail help pages, here is what I gathered - "No humans will read the content of your email in order to target such advertisements or related information."  This is talking about a technology called Ad-Sense that makes it possible for advertisers to target specific email campaigns based on the text of emails that a person sends or receives. Also, through the magic of "Family-Safe" ads, only safe ads will be sent out to the consumers. Ad-Sense and Family Sense technologies being a Black Box, I really don't know what is happening inside. I personally don't have a problem with machines reading my email till I am not spammed against my wishes. The privacy policies of GMail seem good and promise not to sell any PII.  2. "Privacy International" is going after the GMail. Looks like GMail is now BIG enough to warrant attention and law suits :) After all, it is only big fish that yields meat... California State Senator  urlLink http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3339451">Liz Figueroa  author of "Do-Not-Call legislation" is also  in fray to "warn" people of the dangers of GMail. My concern is that lawyers force technology companies to become more of a lawyer firm than a technology firm that it started with. Google might one day find a law suit so big on their chest that it will decide to throw out the "rotten apple" from its basket.  3. Till today, no email service has proved to be economically justifiable. Hotmail, Yahoo or any other.. Email is something that is retained to keep the consumers coming to their e-commerce portals even if the company is loosing money in hoards... So the rule should be, lesser the space, lower the losses. IF GMail is to sustain the 1 GB limit, I really think that they have to come up with something more justifiable, something that looks like a business model...  4. Is GMail a pre-IPO gimmick to get people excited on google? Given that GMail is tom-tomming about the BETA aspect, when it goes lives the promised space would be missing due to "sustainability" issues.  5. MOST IMPORTANTLY, what happens to my other email accounts that all my friends and family know? It is unlike the Cell Phone no. that can remain constant even when one switches operators...  If I get a GMail account today (till the IPO is hugely over subscribed and Google gets the money), my friends might find a return mail in their mailboxes if they write to me @gmail.com post the IPO.  The two features that I find cool about GMail: - Google search to look up information in my mailbox. Currently, there is NO better search technology than Google. It remains to be seen though how dedicated that technology will be to the GMail mailboxes. - Preview feature of GMail that is not available in Web Based emails. Though, my favourite MS Office Outlook does give me that feature!!!  The fact remains that GMail AMAZES me.... both from the mind blogging space if offers and the business model they are going after (that might be a trade secret)...  Till the dust settles... I am not swimming with the sharks....  P.S.: I am making this post using the new email based blogging support recently introduced.
