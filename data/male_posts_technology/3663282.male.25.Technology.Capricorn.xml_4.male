I first learned about him from my brother. The first time I read his book, I was enthralled by it. I don't think I can explain the atmosphere of the book. It's just so surreal. I'm not sure I can explain it so that you can understand the intensity of what I've just said. You have to read it to understand what I mean. I like the book so much, I just bought a copy of it for myself. Before this, I would read my brother's copy over and over again. I intend to collect Haruki Murakami's entire collection. A book at a time.  "Dance dance dance continues the extraordinary adventure of an ordinary man. At thirty something, Murakami's nameless hero lives in a hi-tech, high-rise world where old virtues die fast and success is all that matters. He has shared in the glittering city's spoils, and while he has not sold his soul, he knows that something is lacking in his life.        Now, in dreams, a mysterious woman weeps softly - for him. Yet, even as he tries to understand why, the voice that beckons is not hers. And still he dreams. Bizarre dreams that propel him down byways of his life in search of ... ?    His is a strange odyssey: en route, a thirteen-year-old girl, distressingly beautiful and clairvoyant, is his constant companion; a classmate, now oozing charm on TV soaps, grapples with murder; a lady of the night becomes his guardian angel; and an eccentric Sheep Man materializes to counsel and cajole. What's a fellow to do? Dance. You gotta dance as long as the music plays. And dance is what our hero does ... in the most unexpected ways!"
