I think we should also be wary of publishing any information that is internal to a company. Azim's letter is purely internal and confidential.  There is not much progress in my job hunting process..have too many restrictions in terms of location and commutation. Adding to it is the winter weather and peak christmas season. Everyone busy in shopping and fetching gifts for their loved ones.   I am just gearing up for the long weekend. Xavier do you give any christmas gifts?    Hey Ram and Rini....congrats...mariyadaiya nan India varrappa treat vattiyoda kuduthudunga!
