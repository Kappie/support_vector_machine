It was a lovely meal with lovely people. :)  Once again, I want to thank all of you for welcoming me so warmly into your circle of friends...I am honored that those of whom Johnathan speaks so highly should be so gracious to me...  And no, I'm not just kissing ass. :)  Seriously, you guys rule.  And now I have stupid ol' poopid homework to do. Chow.
