Not sure if I can do the race distance (440 yrds) unaided and without stopping yet. Using the pull buoy, I have no problem. Oddly, using the pull buoy feels a lot like swimming with a wet suit on which I will be doing in the race. It seems strange that a sport known for being so athletically challenging would allow wet suits to begin with. Don't get me wrong, I'm real happy with the way things are. ;-)   I'm gonna ask Martin if we can add more distance using the pull buoy. Makes me feel macho doing lap after lap after lap without stopping.   Hey, Martin! Get well! I need you at the pool.
