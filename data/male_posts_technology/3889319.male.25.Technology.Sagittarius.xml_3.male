An ease to use device, compact , and more precise than the old tool!   Wondering what does it have to do with me? Why am i shocked? Well.. I thought of the idea some time ago.. I was wondering back then what device could a person invent and gain serious amount of money out of it? And i got the same idea.. What did i do with it?  Nothing!  Asking why?   Well.. I would have jumped on the idea right way.. But.. There is a  BIG BUT  here, meaning, what if the is not 100% straight vertical? This would cause a calculation error. What if a person wants to calculate a flat surface, a 2X2 table for instance?   Anyway, I think that if i can come up with such ideas i can, eventually, fix it's defects.
