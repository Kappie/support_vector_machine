II Peter 2 4For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell,[1] putting them into gloomy dungeons to be held for judgment;  5if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others;  6if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly;  7and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men  8(for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)--  9if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue godly men from trials and to hold the unrighteous for the day of judgment, while continuing their punishment.  If God can rescue the righteous, out of a culture that is dark, if God has a distinct purpose in the people of light being in a specific place for a specific time for a specific reason, if God can hold the unrighteous... this really spoke to me about attitude, perspective, intentionality in all facets of where God has uniquely and divinely placed us.
