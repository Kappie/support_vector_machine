BCT Products, EastTech. BCT Products, EastTech. BCT Products, EastTech. ArgHHH!!! as if i had not enough things to do again!! his dad tells me that he's leaving for HK tml morning. arghh why does he always have to leave for this and that.  everytime he leaves, i've gota do so much more! jus entertaining his customers are enough to kill me, not to mention that all those ppl dun speak my kind of english. *sighs*  sometimes i wonder if i'm working for money or is there other reasons pushing me forward. yahh.. i wanna buy over hp, make hp fall, but what the fuck man. it's impossible. dun be stupid. hp can jus crush me anytime. maybe hp don't even know i exist! and most prob, they dun!  his dad keeps pushing me to his company. ask me to take over from him with his son, my 11yrs of good buddy. it's true and i understand that he want me to do well as his company  is at least a world wide company and i will do better there.. yet he wants me to give up EastTech.  but EastTech is my baby. i've seen it grow, i even remember when i first started with me drawing a pathetic $500bucks! to what i am now. give it up now? Hell NO!  but hmm... he's still the boss. even though i'm running the company with my friend, we still take direct orders from him i guess. that's one big fat mistake when he offered to invest 90% of capital in the company and i agreeded.. cun blame myself tho.. i'm not filty rich and i can only slog my guts out. i needed that capital to back me up. there's no one to blame, his dad was the one who made me what i am today. but he jus don't understand how much i've put in to EastTech. EastTech, BCT.. he says if i want to make it big, i'll have to give up one. either i move to his company and walk on the solid carpeted floorings or i stay with EastTech and slog my guts out.  sometimes i wonder.. is money really so important? can't ppl live happily without money? honestly i dont' like money. the reason why i earn money is because i want to prove that i can do what i wan and do it well.. sounds stupid and lame eh? i guess that's me.  for now.. i check my pda again.. tml is a busy day. and i guess i'll have to decide where to go in a few wks time.  i wish i can ask someone what to do, where to go. but i cun. life..  always so full of choices..  if for once i can choose what i want to be, i'll opt to be living in those village days. my 3years in my kampong village with my parents left a vague impression. but i remembered it was sweet. there's this picture always flashing across my head, where me a a lot of kids would go to this van, that uncle i dun remember how he looks like but he got a lot of candy and bread on this van, and we'll take and run away, of course mama told me she had to pay later on. *heehee that is where ppl are friendly everything is so true and transparent. no choices. nuthing. not like this cash society. everything was simple and true. simple and true.
