Cnet reported that Google may be coming out with a desktop search program and touched on how Google, an ad based company might do matching ads to the files on your computer.  While I will at some point have two cents to put in about the ads on my computer, right now I want to talk about Google as a company, a forecast if you will.  Several years ago, many people might remember, Netscape was quite the up and coming internet company. Netscape had the Internet Browser market cornered and was making a very big impression on the market. Netscape could have been the next big thing in computers and taken the market by 1997, if but for one thing.  In 1995 or so Netscape announced that it was going to enter the Operating system market. Stating that within the next couple of years it would have a working Operating System for x86 (IBM compatible) computers. (for those that don't know, MS Windows is an x86 based operating system)  Microsoft killed Netscape as competition through illegal market power and is still feeling the Justice Department squeeze since it lost that anti-trust case.  How does this fit in with Google? Easy.  In the near future, I don't think it will take more that a year after Google begins exchange stock in the public market, I see Google bringing even more software to the internet consumer. I see a Google Linux of sorts hitting the market.  I also see Microsoft falling.  Google, if it so choosed, could easily take the desktop OS market with a custom version of Linux. People love Google. People love Google so much that they even tolerate ads specifically targeted at their searches. NOW THAT'S LOVE!  With this love of Google in the Internet Market, Google could easily come out with its own version of Linux and put it on the market. Since it would be from Google, people would look past the unfamiliar Linux Operating System, and Install it over Windows faster the Microsoft can say "speed racer".  Other companies see the consumers love of Google, and would quickly begin making software and games for the Google OS. I even see Microsoft, giving in and making programs for it.   I see all this happening within the next 12 months or so.   While not official, I hear by pronounce; "Google Linux" this years Operating System of the Year.  Think about it,  It could come true before you realize it.  G. Romero (editor)
