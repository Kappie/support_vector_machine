I was lucky to keep the rope in motion for a minute straight :-(.  This is not the start of me trying to get into shape though.  I have spent the last 2 years getting in the habit of walking during my lunch hour for 3 miles.  I am doing a mile in less than fifteen minutes so I am getting a good workout.  I am on my longest stretch yet going on 6 months in a row of walking 5 days a week.  I now feel the need to add something even more aerobic to my work out.  Thus the jump rope.  I have a feeling that this will take a while to get in shape for, but I am determined.  I am really looking to get more weight off and improve my endurance in basketball and other such sports.    At work tomorrow I will be at our Milwaukie Or. site to set up a T1 for one of our many divisions.  I also have some Cisco PIX programming to do as well as set up a redundant link to one of our remote sites in LaGrande.  I love being a Network Engineer!  Well, take care all.  I need to shoo my wife to bed as she just can not stop putting together a puzzle she is working on.  See ya'.  F.
