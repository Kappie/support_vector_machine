I don't know why, but when you get sick, you feel it a little worse here than other places.  When I first moved here, I didn't believe it either.  Then I got my first taste of the Crud, and I am a believer.  I stayed home sick yesterday, and did absolutely nothing but sleep all damn day.  I got up about 5pm to visit with the family downstairs, watched the Giants game, then went back to bed.  I came into work today, but I will leave again in a few minutes.  We went to see the  urlLink Humboldt Crabs  game Monday night.  Crabs won, pretty good game.  The kids survived just fine.  I love baseball.  Bye for now, hack, cough, moan, gimme Nyquil or give me death.
