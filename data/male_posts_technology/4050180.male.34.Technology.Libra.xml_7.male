You see, a year ago, when she turned one, it nearly destroyed him. That is, to see his little sister be the center of attention, get the presents, the cake, the song ... all that for somebody else. Not good. I swear he cried harder that day than when he dislocated his elbow. Physical pain is nothing compared to pure unbridled jealosy.  But this year, he is four, and things are different. I can tell he still doesn't like it. But he helps her open the presents. He sings happy birthday. He lets her play with her new toys until she loses interest, then takes them when she looks the other way. Why? Mostly because his Mom and I are in the same room and he knows he can't get away with just taking her new toys away. This makes me think a little. We've taught him that he shouldn't act a certain way, but isn't he just as jealous as he was last year? I think so, he's just better at contolling himself and he has rules to follow now.  One thing I do know, and that is I'm still the 3 year old on some level. I think most people are. After 30 years I've gotten good, even better than my son at putting a lot of BS over it. But deep down, I think we all still wish we were the birthday boy/girl.
