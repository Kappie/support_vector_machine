If there's a senior citizen somewhere  who can't pay for her prescription and has to choose between medicine and the  rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it's not my grandmother. If there's an  Arab American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due  process, that threatens my civil liberties. It's that fundamental belief-I am my  brother's keeper, I am my sisters' keeper-that makes this country work. It's  what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, yet still come together as a  single American family. "E pluribus unum." Out of many, one.      Yet even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the  spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes.  Well, I say to them tonight, there's not a liberal America and a conservative  America-there's the United States of America.    There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian  America; there's the United States of America. The pundits like to  slice-and-dice our country into Red States and Blue States; Red States for  Republicans, Blue States for Democrats. But I've got news for them, too. We  worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don't like federal agents  poking around our libraries in the Red States. We coach Little League in the  Blue States and have gay friends in the Red States.     There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and patriots who supported it.  We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all  of us defending the United States of America.
