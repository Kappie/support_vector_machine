Prior to their own dark age, at the hands of Mohammed, the Arabs preserved the writings of  Aristotle.    Without Aristotle, we would be at peace with the Islamist death cults.  We would   all   be living in holes, washing in dirt, and fearing every sunset.  So I guess it's understandable that the left still hate him.
