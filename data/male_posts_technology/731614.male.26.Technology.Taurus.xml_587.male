What is the right thing to do?      hint: first go as your friends the heron, the monkey, and the dog before seeking out the assistance of the wise old turtle to show you what's right in front of your face...      "Remember then that there is only one important time, and that time is now. The most important one is always the one you are with. And the most important thing is to do good for the one who is standing by your side....This is why we are here."    (these questions were purloined from the children’s book “The Three Questions” by Leo Tolstoy)
