I think I may have skipped in 1982 or 1983, but there is no one around to verify that statement.  I was playing around with my son, he was chasing me, when I spontaneously skipped aroung the jog in the hallway.  He stopped suddenly, and with a look of disbelief, said "did I just see you SKIP?"  Yeah, I guess so.  "I didn't know you could skip!"  I've got lots of surprises, kid, just wait for them.
