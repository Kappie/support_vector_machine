Then each end position is graded, numerically, by an evaluation function that assigns value to such aspects of chess knowledge as material (pawn = 1 point, knight = 3 points, rook = 5 points, queen = 9 points), king safety (good), piece mobility (good), doubled pawns (bad, usually), and so forth. The computer then selects the move that, given the perfect play by the opponent, leads to the position having the highest score.   I've always liked playing chess, and been curious about how computer chess programs work. The quote above from  urlLink IEEE Spectrum  gives a great simple description of how they work in the most basic sense.
