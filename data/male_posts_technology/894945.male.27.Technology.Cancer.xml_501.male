Recently I ordered the daddy of mattresses. I've not been sleeping that well and.. well, nevermind. I decided I needed a new mattress, and the shifty slippery salesman twisted my arm (it didn't take much) into buying the BOMB of mattresses. It's got all the widgets and I almost fell asleep in the shop when I lay on it. I was hooked. Anyway, so I handed over the plastic and was told it would take a minimum of five weeks to ship. FIVE BLOODY WEEKS! Wars are fought and won in five weeks! We can launch a man into space, put a flag on the moon and be back in time for a cup of tea in the time it takes to get a six foot four lump of material and springs from the Midlands to Jersey. Anyway, I really wanted it so I agreed.  Eventually I get a call saying its in. I call up the slippery salesman to arrange delivery, and they can't do it for another friggin' week. A week to get a mattress from St Peters to my gaff. Bastards!  So I say yeah, and tell him when somebody will be here to let them in. He says that the delivery guys 'don't like to be tied down to a time'. WHAT THE FUCK? They aren't rocket scientists are they? They aren't rock stars! What am I supposed to do? Take a day off on holiday just so I can let the  urlLink Chuckle Brothers  into my gaff and deliver a mattress! What's the matter with these people? Whatever happened to.. "Ok Sir. When would it be convienient for us to deliver it to you?"  Another thing.. I hate walking to work when it's wet. It's depressing and a twenty minute stroll through the North Sea is no way to begin a days work. So I decide, what with our new Connex buses driving all over the place, maybe I should take the bus. It wouldn't be so bad. I could pay my twenty pence or whatever and sit next to a old granny and talk about the time she tied a German soldiers shoelaces together when he was asleep. So I dig out the  urlLink timetable off the internet.  You know what time the buses leave from the bus stop at the bottom of my road? Between 10am and 4pm. What fucking use is that? Is it to cater for the hordes of invisible tourists clammering to get to the Zoo and take pictures of a monkey masturbating? No. Why arn't the buses running at sensible times.. times that you could use them to get to work, and more importantly get to Chicago bloody Rock. Argh! Jersey has a LONG way to go yet folks.  Anyway, thank you for letting me get that off my chest. I'll reward you with some  urlLink Dogs in Snoods !
