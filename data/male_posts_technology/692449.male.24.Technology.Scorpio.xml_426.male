The march came on the seventh anniversary of Chinese retaking control of Hong Kong. Opposition to Beijing has intensified since China ruled earlier this year that Hong Kong would not be given the right to directly choose its next leader. Organizers said the total number of protesters topped 350,000 despite intense heat.
