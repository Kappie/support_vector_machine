Downloaded the newer fox browser, the only visible difference I see though is the advanced preferences. Appears to be a GUI version of the .rc stuff you find on the Unixes. If I wanted that on 0.9 I would have typed  about:config  in the address bar. Tools>Options however, provides a tree kinda structure for the same.  Had a look at the  urlLink big picture . Am looking forward to 1.0 though.
