I might be in the area for a long time if I don't come back to Pittsburgh before my trip to Trinidad.  I'm still packing.  I have a software release planned for Sunday night that still has a lot to go before it's ready. It's really important it gets out. Ugh - I'l be driving and then at this wedding, and then meeting up with Warren and friends, and then tomorrow is a big family party... must... find... a way.  I learned a new cool word yesterday afternoon ->  in·sou·ci·ance  : lighthearted unconcern : NONCHALANCE  ...I like it!  I went out last night when I didn't even feel like it and spent $30.  Not too happy about that. I should have just stayed in and prepared to leave.  But, I would have felt like I was missing out on something because it was such a nice night out.  shrug . But it was an especially bad idea considering how much fun I had Thursday night...  I was just spent and tired.  hrmmm... I probably don;t have time to hit the library and pick up a book on tape... though it would be nice if I could; I'm in the mood for that today.
