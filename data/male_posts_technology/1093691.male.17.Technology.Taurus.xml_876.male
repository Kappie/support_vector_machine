Jo got it second, so she gets the runners up prize, a smile. :)  Name the object srounded in white.    What is curently on the white/black dot? It's an old photograph, so the buildings around it have changed.    Do not post your ideas on El-Bloggo! Send them to me via e-mail to my normal address. You can now edit and change dates and times on El-Bloggo, plus you might give others ideas!  Not sure how easy/hard you'll find those. If you get both of them you win a massive hug/20 pence/take me out to dinner. If you get one of them correct you win a medium sized hug/15 pence/take me out to dinner. If you get close on both/either of them you get a normal hug/10 pence/take me out to dinner. If you have no idea then you get a look of disapointment/-10 pence (you give me money)/take me out to lunch (not quite as good as dinner).  Good luck! I get back Thursday late afternoon. Bye bye.
