       
      Today I have my BIG Band Playing Test (It's part 2). I am playing "Shalom!" (which is on the Xylophone), "Black Wolf Run" (which is on the Timpani), and "Capriccio Espagnol" (which is on the Snare Drum). I have practiced hard, so I hope that I get at least some sort of B on it (hopefully an A). It is at 2:10 PM this afternoon (during math). But since I have to be ready to play at 2:10, I must leave about five minutes early or more since I must setup the Timpani and set my music out. At every lesson that we go to, we have to have this "list," which is where we put the hard parts on to work on and practice. Well thanks a lot and wish me luck - I've gotta go now!
