Well, it doesn't matter if your applicaitions are so smart that they wipe your ass for you...if they are constantly fucken crashing....its kind of a moot point wouldn't you say?  As if loosing whatever data isn't bad enough...MS now has its apps ask you if you want to send an "error report" to microsoft....well....for my level of agro-high-strungedness, I need a little button that says..."Send piping hot pile of shit to Microsoft?"  At that point, I think I actually would send feedback.....
