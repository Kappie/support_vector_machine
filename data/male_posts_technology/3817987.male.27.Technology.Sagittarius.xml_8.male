They are tacking to the center and stressing how Kerry will be tough on terrorism and his military experience and patriotism, all shown in relief of Bush. This is appealing to swing voters in the middle who think the Iraq was probable for the best but don't like how bush has handled it.  Some of this may piss off the far left but catering to the far left won't help win this election.  Plus the Anybody But Bush sentiment out there is so strong that most people on the far left wont care anyway.    Also watching Bill Clinton speak at the convention last night makes very much hate the 22nd Amendment.  Monicagate and all I think he would trounced Bush easily in 2000. And he would run way with it this time. I have really come to like Kerry but he's no Bill Clinton.
