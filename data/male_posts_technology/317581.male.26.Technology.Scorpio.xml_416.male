I don't know who I am, but I know what I enjoy. time with friends, time reading my books, time spent self improving, these are some of the things I enjoy most. Travel, meeting new friends, watching a well made film, talking, kissing.  Thinking about the un-important things in life. Why are we here? What happens when we die? Is God real? Is there life after death? Is there a soul? Things that can really only be carefully considered after the basic needs are taken care of.  Lively debate with friends in a trusted environment.  These are the things I cherish, these are what make me a man...
