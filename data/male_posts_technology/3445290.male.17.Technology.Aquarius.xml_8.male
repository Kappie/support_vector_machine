For some people this is the best time of the year because the stress levels are at a alltime low, the beaches are full of beautiful people and its relaxing, for students we can earn quite a bit more money then usual, and people are going on vacations.    Summer for me is not as fun as it should be. I am going to be doing summer school throughout the whole time and I'm going to be working two jobs and the worst part is that it will be so hot that I will never get any sleep from all the humidity during work too.    Anyways, in my new job I'm still a rookie in sales and am not making as many sales as my fellow employees who are making around 300-400$ just working at max around 12 hours a week and I'm quite scared because of the results of the final exams which are really scary. I am planning on saving up for nutrition and a personal trainer to get me started working out properly and I am intent on getting a new computer and some new gadgets and I could really use some new articles of clothing....LOL anyways enough of all that bitching and moaning cause its late and I'm gone. LATER!!!!
