For some strange reason I can't seem to turn the channel. His comedy is addicting! Even though we've watched him who knows how many times, and I own it on DVD, here I am watching it again. Great Stuff!    p.s. Here's that comparison you asked for. I threw it together tonight; I threw it together tonight, as a matter of fact... It's an old pic of me so I had to shimmy her in with Photoshop.
