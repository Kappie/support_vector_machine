They were covered up to about six feet in height in mystical glyphs and images of fear, terror, and nice little park animals. One evenhad a painting of a leering face that welcomes you to your doom and laughs at your impending misfortune.   Olympia tells me that would be about as far as she would get, as she finds water towers incredibly scary. I wonder what she thinks of clowns?
