They are the champion of all that is liberal.  My only question is WHY most people would even need a doctor to assist.  If you REALLY want to kill yourself there are thousands of ways to do so.    Unless someone is totally incapacitated (such as the quadriplegic who was given a feeding tube and wanted it removed....obviously he couldn't remove it himself), I can't see why a doctor would be needed.  In that case, he wanted to do it himself but was physically unable to do so.  That is an exception.  Otherwise, there's no need to ask for help.  Just do it!  Go to alt.suicide.holiday (more info  urlLink here ) for help in doing it yourself.  People kill themselves all the time...and all joking aside, it is unfortunate.  Most people terminally ill have the capacity and ability to take their own lives.  Personally, I'm not in favor of anyone killing themselves, but it would be unfair for me to pass judgement as I'm not walking in their shoes.    The other problem I have with doctor-assisted suicide is that it leaves far too much power outside the hands of the person allegedly wanting to die.  Too much subjectivity going on there.  Courts, psychologists, doctors helping to make a determination.  The suicidee (I made that up...what do you think?), may not be in a proper frame of mind to make a decision to end their own life.  It is a permanent decision...there's no going back.    Not to beat a dead horse...but if someone who is able-bodied needs assistance in killing themselves they obviously lack the resolve to do it themselves and should not be assisted.  This kind of goes back to the credo of personal responsibility.
