Most of those chain letters requires us to send to other ppl in a specific time in order to enjoy good luck and prevent bad luck..Wat is dis?if evry1 were to get good luk in love,life,business,frens,family,and watsoever after sending those chain letters,then wat for we work hard for it?den y dun we jux sit down n send da letters and wait for good luk to come to us?instead of working and thinking hard?Isnt dis ridiculous?  And most of the chain letters are indeed veri stupid.Some hav included examples of cases that will happen to u if u do not send it in da next 96 hours or watsoever.Most of them are bout the deaths of ppl who make dis a joke or do not send those letters.I wanna comment bout dis.I hav received many chain letters bout dis.I used to forward to sum of my frens cox i was once scared of da chain letters.  However,when i thought bout it,it was a foolish thing to do.If i were to receive 4 same chain letters which requires me to send to at least 20ppl,dat means i hav to send to 80ppl?The effect of chain letter will not finish.If u think u will die if u delete da letters..think again.If ppl were to die aftere deleting dis letters..den the number will exceeds thousand.futhermore life is god's will,ntg can determine when ur life will end.  So ppl who create chain letters,pls stop it.It is realli annoying esp to da master.N ppl who forward chain letters.PLS STOP SENDING IT TO ME COX I DUN LIKE STUPID CHAIN LETTERS.thank you.
