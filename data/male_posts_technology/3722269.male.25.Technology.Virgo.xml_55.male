It's nice to be able to be there for you guys, whichever of you need help, because you're all there for me. I'd gotten used to having something in my days, which is no longer there, and for a moment or two today, I was at a bit of a loss, for what to do with the time, but I'm stumbling through. A good friend of mine has come to the party and I'm told a stick of ram is en route , and its arrival should coincide with the arrival of my new cpu.. and the arrival of my new gfx card.. all up, pretty much a whole new computer. Fantastic. Which coincides with Doom3, but is completely unrelated, its just an interesting coincidence. Nothing much interesting to say today, but I've gotten shit before for not updating, so far be it from me to do -that- again. I've been forced to add to foreigners to 'block' on msn, I'm not sure what it is about not being from nz that seems to make people annoying,  but strangely, it seems more often the case than not. ahh well. That'll do, time for toast and milo and open fires. More tomorrow, I promise?
