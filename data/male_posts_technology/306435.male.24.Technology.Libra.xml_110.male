Marissa flirted with the manager after he mentioned he had been to the place in Colorado her shirt was from.  Then bought/comp'd her meal.  Then as she was getting her drink he was checking her out.  She took it in stride.  Then she thanked him for the meal as we left.    We got the movie just in time...not that it mattered with two commercials (yes commercials not previews).  There were a whole 5 or six other people in the theater.  It was a good movie.  Action Packed.  I wish I knew the comic book story a little better, but then I would only use that to critique it more.  All in all worht the money and time.  After the movie Marissa and I went to Cleneay to see Jeff.  He had invited us to the baseball game tonight.  As we were leaving we saw Billy riding his bike.  He seemed very calm and told us that the street was dead now and pretty boring.  Then he advised that he was going up to Dana's and that he was going to be "off his bat"...yeah we didn't klnow what that meant either.  I asked him what being "on" his bat was like and he replied "being cool" then making a gesture with his hand like he was the Fonz.  He then advised that Ann had actually named his bike the batmobile (Ann says this never happened which makes it even funnier).  Later, Billy said "So, Hallie is coming into town....Amazing!"  Someone needs to make a documentary on Billy.  It would be a classic independent film.  I am working out the details of a flight to Florida to spend the first week of July with my family on vacation.I have learned that Saturday flights are less expensive than Sunday night flights.  Ann is joining us and I think it may be possible to meet up with her flight when it stops in Cincinnati on the way to West Palm Beach.
