This includes IE, Mozilla (incl Firefox), all gecko based, Opera, and even Safari. But safari is only cool b/c of the css property 'text-shadow'. Autmunleezy should degrade exactly the same in all browsers unless non-compliant code was introduced to the template by one of your blogmasters.   anyway...YO CRAIG! CALL YOUR DELAWARE BROTHER ASAP or as soon as you get up or your gonna get the pimpsmackin' of a lifetime =P
