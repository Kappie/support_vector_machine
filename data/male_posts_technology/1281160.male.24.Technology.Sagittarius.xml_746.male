Just for the sake that our seniors (age or experience) have been practicing something I cannot take it for granted. If that is so then we would have missed the â€˜out of the box thinkingâ€™ which I admire the most. Every generation is augmented with intelligence and sense of reasoning. Before a brand new idea egg hatches the next updated idea egg is delivered.  I recollect, â€œIf you want to stay where you are today, keep runningâ€� If we need to keep up with the pace it becomes necessary for us to leave even the good things ( recall my earlier blog) then how come we can practice something which has no reasoning on its back..   If there is an answer for â€˜so what?â€™ in all my Grandmaâ€™s words I donâ€™t mind following that. If she doesnâ€™t have one and if at all you accept that my reasoning power is also good, then I would leave my brain to decideâ€¦  Kicha: I find some â€œdata type mismatchâ€�error in this mail da do u? Valli: Chottu means Intelligent in Portugal. When u come to India get me a bottle of wine Xavi : dei naanae dictionary paathu copy adichu than type pandran nee yennai meeruva pola irukku.
