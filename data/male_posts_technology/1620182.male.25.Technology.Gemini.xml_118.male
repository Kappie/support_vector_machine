Basically, there is a bot out there somewhere that connects to the Hello network that you send pictures to which will post them to your blog for you.  It's a pretty cool concept.
 
 Hello is a pretty nice program.  The idea is to create an instant messaging service (much like  urlLink AIM ,  urlLink MSN ,  urlLink Yahoo ,  urlLink ICQ ,  urlLink etc .) that is centered around sharing photos.  For that much, it succeeds.  It provides a pretty area where you can pick your photos and send them to your friends.  Unfortunately, I don't seem to have any friends but the blogger bot.
 
 Picture connoisseurs will be a little disappointed with this as a web publishing tool.  The pictures that get uploaded are little grainy (as you can tell from the Space Needle below) and there aren't enough options for how you want the pictures published.  I was hoping for an easy way to tell a story around a picture, but this is really just a tool to get the picture up on the web fast and easy.
 
 As for options, you're pretty limited.  You can pick which size you want your thumbnail and picture to be (thus the poor compression), what color your border will be, what tagline to add to your photos, and which blog to publish it to.  I'm disappointed that I can't publish more than one picture per post and that I can't format it better (i.e. center).  
 
 All in all, this is not a bad tool for the average person.  But if you want to keep your blog "professional" looking (or at least like a human made it), stick to manually adding the images using your img tag.
