I saw him live in Brisbane a couple of years ago, and it blew my mind.  However, his  urlLink website  could be the worst website in the history of the world. It hides in the middle of the window, and I have to scroll using some crappy hover buttons that don't work in my browser. Add to that the fact that it is almost devoid of any actual useful content (discography, tour dates, etc).
