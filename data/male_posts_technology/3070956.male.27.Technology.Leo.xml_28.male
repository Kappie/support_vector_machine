The weather is quite savage today - uugh. Pouring rain with breaks of sunshine - I'm looking for a rainbow.  sigh   Today was hectic - I volunteered to help at Holy Family's Golf Tounament being held at the Sewickly Golf Club and was supposed to be there at 9 AM, but still had the U-Hail we rented for the party and the DJ equipment. So I had to return that this morning and found out that the place we rented the DJ equipment from dowsn't open until 10 AM. uugh. So I rushed over there, dropped off the equipment and rushed over to drop off the U-haul at time since it had to be returned by 11:30 at the latest. I'm still recovering from all the fun I costing over $150 more that I expected it to! Then, I got lost going to the Golf Course... by the time I go there they hardly needed any more help. Oh well. It was nice to see them again.   Then I had a Dr's appointment at 2:15. Just a checkup, hehe. And then I came home to look for my birth certificate and get some work done. I just ordered some Chinese food and am getting pretty hungry. Hope they come soon!
