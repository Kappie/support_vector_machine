And I can do both! haha :)  I also have two projects pending. hehe I promised a friend months ago and until now wala pa gyapon until he stopped reminding me. Ka bad gid ah! hehe  President? Who did you guys vote for? I voted for  urlLink Bro. Eddie  pero he's not going anywhere at this rate. :(  urlLink GMA    urlLink FPJ ? Although I do not greatly support the Arroyo administration, I'd rather root for her rather than leave the Philippines in the hands of FPJ. Kulbaan lang gid ko ya just thinking about it. Hayyy...  I voted for Joy Valdez, but then it seems like Bing is going to win. Ambot ah, basta mga candidato ko ya wala gid gadala-ug ah! hehe Si Novero lang gid guro. Haaayyyy... ok lang.   Do you guys still watch  urlLink AMERICAN IDOL ? (If you're watching sa STAR, read no further, SPOILERS ahead).   I can't believe La Toya's been voted out? Yikes. Nami gid to sha ya voice, seriously. Who do you think will win?
