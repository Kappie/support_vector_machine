His music’s got incredible vibe and it’s such a great bluesy, folk, tropical mix of sounds. I don’t know if that’s what he intended, cuz I don’t read much on his bio or anything. What strikes me more is his lyrical sense. It’s uncomplicated yet profound, whimsical, and sometimes even funny. Like this one called “Bubble Toes”. How the hell do you come out comparing the size of one’s eyes and toes? His song is so full of contradictions and things that don’t add up, but somehow it does make sense. Sort of like myself, ‘walking paradox’ as I always say.   On a side note, the whole ‘bubble toes’ bit got me thinking about my defects. The stuff I call my defects: lazy left eye, animal teeth, flinstone toes, cracking knees, and the list goes on. Although ‘defect’ sounds a bit harsh, it really isn’t that bad.   eg. Animal teeth – as in that orange drum-beating freak of nature of a muppet – Animal. Flinstone toes – equal length toes like that of Fred Flinstone.  A lot of these stuff were pointed out to me by friends and were baptized with matching weird names. They sound a whole lot freakish when enumerated like that, but I actually like them quirks now. It gives me character I guess...   Now I've set myself up sounding like some hideous monster. Oh man.
