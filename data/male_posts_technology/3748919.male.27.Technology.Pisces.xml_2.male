The party was more of a small get together and the only thing that was great about the whole night was getting to know my new friend, oh yeah and a little bit of interesting drama of 2 girls fighting over my gay friend from high school. He did hook up with one though......good for him, bad for me. He got two I got none.   My new friend passed out on me along with everyone else. So I'm stuck watching Something About Mary by myself with a bunch of passed out people all around me. Then out of the blue there's panic cause one of the girls was having an asthma attack and came running out in her little tiny undies and bra, very nice I must say. Everyone in the room I was in slept righ through it.  So the next morning I wake up, which was actually only 3 hours after I fell asleep, and me and my new friend decide to go to breakfast. But before we leave she needs her shoes, and guess where they are? Near where she fell asleep? Nope. Near where I fell asleep? Nope. Nextto the cool guy who passed out with no pants on in the other room sporting morning wood? Yeup! So then we leave and go have breakfast.   So the rest of my day consisted of moving furniture for my future ex-wife. But I did get a couch out of the deal and I'm psyched about that. I watched the game today on my new couch, with the future ex-wife. She was actually packing her shit. Which brings me the whole meaning of the title of this Blog Post. She took my Cats away!! I didn't think I would be as bummed as I was, but I was really bummed. They were all meowing and crying as they were leaving which didn't make me to happy about parting with them. But what got me by was that fact that they've been pissing on any pile of clothing that I've left around anywhere all friggin month. So I have to wash a shit load of clothes now and the piss smell isn't easy to get out. Yup, I'm sooooooo over my cats already.   Stay tuned........................... to be continued!
