The market for folks selling them is not what it once was and you can talk to several folks who have Gmail invites and are willing to give them away. Sites like Gmailswap are not going to last much longer in this type of market.  Also I've removed the ability to add anonymous comments. It's lame when people don't leave their names. Don't be a pussy when you make a comment on someone's blog :)
