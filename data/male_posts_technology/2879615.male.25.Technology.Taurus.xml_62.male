Moms Yistine made us all food because the italian in her won't allow her to do anything but make food at 1 am hoping that some stoned kids will eat it.  Staying true to form, Myson was random and ridiculous, roaring in people's faces and starting fights because he's a fratboy now, and passed out on the couch by like, 10.  Cotten reemerged from his brush with death a more reflective, grateful man.  He's throwing a party Friday to celebrate staying alive for one more day.  Expect continued alcohol poisoning, bleazies, snow storms and if we're lucky, more near death experiences.  Big up to La squared and the summer edition.  Oh yeah and craig you are a frail little pink-white redneck fool. I wish you woooouuuuld son.  La squared's 20th is June 11th-13th at Stoned Harbor. Strap on your drinking shoes and get riled.  No sloppy bitches for the boys of sin and weirdness currently, but the night is young.  waaaay to stay up til 3 watching some pr0n with yistine  craaaig. haha "can we just just see some vaginal sex so I can go to sleep? i kind of need it."  "Taylor Hayes: International Jizz Catcher"  i have never seen pr0n this ridic. Ben you're twisted.  beat it honkeys smaaaaaaashley
