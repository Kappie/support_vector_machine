The highlights of my day today were taking some pictures, and finding out that my yahoo email account storage has been upped to 100MB. That's pretty sad.  My mind is racing 100 miles an hour tonight, so i couldnt' stay in bed, had to get up. I'm processing an incredibly frustrating work situation, with huge stress about money. It's a wonderful combination whose number one job at the moment is making me lose sleep.  I'm trying to find something good on the 'net right now to save this post from being all 'woe is me', and I have found a decent link:   urlLink The Moving Picture Company   These guys are a film and commercial FX house in Soho, London.  They do work for the Harry Potter films among many others and their flash website is Awesome.  I'm out.
