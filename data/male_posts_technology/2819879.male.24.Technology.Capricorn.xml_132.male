One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne  in the Land of Mordor where the shadows lie.  One Ring to rule them all, One ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all  and in the darkness bind them  in the Land of Mordor where the shadows lie."  And so it begins the great story of the Ring...  After reading "The Hobbits" (Prelude of LoR), I just couldn't wait to get start on the Real Story.  Sure, "The Hobbits" was fun and a great adventure in itself.  Yet the Ring has already played a great part in the story...  1st Chapter, which I just finished yesterday, was all about how Bilbo (The first Hobbit to own the ring) was tired up because of the queer ring and how he threw a last, 111th birthday party and left the Shire.  The movie... was quite incorrect (perhaps misleading), about how the whole story started right away after Bilbo gave the Ring to his heir, Frodo.  In the book, Frodo's adventure does not start until 17 years later, when Frodo is 50-years-old (And that's the Age when Bilbo find the ring).  Well, movies are always misleading. While reading the story, although I was trying very hard to come up with my own "picture" of the characters, but I just couldn't help to refer to the ones from the movie.  Frodo, Bilbo, Sam, Gandalf, Sauron, Elrond, Pippy, Merry, the Dwarves have all printed in my mind by the evil movie...
