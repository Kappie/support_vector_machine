But not before i saw Wilson's Gas Station down on Farnham Gate Road selling gas for 26 CENTS per LITRE!!!  Crazy.  Writing more ASP at work today, i'll be so glad when that's behind me and i won't feel so out of my element.    So now on my lunch break, i have to find some food, pick up an anniversary card for my folks, and a gift if i can.  We'll see how much of that can be accomplished in Bayers Lake in a half hour.  :)  So that being said, i'm sure it'll be a long drive today but we're stopping for Sam's pizza on the way, and we're bringing Ginny, so she's always good for some entertainment.    I'm out.
