I think my job/personality are in a unique place where I have time to blog and it fulfills part of my need to socialize. Blogging gives me a way to get my random thoughts of Tim out of my head and onto the internet. I use my blog as a way to socialize with my friends, especially when the job takes up more than it's fair share of my time. I think if I went out more and wasn't sitting in front of a computer for 8+ hours a day, then I probably would not blog as much.  I don't know. Sometimes I feel like a blogger, sometimes I don't. Maybe this was that muse I was talking about?  Peace- T
