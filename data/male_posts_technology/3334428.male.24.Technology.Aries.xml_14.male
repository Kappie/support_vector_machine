I just finished up a long weekend with Memorial Day off and a day off from work.  It's so nice when you can take a few days to relax, spend time with friends, and just chill out.  You think about all the days that pass that you wasted.  The days that could have been a great memory, but instead I slept in or wasted time doing something stupid.  Like yesterday, on my day off.  I spent most of the day doing nothing.  Then my friend Lee says he will teach me to wakeboard.  Sure enough, in no time at all, he taught me.  Time that I would have spent doing nothing, I now spent accomplishing something really fun and cool and also spending time with a friend.   I've realized in my 24 years one main thing.  Life is about forming relationships.  I'm not talking about "dating" but solid friendships and friends.  It takes effort to put yourself out there and share your heart with people, but that's how we grow, that's how we learn.  One great thing about living in a sub-division is that random people stop by all the time.  Salesmen, pest control, fund raising people, candy people, and can't forget the ice cream man who has the nice lil jingle he plays that you can hear approximately 1 mile away.  Today was the day of the pest control guy.  I hear a knock on the door and I get up to answer it.  A very young guy is standing at the door and explains to me our options on fighting off the rodents and other crawling things that lurk around Easley, SC.  We had a good conversation.  I got to know where he was from, what he does for fun, and where he lives.  Something inside me told me he was mormon.  Weird I know, but I felt it.  I asked him if he went to church anywhere and sure enough, he is mormon.  So we talked about that for a short time and then went on to talk about mountain biking and kayaking.  I invited him to go mountain biking with me sometime and told him that I would like the chance to talk about mormonism.  He politely agreed and hopefully he will call.  I realized during this time that I had a root beer in my hand that probably looked like a long neck beer.  Some people look down on beer and it is a hindrance to sharing the gospel, so I made it clear to him that it was root beer :).  It was good conversation because he's a big fan of the root beer, haha.  As am I.    So my goal in this life is to make solid relationships with people and to genuinely care about their feelings and cares in this world.  In reality, this is a hard world to live in and deal with, but the Lord did not leave us alone.  He gave us the Holy Spirit and He also gave us friends...how great they are...how great they are.  On a side note, one of my friends bought a car on Ebay!  Not only have I got him to blog, he now has followed my direction and BUYS CARS ON EBAY!  Congrats to   urlLink  Billy Rogers!
