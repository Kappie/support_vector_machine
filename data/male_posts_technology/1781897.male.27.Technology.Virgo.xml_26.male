This last weekend I had the pleasure of camping at  urlLink Big Basin , which is a really nice place to camp.  There were tons of redwood trees to relax under, plenty of beer to drink...and about 6 powder-sugared "hills" to stare at!  I have always been a "hill" guy...in fact...if a forest has nice "hills", but not much else to offer, I can still see the good in it!  Seeing these hills makes a man glad that he is a man!  I bet I could see way down the valley from the top of those hills.
