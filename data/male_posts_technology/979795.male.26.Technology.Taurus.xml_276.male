Basically means if the camp is under attack or something, QRF personnel will be supporting the guards at the guard room at any point in camp, hence the term QRF.  Had a difficult afternoon today. Basically being in RSM office means I gotta plan out the monthly duties (eg. guard duty) for the whole brigade. Haiz, it's proving to be quite an ordeal. Basically what happened was that when I came in, my friend Neo had already planned out a duty plan. Problem was a neighbouring unit had to go on exercise and that meant they couldn't send the men in to do duties for certain pre-arranged dates. They requested a swap but now the dates we got were not favourable. Means some people had to to have their original duty dates rearranged and some actually got extra duties beyond their monthly average, while others got their duties so closely packed together it became difficult to have enough rest in between. Some last minute medical cases had to be pulled out from their duties at the last minute, leaving even more empty duty slots for the month and insufficient people to fill them.  It seems like even I myself will be doing some of these extra duties.  I've heard of several unhappy grumblings and it feels bad to be the'bad guy' to have to do these. I've been making changes since last week and till just now, things have been pretty disorienting and hectic. It seems there are so many factors to consider, their personal commitment dates  their other duty dates (which is a lot to be going through on an individual level).  Neo has been helping to try and sort out the duties together because he has more experience than me. Originally, he wanted me to handle it because I'll soon be the one taking over this completely soon. But it was just too much for one person to handle.  It's impossible to please everyone in the brigade and I thought of taking up more duties. But Neo said it was not worth it as nobody here will appreciate it. That's true. I think all I can do is distribute the extra duties amongst everyone (including ourselves) and whoever is unhappy about it, well ... tough luck. But it sure isn't going to earn me any friends in the Brigade.  Also realised one thing, sometimes it's necessary to be the bad guy so as to get things done. If I ever get into the police force, I think I will enforce this belief. It is not only necessary but crucial to get things moving quickly. Humans are forgetful, most of them will soon forget this unhappy month and just carry on their duties whether they like it or not. To allow things to drag on so long will only serve to remind them of their 'torturous experience'.  Hope QRF won't be activated later. They usually test our readiness one/twice in a night. I wanna sleep .... :(
