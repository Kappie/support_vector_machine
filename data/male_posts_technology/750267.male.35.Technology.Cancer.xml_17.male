If there's one thing I hate, it's predicting something, admitting that I was wrong, and then finally being proven right. So it turns out the sniper was caught because he was seen - good eyewitness descriptions led directly to their capture.  It turns out that one of the sniper suspects was seen "clearly" by a policeman, and the investigators had a great description of him for several days before the arrest. This policeman also picked this man out of a photo lineup with some certainty.  The oddest thing I heard today was that one of the snipers served in the Gulf War, actually disposing of Iraqi chemical weapons including Sarin. The suggestion being made is that being exposed to Sarin, even a little bit, can cause all sorts of psychological problems. A good defense lawyer would based his entire defense on this one theory.  Another interesting fact is that many of the recent serial killers in U.S. history (the sniper, Timothy McVeigh, Jeffery Dhamer, and others) have had U.S. military training. So the other defense theory could be, hey, the government taught these guys to be ruthless killers... Military training is essentially an accepted form of brain washing, right? Sir, yes sir!   I don't know what to think about that. Anyways, the sniper will never see the outside of a prison again. Death penalty for sure. Several states are fighting over who gets to kill them first. Sane, insane, who cares? They terrorized millions of people for three weeks, and killed 10 (or more if you count earlier crimes). I'm glad its over.  Scott
