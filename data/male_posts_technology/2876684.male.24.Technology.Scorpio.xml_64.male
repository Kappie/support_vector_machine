I have to send in my passport and pay the remainder of their fee and in 4 weeks time...  I'll officially be an Australian resident.  I should be elated but I'm not - maybe it hasn't sunk in. Or maybe I told myself I was always going to get it so I'm not surprised.  In any case, it's good news. I guess I've forgotten how to celebrate, that's all.
