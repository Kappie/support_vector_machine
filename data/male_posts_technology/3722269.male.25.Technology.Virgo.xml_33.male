Just finished putting dinner on, there's a distinct lack of selection in regards to meat at the dairy across the road, 5 variaties of sausage, 4 of bacon, 3 of ham... nothing much else. I ended up grabbing a bag of Aria Farms Beef Chips.. well, they're solid freeflow beef, and get the healthy heart tick, I grabbed some mushrooms, an onion, and some tomato paste.. and tada we have all the makings of a scrummy beef Goulash.. normally I'd prefer it to slow-cook all day in the magical crockpot of tenderness, but the quality of the beef, and the fact I've slapped that baby into 'high' should mean we're 'sweet as' for target time of 6pm. Dinner must be at 6, on the dot, or smokey does a naanaa. Creature of habbit. He'll appreciate the meal tho, he's a fan of anything even vaguely reminiscent of 'farm food' that is to say, anything 'comforty'. I cubed up a potato or three, chucked that in, and diced the onion and as I was peeling the spuds it occured to me, that the simple design that is a swiss potato peeler, is soo much better than the standard 'kiwi' potato peeler... there's something about the swiss peeler, the angle.. it almost makes peeling potatos not a hassle at all. Almost. In typical 'Chris' fashion, I've managed to make good money in the first part of the week, and am set to 'kick back' for the rest of the week, instead of knuckling down and making -more- money.. finding the balance here is crucial.. I see time being more important than money, but as one of my favourite tracks at the moment goes "money cant buy me happiness, but I'm the happiest when I can buy, whatever I want, whenever I want" I think there's a lot of truth to it. I think money is a magnifier, if you were a good person, with money you'll be able to do more good things, if you were a bad person, you'll still suck arse. Nothing set in concrete for this weekend yet, but this is good, as my washing that was still on the line from yesterday (*groan*) is still sopping wet, and anything social lined up would mean having to get that stuff laundromatted.. although as I say that, to contradict me the sun comes out.. There is hint of a couple of people who might or might not drop in, which is always cool.  I love having guests, even if the house is a mess. My expected visitor this afternoon cancelled, so I found myself with a distinct lack of things to do. Headed off to town and priced up some new toys that I cant decide if I need.. especially as I should be spending the money on doing up my poor wee car.. so that I can tikitour all over the place and come and visit you people. Hurrah. On that note, I thought about doing a pilgrimage tour, just me, and muh lil car once he's up n running, and toddle around nz, staying at backpackers, g33ks places, and the occassional roadside.. I think it'll wait till summer tho, as I'm a hella wuss, and the cold is... well.. cold. It seems this bloggywoggy has spurred some people to inject life back into their blogs, and I've seen at least one or two new ones spring up, that I'm going to take credit for inspiring, even if I had nothing to do with it. Why? Because I can.   Thought for the day:
