I guess the trouble is that I do not always have things to say? :-)  My latest task is to try and make myself more attractive to Alanis Morrissette. It is not that I am undeniably attracted to her so much as that she has explicitly listed out what she is looking for from a guy, and I think I can meet a lot of the qualities that she prefers. So often men wonder what women want, and so seldom do we get to find out -- its amazing to have qualities listed explicitly this way. The time savings alone makes this a worthwhile consideration!  The song goes like this:    Do you derive joy when someone else succeeds?  Do you not play dirty when engaged in competition?  Do you have a big intellectual capacity but know  That it alone does not equate wisdom?  Do you see everything as an illusion?  But enjoy it even though you are not of it?  Are you both masculine and feminine? politically aware?  And don't believe in capital punishment?   These are 21 things that I want in a lover  Not necessarily needs but qualities that I prefer   Do you derive joy from diving in and seeing that  Loving someone can actually feel like freedom? are you funny?  Ã  la self-deprecating? like adventure? and have many formed opinions?  These are 21 things that I want in a lover  Not necessarily needs but qualities that I prefer  I figure I can describe it since I have a choice in the matter  These are 21 things I choose to choose in a lover   I'm in no hurry I could wait forever  I'm in no rush cuz I like being solo  There are no worries and certainly no pressure  In the meantime I'll live like there's no tomorrow   Are you uninhibited in bed? more than three times a week?  Up for being experimental? are you athletic?  Are you thriving in a job that helps your brother?  are you not addicted?   These are 21 things that I want in a lover  Not necessarily needs but qualities that I prefer  I figure I can describe it since I have a choice in the matter  These are 21 things I choose to choose in a lover   ...curious and communicative...    By my count, I have somewhere between 19 and 20 of these items (I say 20, a friend of mine says 19). And I can be flexible about the capital punishment issue (item #21). So if you ignore the fact that she is engaged to Ryan Reynolds, I may have a shot, right?
