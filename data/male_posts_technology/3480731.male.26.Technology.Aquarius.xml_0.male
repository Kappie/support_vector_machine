I've been looking through a selection of different Blogs and it seems that most people are rather creative. Sadly, I don't fall into that crowd. I'm the type of guy that cringes when asking what someone wants for birthday/Christmas and I'm told "Be creative.". Now, give me a list, I'm all smiles.  So, for about six hours before June 1st, you wouldn't know it here in Chicago if it wasn't for the calendar. It's 63 degrees out and it has been raining on and off for at least the past three weeks. Not that I don't mind it not being 85+ degrees, but this is just too much.  This seems pretty good for a first post; I'm shocked I came up with something. Now the real challenge; keeping it up.
