Like Thunderbird, I even keep an eye on new nightly builds for new features or fixes that interest me. But now, about a month before they're supposed to release a version 1.0 milestone, the leadership has up and decided to get rid of the outstanding, very Windows XP-ish look that it had, and replace it with this rubbish called Winstripe. Since most Firefox users are used to Windows, it's really unclear why they've decided to shove this Mac look down everybody's throat. Bottom line, it stinks.  I don't want to be too harsh on the Winstripe creators  I know a lot of Mac users like the look. But when Firefox is a month away from going prime time, and users are stuck with a look that's more like amateur hour targetted at a platform that most people  don't  use, it's frigging ridiculous. And yeah, being Firefox, of course you can change the theme, but as a first impression to present to a newbie, this is horrific.     The Qute theme, which had been working fine:         The new Winstripe theme, suddenly introduced just a month or two before Firefox 1.0 should be out:
