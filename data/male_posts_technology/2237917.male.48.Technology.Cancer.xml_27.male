My land , 70 acres goes all the way back to the road @ the bottom that runs left to right.    The fields are where my friend Sonny grazes his 16 Hereford cattle, I also have a Brook that runs through the woods with a couple waterfalls and swimming Holes.  There are Bear, Deer, Fox, Turkeys, rabbits, raccons, woodchucks, and beaver all out there.  Moose are migrating down from up north, but I haven't seen any yet.
