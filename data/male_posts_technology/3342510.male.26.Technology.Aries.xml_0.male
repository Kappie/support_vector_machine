Went to a  Warhammer Conflict in Toronto  and learned to play Warhammer 40k (well played a game anyway), made a pile o' rocks from styrofoam and wood chips (when in doubt of what scenery to make, make a hill or pile o' rocks) and looked over a couple of VERY cooly painted armies. (see above, painted, but not as nice as these guys :(  )  Oh and slept once in a while too.
