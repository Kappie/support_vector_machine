Shop-vacs don't really seem to worry too much about details.  They are more interested in getting the bulk of the work done.  I think that if I drive around in the sun my car will be all sparkle sparkle from the inside. I may be blinded if that happens. I may find myself blinded by a gust of wind. I really feel like I am at the mercy of the elements when I am encased in machinery.    hmmm.  I would love to be the machine instead I think.  I want to be just like conky from pee wees playhouse.  I want a record player in my stomach, boom box in my chest, and i want to stutter all my words like prefuse 73 is programming my speach through his mpc.
