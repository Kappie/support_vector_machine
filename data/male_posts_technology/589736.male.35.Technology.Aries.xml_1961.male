Forgetting the topic of the exchange for a minute, I did hear a funny thing.  Bush was talking about the expiration of the "let's get all the dirt we can on everyone and imprison people without due process" act.  He paused for some reason, probably dramatic effect.  At which point there was a smattering of applause from who I assume were Democrats.  Then he continued and said that the terrorist threat would not expire on the same deadline, which of course got a tremendous round of applause.  I saw a replay of that portion of the tape this morning.  He definitely enjoyed that little "gotcha" moment.  And, like I said, ignoring the topic it surrounded for a moment, it was kind of funny.  Other than that, as much as I like politics, I can't stand the State of Union address.  It never really amounts to more than a chance for politicians to put on a public show of what they are for and against.  The party in power will say that it was a great speech.  The party out of power will say it failed to discuss the really important issues.  Instead, we watched a rerun of Early Edition on PAX.
