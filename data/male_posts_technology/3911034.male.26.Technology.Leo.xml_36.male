Despite the fact he has one of the best Joe Dirt style hair dos he is running circles around players 10yrs his senior and earning  3 times his wage if not more! I was going to pre-empt him as Legend of the Week before last nights game but I thought I'd give him a chance to prove himself and he passed with flying colours. Expect big things from this youngster in the not too distant future. Everton 1 - 4 Arsenal.
