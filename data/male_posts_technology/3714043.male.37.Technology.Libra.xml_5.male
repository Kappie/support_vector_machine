Work, trying to sleep, watching TV, rinse, repeat.  On the bad side, works been getting kinda crappy.  It's tough when your managers are your friends and the company is going through a rough spot.  One of my managers, who has been a friend of mine for about, I don't know, 10+ years now has thrown himself into his work so much, that that is all he is now.  You cant have a 2 minute conversation with him without it being focused on work.  It's like the friend I had was scooped out inside and replaces with a corporate pamphlet... and you know how fun those are to read in your spare time.  I used to hang out with him a lot, just chill, go for a bite, watch TV.... and I know this sounds crappy, but I don't even want to get phone calls from him anymore cause all we do is talk/bicker/complain about work.  It's like any possible conversation about anything else gets sucked into a black hole the moment the possibility of it gets near us.  I'm getting sick of work, the last thing I want to do is talk about it after work, during meal, in car rides, emails... My company has stolen my friend's soul, and I want it back.      urlLink    Corporate Life urlLink
