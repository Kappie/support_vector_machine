We'll have buildings to stay in, as we're not staying at the districs normal camp, Camp Burton.  We should have about 20-25 people going.  We'll take the kids out on a couple of nature hikes, during the day and at night.  I'm going to take my telescope along, so we can do alittle astronomy work.  During the night hike, I'll show them how to find the north star, how to locate the milky way, and various constellations.  We usually have a great time.
