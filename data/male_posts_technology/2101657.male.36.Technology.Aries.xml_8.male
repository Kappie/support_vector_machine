I decided to swing by, as they had a special on CD-R's, a 50pk for $4.99.  Well, go figure, by the time I got there shortly after work, they were sold out. I found out at the cash register that they had a substitute, but go figure, that one was sold out too.  It's an impressive store, and it was impressivly packed.  There were so many people there, that I decided to just get the movie I wanted then, as they had The Matrix Reloaded for $15.  I was going to walk down the computer goodies isles, but they were so jam packed, that I decided to not try and do my impersonation of a salmon going upstream.  It was nice having the store open, as McDonalds has been doing their Monopoly game, and they have had stickers for $1, $5, and $10 for use at Best Buy.  I had my little slip in hand with 7 of them, so my Matrix Reloaded cost $9.  Sweet deal.  I had the evening to my self since the family was out of town, so I sat down and watched it. The special effects are awesome. Just like the 1st movie, but 200% better. The only draw back was in the Agent's Smith fight scene, it was very obvious that it was CGI, and poor CGI at that.  Still impressive, but it didn't look like the actors  what-so-ever.  Well, off to start my Saturday, hope everyone has a good weekend, will post again later.
