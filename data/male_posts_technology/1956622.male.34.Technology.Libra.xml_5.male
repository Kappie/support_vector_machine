My money is running low so we got a bunch of old bread and even stopped at the store for another loaf and went to the waterfront in Everett.  Karissa and I spent about an hour feeding the seagulls.  She loved the birds and loved how they would pretty much follow her for bread.    I took Karissa to the marina to walk the marina after feeding the birds and she enjoyed the walk. It started to rain a little so we cut our walk short and went into one of the stores to get out of the rain.  Karissa wanted to have Ice cream so I got her some bubble gum ice cream.  I got a great picture of her blue face.    We went to the park luckily the sun came out it was still cool but the sun helped.  She ran around the park and played on the toys.  She had me spin her on the merry go around.  I can tell you I felt sick with all the spinning.  I am not sure how I used to do it.  Bedtime is the way it has been all week.  Nothing but one big issue.
