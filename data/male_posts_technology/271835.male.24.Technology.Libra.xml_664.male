Using the  urlLink email to Blogger feature  Stephen is publishing all the spam he receives at the address for that blog. This is then published in all it's nasty HTML glory. All e-mails to stephennewton.mofs@blogger.com are posted here uncensored. Anyone is free to pass judgement on them... or whatever. Repeating the email address here can only help boost the crap he gets.  One thought does spring to mind. It could be easily hijacked by unscrupulous bloggers trying to boost their linkbacks. All they'd have to do is email stuff containing their URL, this would then be indexed as a linkback by  urlLink Technorati ,  urlLink Blogpulse ,  urlLink BlogDex ,  urlLink Google  etc etc. I'm off to run a mass mailer. Bwahahaha!
