       
      Okay, I've come up with a solution to the sidewalk issue.  When I'm walking my dog Brandy, if she takes a dump on the lawn of someone who HAS shoveled, it gets picked up.  Otherwise, it's going to sit there as a badge of "I don't care about my neighborhood."    Seemed like a good answer at the time.
