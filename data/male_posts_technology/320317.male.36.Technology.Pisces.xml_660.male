CNET Radio Direct will be concise, important, and useable. You'll get this all in a compact, high-fidelity MP3 file that plays on the device of your choice."

 

 With the new  urlLink CNET Radio Direct  there will NOT be any "streaming" audio, but rather the listener must download a MP3 file and play it locally. I would assume this is much cheaper to produce considering CNET doesn't have to maintain a "web farm" of costly servers for streaming from both Microsoft and Real's streaming server products. However, you, the user will have to install a client application which takes advantage of "peer-to-peer networking" technology to manage the timely delivery and download of a twice daily MP3 file. Since you could download the MP3 file from your nearest neighbor rather than CNET's own servers, this further minimizes the cost to CNET of delivering their radio program to the masses. Could this be a new trend of listening to audio on the web? On a personal note, last summer I did purchase   urlLink XM Radio  mainly because of CNET Radio. I'm not even sure I'll even keep the XM Radio service now that the CNET channel is no more, although I do find myself listening to FOX News just as much. The comedy channels are pretty good as well. With everything that is going on right now, I really do like the up-to-the-second news. I guess the web and XM have turned me into a news junkie.
