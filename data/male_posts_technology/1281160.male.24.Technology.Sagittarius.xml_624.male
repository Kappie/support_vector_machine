S Rini, its not fair from my part in the friendship focus by abstaining for your marriage that too on a holiday and paying a visit even in a working day, Any way let me wait and see what is going to happen.  But, please do remember I made on time for your engagement (working day). Reg. snaps I will get u the best jpegs in a zip(around a MB) to ur office inbox....  BCP article is good.... plng. to call kicha by noon, let u know later...  one more point for vijay's querry is that, we are matured enough to maintain balance (to some extent) between ordinary day and a festival day...........  Yeah MDGs are really scintillating, but what efforts are taken towards the same.......... I think the time period is also very low compared (just 12 more years for 8) to the goals.  coming to empty space, put something let me comment later (hahahahaha ) sorry too busy to break head......  Cheers
