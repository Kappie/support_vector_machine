I am personally always fighting food demons and weight demons so I know about trying to lose weight etc, and for fun one time I did Atkins for 2 weeks and lost some awesome weight.   And then I ate some pizza and gained it all back! :)  So now I am sticking with tried and true - salads, exercise, and some painful late night choices like herbal tea instead of that gallon of Haagen Daz.    But can you imagine the money being made from all this?  I remember the high carb diets a few years ago and the high carb bars everyone had in their pockets.  Man, that is the kiss of death now!   OK, it's Saturday again, weekend again, wow, time flies. -Mustafa
