A while ago now I came up with a plan of getting the whole crew together for some photo shots around the island.  What we would do is get hold of a van for transport and an old Sofa.  We would then proceed to drive round the Island and at Random areas stop, get the sofa out, all sit on it and have a photo taken.  We could do this almost anywhere.  Gory Castle, St Brelades Beach, St Ouens Beach, Middle of Town, Jersey Airport, Faldoet Dolman and so on.   So go to the message board and put down your views.   urlLink Message Link   Danger
