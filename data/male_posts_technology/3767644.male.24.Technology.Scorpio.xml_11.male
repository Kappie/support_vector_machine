Thoughts that may never go, to leave me in sanity For these thoughts are mine and i am habituated The terminal feeling of loneliness that has been a company all along this far.  I fear  a change for I find comfort in discomfort for i know its extent I take a deep breath each time and sigh Each time love passes me by.  All i know is all I've known The madness of loving that made me pay I smiled when I paid those dues last yuletide For I lost all love when I lost my love.  I know I am a damned to a life of eternal lonliness I still like a fool watch the roads I walked Amongst the valleys and mountain side For I still carry hope deep in my heart... somewhere   (C) Copyright Ritesh Nair 2004
