She has this very nice back view, long hair, nice side profile(the type of girl I am looking for)  Suddenly, she turned around, and that action of her, made me go weak on my knees and my eyes were still glued on her. She has that smile that could turn a bad weather day into a sunny day. I think she's from Singapore, judging by her accent.  She was wearing this red jacket with black bottoms. Think she looks like one of the Jap movie star. Wonder if she's attached. U goon! of coz I think she is. What's a pretty girl like her, being unattached in this world?  Will try to get a pic of her ASAP.
