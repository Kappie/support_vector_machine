Synopsis: a whale is found dead on beach  local town too cheap to get rid of it properly so they stick half a ton of dynamite inside it instead. What they weren't expecting was the deluge of huge chunks of whale blubber (leave sound on - you have to hear the sound of falling whale lumps at least once in your life) - big enough to destroy cars they landed on.     I love the smell of exploded whale in the morning.
