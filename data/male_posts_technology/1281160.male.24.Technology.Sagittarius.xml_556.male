I told this to my PL, he says, if he tells that the next time, ask him to talk to me... am getting sandwiched between the two...   Reminds me of how we had a similar situation tackling the two extremes of RT Swamy and Balaji during our placement activities... Though it didn't achieve anything atleast now I'm not finding myself in an unfamiliar situation...
