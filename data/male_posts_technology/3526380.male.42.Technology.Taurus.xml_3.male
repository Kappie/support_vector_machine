I have no fecking idea.  But nonetheless, here I am.  I should be working.  But, WTF.  Here I am.  What drives people to Blog?  Most that I have seen seem to be driven by depression, desparation, the need to express their feelings, frustration, the need to express political views, passions about their interests, perhaps describe a situation in which they currently find themselves.  Me?  All of the above, I guess.  And none of the above.  I shouldn't be here.  I should be confidently pursuing my career, goals, and dreams.  But here I am.  Why?  I have no fecking idea.  Yet here I am.  Must be a reason.  Something deep.  Mysterious.  Or even completely pointless.  Probably something I haven't even figured out yet.   More to come soon, for those of you just hanging on the edge of your seat.
