They're greatful for our business...they show this by scheduling 7:00 PM confrence calls.  Here'z my take....  Give me the fucken work and i'll get it done before 6:00 and be home with Miss Pants by 7.  Noooo...i get to sit here until 8:00 on a fucken video conf call and stare at a bunch of people who don't have a clue.   Now that's nice....real nice...yeahhhh....thanks.
