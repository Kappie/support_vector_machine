Specification is very, very important, true.  But when you try to determine what a product should do in a group discussion, things don't work out.  Here's why:
 
    Experts are rare.   It's entirely unlikely that you will be able to gather a group of experts in the field that your product addresses.
   There is no BEST solution.   Even if there was a "best solution," the metrics required to accurately measure the differences between solutions does not exist.
   Group discussions among non-experts go nowhere.   This wastes time.  It's true that your specification period should consume a large portion of your development cycle, but not ALL OF IT! So what's the solution?  Specification by mandate.  You should have one or two people who are experts in your product's field.  They should know the market, what users you are trying to address, and where your product falls in with your company's other products.  With this in mind, the expert should develop the product specifications, run them through some sort of approval process, and then hand them to the developers for implementation.  
 
 Okay, lunch at my cubicle now.  Meeting with the QMS Auditors in five minutes, and then back to the doomsday meeting at 3:30p.  Cheers!
