I posted this at my blog a couple of days back, and had a decent enough response. Let's see how you guys react.  --------------------------------   I came across  urlLink this  article by Tavleen Singh via  urlLink Wonderbug's blog .  Moreover,  urlLink her last post  also got me thinking, or rather thinking again, on this topic. I left a long comment too at her post. Funny how some issues never get redundant!   Now I am not a very devout Hindu by any long shot. I never go to temples, attend  poojas  once in a while only because my parents stress on it (which they rarely ever do). In fact, I have often thought of converting to some other religion, most likely Islam, just to see if it makes the slightest bit of difference to me. But that doesn't mean that I am not aware of my history and heritage. I know more about my religion, and my caste than most people I have come across. I also take avid interest in reading up on the history and evolution of other religions. And all this has taught me one thing - many of us give a hell of a lot of importance to something as personal as one's religion and beliefs, more than what is sanely necessary. This is what politicians, most of them at least, make full use of.   I am not apologetic about being a Hindu. Just as I am not apologetic about being an Indian, Bihari, 22-year old, male, human being. I was born into it, and it is what I make of it, not what some ignorant western journalist projects it to be. That is why, it really offends me to my core when I hear the word 'Hindu' being mentioned in the media as something with orthodox, millitant, intolerant, despicable connotations. And that happens quite a lot to have missed your senses. I really don't care much about what BBC or CNN thinks of Hindus, which translates to a majority of Indians, apart from the fact that these are also inadvertently shaping the average foreigner's opinion about me. This is not very different form the picture that Hollywood portrayed of India as a land of loin-cloth clad, snake-charming, elephant-riding, mantras-chanting, black magic-practising, Kali-worshipping, idiots, for a very long time. But, what takes my goose is that even our own politicians are misusing 'secular' to mean 'anti-Hindu'.  BJP's been branded a Hindu nationalist party for eternity. There are people, and a substantial number at that, who might be dangerous to the idea of 'secularism', but there are saner people too, who just happen to be simply proud of being Hindus. It will be very naive on our part if we just get blinded by the media hype, and utterances by 'secular' parties' leaders, to believe that every single BJP worker is sharpening his knife to stab the next innocent minority community member that passes by. Come on, let's use our brains too, for once. Respect for another person is not possible in the true sense if you don't respect your own self. Similarly, you can't really respect another man's religion unless you respect your own religion too.  Actually, there are too many aspects to this and with all the thoughts erupting in my mind, I am afraid I might lose coherence. Any person with a basic sense of logic, an average memory, and some knowledge of our recent history can judge that no party today in our polity is really secular. There are some persons in every party who are, others who aren't. And so, judging an entire political party that is made up of so many brilliant individuals with their own individual traits and personalities as non-secular and fundamentalist smacks of ignorance. I could go on and on talking about the 'secular' credentials of other parties, but I am sure we are all knowledgable people here, and are already aware. The point is that public memory, as they say, is very short and very soon Gujarat riots would be forgotten. Just as Delhi re-elected Sajjan Kumar and Jagdish Tytler. Political parties, and the public, don't really care about how many people died in the riots, or who perpetrated them. Right now Gujarat is being cited by BJP baiters because it's fresh in our memory, fresh enough to extract political gains.  So to sum up there are two points that I want people to consider seriously. One, don't judge any party on the basis of whether it is secular or not, as none truly is. Two, and more importantly, don't get influenced by the media, and start believing that every thing Hindu is bad. Most of it is not. As with any religion. And that is my interpretation of Hindutva.
