Saleswoman:  This is regarding offsite storage of your data backup tapes.   Matt:  Oh, no thank you.   *click*   ...   *thirty seconds later*    Matt:  Hello?   Saleswoman:  Hi! Could I speak with  *name omitted* ?   Matt:  What is this regarding?   Saleswoman   coping an attitude  :  As I said a minute ago, this is about the offsite storage of your data backup tapes!   Matt:  Well, I'm very sorry, but  *name omitted*  is the president of the company and he does not deal directly with that sort of thing.   Saleswoman:  Well, could you tell me who in your organization  would  handle that?   Matt:  The IT director would be more appropriate.   Saleswoman   becoming very impatient  :  Well, could you tell me who that person is?   Matt:  Sure.  Matt Chancellor.   Saleswoman:  Could I speak with him?   Matt:  Speaking.   Saleswoman   sighs heavily    *a moment of silence*    Saleswoman   very annoyed  :  Bye.   *click*     I love taking sales calls.
