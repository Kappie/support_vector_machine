    
       Just come back from a great night in town.  My flatmate Zach and I met up with 'Captain' Kirk for a few rounds in Sports before speeding through Be bar, then back to Sports again to pick up Custard, Hannah and Gail.  Then on to Liquid for a few more drinks followed by immesurable casualties caused by my slightly odd, unrefined and somewhat uncontrolled dancing technique.  There was much rejoicing when I headed to the bar and this time I managed to avoid knocking over a bottle of Sol and sending lime in the direction of bar staff.  It's a friends birthday tomorrow so we're out for a special celebratory evening and then next week my sisters baby is due, the following week I've got friends over on the saturday and off to Andorra skiing with some Guernsey mates on the sunday for a week.  If you don't see me I'm not dead I'm just away*  [)amo (Still awaiting an official Toaster-assigned nick and appropriately offensive Toasterfiles t-shirt).  * = unless I die horribly on my skiis in which case, yep, I'm actually dead.  Bugger.
