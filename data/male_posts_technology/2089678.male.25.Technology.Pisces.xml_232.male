Well.. it really sounds like MUSIC and that too ROCK MUSIC for the ears of brainbench certification aspirants but wait..... all has got jazzed up. What happens when an apple needs to be shared between 1000s of hungry men? of course everyone is left without a piece of it. Thats what exactly has happned with Brainbench. After announcing the free tests they did not take care for the high availability of the data through their servers. For more than half an hour i tried to just login, forget taking any test.  By the way how much difference does it make if you get these certifications. I and may be the community would like to know any success stories. Please share your comments.
