And I find you've all turned into peace loving hippies, practicing free love. pah. Your pints are all puffs.    Anyway the  urlLink Sine link ILuvNufc posted earlier  has a picture of  urlLink wor hoose . That's ILuvNufc's and mine. We moved from that one about 20 years ago. I'll quickly point out that we aren't shirt lifting life partners but siblings. If you follow that row to the left for about 12 houses you'll find  urlLink Chez Tweedy . Also on the same estate lived  urlLink Jackie Lye  of Brush Strokes fame. And Ant  Dec lived in our lockup with Jimmy Nail. probably.
