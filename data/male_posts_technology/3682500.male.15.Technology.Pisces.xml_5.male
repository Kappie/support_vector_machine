What is it exactly? ThemeXP is a site that contains all sorts of skins, wallpaper, boot screens, logon screens, icons, and whatnot to jazz up the look of your computer. With thousands of options to choose from, you will find the perfect style to jazz up your computer with. Don't like the look of your default screen every time you load the computer? Pick one out from this site, maybe even make it look like another OS! Great site.  Rating: 8/10 - Good organization, easy to find skins and easy to install them. But beware of popups on this site...don't use IE with this site without getting a popup blocker first.  -RC
