I can only hope it goes well.  I spent my time today doing very little of anything.  The cat went to the vet for a checkup following his operation, and he was alright.  So, if he was emulating me by having an operation, then I should, by extension, be alright as well.  If anyone has been following this, thanks for reading.  I should return soon to post more exciting events.  If not, then I shall leave with the end of a quote.    "...the rest, is silence."
