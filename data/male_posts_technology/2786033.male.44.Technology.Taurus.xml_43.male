After all, it doesn't take three firefighters and a fire boss to put out a fire caused by an ill-placed cigarette butt (which is probably the last 'disaster' to occur at EUG). Oh, one of those Government employee+Union member employees may have missed a break once(a true disaster), but I doubt it. The more this money sucking gov't acts like a business, the better.
