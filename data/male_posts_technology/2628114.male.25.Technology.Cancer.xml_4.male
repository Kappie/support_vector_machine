After just 10 minutes, I have to give full credit to my brother-in-law, Brad, who exercises almost exclusively on those throughout the winter.  2 minutes got me sweating, 4 minutes and I was tired, and I thought minutes 5-10 would never come.  It may not have been the best for my knee, but it will certainly be a great advantage when I really want to train for hills.  I did a  5and2and5 on the ellipticals, then transferred to the stair climber, and finished with a 5and2 on some other technically advanced elliptical that surpasses the previous in coolness and effectiveness.  It allowed me to adjust the height of the front roller and in so doing adjust the muscles I was working.  Very cool and very helpful!  Gotta love those ellipticals!
