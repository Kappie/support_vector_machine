But I'm going home as one would expect... after a pretty long interval by my standards... and I'll enjoy a christmas treat from my friend who was my roomie in Mangalore at the time of my infy training...!!  And to top the icing, we have holiday on Dec 26th to enjoy a long weekend and will be compensating that by working this saturday...
