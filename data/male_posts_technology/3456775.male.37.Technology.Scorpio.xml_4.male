I picked up a habit from my brother-in-law of kind of sucking on the cigar for a few minutes before lighting up. This one really irritated my tongue, which is usually indicative of a more full-bodied, strong, cigar. And about the first inch or so was on the stronger side but after that it smoked more in the medium range. The ash held on fairly well and burned evenly.        I was able to get down to about 1 1/2" before I just had to put it out. for the most part I liked this cigar. It was strong, but not intensely so.  I didn't get any perfumy tastes and by mid morning of the next day (about 123 hours after smoking it) all of the aftertaste was pretty much gone.    All in all I would probably smoke this one again. Unfortunately I can't remember the size other than that it was closer to a corona.
