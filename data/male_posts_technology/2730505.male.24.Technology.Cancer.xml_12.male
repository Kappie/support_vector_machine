Not for any grand cause, necessarily...  but for something that tugs at your heart,  something that's your inspiration,  something that's your dream.   You owe it to yourself  to make your days here count.  HAVE FUN.  DIG DEEP.  STRETCH.  DREAM BIG.   Know, though, that things worth doing  seldom come easy.  There will be good days.  And there will be bad days.  There will be times when you want to turn around,  pack it up, and call it quits.  Those times tell you  that you are pushing yourself,  that you are not afraid to learn by trying.   PERSIST.  Because with an idea,  determination, and the right tools,  you can do great things.  Let your instincts, your intellect,  and your heart, guide you.   TRUST.  Believe in the incredible power of the human mind.  Of doing something that makes a difference.  Of working hard.  Of laughing and hoping.  Of lazy afternoons.  Of lasting friends.  Of all the things that will cross your path this year.   The start of something new  brings the hope of something great,  ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.   ----------------------------------------------------------   I've Learned   Author unknown   I've learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is be someone that can be loved. The rest is up to them.   I've learned that no matter how much I care, some people just don't care back.   I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and only seconds to destroy it.   I've learned that it's not what you have in your life, but who you have in your life that counts.   I've learned hat you can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes. After that, you'd better know something.   I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to the best others can do.   I've learned that you can do some thing in an instant that will give you heartache for life.   I've learned that it's taking me a long time to become the person I want to be.   I've learned that you should always leave loved ones with loving words. It may be the last time you see them.   I've learned that you can keep going long after you can't.   I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, no matter how we feel. That either you control your attitude or it controls you.   I've learned that heroes are the people who do what has to be done regardless of the consequences.   I've learned that money is a lousy way to keep score.   I've learned that my best friends and I can do anything or nothing and have the best time.   I've learned that the people you expect to kick you when you're down will be the ones to pick you back up.   I've learned that sometimes when I'm angry I have to be angry, but that doesn't give me the right to be cruel.   I've learned that just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have.   I've learned that maturity has more to do with what types of experiences you've had and what you've learned from them and less to do with how many birthdays you've celebrated.   I've learned that you should never tell a child their dreams are unlikely or outlandish. Few things are more humiliating, and what a tragedy it would be if they believed it.   I've learned that no matter good a friend is, they're going to hurt you every once in a while and you must forgive them for that.   I've learned that no matter how bad your heart is broken the world doesn't stop for your grief.   I've learned that our background and circumstances may have influenced who we are, but we are responsible for who we become.   I've learned that even when you think you have no more to give, when a friend cries out to you, you will find the strength to help.
