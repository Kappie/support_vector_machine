The boredom and depression flows like a sad, tired, river down the high street. Even the brass cows in West Centre seem to being mooing a little quieter than normal. It's as though the very air itself pushes down upon the citizens of Jersey, crushing spirits and smiles. Oh well, who gives a fuck because today I’m off to CANCUN!  Yes, in less than 48 hours me and my buddy Kirk will be frying to gas mark five, heavily marinated in tequila and served with an assortment of young American college girls. So long, suckers! Muahahahah!!!!
