I don't think I have ever gotten so much into an anime, it actually has good action and a cool story. It would make a freaking awesome videogame if they ran it with a Ninja Gaiden type engine. I have endured 91 episodes so far, and we are finally given the character Tsunade. After the whole Chuunin exam, we all wanted something different.  If you read the Newtype a month or two ago you are given a review for comic party. I looked at the store and found it, but it was something about yaoi so I put it back, being discouraged because I thought it was about doujinshi but no!  Then I went back a few weeks later and found that there was another manga called "comic party" I dont know how they ended up with the same title but they are completely different stories. The one I was interested in was there, with the doujinshi and all. But I am scared to buy it because of the impression.  Oh well who cares, Realbout Highschool 6came out and once the comic store gets it I will buy it from them because I want to support them. Screw Barnes  Noble with their Poetry Night.  I am almost finished with .hack//infection I will finally give myself the privledge to watch liminality, just a few more dungeons ^_^
