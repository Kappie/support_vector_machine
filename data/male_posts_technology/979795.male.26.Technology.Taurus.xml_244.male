It's been about a month since my breakup with my ex and I was doing some thinking and reflecting about my last relationship. I dunno why this occurred but I think it's because of what my ex said a few days ago. Can't rem which day she called last week, but she was asking me something about how to run scandisk on WinXP. Gave her instructions and she thanked me and we hung up. After that I went to watch TV and was downstairs the whole evening. Suddenly, Lynette (housemate and course mate) got a call from my ex, who was looking for me. (Apparently, she called my mobile 3x and because I was downstairs I didn't hear my mobile. Mind u, my room is on the 3rd level.) My ex was pretty pissed, she started telling me things like, what on earth did I install in her laptop without her permission and why did I put XP in her laptop in the 2st place when I last helped her to reformat her harddisk. Then she said everytime she tried to run NJWin (think is a chinese recognition program), NJWin would crash. She started blaming me for not asking her before installing XP instead of win98 etc. She said she tried running scandisk and it won't even carry that out properly. I was a bit pissed but I really controlled my temper. I told her I didn't know what the problem was and that I dunno how to rectify it. I said I could put in win98 for her again if she wanted me to (considering that it was the start of my holidays and I can make time to settle it). All she commented was she didn't want me to do anything to her laptop and since I couldn't solve the software problem she kinda hung up abruptly.  I was really annoyed with her tone. But I can understand it a little better when I found 3 missed calls on my phone and found out my house phone was in use by my housemates that evening as well. She might have tried calling me and the house so often that she just blew it. Plus she probably encountered the problem more than once each time she used it. But understanding her reasons for blowing her top don't mean that I'm excusing her for it. We are after all no longer a couple and I would really appreciate it if she stopped speaking to me like I bloody owed her something in my last life. To me, it only sounded like she called me up just to tell me off about me having installed XP on her laptop instead of Win98. To a certain extent I do admit that I don't remember consulting her before doing that. But another point I'd like to note is that I distinctly mentioned to her before that XP doesn't need NJWin anymore because of it's capability to recognise other languages (I installed that component for her as well). The only reason she might have for installing NJWin would be to play Chinese games. If she wanted to type or surf chinese sites, XP could've handled that.  I do not excuse my self from any part of my involvement in her frustration (no matter how small). But I really don't think she should overlook the big picturet that I wasn't intentionally evading any of her calls and the vents that were out of my hands (house phone in use). Also to note is that I had volunteered helping her reinstall back Win98 if she wanted me to. Because of all these, I really cannot excuse her for her behaviour. I'm sorry things turned out this way but I've made a resolve to not hold back these kinda emotions with respect to anymore outbursts by her directed at me. Naturally, her close friends will get the picture that I'm some kind of monster as they never heard about my side of story. I dun think I give a damn anymore. Just so long as I know that I really didn't do anything wrong (or intentionally did it). If she just want to call me up to give me a piece of her mind on the phone instead of solving her problem, I dun see the point. I absolutely refuse to entertain anymore such outbursts like that as though I was still her bf or something. Since I'm only a normal friend to her now, I do seriously expect to be respected as 1. Afterall I really don't blow my top at anything like that to my friend. I really have this feeling that all because of the way she responded, she isn't treating me as a friend anymore. Who on earth flares up so easily with a friend.  I don't want others to be too judgemental about her in anyway. Afterall, you never heard her side of her story and everything I've said is 1 sided. I think my ex is still basically an OK person just that we have a great deal of extreme differences that makes us clash around a bit too much.  Goodness gracious. I'm glad I'm documenting this part of my life and that someday I can look back and laugh at myself or something. I hope that I will learn something from all my earlier posts, no matter how insignificant they may seem.
