Ujjal Dosanjh, the former Premier of British Columbia is now the Health Minister. Maybe I am the only one that remembers, but this guy and the rest of his  urlLink old party  caused so many problems in BC, that we gave the  urlLink BC Liberals  a near dictatorship in Victoria. Near the end of Dosanjh's term as Premier, he sent millions of BC dollars to his home country of India to start himself some businesses.  Now this guy gets a promotion. He is in charge of Health Care, the most important program in Canada. Paul Martin seems to think that he can fill the cabinet with BC content and it will please us Westerners. It is a great example just how out of touch Ottowa is with Western Canada.
