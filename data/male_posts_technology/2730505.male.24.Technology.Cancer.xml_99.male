We won't get into that.  Anyways, it's back.  I can read again.  I am sad though since it is almost over.  It's been good.  It's a novel about four people and their choices in their lives.  It's really cool how one section is devoted to one character and then it goes through all of them one by one and then they slowly come together in the end.  At times it got hard to read because I'm not too familiar with the history behiind it.  It's been enjoyable so far and I can't imagine it to be not for the rest of the forty or so pages that I have left.  The movie was worthless (Meghan warned me anyways but I still wanted to see it).  We tried to watch it one time a couple of weeks ago but "distractions" prevented us from doing so.  It was nice that I could recognize some of the lines that the actors were saying on screen were directly from the book.  I liked the way that certain significant scenes from the book were also portrayed nicely on screen (the holding of hands through out the night, the screaming while making love etc.) but it was sorely missing the narration that just makes the whole book.  It could have been better if there was some sort of narrator to explain how their were feeling, the explanation of their past before they met each other etc. etc etc. (well like I said, I didn't really see a whole lot of the movie so that's what I got).  Anyways, the movie was bad but cute at the same time.  I still would think that one should read the book and just the book unless you want to get dissapointed by the movie or just watch it for the sake of novelty.  Another book that she lent me was The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand.  I plan on getting started on that one as soon as I finish The Unbearable Lightness of Being. It's pretty thick so it will take me a while.  I guess I'm some sort of retard as well since another work by this Author (Ayn Rand) is Atlas Shrugged.  Now I have not read that book but I think it's one of those well known books that people know about.  Now sure but I guess that too is worth a look.  I've also been looking at other Kundera books that I will probably purchase  I have read  urlLink The Unbearable Lightness of Being   So now I think I am hooked.  Here's the rest that I want to read.   urlLink The Book of Laughter and Forgetting    urlLink Identity: A Novel    urlLink Ignorance: A Novel    urlLink Laughable Loves    urlLink Immortality    urlLink The Art of the Novel    urlLink The Joke    urlLink Slowness: A Novel    urlLink Farewell Waltz: A Novel    urlLink Life is Elsewhere   There's a lot of reading and I am afraid that I don't know if I will like them all.  I guess I better start from the top huh?
