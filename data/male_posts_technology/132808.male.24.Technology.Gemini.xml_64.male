Well, I was looking through the Winnipeg Sun the other day, and I noticed a picture with a couple of teams at the U of M playing street hockey.  One of the teams was called "Taco Fish", and the other?  You guessed it, Ninja Boot.    Part of me is pissed because I feel ripped off, but part of me feels good that I added something to Winnipeg's Pop Culture.  If Ninja Boot takes off, there'll be hordes and hordes of guys who claim they invented it.  But only one will be telling the truth:  me.
