We always say that absence of light is darkness. Why don't we ever say that absence of darkness is light? Therefore, I am in utter confusion as to whether light is prevalent everywhere or darkness is. There is also another view as to both darkness and light are 2 mutually exclusive entities. Please enlighten me on this.  I hope nobody has the urge to kill me on reading this.   As one of the ardent bloggers put it as a comment in my previous blog I will include my  'signature'  in this blog. As usual, I thank you for your patience and please feel free to comment.
