It's Saturday and we may not be fortunate to be at Inverness, but party fever is brewing.   The girls (K), are out shopping for more products made only from the worlds most protected and endangered species by multinationals, who have successfully convinced 98% of the worlds female population that panda puss keeps skin looking younger and that the eye balls of the flying penguin are great for that special eye lash tint.  They have returned....Alas.  Anyway...no real news, Friday night was filled with big party for James, so now am resting up and taking it easy. (James and Anna say hello by the way....they are jealous too).  Kaia is becoming a red head...  We All Miss you.   J.
