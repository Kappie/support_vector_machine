At least I recognized that as incorrect.  Then I asked  urlLink Jeeves , and his suggestion of TURET'S, which I had before my friend intervened and I updated, was apparently wrong as well.  But you know, I'm sure that Jeeves gets tired of answering the same old questions day in and day out: ROOSTER-SHAPED OVEN MITS FOR SALE ON E-BAY. SHIPS IN 2-3 BUSINESS DAYS... HOT PICTURES OF ANNA KOURNIKOVA. WALLPAPERS, POSTERS, DESKTOP THEMES, MORE...  So, just to mix things up for the poor guy, I like to engage him a little more personally.  Though judging from his responses, he's not used to the attention. Q) What's going on? A) REGISTER ONLINE, PREPARE WITH REAL SAT QUESTIONS... Q) Got any big weekend plans? A) KNITTING AND OTHER LAZY ACTIVITIES IN A BUSY LIFE... Q) So is that what a British manservant search engine does with his free time? A) TOM SELLECK WAS SO GOOD LOOKING!...  Even though the man apparently can't spell worth a flip, I think we should all take a moment to get to know the man behind the machine before we rush on with our selfish inquiries.  Just a thought.  Of course gon't tell him, but I prefer  urlLink GOOGLE , myself.
