This was not before I made Brad drive me to the Mason Rec Center, lie and pay for me to get in, and run with me.  According to him I ran close to 5 miles on some cushy, indoor track.  Since I have a little more elaborate stretching routine than Brad, he was able to start before me and get a little more distance in.  All in all, it was a good run which served as a good warmup to the Saturday run.  I continue to feel soreness or aching in my shins and calves but it's not the pain similar to my past knee injuries.  Other than that, my legs feel good and my knee pain has all but subsided.
