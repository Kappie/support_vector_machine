You know, for all Bush's faults, at least he doesn't go around flapping the bird at the legions of people who oppose him.   And yet, this arrogant tool is running for the American presidency... if it had been Bush, you can bet there'd be a whole mess of morons rolling around in their own muck. And probably screaming "Bush Lied!" and "It's All About The Oil!" and "Death to the Infidels" etc.
