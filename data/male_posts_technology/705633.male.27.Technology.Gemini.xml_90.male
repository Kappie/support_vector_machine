Here's a picture of one very similar:     It's a Honda CRX (know in the USA as a Honda Del Sol)  I am totally smitten with it.. drives like a dream, smooth with plenty of power and looks fantastic. I loved my Mini to bits, but this thing rocks. The gearbox is smoother than a snake covered in vaseline riding a water slide.
