Do not read  it if you find taking a dump to be just part of every day life and something  that should never be mentioned or discussed.  Do not blame me.  You have been warned.  Thank you for your attention.    The Perfect Dump Every once in a while, each of us experiences a perfect dump, it's rare, but a thing of beauty in all respects.  You sit down expecting the worst, but what  you get is a smooth sliding, fartless  masterpiece that breaks the water with the splashless grace of an expert diver. But that's not the end of it. You  use some toilet tissue only to find that it  was totally unnecessary. It makes you feel  that all is right with the world and you are in perfect harmony with it.  The Caesarian Dump Pain! That's what this dump and childbirth have in common. Its simply a case of too much dump trying to go through too small  a hole, and there's no obstetrician to  help.  The Beer Dump Talk  about nasty dumps. Depending on the dumper's tolerance, the beer dump is the end result of too many beers. it could have  been 2 or 22, it doesn't matter. What you get  is a sinister, lengthy, noisy dump  accompanied by a malevolent fog that could close a bathroom for days.  The Chili Dump Hot  when it goes in, and rocket fuel when it leaves. The chili dump stays with you all day, making your tush feel like a  heat shield.  The Cable Dump Long, curly and perfectly formed like 2 feet of E13 telephone CO- axial cable. It loops lazily around the bowl, like a  friendly serpent. You notice it has three  rest rings encircling it. You wonder  admiringly, "DID I DO THAT? Where did it come from?" You leave the bathoom pleased with yourself.  The Latrine Dump In case you didn't know, a latrine is a hole in the ground with a tent around it where soldiers, boy scouts and flies  go to dump. Tip: Don't ever, ever look in the  hole.  The Mona Lisa Dump This is the masterpiece of dumps. It's as perfectly formed as it can be. Delicate and slender with intricacies that  would make da Vinci weep. And just think, you  made it yourself. You may even want to break  out the Polaroid, but maybe that's going a bit too far.  The Empty Roll Dump You're done...you reach for the toilet paper only to discover that empty cardboard cylinder. A mild panic begins  coldly in your throat. You could use the  curtains...no, someone would say "Where are  the curtains?" Then what would you say? The rug?...too cumbersome. Then you must come to the same conclusion that  every "empty roll dumper" must face...Pull up  your slacks, tighten your tush and wriggle  yourself to the nearest full roll.  The Splash  Back Dump You send the dump on its way, it  drops like a depth charge into the bowl  creating a column of cold bowl water that washes your bottom with a startlingly unpleasant shock. Now you're wet  and embarrassed. Tip: Blot instead of  wiping.  The Aborted Dump You are in mid-dump when the phone rings. What do you do? ABORT! Pinch it off, go for the phone, and save the rest  for later. It isn't pretty, but you've gotta  do what you gotta do.  The Alfresco Dump Everyone has had to go outdoors from time to time. This can be a rather pleasant experience really. The open air, the  nature, and a good bush all contribute to the  peaceful ambiance that our primitive  forefathers must have enjoyed. What can screw up this harmonious interlude is a troop of brownies or a patch of  poison ivy.  The Childbirth Dump This is a dump that is simply too big to go through the aperture provided by nature for the purpose. You sit there,  thinking over your dilemma. First it hurts,  and it isn't going to get any better. You  wonder if you'll ever see your loved ones again. You imagine the newspaper headlines screaming "Man dies trying to hatch monster loaf". You realise you'll have to  resolve the crisis before you can leave the  bathroom. Basically there are only three  things you can do: 1. Scream 2. Call an Obstetrician 3. Hope like hell you have enough Vaseline to get you through it.  The Tijuana Trot Dump The phrase "Shit Happens" really applies here in a big way. When the ice in your tainted margarita makes contact with  your lower intestinal tract, the fun begins.  For the next 72 hours you'd be better off if  you carried your own portable toilet with you because you will spend most of that time on the pot and the rest of the time in a foetal position. Now you realise  why Mexico never had a navy.  The Machine Gun Dump You're just sitting there in a state of sublime peace when all of the sudden you emit a group o noisy gassy bursts  that break the silence like machine gun fire.  The guy in the next stall hits the floor like  a combat veteran cradling his umbrella like an M16...damn commies.  The Sound Effect Dump You feel a noisy one coming on. Relatives, friends or work mates are within earshot, so you must employ some clever  techniques to cover the disgusting sounds you  are about to emit. Timing is obviously very  important here. At the precise moment of release, try the following sound effects: 1. Flush the toilet 2. Sing the first two stanzas of your national anthem 3. Drop a  handful of quarters on the floor  The Security Dump You have enough on your mind when you're in the bathroom without worrying about a lockless door and someone bursting  in to find you in mid-dump mode. So how can  you prevent this embarrassing spectacle from  taking place? One way is to strategically place your foot against the door. If you can't reach to do this...hum loudly.  Th Cling-On Dump For the most part you've completed your dump, but there's one little morsel that refuses to drop off. You're  getting impatient. Someone else wants to use  your stall. So, you grip the seat with both  hands and wriggle, twist and pump but that last little stubborn piece just hangs there, suspended, clinging like canned peach between you and the bowl  water. Maybe the person pounding impatiently  on the door has scissors.  The Houdini Dump You go, then you stand up to flush, and the darn thing has disappeared. Where'd it go? Did it creep down the  pipe? Did you dream the whole thing? Is it  lurking out of sight? Should you wipe...maybe  you should just to make sure you went. Should you flush? You'd better, because if you don't, you know it will reappear and smile at the next person who comes  in.  The Flu Dump You  feel so bad that you don't know which end of you to put down first. You have roaring cramps, so you sit down. Then a wave  of nausea rolls over you like a cold fog, so  you stand up and cramps squeeze your  intestines like a vice so you sit down again...up down up down. Don't you wish Mum were close by?  The Porta-Pottie Dump Construction workers and outdoor concert goers will tell you about going in a portable toilet. My best  description would be, "Its like taking a shit  in an upright coffin". It's claustrophobic  and it smells bad...best advice...go in a paper cup.  The Proctologist Dump In the beginning, the lord created the earth, the sky and the firmament, but I hope he didn't create this dump,  because there is nothing biblical about it,  you run out of gas. That's right, you run out  of propulsion. The dump is right there at the end of your barrel and refuses to go any further. You grunt, you squeeze, you wriggle but it just stays there like a  lump of lead. You've only got two choices  here. One is to squeeze the damn thing back  up your intestine and wait until next time. The other is to pretend you're a proctologist and go after it yourself.  Not a pretty picture is it??  The Whole Roll Dump No matter how much you wipe, it doesn't seem to be enough. You blow the whole roll and you have to flush 25 times  too. The whole episode is consumer  waste.  The Graffiti Dump You flush the dump and the swirling motion of the receding bowl water forces the dump to the porcelain sides,  scraping a creative squiggle on its way down.  You flush again but the curlicue hangs there...love it or leave it. Its your choice.  The Encore Dump Ahhhh, you're done, so you wipe, put yourself together, wash your hands and are about to vacate the bathroom when you  feel another dump coming. You have to return  for a curtain call. The world's record is  seven encores.  The Born Again Dump This is a dump that's going so badly, you say "Lord, if I live through this, I'll take up religion" you always get  through it, but seldom keep the promise you  made in desperation, because a born again dump  is like childbirth...you forget the pain quickly.
