Oh and yea, there's like 9000 users who have to be audited too.  It's a bit strange for me because I don't have the relevant IT background but the reason I was put on the project was because I'm familiar with most of the sites it involves (at least in NSW) and just from today, I can see it would have been really hard for someone else to come in fresh.  There is another guy who's been contracted to audit the project as well - I'm glad I don't have to do it alone!
