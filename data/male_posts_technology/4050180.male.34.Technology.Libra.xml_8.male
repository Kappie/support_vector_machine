About a week or two before I moved to my wife's hometown, a reorg happened at my company, and    J-Lo    became my boss. This was an important twist.    Why do I call her   J-Lo  ? Because that was her nickname. It probably stuck because that's really her initials, and she is hispanic (half Spanish), and in great shape - though she's shorter and curvier than the real   J-Lo  . Besides, its a lot nicer than her other nickname - 'Patch'. One of the  girls  on our team started it, and us guys loved it so it stuck too. 'Patch' came from the fact that   J-Lo  , like many of the young 24 year old attractive females in our office, used to wear skimpy little tops that didn't come all the way down to her waist. The problem was - well ... have you ever heard of a happy trail?   J-Lo   had sortof a reverse happy trail. She had a little hairy trail that went from her lower back down to her nether regions - thus the nickname 'Patch'. Nicer co-workers might have told her about the 'Patch' - but not our team. We just used the nickname behind her back because that's the kind of assholes we were.  Now, the moral of this entire confession, if it wasn't such a pointless ramble, could be "Never let a cheerleader have your promotion" (  J-Lo   used to be a college cheerleader). If   J-Lo   hadn't been my boss a lot of the stuff I'm leading up to might have never happened. You see, several months before, the leader of another team transferred, and we needed a team lead. I had seniority and was the obvious candidate for the job but I didn't want it. At the time, I was trying to get a little better 'work-life' balance and the last thing I wanted or needed was more responsiblity. I recommended   J-Lo   for the job. Most of the higher ups were against it, mainly because she was the youngest memeber of the team. Trouble was,   J-Lo   had just been passed over for a promotion on her own team and had transferred to ours. She didn't have much technical expertise yet, being new to the team, but she was sharp, super intelligent, a type-A personality, and an incredibly hard worker. And she was undoubtedly going to quit if she didn't get the promotion that I didn't want. In the end,   J-Lo   got the promotion because she worked her ass off, she deserved it, and (unbeknownst to her) because I was willing to smooth the path for it to happen.  And several months later, the reorg happened and   J-Lo   became my boss. Since I had already made plans to move and begin working from home, I was thinking the reorg would completely screw things up. So I had a meeting with   J-Lo  , explaining the arrangement I had with my old boss and that I was planning on leaving. She had to choose between keeping the most experienced, and best :) player on her team and letting him work remote, or losing me completely. So she made the fateful choice to keep me. Then the real fun started.
