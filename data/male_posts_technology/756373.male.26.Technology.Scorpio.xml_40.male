It's old news already, but I'll say it again anyway : Blizzard has announced a 3rd person Metal Gear Solid clone /squad based tactical shooter in the Starcraft universe. Which is a frikkin good idea, imo. Where it turns sour though, is Blizzard's rather silly announcement that it will be developed for consoles only. No PC version or even a port planned. Nothin. Nada. Sweet fek all.  Way to go Blizzard, you have just  urlLink jumped the shark.  The fans are livid. Blizzard was to PC gamers what David Beckham is to soccer - Blizzard is today's  definition  of what makes computer games cool. We PC gamers , despite everything, despite the constant advances of consoles and console fans snubbing and ridiculing PC's as a gaming platform, despite it ALL , we at least had Blizzard. We had our trump card. No matter how many PC developers jumped ship, we could proudly say, "Our band, Blizzard, plays on!" Well, looks like the band has just jumped ship as well. Or is that the shark? Because alienating a huge existing fanbase in the hopes of securing console sales is precisely that. Compared to the console industry, pc gaming has  way  more in the way of competition - literally hundreds of developers , as opposed to the scant dozens for any one console. Giving a fanbase secured through years of hard work the proverbial finger is A Dumb Thing To Do(TM). All the baying dogs at Blizzard's heels need is an opportunity like this. Where Blizzard could have secured a sizeable and LONG TERM fanbase in the multiplayer first person/third person action genre (ala Tribes2), they've instead opted to make a quick buck on the consoles. An area virtually untouched on PC's as well, should they have chosen not to go multiplayer/FPS, is the Metal Gear Solid style 'shooter' on PC - there are precious few, if any. MGS2 was never ported to PC. The closest we come to stealth based games is the Rainbow Six / Ghost Recon franchise, and the ancient PSX port, the original Metal Gear Solid. But the PS2 has MGS2, and the XBOX will soon have Splinter Cell (as will the PC..). Where Blizzard had PC fans who would have bought Ghost no matter HOW crap it was, they instead choose to enter the console market, and let's face it : most console gamers couldnt give a crap about Blizzard. They want their racing games and their fighting games and their console RPG's. They want their Capcom games and their Electronic Arts titles and their Squaresoft products. A good portion of console gamers don't know Blizzard from a hole in the ground, whereas every single last motherfucking PC gamer on the planet knows who made Starcraft.  I could rant on and on - I'd love to see a PC version, I'd love to be able to play a zealot on the battle field and go toe to toe with other players, or jump into Goliath and go stomping around the Confed borderworlds shooting down Mutas, or lurk underground as a Hydralisk and ambush hapless marines as they come ambling along. Sadly, it looks like it may never happen. So way to go Blizzard. I give that Shark Jump a 10 out of 10.
