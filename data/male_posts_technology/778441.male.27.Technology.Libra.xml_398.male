On being made aware of this bizarre judicial order, Chief Justice Khare said...   "What is happening in Gujarat? By giving Rs 40,000, you can obtain a judicial order? If this is the state of affairs, only God knows what will happen to the country,"   Well... thats the question that every one in India seems to be asking... for a long time now!
