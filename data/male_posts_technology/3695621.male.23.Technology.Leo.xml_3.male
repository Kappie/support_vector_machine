I haven't been able to quit thinking about it daily since then.  I'm completely addicted.   I don't think I could stop of I tried.  It's hard to put into words my feelings about the sport, but I'm going to try to do it here over time.  I also need a place to daydream about skydiving, and journal my career in the sport.  As of last weekend (June 13), I have 37 jumps logged.  I also brought my mother Rebecca and my brother Andrew out for the weekend.  My mom did 2 jumps on Saturday.  She told me it was the greatest experience of her life.  I'm pretty sure those were her words.  My brother Andrew was able to fly the plane to altitude for her second, and my 37th jump.  I'm glad he had the guts to ask!  If you ever go, make sure to budget an extra hundred bucks for the video.  It's worth EVERY PENNY.  The guys at SkyCam are amazing in all aspects of arial photography and video editing.  You recieve a 6 minute video dubbed to music, and professionally edited with visual effects that will blow your mind.  I'll find the time soon to post my mom's video as a sample.  I truly regret not having my Tandem jump videotaped.     I started on Friday, April 2nd with 2 tandem jumps.  I was back the next day with $1800 in hand for the full AFP package.   15 jumps, all with videotape and expert coaching.  I went through ground school on that Saturday, and did AFP Levels 1-5 on Sunday.  The experience at SDC is second to none.  I was lucky enough to jump with each of the 4 full time AFP Instructors.  I felt honored to be coached by the two owners of the Drop Zone,  urlLink Rook  and  urlLink Missy  for several of my AFP jumps.   urlLink Dave Cicciarelli  was the instructor that I logged the most jumps with.  He also took my mother on her first Tandem.  The man has over 12,000 jumps logged and is absolutly AMAZING.  He has a true love for the sport.  I also jumped several times with  urlLink Nanette .  Imagine a person with the most energy, joy, and passion you've seen that you've ever seen, and and then triple it.  That's Nanette.  And Nanette, if you're reading this...  We still need to drink some of that graduation tequlia (Don Julio of course!) ;)    I'm especially interested in canopy piloting, belly flying, and freeflying, and one day hope to become a tandem master.  It was the greatest feeling to introduce my mother to the sport, and I hope to introduce many others.  If you're thinking about your first jump and aren't quite sure, just visit SDC.  The people there are one of the greatest aspects.  Everyone will go out of their way to make you and your guests feel completely welcome and at ease.  If you're licensed, and looking for a someone to jump with, find me!  I'll jump with just about anyone.  By next season, I should even be able to help you out with a place to stay.  I've just got to move my RV up there and find a slot.  It's beginning to get late, and I'm starting to get tired.  It's been a long weekend.  So...  ... To Be Continued
