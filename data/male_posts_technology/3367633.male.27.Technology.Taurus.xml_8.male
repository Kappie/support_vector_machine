Oh well. At least the receptionist was funny. She was a pre opt transexual. If I hadn't spent all the time around deserie in Lexington I don't think I would have known.   I decide to have all the normal std test done. Hep and Hiv being the two most perdomiate ones.   I tried to lift up the pad on the desk i got the other day and found out that its a solid green pad. not wood at all.
