Owing to the fact that both of us are pretty bad at our culinary skills and that too coking Punjabi food at home would have been more of an exercise in itself, we decided to hunt for a good place to hog.  As I have mentioned before, hunting for a good place to eat in Bangalore can sometimes become quite annoying. We took the Bangalore Times which has a special section on food on Fridays where the restaurants throw up ADs in the anticipation of the fact that all the IT people in the city would definitely want to move out of their daily boring schedules and dine out on the night of Friday as Saturday happens to be a holiday.  So, Kalpana jumped ahead of me to grab the paper and was pretty fast in finding out about some restaurant by the name "Chandani Chowk" in Koramangla which happens to be 'the' place to have Punjabi food (well according the AD at least). Directions Madame??  "Oh, its on the Koramangla 80 ft road next to Microland ", she said.  Only after reaching Microland and knowing the fact that the 80 ft Road was no where near to this so called landmark, I knew for sure we were lost but still, to try our luck out, we went as far as Asian Sports Village and found nothing. What next?  "Well, now that its getting late and we are hungry too, lets go to the Feast of Asia ", she said, a little disappointed though as I knew she wanted to have something good. (not that Feast of Asia is not good)  So, we started moving back to where we came from and were all set to park our Honda 'Activa' (can't we make that invisible) when I saw something just opposite to Feast of Asia that made my eyes sparkle. No No!! It was not  "Chandani Chowk"  but another Punjabi restaurant called  "Dal Roti" . :)   Dal Roti  At first I thought this place would not be as nice as it turned out to be. Situated on the first floor, just opposite to the Feast of Asia, this place is really 'the' place to go if one is looking for a break from the daily dose of South Indian delicacies. The menu is in English but reads Hindi. So, one can find the name of the dish in pure Punjabi iStyle, "Sarsoon da Saag aur roti" and what more it also serves some Chinese dishes and the section in the menu for those delicacies reads "Chini Chini" .. I thought that was really cute.   So, what did we have? Before I answer that I would like to add that this place serves both vegetarian as well as the other kind. Well, we started with the Veg Clear soup, which was really well made, no additives, no sticky business, plain clear soup with whole bunch of vegetables. To accompany that we went for the "Dandi Veg Kebab", something really delightful, and came as five kebabs rolled on small sticks served with Pundeney ki Chutni.    For the main course we went for Karela Masala (wow!), Rajma and can you believe it, these guys serve you plain atta rotis, the one your mother would make for you. Though they also have the regular variety of breads usually available in any restaurant these days, I would definitely vouch for the plain ones.   Well, the food was tasty (no doubt) and quite in the budget too but then there were so many other things to try out, looks like I would have to pay these guys a visit again :)   Till I find where "Chandani Chowk" actually is, its "Dal Roti" all the way.
