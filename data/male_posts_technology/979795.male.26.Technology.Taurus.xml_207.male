Proabably because I did it really slowly.  After awhile, it suddenly dawned on me about an experience with some beginners I had last week.  I was paired with a new-comer to the Uni's dojo and we were going through Shihonage. Well, each time I brought him down to the ground, he was able to slip out of the pin I had on his arm either completely or at least halfway by rolling out from under his own arm. This brought to mind about what I was doin (or wasn't doing).  I wasn't able to completely hold him in a pin because my technique wasn't really good, and second because I wasn't commmitting fully into the technique either.  Just a few minutes prior to my blog (and what prompted me to write this blog), I was surfing around AikiWeb and reading some articles. That's when the picture of the scene I had in last week's class just popped into my mind. (I dun understand why because what I was reading didn't bear any close link.)  Anyway I remembered a second instance in which I paired up with Steve, who's been with the dojo for about a school term. I remembered him being stiff when I was still fumbling with a kokyuh o technique on him. (In his own friendly words, he said it's probably him "just being difficult"... nice chap hehheh.) Anyway, some of the techniques I did went easily on others but not on him. Similarly, I was poor in my technique and I was still trying to be 'nice'.  I'm not saying I should go around breaking pple's arms, but I'm just hoping that I can train towards being able to feel how a beginner is coming towards me and still being able to handle him despite his 'stiffness'. In addition to my previous blog, here's another point I can look forward to by training with someone who is unfamilar in Aikido.  I should explore the little loopholes which my partner exposes and make use of them fully. If I should 'hurt' him/her a little in the process (pls note that I dun mean injuring my partner), I think that is a form of training for them too. If they decide to stop participating because "that chap in the dojo always gets too rough", I think they are limiting their own Aikido experience. But if they should see and understand something from it, I think they might've discovered something about Aikido.  We should endeavor to moderate a little of our "niceness" to our partner, not to make things unnaturally easy (or hard) for them. Instead, we should probably apply whatever level of restraint and 'nastiness' with the thought that whatever we do to them will enable them to realise something for themselves. It's not easy to keep this in my mind when I'm thinking of learning a technique by pairing up with a senior, but it sure will be easier to try it out with a junior.
