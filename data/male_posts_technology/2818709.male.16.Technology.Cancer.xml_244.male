Upper respiratory disease...We didn't get to em in time, and they got sick...and...yeah...We have 3 left that are healthy.  Grand total of cats that have died in the house (to my knowledge): 4  Yeah. I walked into the living room, dad was asleep, and i noticed that one of the kittens didn't seem to be breathing. I poked it....and moved it a bit...and nothin. I looked at it's chest for a minute...nothin. Conclusion: Dead as a doornail.
