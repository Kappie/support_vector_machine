The lineup is now annouced on the  urlLink official  site. I must say the Saturday and Sunday lineups are underwhelming. But I am looking forward to Built to Spill, Death Cab for Cutie, Pixies, Crooked Fingers, The Walkmen, President of the United States of America, and Cobra High.  see ya there ;)
