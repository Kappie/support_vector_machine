After discussion, I think it would be helpful to clarify a little bit what I mean by that.  So here goes.    Individualism is the belief that the world (and specifically things religious) function in terms of the single unit, the individual.  It is the idea that people rise and fall on their own, sin on their own, believe on their own, and interact with God on their own.  "Me alone" is the secular version, and "Just Me and God" is the religious version.  Individualists can't imagine confessing the sin of the group, taking part in the judgment of the group, or coming to God to worship as a group.  Individualism is a fundamental American assumption that influences much of our thinking.    Of course, Individualism is wrong and sinful, and has terrible consequences in our lives, as do all false beliefs.  People are designed to live in community, and find meaning and importance and fulfillment in relationships.  We know this is true because we see that God Himself is not an individual, but the Three-in-One, the Eternal Community.  God is not "satisfied in Himself", because He (the Father) is not alone.   This is Trinitarianism, the only satisfactory worldview for life on earth.
