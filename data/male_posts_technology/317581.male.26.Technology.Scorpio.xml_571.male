Love is able to have you take chances and give flight to new ideas more readily than any other form of hypnotics or drug. Love makes you want to be someone that is an image of what the person you love wants. Love can inspire you to learn a foreign language or take up scuba diving. Love can take your fears and throw them out the window. Love is such an awesome thing.
