Kai - I was very proud of us keeping control of our emotions at the airport, especially considering my chronic PMS at the moment. Was that sharing too much??? Anyway, if my estimations are correct you will be landing in Kuala Lumpur in about an hour. Hope that you got some sleep and that no-one dared to come and sit next to you!  James - We must stick together through this difficult separation! While I draw the line at  urlLink Tupperware  parites I am most happy to come round tonight and cook you dinner - give me a call!  Gede - It is times like these I miss you the most. When I'm sitting in a tutorial listening to Marselina (bitch! bitch!) waffle on about merge sort join type things and transaction processing and wondering how the hell I'm going to pass my PHP test tomorrow. Heh. Have a wicked time in London with Kaia! Send us postcards!
