I have taken many adventures from the Wayfarers Brotherhood and in all of them I am overcome with a sense of loss for my companions. It simply seems that no one else of Norrath wishes to help me in my quest. They are all greedy for fame, riches or magical jewels. I am now at a loss.   Though there is one Shadow Knight, a dark elf that beings my hope and joy. His teasing taunting have showed me that even outside of my former companions the people of Norrath can stand up to the evil and wish to overcome it. His name is Sivius. We have done many adventures together in the dungeons under Norrath and we plan to do many more.   There have been groups with us that seem to want to perish us all. Yet with Sivius I have not perished yet and neither has he. There are some arrogant fighters and spell casters in Norrath that seem to believe that they can accomplish everything themselves without the help of others. There was a barbarian warrior who would pull massive mobs when all were low on energy. He did meet his doom a few too many times; however Brell told me that he chooses his own destiny and that I should heal the others before him. I felt bad however I did as Brell told me. There was also a wizard who told us repeatedly that she can take on a dungeon by herself alone. A few hours later I saw many of her bodies that Brell did not see fit to bring back to life lying outside a cave. I believe Brell has taught her humility.  I will rest now and rejoin with Sivius tomorrow for more adventures, he is very persistent and willing to join me on my quest. It is a very nice change from the eager for fame population that lives on Norrath.  Akcron â€“ Ziggur! Wait for Backup!!
