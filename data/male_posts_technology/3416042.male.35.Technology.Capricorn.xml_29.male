But the primary reason for the trip is that we're conducting focus groups around a project we're doing at work.  What I wanted to say here is that it's really impressive and exciting to participate in this activity for the first time.  They treat us very well as the people (via Microsoft) funding the focus group.  We have a room with three tiers of desks, very nice chairs, access to the internet, food and drink, and a mirror window plus microphone to be able to listen in on the focus group itself.  It's very comfortable.  Beyond the sheer physical niceties, the ability to get a very targeted group of people together to go through a carefully planned out discussion to either validate or refute our assumptions in our planning is just downright cool.  I wish such things had been attainable for my small business!
