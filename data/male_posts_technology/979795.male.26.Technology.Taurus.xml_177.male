All of us took a lot to keep our strength up for the journey back the way we came yesterday. We had the nicest hardboiled eggs. The egg white was solid but the egg yolk was only half or three quarter cooked.   1045 hrs  Departed Osterbo. We moved a lot faster and we made good time, possibly because we didn't take the steeper route this time. It also felt like there were more down slopes on the way back. Justin led and I was trailing behind with Daniel between us. Halfway through, Daniel took the lead. Being the last man, I lagged behind quite often. A few times, the guys had to pause for me to catch up with them. That says a lot about my level of fitness. I guess there's a lot of training I'll have to do when I get home. Might have to do some thigh strengthening exercises too.   1500 hrs  Ended much earlier than intended. We decided to hang around a stream where we washed up (no skinny dipping this time). We immersed our blistered feet into the ice-cold water and it felt really good. We took some photos here as well. I was quite happy that my legs felt stronger and hadn't tightened or cramped up today.  The cab came 15 mins earlier than before. We returned to Flem and lodged back the same hostel. We were given different rooms though. This time it was a room for 3 instead of a dorm. Dinner was a simple meal of pasta with eggs. Justin was trying to achieve the same standard of the eggs we had in Osterbo. He didn't quite make it for this first try. We had early dinner and an early shower. We even had time to wash our clothes in the laundry.   2045 hrs  Feeling a little bored â€˜coz we haven't got anything to do. Justin popped out to get some chips for snacks. At this point we got into some random chat and read up on some pamphlets, which we picked up here and there.
