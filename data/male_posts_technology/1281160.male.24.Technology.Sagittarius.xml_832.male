The blog on onsite tempted me so much that i decided to deviate from my usual course...so here iam blogging! To be honest the whole of last month i was torn between my career and personal life...life being highly uncertain...we dont know whats in store for us after 3 months...continue in UK, back to India or in a different country?   Kishore questioned the decision of the couple to stay together in onsite...have they got any other choice?...i can quote instances where people got fired for declining onsite assignments..its no jolly ride for career oriented people to live in onsite.The barriers are too many that i really go crazy at times....cannot apply to goods jobs in top companies as they do not entertain applications from non UK and EU nationals...cannot get into any contract employment..if we end up in a different country or India and if at all i manage to get into a job will the stay be long enough for me to settle in a decent job...to top it cannot plan any vacation to India without concerns..in total my career is in a total disarray...the only thing I am clear about is I am not going to compromise my family life at any cost!   Hey Ranjini..nan oru thara blog panna 100 times panna mathiri...so treat kuduthudu. Xavier your gift is on its way....ni ketta sundal!...here the xmas fever has reached to a height that people are going crazy...never seen so many hanging out in the streets after 8 in the evening...came across a dozen santa claus..dont think we'll have a white xmas but hoping one for new year...Merry Christmas.  We are visiting Leeds and Manchester during the weenend....  Bye
