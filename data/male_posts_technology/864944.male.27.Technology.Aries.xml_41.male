(which I promptly fed to hungry fish ;p )  Anyway.. i came across this site and thought it was cool.  When i was younger, i even remember the cicadas coming out of the ground in Rhode Island and covering the tent I was sleeping in.  My friend and I woke up to a tent covered with the shells of these creepy bugs with big front claws.    We'd even get live ones, and stick them on our shirts like pets.  Crazy.     urlLink Howstuffworks "How Cicadas Work"
