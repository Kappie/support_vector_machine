We're all quick to dismiss pootie as just another laughable slang, but really, it's much more powerful than that.  So long live the Pootie Power.    Im gonna start using pootie as a word when I can't think of any other words.  Like when your fixing something and u can't find that tool u can never think of the name of:  "Hey have u seen my pootie?"   Or when you're running late and forgot one thing and you shout to the person behind you:  "Hey...grab my pootie will you?"  Or even when your dinner tastes like something you can't place: "That tastes like pootie!"  Seriously, though, I never actually opened my pootie spam.  I get like 10-20 spam e-mails a day...man if I answered them all, by now i'd be rich, incredibly sexed up, and have the biggest weewee ever.  Not only big, but it could stay hard all year long with all the cheap and free V1@gr@.  And why the heck do they use the netspeak for viagra all the time?  It's obvious the spam filters don't work so well, so just spell it proper you spammers.  Do you think you're intelligent or sneaky by changing the text?  Does it make me more inclined to open your bandwidth wasting tripe? NO!  So just stop it.    If I was king of the world (see my post on the Samurai Pharmacist for my methods of attaining that position), I would pass a law that would force all spam companies to buy squippy new computers for everyone they spammed.  At least until they run out of money.  Then I'd make the lame ass bastards wash my car.  And my dishes.  Yeah!   Yeah, OK it was a bit of a lame blog, but what are you gonna do?  Go have a bowl of pootie and get over it.
