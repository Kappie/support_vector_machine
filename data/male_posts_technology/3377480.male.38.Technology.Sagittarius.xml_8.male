Its not straight, but it is level until it drops to my neighbors yard.  today I should get going hard on putting the panels up.   the way this pool works, is the sides are a polymer plastic with big braces, with a 8 in by 2 foot concrete color around the outside to keep them in place.  the bottom of the pool is a sand mason mix. then you put the vinyl liner in place.  for those that went to destin the pool at that house was same type of pool.
