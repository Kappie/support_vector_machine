Thus when I was combing my hair to look normal, I was actually combing it backwards. This is really hard to deal with, considering I've been doing it since I was like 8 or whatever age it is one starts combing one's hair.  hmm... Cahlen was dropped on his head.... that explains a lot of things:)  well, now it's time to play video games, I mean work:)
