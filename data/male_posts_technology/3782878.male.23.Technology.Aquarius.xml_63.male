I do not understand why this is, but I accept those things as the mysteries of life on Norrath. I also awoke and found my special compass I have acquired had been replaced with a very basic piece. I will have to forage for another later.  I met Kretais and Akcron near the tree where I like to make camp. We gathered up and after receiving the blessings of wolf from Kretais we made our way to the Great Divide, for we had chosen to assist my honorable cousins the Coldain Dwarves of Froststone. We had decided to assualt the fortifications of the Ry'Gorr Orc Tribe.  The assualt went fairly well, Kretais decided that he would bait the Ry'Gorr away from their posts so that we could assualt them away from their reinforcements, we spent some time doing this, and I was so happy assisting my icey brethren that I toasted our acheivements with red wine and ale. it was a good night, but eventually our resolve grew weary and it was once again time to camp, so back to the Plane of Knowledge we went, and I set up camp and rested.  We have since discussed battle plans, and I have discovered an ally Konath has found himself stuck inside Runnyeye, so tonight we plan to assist him in escaping runnyeye, and once we have rescued our dear friend, we shall help our new Guildmember Ellektra with obtaining some of her pieces of an epic Enchantress item that she desires inside Lowest Guk. I hope our raids on these locations are successes, and we shall find out tonight.  If we meet may it be as brothers, and not as enemies, Ziggur Rathebringer
