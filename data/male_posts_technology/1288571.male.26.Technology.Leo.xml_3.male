Yeah, well, I've been fighting this "little" problem that DirectX 9 introduced to my system a while back.  The problem goes something like this - If you run Windows XP, use Windows Messenger, have the built-in XP firewall enabled AND had installed DirectX 9 (note: no "a" on this one), your Windows Messenger would freeze for 5 seconds every GODDAMN FUCKING MINUTE.  Somehow Microsoft overlooked their own software when testing DirectX 9.. maybe the testers went out on a binge and got shitfaced every night. Who knows.  At any rate, they've fixed this problem FINALLY in DirectX 9a.. and thank dog for that!  I knew a little work around that fixed the problem but I won't get into it because its a stupid solution even though it worked.  New solution?  Download  urlLink DirectX 9a  now to end your misery and save the few strands of nappy hair left on your head.
