I went to a store that I visit for one reason only -- they sell Coke products for a buck a two liter. I drink a hell of a lot of Diet Coke, and they are my dealers.  I brought four two liters to the counter and proceeded to wait in line while the cashier was discussing Jesus with a "customer" (who hadn't purchased a damn thing) in line.  I am typically very tolerant of other people's religious beliefs, provided that they are not "witnessing" or "preaching" at me.  After several minutes of standing at the counter holding an armload of soda I said "Look people, Jesus isn't paying for this soda -- I am. Would you please move him out of the way so I can pay for my soda and get out of here?"  The cashier was not pleased with this and told me to "get the hell out of his store".  I proceeded to enumerate a few points.  1 - "It's not your store, you are a schmuck getting paid minimum wage to run a cash register."  2 - "Leave church for Sundays, not for work"  3 - "The job of a cashier is to help customers, not holding services in a check out line"  He wasn't happy with me at all after that. Actually, he looked like he wanted to slug me. I did the obvious thing of course, I egged him on.  "Okay, Jesus boy, you want to do something about it?"  He got the message that he was walking on thin water and got out of my face. I left the store and will never go back. Ever.  Fortunately, it's only Family Dollar, so there's no sorrow there. That store sells nothing but  shit  anyway.   It's worth my while to pay a few cents more and not have to listen to preaching outside of church.
