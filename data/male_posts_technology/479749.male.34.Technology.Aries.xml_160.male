This does not include hauling 24 8 foot 2x4s into the house along with 5 sheets of plywood, help Jean build the platforms for the craw space then hawing those into the basement and placing them temporally in the craw space.

Post Workout notes: My arms are like jelly. Amy jokingly said as I was leaving "Hope you don't have to type much today." At least I thought she was joking. The last part of the workout I could feel a big burn in my shoulders. I just hope Jean doesn't want me to do any lifting tonight.. I'm not even sure if I could pick up John at this point.   I also need to start dropping the carbs from the diet. It's going to be hard but worthwhile in the end.
