That would be ok, except getting called into work when I'm planning on a day off always puts me in a crappy mood.  That would also be ok, except that on Thursday my girlfriend got a new job.  So she's been in the mood to celebrate.  I'm extremely happy for her, and proud of her cuz it's a booty kicking job, but being called and guilted into working for the 13th and 14th day in a row put me in such a foul mood that I completely rained on her parade.  So now I'm a tired, bummed out assmonkey.  But what are you gonna do?  Tomorrow I will do something nice for her and maybe things will be all kopasetic again.  However I do feel pretty shitty for pissing on her great news.  I didn't mean to, but I did it.    Hey about the word Kopasetic...wtf does it mean?  Where did it come from?  Why do I care?  And speaking of words, I was watching a program just now about purely Canadian words.  I didn't know that Butter Tarts are a purely Canadian thing.  And so is the colloquialism "Shit end of the stick".  A few others struck me as well.  Course I can't remember what they were now...hehe. Ummm...twofour is a canadian term (as in a 2-4 of beer), and so is dipsy-doodle.  Not that I use either of those a whole lot.       Uhhh that's all I got tonite.  RT I await your comments... Oh yeah...i'm still waiting for the word too...
