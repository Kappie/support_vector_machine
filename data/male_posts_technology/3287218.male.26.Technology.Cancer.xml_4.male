It is being made by a friend of mine and he is an awesome programmer.  He explained the details of the game.  It is going to be an online game that is going to be multi operating system compatible (Windows, Linux, and Mac).  That is pretty good for a game to do.  The game is going to be like no other game that has been produced.  The main focus of the small team that is working on it, is Perfection.  They want the game to be perfect in every way.  That is basically all I have to say about the game.  One more thing, it has been in production for FOUR years.  WOW!!!!!  Ok, thats it.
