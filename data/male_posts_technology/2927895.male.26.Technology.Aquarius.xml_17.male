The reason why I had to stop was because my car started to make a funny noise --- actually, it wasn't funny really. I started to think I would have to abort my drive, given how loud the sound was. Strangely, the sound stopped shortly after this break and I could proceed to driving at 80 kmph consistantly thereafter 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink My first break during the 7 hour journey 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink madhu .
