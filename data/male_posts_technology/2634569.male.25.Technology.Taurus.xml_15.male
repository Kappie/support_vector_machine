I chant, that's your punishment for the words you say This "sin" as you call it is something I didn't choose You don't know me but you hate me, I can tell- I see your work on the nightly news Matthew Shephard  countless others taken way before their time By you claiming to be doing "God's Word," um.... no, it's called a Hate Crime! We'll stand before the gates of Heaven waiting to get in You'll get to the front, they'll pause and say, "Wait... You violated one of the 10" So let's not judge or fight each other for the battle is already won For God has room for all of us You his straight daughter, and me his gay son.
