Duh. So I guess the net benefit from you obediently following the link to the Post story is that you learned a little about the tendency we have to gain a little weight over the holidays. You're welcome.  New Years. I'm one of those people that can't help but make a million resolutions. And really, why not? I realize I'm not going to live up to each and every one of the goals, but who cares? Maybe the biggest detriment to improvement is the fear of not reaching a goal. Maybe if people became immune to disappointment at not reaching some milestone they had set, and were able to be happy simply in the act of reaching, then perhaps mental impediments to progress would largely disappear.  I guess the philosophy relates to my experience with learning Russian. I quickly realized that I would never speak the language perfectly, and that people might always know I was a foreigner despite my best attempts to speak correctly and without an accent. But there were gains to be made, and those gains, though less of an accomplishment than learning to speak perfectly, gave me a lot of satisfaction (and I learned to love Russia and decided to make it my major when I got back to college).  So when it comes to the New Year, I figure that anything goes. If you make goals and don't reach any of them, look back anyway and try to see if any progress has been made. I think if the goal has brought any progress, then it was worth making. So here are my goals for the New Year (in no particular order):  1. Eat more fruit 2. Exercise more 3. Finish my independent study classes by the end of February 4. Be efficient at work 5. Make more resolutions as needed.  Have a happy New Year, everybody. I hope to be blogging often--definitely more often than I have been the past month.
