Below is a picture and comments from Rediff.com     Photograph: Ian Waldie/Getty Images. Venus made a pass across the sun on Tuesday -- the first time since 1882.  In a rare alignment that has not occurred in 122 years, the planet appeared to move across the face of the Sun -- an astronomical event known as the transit of Venus.  Before Tuesday, no human alive had seen the event. The next transit of Venus is on June 6, 2012. But miss that one and you are out of luck. The next one will be in 2117.  Venus is visible as a black dot as it transits across the face of the Sun as seen from the Greenwich Observatory in London.
