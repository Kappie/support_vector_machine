Those "anti-drug" commercials. 3. Racial Prejudices 4. Walmart sackers. 5. Old people that drive cars. 6. People that go to a fancy restaraunt and order *just* a salad. 7. Game companys that try to bring back dead characters. 8. Movies based on video games 9. Oklahoma. 10. Cats.  Pick one. Someone. I'll rant on it after i get back from ice skating.
