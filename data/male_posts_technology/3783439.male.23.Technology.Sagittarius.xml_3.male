Configuring outlook of http is boring as hell and I had about 10 machines to do this to, so I though t I would call John who works for the Lennox Partnership to see if he wanted to come with and make a boring job a little less boring :)  I had to fix a problem on my managers computer (who btw has a nice office overlook the river and the carpark out the back) When I spot a rare thing - a space in the car park!  'John, quick park your car in that space in the back!'  John shot off to park his car (he was in a double yellow at the time) and I continued to sort the bosses computer. 10 mins pass no sign of john. Then he appears at the top of the stairs and asks to use the phone cause he thinks he's broken his ankle. I wish I had a picture cause the swelling was bigger than a baseball!  John up to the hospital, turns out he's snapped a bit of bone off that has ligaments attached and he may need to get an operation. He got a plaster put on his leg and was in good spirits. We went to the Chinise for lunch afters and i'm going to send him the Novell Technical preview stuff I got sent to help him pass the time!  Another exciting day at the SIP then!
