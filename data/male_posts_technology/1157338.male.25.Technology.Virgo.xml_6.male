I took them to Shanna's job tonight, so her co-workers and clients could see them.  Shanna works at a place called Stillwater Group Homes, they provide in-home health and life care for physically and mentally handicapped people.  Her clients are pretty severe, but their faces lit up when they saw our little furballs.  It was sweet, cute, and heartwarming. So there, I'm not such a negative fella eh?
