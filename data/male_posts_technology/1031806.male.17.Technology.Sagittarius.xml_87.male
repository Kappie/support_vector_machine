'Twas fun - we hung out and dled a ton of songs. Later, we took some random pictures and sent them to Cameran (who we were IMing).    On Saturday the 19th, around 3:00, we went to Davison’s (a really good restaurant) and ate lunch, then went back to my Grandmother’s house and had an Easter egg hunt and dessert. We left around 6:30 or 7:00, and [little] Sam came over to my house around 7:15. We messed around for a while, and then drove to Cam’s house where I was going to spend the night. Sam stayed at his house for around ten minutes until my dad left and took him home. Cam, his little bro. Caleb, and I ran around outside, built a six foot fire in his tiny grill, and jumped around on his trampoline from about 10:00 to 11:30. All this time, we were listening to various head-banger songs (Headstrong, Still Frame, Crawling in the Dark, and others…) and talking on phones (me, on my cell, to Gwen, and Cam, on his house line, to Goody). We were trying to convince Goody to come over, but he was to tired and needed sleep before church, the next morning. Cam kept shining my spotlight at passing planes (he lives right by an airport), and we got kinda freaked out when two or three low-flying helicopters started circling the area with spotlights about ten minutes later. Goody (who lives about 8 blocks from Cam) was starting to get edgy too, but then quite suddenly, they just left. I was startled when, about five minutes later, Gwen heard and saw the same helicopters above her house (She lives 8 blocks from me; about 11.4 miles from Cam’s and Goody’s houses) Later, we put the fire out by spraying it with a pressure-washer-velocity hose for 30 seconds, filling the air with little dust particles that got into my contacts, and steam, which cut down vision to about 5 feet. After making our way back to the door, we went inside, ate some really good brownies, and started playing HALO in Cam’s room. Cam was still talking to Goody, but Gwen had to get off for half an hour. When she called me back, we were still playing HALO, Goody had gotten off, and it was around 12:15. I think we finally stopped talking around 1:30, but beforehand, Cam decided it was to cold in his room. He has a rather interesting way of dealing with this: first he clears off his desk (as much as he can), then he pours about 4 ounces of rubbing alcohol onto it and LIGHTS IT… (lol)  He let it burn for a while (prolly 45 seconds total), and believe me, the temperature in the room rose abut three degrees. When we finally decided to go to bed (about 2:15), it was too hot, so he grabbed a huge floor fan from the first floor, and left it running all night. We got into bed at 2:30, but talked for around 2 hours before finally falling asleep.  Sunday the 20th, we woke up at 8:22, 8 minutes before the Rivas’ were to come pick me up. We rushed to get ready, and actually were by 8:30, but Beth was 10 minutes late, so we didn’t have to after all (lol). I didn’t eat anything for breakfast except a huge matzah (spelling?) cracker, and nothing at all to drink until after first service. Then, I drank three glasses of tea, a couple of hot chocolate, and a ton of water (and ate several donuts). I found out that Brady lost his eyesight again right after he woke up that morning, but somehow was able to go get to church without his family noticing… he showed amazing skill by walking around the fellowship hall, after everyone cleared out, bypassing every obstacle that was normally there, but tripping over things that weren’t (like feet and backpacks). Later, after second service, he suddenly got his sight back again. … I don’t really know what to make of it all, but I do agree with Steven – if I were in his shoes, I wouldn’t go walking around like that even if I could, because it just makes people suspicious. Youth church (during second service) was interesting – don’t remember anything about it. (lol) After church was out, Goody, Steven, Peter, Brady, Pat and I went across the street to the Fred Meyer complex and found Cam. We hung around for a little while Steven bought more shoes, and Pat bought a huge sandwich (go figure – he’s always hungry… and he’s nowhere near fat… must have a really fast metabolism). We then headed back over to church, and Gwen called me. I got into the Gadaholts car, still talking, and we drove back over to Fred Meyer. I got off the phone when we got in, ‘cause I knew we needed to be fast and it was going to take a while (I was exchanging a defective airsoft gun). Indeed I was right – they were really busy, and it took more than fifteen minutes. I called Gwen back once we got back in the car, but it was quite hard to hold a conversation ‘cause of all the ambient noise in the car. Hahahaha *Remembering the “Haggis song” that Uncle Greg and Timy made up and kept singing*. Gwen could hear me, and everyone else in the car, but I couldn’t hear her (I tried, I really did). :)  ‘Ne way, I got off the phone when we got to their house, and proceeded to help make lunch (really good, juicy steaks, mashed potatoes, and apple crisp), and to consume much of it :). I got back home around 5:30, and tried to call Gwen back, but she was at work.   Monday the 21st, I got to school and found out that Gwen was sick. – bummer. I called her later that night for some reason that I can’t remember now…  Tuesday the… (oh, never mind), was really fun! I went to the airport by Cam’s and Goody’s houses for an aviation career day (but, *wah* Gwen was still sick, and couldn’t come, and I felt really bad for her). We watched tons of presentations on piloting and ground tech stuff. Then, we went outside on the tarmac for around 45 minutes, and looked at some really sweet small planes and helicopters. The choppers were tight – Lifeflight, cargo, and a couple news choppers. I really want to at least get my private pilot license, and possibly become a CFI (certified flight instructor). When I turn 18, I want to work as ground crew for Southwest Airlines. The pay is decent, but the travel benefits are insane – free travel to anywhere in the continental United States, anytime. I got a ride back to school with Tyler (the only other person from our school to go, other than me and Gwen… well, other than me, since Gwen didn’t go… *wah again*). Before we went back, though, we drove past it, to Wendy’s and tried to use up as much time as would not be questioned before returning. Later, after school, I brought Gwen’s homework to her house (I did on Monday too), and later, right before youth group, she called me wondering about a bible test the next day. I was quite thankful she called me, cause I was oblivious to it, since Bible’s our first period, and I’d skipped first through fifth (out of a total of seven), for the aviation thingy.   I got to youth group about 20 minutes late (no thanks to my parents who wouldn’t even let me go at first...). Worship was tight, though I was only there for 2½ songs… The teaching was... interesting... some really random thing on guy / girl relationships that prolly didn’t make sense to the majority of us... Later, afterward, Ben and I holed ourselves up in the control booth, playing Joy Electric, and MXPX, with some really sweet lighting effects for half an hour. It was kinda funny – none else was in the sanctuary the entire time, and we just spent it getting up to speed on each other’s lives. Ben’s a really neat guy; it’s amazing to see how on fire he is for the Lord. :)  Wednesday, Gwen was still sick :( Chapel was cool; don’t remember anything else about it at all. (lol) Gwen and I talked at some point before 5:00, when Ben came sloshing up to the door. It was pouring out, and he has walked all the way from the bus stop several miles away (he was wearing wool, so he wasn’t cold, just wet. We messed with stuff, and eventually got around to math. My mom took us to midweek around 7:15 (it started at 7:00). Afterward, my mom was more than an hour and 15 minutes late picking me up... really, really, really annoying...  Thursday, Gwen was back! :) We had a test that I kinda out off in Bible... and, well, yeah that’s about it - don’t remember much more about that day.  Friday, we had a special chapel, and our speaker was a Congressman, or Representative... or something (lol). Plus, it was newly instituted (by the students), Caution Tape Day at school. Everything had some type of Caution, Warning, Danger or Police Line Do Not Cross tape on it. I was wearing a Caution tape neck tie, a Warning sash, and a Caution belt. I called Gwen (or she called me...) after school about something (hehe, I’m getting progressively more tired as I write this...).   Growth Group was fun. My small group leader is so tight. We’re almost done with the book we’re studying, and when we’re finished, were going to have an all-nighter called the Hunt for the Perfect Chalupa (spelling?), which basically entails going to every fast food place open at all hours of the night, doing random things, and videotaping it all. One Idea we’ve had is bringing David and Ben along, Ben playing a guitar the entire time, and David singing. We would just walk in as a group, and order stuff, all but the two of them, who would follow directly behind us. Then, we would sit down and eat our meals, and leave, with Ben and David serenading us the entire time. Another Idea is to get an even bigger group of people (we’re 12 strong so far... including Ben and David), and all walking into a Taco Bell, waiting in line as a group, and ordering just one chalupa. Once we got it, the person in the lead would grab it and charge for the door, with the rest of us chasing after him, suddenly yelling the chorus to Hoobastank – Running away.  After growth group, I drove over to Cam’s house and picked him up. We came back home and spent all night uploading random music files and tweaking them. Finally, at around 2am, we played halo for a little while, then passed out. (lol)  Saturday morning, we didn’t really do anything, juss kinda vegged out. Gwen came and picked us up at 3:45, and we rode the mile or so to Adri’s house with her and her mom. We get there, and Cam faded in and out for a couple hours (he was sooo tired – he kept dropping random things when he was making his sub sandwich), and I was wide awake. When it was time for desert, it turned out to be a massive cookie, not a cake (‘twas really good). After we sang, people kept going on and on about my voice... which I thought was kinda odd ‘cause I don’t really esteem my voice to highly, but whatever. (lol)  Later, we watched Zoolander (a very stupid, gay and perverse movie), and played some HALO on Cam’s Xbox. One or two of the girls put on Baby got Back, and started dancing to it... slightly disturbing. Butters, Cam, and I (the only guys) kept our eyes firmly fixed on other parts of the room for a couple minutes. (lol)  Gwen had to leave early (like 8 or something). We watched a Knight’s Tale all the way through, starting at around 9:00 (it’s a 2 hour movie and  the party officially ended at 10:00, but everyone stayed around for the movie – which was good because Adrie doesn’t have a DVD player, and if we left, we would have to take the Xbox with us – oh, and the DVD was Gwen’s). Another random note about the party: Adri’s a crazy pyro. Most of my friends and I are pyros to some extent, but we treat it like a science – asking questions like “how long can I burn this safely without it exploding?” or “ how can I take the ingredients in this firework, and turn it into something that will make a really loud noise, without a considerable risk of shrapnel?”. Then we answer our question. Adri, though... well, she’s just insane about it. She kept chasing people around with candles and lighting things like potato chips on fire. Her mom kept running after her and snapping her with a towel, and she kept lighting thing. (lol...¿) Then Josh got a towel and started snapping the Adri every time she lit something, so her mom left and did some stuff upstairs. (man that was funny).  Cam and I fell asleep around 1:30 the next morning, and woke up about twenty minutes before we had to leave. We picked up Hamid on the way, and arrived at my parent’s church about 3 minutes late. I was SOOO tired during the service... I don’t want to be rude, but it honestly was more boring than usual. I would just have let myself fall asleep like a most of my friends do (sitting all the way in the back), but I was two rows away from the pastor, so I held out as best as I could.   Later, after service, Cam and I saw Josh again, and I introduced Cam to Rachael. It was so funny... Rachael and I were talking for about 5 minutes when Cam suddenly piped up something to the tune of “Man, she’s Diane, exactly.” That kinda took both of us by surprise, and I asked him what he meant. He launched into a detailed explanation of how Rachael’s psyche modeled Diane’s and left just kinda standing there, mouths open, wondering how the heck he could figure all that out so fast... He should be a psychiatrist (lol)
