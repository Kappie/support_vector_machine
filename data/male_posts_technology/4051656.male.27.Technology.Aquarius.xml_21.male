Security experts and vendors this week welcomed the introduction of Windows Firewall, part of Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2), as a valuable way of protecting PCs. But while the firewall is an improvement, it falls short of the standard of protection expected of commercial firewalls, according to some industry observers.   Windows Firewall--which replaces the old Internet Connection Firewall--marks the first time all up-to-date PCs will have a firewall switched on by default, an important step in stopping the spread of viruses, according to industry analysts. However, the software suffers from two major flaws, critics say: it does not block outbound traffic, and it can be switched off by another application, possibly even by a clever worm.   Good thing I run my own firewall. I don't really understand why it's the OS developers' fault that your system is unsecured on the network. That's like blaming the construction company when your house gets robbed. I guess it's all part of this culture that expects to have their hands held every step of the way through their lives. I'm glad my parents were old-school.
