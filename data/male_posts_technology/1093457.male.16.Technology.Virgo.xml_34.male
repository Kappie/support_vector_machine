I have had all week. In fact its got me slightly worried. I mean, is it normal to have a headache everyday? Didn't Dr Greene on ER have lots of headaches before they figured out, that he, um, had a brain tumour? Crap.  But I mean like I wouldn't rule that out! Tumours are cancer yea? Well I think everyone in my family have died of some form of cancer. Pants. What a nice thought huh!  Well, on the TV just now they played all the fame acadmey videos. David, Sinead and Ainslie. Out of all three I must say that Ainslie has the best song and the video is quite nifty. It would be funny with Ainslie in the USa, they would not like him! I mean, he sometimes has on nail varnish but I think when performing he has just a hint of eye make up on. Which I don't mind. I think personally that if a guy has like eyeliner on it can make them look quite sexy.... or maybe that is my gothic side coming through. LOL.
