Nothing abnormal about that, is there ? :)  Anyway, I poked abit around on the net to see if there was some kind off Sidabar for my Firebird, but as far as I can see there is none (if you know there is  urlLink mail me !)  But I found out something about WebPanels instead, reading  urlLink Phil Ringnaldas  pages. Hopefully thic comes into play RSN(tm)! :)
