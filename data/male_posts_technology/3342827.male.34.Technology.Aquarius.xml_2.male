I also need to work out how to fit in a weekend trip to Vienna in June, an extended trip to Kiev, as this was mentioned during last night's drunken exploits.  However, I did get some work done on TPR in between administering the computer systems in the office and finally got my main movie detail page done. It looks damn sexy as well, in my opinion, but you'll all have to wait before you can agree or disagree.
