So I just replied to my fellow spammer.  ---  ORIGINAL MESSAGE- >From: "owo Owo"   >To: eladofnifu@gmail.com >Subject: VERY VERY URGENT >Date: Mon, 12 Jul 2004 20:04:35 +0200 > >No 13 VS2 >Cethswayo Estate >Generation-South Africa. >Satelite. >FROM:Mr.Chuks Owo. >Tel: 874:763648313 >Fax: 874:763648315 > >My name is Mr.Chuks Owo,I am the operational manager in account  >management section incharge of credit and foreign bills of one of  >the prime banks here in South Africa.I am writing in respect of a  >foreign customer of my bank who perished on EGYPTIAN Boeing 737  >PLANE CRASH into the red sea with the whole passengers aboard. > >There is an account opened in this bank by this great late diamond  >and oil magnet who died without a written or oral WILL attatched to  >the account.

I am getting about 5 of these a day promising me a fortune. So most people would think they were spam.  Currently I am using an ancient shaman art of soul taking, if you are to betray me you shall see thousands of pieces of your soul swim around in despair for eternity.
