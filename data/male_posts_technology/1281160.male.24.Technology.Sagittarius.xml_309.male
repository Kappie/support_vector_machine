Will check the blog often and update if possible.  To understand movies such as The Matrix needs a lot of understanding and concentration.   For example, in Matrix, Neo's room number is 101. Consider it a binary number, 101,. When you translate it into decimal, it becomes 5. The binary series starts with 000, not 001. So the sequence would be 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111,..... 101 comes as the sixth element.   Now consider Matrix: Reloaded, Neo is told by the Architect that he is the sixth anomaly. See the connection.   Another example of Matrix's deep meanings, the number plates of the cars used by major characters in the movie are all Bible references. The first two characters consist of the book name, the next two numerals, the chapter name and the last two characters, the quotation name. The quotations are related to the movie context.  Saw "The Matrix" last night. saw only half of the movie. Will be continuing tonight also.  To end a quote from the Matrix: "I can only show you the door; it is up to you to walk through the door" - Morpheus.
