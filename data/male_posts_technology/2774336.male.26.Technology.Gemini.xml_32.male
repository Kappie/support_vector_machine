       Stomach pain, waves 

       Belching 

       Gurgling, gas 

      

    

     

 

 

 Well, the little dog upstairs didn't take too kindly to having a plumber in the house and decided to bark all morning.  Thats ok, I needed to get up anyway. 

 I haven't eaten yet today, and my stomach is doing the waves of pain thing.  I think I'll go have a bannana. And some Zantac.
