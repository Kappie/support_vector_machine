I don't really know why, I just blew it over the course of several days. This week I'm back on track, and I'm hoping this coming Monday shows a loss.  It's time for monthly pictures! The exciting thing about these pictures is that those jeans I'm wearing haven't fit for a year. So something's actually happening!
