Yeah...yesterday I saw harrison's (his blog in my links) new comp IT IS AWESOME he has a drive that supports like 6 kinds of memorycards now all you need is something that can read PS2 mem (that would  be awesome). I have to beat vegeta jr's adventure pretty soon beacuse i review games for the guy at vizzed videogames (also in my links). I will be sure to tell you how it is. I have to d/l more naruto at dbznetwork (on my links) and i have to join the techtv blog ring and me + harrison are going to make a geek blog ring. Yeah well thats all the news i have right now, ill be back later.
