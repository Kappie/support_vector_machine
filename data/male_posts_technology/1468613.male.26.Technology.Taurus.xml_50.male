Seeing Anne was great and I have made her swear on her life that she is comming to visit early next year.  So bring on the summer party season!!!! Seeing mum and dad was great too, Moet on the balcony in the balmy night air, lunch of smokes salmon and San Pellegrino water (spelling????) on the terrace with boat trips on the lakes and evening wines in very trendy bars (Oh the life!) Then to Italy with mum.  Where a new definition of born to shop was given life.  Maybe last month would have been a good time to invest in the Euro because we certainly did our bit the Italian ecconomy.  However we did fit in time for wandering the back streets of Rome and Florence while taking in the sight and the occasional glass of champagne. Then on to Glasgow - where it has rained nearly all week.  Thankfully we picked the only sunny weekend Scotland has had in the last 75 years to go to the Isle of Skye which is a truelly magic and untouched place (Gede was particularly taken with the sheep ;). And well yes Glasgow - need I say more ;) So anyway, Gede and I head down to London tonight then I have to be at Heathrow by ten tomorrow and then off I jet home. Looking forward to all the hugs at the airport and missing everyone over here already. Much love Kai
