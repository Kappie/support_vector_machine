I've fixed that annoying font problem and also found a new comments system - so readers, feel free to backlash against the Toaster boys as we post our inane, bandwidth wasting drivel out into the reaches of cyberspace.  Here is the  urlLink funniest news headline  I have ever seen.  Also here's a little something Mr Grist sent me earlier today which brightened my day up:  In Japan, they have replaced the impersonal and unhelpful Microsoft error messages with Haiku poetry messages. Haiku poetry has strict construction rules - each poem has only 17 syllables; 5 syllables in the first, 7 in the second, 5 in the third.  They are used to communicate a timeless message, often achieving a wistful, yearning and powerful insight throughout extreme brevity. Here are 16 actual error messages from Japan.     The Web site you seek Cannot be located, but Countless more exist    Chaos reigns within. Reflect, repent, and reboot. Order shall return.    Program aborting: Close all that you have worked on You ask far too much.    Windows NT crashed. I am the Blue Screen of Death. No one hears your screams.    Yesterday it worked. Today it is not working. Windows is like that.     Your file was so big. It might be very useful. But now it is gone.    Stay the patient course. Of little worth is your ire. The network is down.    A crash reduces Your expensive computer To a simple stone.    Three things are certain: Death, taxes and lost data. Guess which has occurred.    You step in a stream, But the water has moved on. This page is not here.     Out of memory. We wish to hold the whole sky, But we never will.     Having been erased, The document you're seeking Must now be retyped.     Serious error. All shortcuts have disappeared. Screen. Mind. Both are blank.   Isn't that better than "Your computer has performed an illegal operation."
