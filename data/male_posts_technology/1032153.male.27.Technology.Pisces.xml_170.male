Now folks.  urlLink Here  is why I cannot stand the guy.    Less than 24 hours after accusing the Walt Disney Company of pulling the plug on his latest documentary in a blatant attempt at political censorship, the rabble-rousing film-maker Michael Moore has admitted he knew a year ago that Disney had no intention of distributing it.   .....  In an indignant letter to his supporters, Moore said he had learnt only on Monday that Disney had put the kibosh on distributing the film, which has been financed by the semi-independent Disney subsidiary Miramax.      This guy is a fraud! He cannot be trusted to be truthful. His deceit carries through into his 'documentaries'. Can we trust anything he says? I suggest not. He has an agenda, and he will not stop short of lying to promote it. Treat his work with suspicion, or treat it as fiction.   Petrol Prices  Yes they are on the up and up. So much so that I am planning to ride to work tomorrow if the weather is fine.
