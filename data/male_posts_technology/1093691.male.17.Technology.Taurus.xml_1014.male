The boys one was good but not very funny, but the girl called Olivia, hers is just so random that it's really funny. Completly random. I think we should do something to spice up our blog. Like have different cateogries and put someone in charge of each category. Like Our News, World News and our Views, Events in our lives, stuff like that, make  it funny and not just a regular ole blog.
