I know I changed. Ya know a friend of mine asked me before I got here, when we were all shipping out, he asked me why are you going to fight somebody else's war? What, do ya all think your all heroes? I didn't know what to say at the time, but if he asked me again I'd say no. I'd say there's no way in hell. Nobody asks to be a hero, just sometimes turn out that way. It's not that i like em or i don't like em- I respect them. Look, these people have no jobs, no food, no education, and no future. i just figure that, ya know, I mean we have two things we can do. We can help, or we can sit back and watch a country destroy itself on CNN. Right? Sometimes people ask me why I do it, they say what are you some sort of a war junky? I dont answer them cuz they will never understand. understand that its just for the man fight next to you. Only the dead live to see the end of the war.
