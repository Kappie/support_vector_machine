She, that is the woman who I feel I should be with, the one who I'm truly in love with and feel is my soul-mate...her, well, she's giving me all that she can...all that she's prepared to right now.  And for that I am extremely grateful.  I cherish everything we have and do together, and for now that's got to be enough.  I've got my family, she has hers.  If some day we can be a family together, that's wonderful too, but until then, I take all she can give and give all that I can.  And that, is a relationship.  What a weight off that was to learn!  *Whew*  I can breathe again.  I can relax again.  I can understand and live a life and not be tormented.  What caused this?  Where did this revelation come from?  I have no idea.  I'm just glad it showed up.  :-)
