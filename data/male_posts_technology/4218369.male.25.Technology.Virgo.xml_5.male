           
      Single, happily employed, no kids, all the time in the world... That was my life 6 months ago. Engaged, dad-to-be, miserably employed, trying to write a business integration software package in my spare time... This is my life now.  So now I'm taking the few minutes of peace while my wonderful, pregnant fiance is sleeping next to me and using it to write to the faceless world (AKA you).   Why am I writing this?  I'm fairly certain that I'm writing this to get a handle on the process of change. I need to see what's going on in my life and try to understand it. I've always been introspective and analytical, and when I'm going through wholesale life change, these traits naturally go into over-drive. Hopefully, this will be the canvas where I can paint an comprehensible picture of my life.   Why is it worth your time to read this?  Obviously, you as the reader bring your own reasons to this text, and I'd never presume to know them. However, here's what I hope to give you through this relationship. I want to share with you the honest process of my life. I believe that most things we encounter in life are far more universal than we think, and that our problems are common when we can see them objectively. My wish for you, is that you become better by reading about me, and that I become better by sharing with you. I don't presume to be some modern-day  urlLink Everyman , but maybe we all are.
