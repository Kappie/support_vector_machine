As a whole, American attempts at orchestral music (movie soundtracks not included) have been pathetic.  Bernstein had some attempts at "good" orchestral music (Candide Overture).  Copland was the best American composer in my opinion.  But, you can't beat "the continent" for good classical music.  From Bach through Beethoven to Tchaikovsky (yeah, Russian, but close enough), they had some incredible talent.  I guess what it comes down to is I will admit that, as a whole, European culture, which is after all what all the things we are talking about make up, is better than American.  Hell, we can't even make a decent beer.  I still prefer living in the heathen US, wearing my holy blue jeans, ratty old t-shirt, eating my cheeseburger, deep fried potatoe strips, and watching American football on TV, or better yet, laughing at some of the ugly dresses the actresses wear to all the awards shows.
