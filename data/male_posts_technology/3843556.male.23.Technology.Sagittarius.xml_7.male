I missed out on seeing her cut her cake but I made in time to eat it. I had made up my mind at the start of the day never to talk to Sairoo again. But things changed as the day rolled by. My anger subsided but not the pain. The last few days has left behind a scar that will remain for a long time to come. I did not see anything wrong in my decision. But I did change my mind because I did not want to lose a friend and also due to the influence of Sravi and Gaurav. I felt some inner peace within me. I felt strong within and I am tired of people hurting me. There are times when I begin to dip low but every time that happens Sandeep's words ring on my mind. I have not been working productively over the last few days because of lack of concentration. I promised myself that I would from today remain focused and work towards the goals I have set for myself. Asha then took us out to Bollywood Grill for dinner. The food was amazing. By far the best Indian restaurant I have dined at in this country. It was also nice to sip on some Indian beer. It has been more than two years since I have done that. I am more than gifted to have friends like Abinesh, Sandeep, Gaurav and Sravi. They have a made a big difference in my life and I cannot thank them enough.
