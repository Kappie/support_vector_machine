Despite that, I had an excellent time at Day One of BloggerCon.  Great panel on education filled with passionate folks and new ideas about how to make blogs work in schools.  And not to be too aw-shuckish, but it's been a real treat meeting folks who say "I use  urlLink Blogger  - thanks so much"  and then getting to hear their ideas on what we should do next.  Tomorrow morning's user get-together should be a good time assuming I get any sleep between now and then.  Where's some valerian root when you need it.
