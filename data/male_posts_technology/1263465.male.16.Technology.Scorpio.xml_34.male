I got to thinking as I was working my way through the site about how important 2A used to be to me, and how they aren't so much now.  Back in the day (pssh, 2 years ago...) 2A was by far the best thing that I had ever seen.  Period.  It was prolly the reason I started doing flash, too.  But now after I've seen  urlLink such   urlLink amazing   urlLink things , 2A isn't that big of a deal.  It's like they want to be, but it's like they try too hard, and end up overdoing it all.  It's like they are the old school, with there 'super-cool' 25 milligram video that really rocked the industry when it came out.  But now it's like, yea, so what?  But really, don't get me wrong.  I love 2A's work, and they're still going strong after a lot of people have dropped out of the game.  Congratulations, 2A, for fueling today's amazingly talented individuals.  And for taking all the ripping gracefully.  peace out
