Shivites: sorry i had to cancel game again - didn't have much time (cutting up damn trees) or opportunity (all my game stuff is on my PC) to get it together for Sunday.  alas!  but we will try again two weeks from now.  until then, i invite you to look eagerly towards this coming episode of  urlLink "Road To Glory" .  look, damn you!  more from me when we get Comcast on the effin' stick and complete our return to civilization.
