I initially wanted Sandra to record one for me because it would be rad to have an answering machine message in German, but she is not currently microphone equipped.  So it would be on a strictly voluntary basis. It could be like a christmas gift exchange with voluntary participation.  Whoever gets Belle would win because her voice is cute. Whoever gets me would lose because I will sound retarded.
