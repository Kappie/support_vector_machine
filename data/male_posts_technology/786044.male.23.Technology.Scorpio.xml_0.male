II)  eyes see what the ears can't hear but sometimes i think  I can almost hear your skin singing softly  whispering sweet somethings in wind gusts so only I can hear  so smooth a silky slippery slope there's no turning back  explosive radiance must be contained, trapped a cage of clothing - wrapped tight, like a second skin to bare the form from which my dreams are made, carefully crafted from every hint you've ever dropped along the way I gathered them like a sparrow in spring piecing it together, architecting a nest for my head to rest  Telling you every dirty thought I've ever had about you would take an eternity  And still we'd need a Time Machine  to span the lifetimes it would take  to recount every beautiful thought on the same subject.  And That Machine would certainly break down  before allowing us enough time to cover each reason that I write poems  like this one  Because every day i see something new in you (or perhaps it's just something I forgot - you know how my memory is) But it keeps me coming back -  as if coming back were an option...  As if I could stop thinking about you  As if I were on the open sea ebbing and flowing  As if I were a higher order function changing direction as I move closer to our origin  As if I were running a 5K on the track away with the wind before coming back to your voice  As if I were a boomerang and you had to throw me to get me to come back  But if you just hold me, I'll stay in your hand forever.  --  Fan P walking...
