Did laundry, paid bills, yada yada yada.  Got some work done, too. Just a pretty laid-back (yet productive) day. I read a lot, too. I was going to hit the road to NJ today, but I decided it would be better to relax a bit.  Spent some time with my friend on the phone.  She's moving to Hawii on a whim because she's totally into this guy and she's getting scared so we talked a bit - think she just needed to talk about it.  Sweet article I found today:  urlLink MSNBC - Genetic mutation turns tot into superboy   Spoke with my best friend from growing up, Warren, today for a while.  I noticed that most of my friends have certain things in common: they are philosophical, easily inspirable, and generally open to and accepting of people.  Warren and I usually have pretty cool conversations about well... whatever is going on and/or comes to mind.  I was speaking with him today about this context that I'm stuck in that goes something like: "You never know what you're gonna get, so choose to commit to whatever feels right and inspires you."  But the more I think about this, the more bothered I am.  It's irresponsible... just like when people say "everything happens for a reason" ...what bunk - that just takes all responsibility off of them for making things happen in their life and making it ok when they mess up and things go wrong.  So where I am at I guess, is that I commit to people and things more easily now than ever, which has been a huge jump forward. On the other hand, the quality of those people and things may not be the best I am capable of.  My choices right now are possibly... very arbitrary and out of my control with this context.  However, It's what makes sense to me right now and I'm worried... I think when this context evolves to the next level in my mind - to where I just can't see yet, that I'll reach the next big leap forward in my progress with every area of my life. Just need to find something that makes more sense to me... uugh.  My friend told me about this stream and I ended up liking it a lot:   urlLink ClubFM Internet Dance Radio, Trance Radio, House Radio, Tampa Radio, Chicago Dance Radio, Las Vegas   Eesh... getting tired early tonight, but somehow I wish I were somewhere out - dancing with good friends.
