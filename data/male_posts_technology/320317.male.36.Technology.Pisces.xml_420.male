It's America's most popular satellite radio service at only $9.99 a month, and a new audio experience on your radio with the unmatched clarity of 100 digital channels wherever you drive."

  I recently became a subscriber of XM Radio after purchasing the hardware at Circuit City. It's pretty sweet. I don't know why I didn't get it sooner. It's basically cable TV for your car. There is a ton of music categories to listen to, but I got it primarily for news and talk radio such as CNET Radio, ESPN, CNN, CNN/SI, Discovery, and a whole lot more.
