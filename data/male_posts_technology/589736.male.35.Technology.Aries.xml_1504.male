From darkhorizons:  "...the official site reports that Anakin apparently has a scar in the movie but he does not get it in the film, rather the event happens in one of the books preceeding the film."  Okay, so now *another* book is canon?  What the hell?  Is this a movie or not?  Is it a movie about people whose further adventures are recorded by unnamed historians, or novels about people who occasionally get filmed by some omniscient documentarian?  If both the movie and the book are essentially the same thing, is the movie a better story because it was the one that got filmed, or rather does the book supply backstory that the movie couldn't manage, and if so, why not?  I understand this is just a marketing ploy, but it raises profound questions about the nature of narrative.  (Please note that I'm focusing on canonical texts that occur in the same world and timeline as a movie, or vice versa, *not* spin-offs of either medium that provide alternate adventures.)
