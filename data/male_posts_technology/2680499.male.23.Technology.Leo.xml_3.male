Well, today my boss is on holiday, so we are a bit freer (if there is such word) to spend time on here and there. Hmm hmm...  Yesterday, I was walking down the stairs with my colleagues. We were on our way to lunch. Unfortunately, I somehow slipped down the stairs. Gosh!! That's embarrassing, I think. But luckily I did not hurt anywhere. Except, maybe a little on my butt. But that doesn't matter.  As I wish to get slim day by day. I eventually had gone down on my waistline, by doing lots of exercises and food control if u would like to know. I think my weight gets lighter too. But I seem to have this problem that frust me everytime. I don't really want to say this but, I'm not sure if this is called constipation. Coz I really didn't go to the loo for big for few days, but when it comes I can go smoothly. With no "brutal force"!! But what distracts me is that everynight I looked at the mirror. My waist is like expanded a little after dinner + not sitting in the loo. I'm so unhappy with that. Wander if there is a solution with that.  Btw, these days the temperature is rising. Well, I can't really tell if it is rising or not. But all I know is that, I have consumed so many water but still feel the heat in me. That's not rite. Can u imagine finishing one whole bottle of mineral water in just the morning? Well I did that. And its consequence is I go to pee every 15 minutes. I knew that when one has diabetes will have this problem. But my sugar intake is low so I don't think its that. Or maybe it could be hypertension? I've been thinking of these possibilities. But, I still can't be sure of it. My lips are always dry, I'm always thirsty, but I don't sweat a lot, except for sports... I even think of I did not shit for days could be the cause of abnormal water level of my body.  Jeez.... Why would I post something like this today. Must be something went wrong in my head. gotta fix it.. Chao!!!  P.S. my brother is coming back today. With my com =)
