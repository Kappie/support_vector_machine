'I searched it thoroughly and studied it carefully looking for problems or flaws,' he said. 'I couldn't find anything. It is brilliant design,' he told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital."   I am getting closer and closer to purchasing a Mac. Not necessarily an iMac, but certainly a flat-screen Mac.
