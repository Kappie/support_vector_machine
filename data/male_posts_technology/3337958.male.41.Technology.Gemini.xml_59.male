Some dude posted a message about wanting to try it out, and gave his username, so I took him up on it.  It totally cool!   The sound quality was much better than any speakerphone I've ever used, and the fact that I'm using the mic in my monitor and the speakers on the side didn't result in feedback the way it did in applications that we tried before.  There was a *little* bit of a noticable...kind of a single duplex phenomenon?...like...conversational sidewalk bumping, but that may just be attributable to the awkwardness of talking to a total stranger.  Of course, McAfee was howling about the app now and then, but I pimped out to the app each time.
