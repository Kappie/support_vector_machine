And to finish it off yummy mini eggs! we had a really weird discussion though, we were tlaking about digging the patio up, and thne mum started saying she doesn't know why people bother to bury bodies under the patio cos it's so much work, then we started talking about how you do it etc etc. Then it emerged that Louise had gone to get a cloth out the sink, but she reached into the sink and grabbed the turkey giblets! OOooh it was funny! All this while poor Nancy is throwing up in the lounge. Marvellous, I love Easter.
