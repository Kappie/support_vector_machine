The summer issue of  urlLink Black Petals  is out, which is an especially good episode since it features my short short story "A Brief Future of Television." I tried to get it into last year's winter issue since it has a Christmas / Hanukkah / Ramadan / Kwanzaa (which I refer to as HannuKwanzaRamadaMas, or HKRXmasux when I'm in my usual foul mood) theme to it, but they had too much of a backlog. I'm just happy to see it in print. I rule!
