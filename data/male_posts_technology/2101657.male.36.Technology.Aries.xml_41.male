While there I had the Doc look at a spot on the back of my lower left calf. It was decided, to make an appointment for next week to have it removed, based on his impression, it looks like it's skin cancer.  We'll know for sure after they check it out. It's a small spot about a quarter inch round, that on occassion hurts into the muscle. There is also another spot about 4 inches above it thats probably in my opinion going to be the same way.  Plus there are 2 other spots just like that one on the back of my left shoulder.  Hopefully I wont turn into a walking tumor.  Time will tell, I get to have it removed on the 2nd of June.  Then 2 days later I will be camping with our Boy Scout Troop over-night, to help setup for a fund-raiser the next day.  Too much to do, too little time to do it in..
