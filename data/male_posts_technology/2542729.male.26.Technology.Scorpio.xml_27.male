Now i'll have to budget my feeble finances for another week til I get paid again. God help me if I come up short though. Anything would be better than hearing mom gripe over how i'm not using my talents to their fullest extent, that is, talent that transfers into profit. Well boo hoo momma! Maybe i'm not the doctor that some saw, or the electrical engineer that uncle Maron predicted when I was 14. Maybe i'm just the lowly carpenter that works out of his ex-step fathers' corner shop. Maybe i'm just the eclectic result of circumstance...  ...and speaking of a man whose true soul is forever cloaked behind that stern, incisive persona... I've got my suspicions about him...always have. And if anyone can recognize a man with secrets, its me. He's hiding something...just don't know what it is yet. He hasn't been the same person after the big fire. When the police asked him of the events as they approached him, he told them virtually nothing! He claims "I was so shocked by--I mean oh God, please help those poor people!" With that the inquiries began to dissipate, wrote him off as a distraught witness. Whatever works, guy. Personally I hope they brainwash him, see what other nuggets of knowledge he has saved in that big head of his.  "I hope you know that Chase is coming by tonite to check on the water heater..." Begins mom. "Why? I don't even see why you still let him in the house! What has he ever done for you?" I respond. She puts her head back down and continues sweeping the floor. "Its true mama," I continue, "but whatever. Hey the heater isn't even broke!" "Have some sympathy Kole, the guy is just trying help us out...there's nothing wrong with that." Guilt can go a long way in changing a persons' daily habits. I think I liked him better when he was just a roving snitch who instigated fights  farted when surrounded by large crowds. But after that incident two years ago, he feels the weight of the world on his shoulders. Actually if I was in his position, I would probably be doing the same thing. Its a lot to swallow, a heck of a lot to accept. My battle in itself is...its war. A constant war raging in my soul. Honestly i've tried everything but therapy, not my cup of tea as they say. But I pray about it everyday, and often times it drives me to use the pen. I never even touched a poetry club til my moms' accident. Now there's so much on my mind words can't stop flowing. Its how my mind has come to sift the theory from the reality of the emotions lurking in my heart. Its how the laziness of one sin has transferred concensual ownership over to another, and my mind is a blazing warfield of confusion. I feel like i'm about to explode from another mans burden! Another womans....   TO BE CONTINUED
