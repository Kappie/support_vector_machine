I miss them.. maybe I just miss the drinking? anyway - speculate about that later. We're about due one. The last party of any decent 'worth' that I remember that was mainstrean #auckland, was the Halloween party @ GIR-s place, at times when I looked up from my frothy beverage I noticed wall to wall people, thick, right up to the gate... this is how it should be. The 20th we threw mag-enta, at Stages on K'Rd was also noteworthy, mainly for the pool and spacey games, but also for the turn out of decent quality people. In short, ima come up to auckland, and have my 21st party I think... the ones of you that know me better will realise I'm way past 21.. but who the fuck cares? I didnt have a 21st party, so Ima do it soon. Value your thoughts on this.  Ka kite.
