Anyway, yesterday I went back and we had a 15 km outcamp run to Pasir Ris park. It wasn't as nice as ECP, and there wasn't any early fall out but I did manage to go a lot longer than my 1st 15km run a few wks back. However, after the run, both legs felt really weak and my knees felt kinda bruised / sore. I think I'll need to take things easy the next few days just to make sure that I'll be ok for the AHM next Sun.  This morning I woke up early to go for a quick jog. It seemed to help my legs and knees a bit. Either that or it was the sleep I got lastnight that helped. Later I'm gonna be going to Comex at Suntec to get my CD-writer. Been waiting for ages to get it. Hopefully can meet up some friends and catch a movie later on. Dun wanna stay home all day again.
