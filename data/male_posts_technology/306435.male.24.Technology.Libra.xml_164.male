After, we went to Executive Bowl.    Saturday, we went to bardstown road and went window shopping.  We learned all about fung shui cycles.  Be careful for "Blood accidents" this cycle!!!  Sunday, I drove the boys to track practice and Ann taught Matt how to play the guitar.  It is all about power chords. All in all it was a fun weekend.
