A number of reviews have surfaced to counterbalance the glowing praise that some 'critics' are showering F9/11 with (example,  urlLink Mr Ebert's fanboy pandering. )   urlLink Andrew Ferguson calls it 'a crock'.    urlLink Richard Just says he's plainly and simply dishonest.    urlLink Bill Ferguson says it's pure left-wing propoganda.   A recurring theme I'm reading in these more critical reviews, is that the movie does nothing to solve any problems, instead dehumanizing, demeaning, and demonizing - and as a result polarizing the right-vs-left schism only further.  Ed Koch, former mayor of New York,  urlLink says it best:   "The movie’s diatribes, sometimes amusing and sometimes manifestly unfair, will not change any views. They will simply cheapen the national debate and reinforce the opinions on both sides."  Congratulations, Moore, you've merely evidenced that you're just another part of The Problem after all.
