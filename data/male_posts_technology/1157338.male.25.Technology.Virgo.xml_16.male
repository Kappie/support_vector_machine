I have been the epitome of busy, tired and angry over the last couple of weeks, and it's really starting to show.  I hate it when things get like this, but the whole summer has pretty much sucked ass.  I know the people I work with have gotta think I'm one unlucky mother, and I hate to say it, but if you'd just been looking at my life since may of last year, you'd be right.  Here's a quick rundown of just a brief selection of the things I've had to deal with in the last 3 months. 1) Wife's car - broke down 2 times - once for the power steering pressure hose, and most recently (as in 2 days ago) the alternator went out 2) My car - broke down 2 times also - once was the heater core, second was the battery( 1 day ago).     for about 2 hours there, we had  0 drivable vehicles... now that sucked. 3)  Wife got laid off from her job at end of June  -   just recently started working again - still waiting on that first paycheck. 4)  After Shanna got laid off, we've visited the doctor or the hospital about 6 times.  the medical bills are really starting to pile up. 5)  Shanna had to have an emergency root canal on an abcessed tooth - no dental insurance (job's dental is pretty much worthless) 6)  Auto Insurance company who can't figure out how to properly charge a credit (debit actually) card and charge me twice what i actually owed. 7)  lack of funds in a big way.  With Shanna losing her job, me just starting one (that only pays once/month no less), all the doctor bills and car repairs... we're just barely squeezing by.   Shanna got a partial paycheck today, that is not enough to cover our next bill.   how we'll get past it until the end of the month is my current worry, and lord knows I have enough of that at the moment 8) Shanna's mom died 9) My grandfather (maternal) died. 10)  My sister (whose recent marriage was a highlight in this summer) is having trouble finding work - with a BS and a GPA of 3.98 to show for it too) 11) Game development is still going OK, but we're having trouble getting the last bits cleaned up.. some team members fell on some extraordinarily rough times, and that is causing troubles getting some content finished up. 12) I have trouble sleeping lately  (wonder why) 13) Loosing too much weight from the sleeplessness and the stress. 14) my dogs have fleas, and no medicated shampoo or flea collar seems to be helping the poor bastards.  Ick. Like the old quote goes tho, leave them with a great ending, and they'll feel like they had a good time (para.)  so here's the good things I've got going on: 1) still married 2) I'm employed - even if it's not my first pick, the job is getting better, and it's a good income 3) I'm working on a video game - and they finally got my name up in the credits.. now that's fucking cool no matter how you look at it. 4) even with all this I'm still managing to go to graduate school - class starts tomorrow for me (once/week) 5) my dogs are still fun and cute when they're not itching 6) my cars work now. and I was able to do most of those repairs myself, saved cash that way. (didnt' do the power steering hose, not enough time) 7) Shanna's got work now, and that's helping her out immensely 8) it's my birthday on Sunday, I'll turn 25, and my insurance rates will go down quite a bit, YAY.  there we go, so it's not all bad, but it's enough bad to have me pissed off, which, if you've been reading this long enough, you know can be entertaining in and of itself.
