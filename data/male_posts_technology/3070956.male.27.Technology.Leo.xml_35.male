Chris invited me about a week ago, and I'm so glad I chose to hang out with them instead of doing anything else. It was such a great time...  I woke up yesterday morning and ran over to Chris' place to meet Chris and Scott (who were both very hungover), so we could leave together for  urlLink White Water Rafting  at Ohiopyle, PA on the lower Youghiogheny river. This was the first time I've done it - man, it was awesome!  We left a little late, stopped at Starbucks, and rushed over to Ohiopyle.  The adventure was scheduled to start at 12:00 and we got there about 5 minutes late. It wasn't a problem since everyone was still getting ready.  We signed some papers, equipped outselves with life-jackets and helmets, and took a short bus ride to the launching area.     Scott, Chris, and Me  urlLink     Me, Lilly, and Chris  urlLink          urlLink        urlLink        Our large group was combined with other groups.  They didn't have enough rafts distributed so they had to grab another one for us since we were the last ones to sit down. I shared a raft with Lily, Scott, Chris, and Lily's friend Marianne.  Then , one of the guides gave us detailed instructions about how to raft effectively and safely. Stuff like how to hold and use the paddle and how to work together.  Chris got chosen as the captain.  The captain's job is to direct everyone on what to do. For example, when we're supposed to turn left, the captian will yell "back left!" and the people on the left side will back-paddle and the people on the right will paddle forward.  The opposite is true to turn right... and to paddle forward, the cpatin yells "All forward!"  We got the hang of it pretty quickly I guess, because we usually came out in front - even in the beginning.      urlLink      urlLink        We carriend the rafts down to the river and launched off the shore. After paddling around a bit, the guides came out and gave us more detailed instructions.   Getting our feet wet...  urlLink      What a great time!  Most of the time, out boat (#28) lead the whole group right out in front. We fooled around with seating positions a few times throughout the trip and finally decided on Scott and I being on one side with him in front, and Lilly and Marianne being on the other side with Lilly in front.    It was a hot, beautiful day so every time we reached an eddy we'd take turns jumping into the water. The water was cold and refreshing. I had my running shoes on and thought that having them in the water would be wierd and uncomfortable, but somehow it wasn't bad at all.  At one point we had to get moving and we were out of position.  As we were trying to switch seats with each other we hit a rock and light rapids and Scott fell out of the raft.  I tried grabbing him and missed. Chris was able to catch him and them I grabbed Chris' foot so he wouldn't be pulled out of the raft.  As this is happening, I look behind be to see some major rocks and rapids coming up.  urlLink Aaaah!   We were able to pull Scott back in, but it was crazy. Wow... so much fun!  Only one person was hurt on our trip (not one of us)... one of Lilly's other friends, Maureen, needed stitches because her knee was cut open after being thrown from her raft. Awww.  They took great care of her though.      urlLink      urlLink        urlLink      urlLink        urlLink      urlLink        Mid-way they served us a lunch of sandwiches and fruit and some water. We were pretty thirsty.  During lunch, Scott and Chris found a small animal skull and Chris decided to keep it.     Us with our guide, Hank  urlLink      We were exhausted after the trip, but we can't wait to go again.  We talked about the possibility of pitching in to buy a raft so that we can go anytime, but maybe it would be a much different experience without guides after all.  The portion on the river we went on had an average drop of 25 feet per mile.  We're considering going again, but to more challenging rapids.  We're now planning a trip to on the  urlLink Upper Youghiogheny  river in Friendsville, MD where the average drop will be about 115 feet per mile with 8 foot waterfalls, etc... and I hear that for one of the miles, the average drop is about 225 feet!  urlLink Class V rapids , baby!  Whohooo!  Hopefully, I'll be able to make it since I'll be traveling a lot soon.    -Ryan Riehle
