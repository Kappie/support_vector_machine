Rode around the neighborhood and in Bethesda, MD. I sat down at Camerons for a bit of seafood.  I let a couple of sports extremists (bungee, kite surfing, snowboarding, etc.) like myself try out the ride on a Trikke. I think they got a new toy on thier list.  I'm still looking for more people who own Trikkes in the DC area. I saw a press release about a guy at GWU who rides between classes. That's him ...  . I got to find him and hook up.  Still riding every day and about 10 miles each weekend. I've been able to ride up hills with a small grade (about 10%). Working to get to that 17% uphill grade, and beyond!  I must find a bike or skate marathon to ride in soon, before the season ends. Need to get up to NY and ride around. I'm sure to get a lot of lookers (and conversions) up there. There should be a buch of cool riding spots up there.
