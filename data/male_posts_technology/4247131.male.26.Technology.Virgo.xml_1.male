And what good timing it is as well, I will have the next two days to work on it because I am at home with Tonsilitis or Glandular Fever. The doctor couldn't work out which, but very kindly sent me to a place that sucked 2 vials of blood out of me and let me know that they should know in a couple of days. I am hoping that it's only tonsilitis. But we will see.  Due to me being stuck at home today, I watched  urlLink Walking Tall  today, not a bad movie, not great but worth at least a watch once if you like  urlLink The Rock  and don't mind popcorn movies.  Unfortunately there hasn't been much to watch on cable TV today either, well there is a Simpsons fanfest on while the olympics are on but at the moment they are only showing early seasons, hopefully this will change over the sixteen days of the olympics.  Thats about all I can write at the moment, well I could write some more but I dont think I have the energy at the moment.
