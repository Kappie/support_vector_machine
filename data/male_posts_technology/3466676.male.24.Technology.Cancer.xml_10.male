Anybody who knows me will tell you that I will do whatever it takes to avoid going to the hospital.  It just isn't something I like to do.  But after twenty minutes staring at this nail in my foot trying to figure out how to remove it, I went.  The emergency room was packed.  I sat in the waiting room for two hours before I was called in.  To my surprise I was not being called in to see a doctor, but I was moved to another waiting room with a sign on the wall that read "Fast track area".  There was a nice old man in the room with me and we talked for a while, he had a pretty sore shoulder he told me.  After 20 minutes talking to the old man, he said "I don't think they want to help us.  I will just go home and hope it works itself out." and he left the hospital.  It was almost two hours before the nurse came to get the old man, and I told her that he was long gone.  I also mentioned that I had a giant nail in my foot that has been in there for 4 hours and I would like to have it removed.  She said that they were doing the best they could but there was only one doctor on staff.  One freakin' doctor?  There were 35 people waiting to see this doctor.  I finally got to see the doctor a total of four and a half hours after I entered the emergency room.  I received two needles: one for tetanus, and the other to freeze my foot for the nail removal.  I felt bad for some of the people waiting to see the doctor that were probably in worse shape than me, but at the same time I was happy to have a nail-free foot.  I have to say that the staff at the hospital were taking a beating from some of the patients in there because of the wait times, but they were doing their best to get through everyone quickly.  The doctor and nurse that helped me were friendly and we had a nice time all things considered.      Let's pretend to forget how terrible Ujjal Dosanjh was when he was in charge of BC, and hope like mad that he can do something to fix our health care system.  I fear that he is going to use the classic NDP strategy of throwing mountains of money at a problem walking away from it.  While extra money would have paid for another doctor in my case, the main problem is how the money is spent.
