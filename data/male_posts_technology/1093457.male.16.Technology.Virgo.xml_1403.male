If I have not already said, I might be getting a trampoline, I just have to convince my dad it's a good idea and that it won't ruin his grass... I measured the garden and it is just big enough for a 12ft trampoline. So that's the one I will be getting if I can convince my dad.  I am looking forward to Andy's party, it should be fun. I have a question though:   What is everyone wearing?   I stayed after school today and did some work, I also played a game of pool with Laura. We started playing thinking there was no white ball so we were using the black ball, only for an upper 6th person to say, why arn't you using the white ball? We were like Dohhhh  Umm, yea thats about it.
