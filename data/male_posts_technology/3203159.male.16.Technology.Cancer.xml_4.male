Ford is advertising with "The Great American Ford Sales Event"  And Chevy with "Chevy.  An American Revolution."  I don't get it.  Why?  What's going on with the patriotism?  I better get a damn American flag paint job when I go in.  ..I think they're losing business to the Japs.  Well, hell.  Every car company will be losing business if we don't lower the damn gas price soon!
