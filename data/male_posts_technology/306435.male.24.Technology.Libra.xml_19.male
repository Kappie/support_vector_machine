I am not really a big fan of rainy days, but feel they are needed every once in awhile.  Wow here I am talking about the weather...who am I  urlLink Kristin ?    I am going to be going hom ethis weekend...I am trying to talk Ann in to coming.  She is a little nervous.  I can understand that...I mean the position of meeting your girlfriend/boyfriends parents for te first time can be intimidating.  I hope she is not though.  Anyway we are going to go to the St. X Trinity football game.  It should be fun.  Other than that not much else is going on...until then..
