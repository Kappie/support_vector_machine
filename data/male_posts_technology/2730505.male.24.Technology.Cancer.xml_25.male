This, as Meghan has aptly put it, is an "art house" movie appealing more to the, as I say it, "artsy fartsy" crowd that and less to viewers that appreciate a good action flick with a good dose of sex or just a stupid comedy about nothing.  I was forewarned that it was going to be a slow movie and it was but it was still good.    It's about two people being "Lost" in their own respective lives.  Bob (Murray) plays an actor who is in Japan to pick up $2 mil for endorsing Santory whiskey while Charlotte (Scarlett) plays the wife of a photographer that is always chasing and ass kissing the celebrities.  The movie pretty much circles around the fact that both of them aren't very happy on where they're at and the love affair that never happened.  It's painfully beautiful.  Older man, career is past it's prime and the younger woman wondering if marrying her husband was the right thing to do.  The see each other around in the hotel (side note:  I've been to Japan and in that country space is limited so space is expensive and that hotel just seemed a little too much) noticing each other wanting to say something but holding back.  They see each other at the bar no real dialogue between the two of them and that what makes it good.  It makes you feel what each character is feeling, the longing for companionship, the disappointment, the connection between the two of them when the camera shows them looking at each other.  It's definitely not about the events but the moments.  The lack of dialogue also makes the movie so human.  It's just so natural and imperfect like real life it really is believable.  There is also one scene with Mt. Fuji as the backdrop and he teed off for a round of golf.  That was beautiful.  It was just perfect.  I also think that the fact that they decided that Japan would be the location was a good choice because this story would be a little harder to make if say it was filmed in an English/predominantly English speaking city.  That made the connection between the two people just that much more special.  I enjoyed the film personally although it was slow and really not your typical movie, I say I like it.  Now if I watched that thing any other time before now I would doubt that there would be anything good coming out of my mouth.  I still feel like I have to watch it again to really notice the little things/nuances that make this movie worth watching.  The best thing about it: the ending.  It's where Bob chases after Charlotte and whispers something in her ear and she fights back tears and smiles and it seems to leave you with a feeling of closure for both as they return to their own lives as they both walk away from each other.  Also because it was just so slow, I wouldn't have any qualms about the slowness but since I had to get up in the morning I felt sorta rushed.  It would have been better to watch it on a Saturday afternoon or something.  It was so human and very focused on the feelings it was a nice change of pace from the run of the mill, event driven movies that are always out.  So if you are feeling "art house-y" I recommend watching this flick.  This isn't your typical movie, there you were warned.  It was a good talk we had.  Thanks!
