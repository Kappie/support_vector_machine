It was very laid back and "comfy". --- Chris and I are basking in the wonderful space of our new living room.  The re-arrangement and the paint job did the room wonders. --- My buddy  urlLink Jay Brewer  has a site he's been working on called  urlLink Fast Food Fever .  One day for lunch this week, we went to McDonalds and had a photoshoot.  Expect to see plenty of rediculous content on that site in the coming weeks. --- Today is really dark and crappy out, and its effecting my mood.  I hate that.  Here's to a sunny tomorrow!
