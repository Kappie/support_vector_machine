The above link is subscription only, but  urlLink Cherryflava  has a write up. I'm still a little shellshocked, this humble blog being mentioned alongside much more professional, knowledgeable and active sites such as  urlLink Commentary , among others. Whether the article puts positive light on the state of southern african blogging, I don't know - 'flava seems to indicate that's not the case. Like he says thoough - no such thing as bad publicity.
