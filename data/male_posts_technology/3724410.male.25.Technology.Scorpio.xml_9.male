If you didn't get the theme of my today's blog then try to remember the latest encounter flick  "Ab tak Chappan" starring Nana Patekar , playing the role of Daya Nayak.  But how good they are ?  are they real or fake?  is it right or police just kills to prove their worth ? whether encounters should happen or not ? what about common people getting hurt at times in the process ?  1001 questions and no answers...  Till now , debates go on.. encounters happen...   urlLink   People like Daya Nayak did some commendable job    and Human right Activists are up on their arms again against these policemen.   The terrorists who attacked akshardham temple in gujarat killing so many people were supposed to be encountered. What do you think, they will surender and say "Please come and arrest us.." Bull shit...they simply open fire.. and why should not we retaliate ? Yes these terrorist dont even think a single before planting a bomb in a shopping mall to kill so many innocent people..and these human rights guys want to save the rights to live of those terrorists. .  Remember Ansal Plaza Shootout..   Yeah..go and arrest them , what will happen ?  the case will go to court and they will be in jail.. some day their gang guys will kidnap some bigshot and hold to ransom the life of so many innocent people who , in no way, are linked to this everything..and finally these terrorists will be released  ..Remember Kandahar..  So many incidents.. and people blame encounters.. Yes..police is also human.so chances of human errors are also there .. but the same happen on war front also..  And so the debate rages on. While we settle back into our comfortable existences. Maybe once in a while, we nod at Jack Nicholson’s words in A Few Good Men: ‘‘My existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives. You don’t want the truth. Because deep down, in places you don’t talk about at parties, you want me on that wall. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it.’’ And we keep turning away from those pictures of bullet-riddled corpses. Till there’s another case of a mistaken killing. And a little voice whispers in our ears, ‘There, but for the grace of God, go I.’   what da ya say ?
