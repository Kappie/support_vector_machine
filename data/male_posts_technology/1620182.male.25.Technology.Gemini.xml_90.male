Actually, I take that back.  This is about as disingenuous as blogs come, so don't hold your breath for a high degree of entertainment here.  So, without further ado, here is my weekend.  ** Note that this account is abridged as I did not really keep a "running" diary, nor is my memory what it used to be.  You know how it is.  
 
  Friday, June 25th 5:45pm  -- After a grueling day of waiting for some forms to be processed, a couple of the guys decided to go grab dinner.  Where to go?  ...Where to go????
 
  6:15pm  -- Following a heated discussion via Exchange Messenger, we finally decide on  urlLink John Harvard's  where much food, beverage, and work-related gossip was consumed by all.
 
  7:15pm  -- We've finished eating, but decide to stay at our table and continue our conversation.  Who cares if the waitress is trying to make a living?
 
  8:00pm  -- We're guilt ridden at this point.  George and I order desserts, Omar a coffee...I'm not sure if we were hungry or just submitting our orders as a peace offering.
 
  8:10pm  -- My dessert emerges from the kitchen.  It's a brownie with about a gallon of ice cream piled on top.  I mildly complain about serving sizes in America as I start shoveling it in...
 
  9:00pm  -- I'm down to three scoops of ice cream.  I don't think I'm going to make it.  I can feel all five days worth of working out slipping away.  Oh well, there's always next week...
 
  9:30pm  -- Omar and I head back to my place to meet Ed before the movie.  This seems like a dumb idea considering John Harvard's is right next to the theater, six miles from my house.  I can't believe these guys have lived on the island for over three years and still don't know how to get to the mall from our office.  
 
  10:20pm  -- Omar, Ed, and I arrive at the theater.  That's theatre for you Brits out there.  There's a huge congregation of teenagers out in front, dressed in the most skanky outfits you can imagine.  Okay, maybe not that skanky... "Are you going to ask?  Alright, I'll ask.  Where do the high school girls hang out around here?"   
 
  10:30pm  -- The theater is packed.  So much so that we can't find three seats together.  The best part is when people just needed space for their purses / other personal items.  Purses are people too.  I don't know why we bother sometimes.  There are too many damn people on this stupid island.
 
  12:30am  -- Okay, we were just subjected to two hours of intense Bush-hating.  I felt a little like Winston Smith in  urlLink 1984  where everyone is supposed to watch the TVs for the "Two Minutes Hate," screaming to the point of turning purple over the images being flashed in our faces.  Well, maybe more fuchsia than purple.  It was a good time.
 
  1:00am  -- Ah, another day in the books.  Good times.
