I hope I live to see that day.  Today I was pretty productive, did a shit load of laundry, dishes, and kinda cleaned up.  Then went to Uncle Julio's... Went swimming.  Then tried sushi for the first and last time.  That had to be some of the worst shit ever.  Ended up over at the girls house watching movies.  Just got home.
