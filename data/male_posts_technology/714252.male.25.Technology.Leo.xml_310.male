Everything I tried discovered another problem in that hunk of crap that my customers like to call a server, only now have I finally gotten the machine to a stage where I can get the old files off to a new computer which still isn't a fix, it just lets my customer finally start working again.  GAH!!! I'm exhausted and I have to go to bed now but I can't.. Want it all to end.
