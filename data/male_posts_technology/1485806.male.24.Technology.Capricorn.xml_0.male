For many life have never been easy....the moment wen something happen, they phreak out and run around is small circles and start pulling their hair...kinda like the small kid ..wildberry cartoon...or the Tasmanian Devil. For God up there looking down with a smile .....rubbing His Hands together and He called upon the The Father and Holy Spirit....to gather and have a meeting...This is the time....the time to work ....the time to change this ah beng's life forever...this is our grand entrance.. and Boom....no more chinese laundry...i mean no more problems. Life from a simple life with lots of problem.....changed into a life filled with purposes ....meaning...goals...yet with simplicity..with God on our side...and juz a little blop of kaya in our bread. Got poster to do.....juz had lunchie with Mel and wow have she got loads of stories....but that is another blog..... and to make the story short shorter...i am going to say this
