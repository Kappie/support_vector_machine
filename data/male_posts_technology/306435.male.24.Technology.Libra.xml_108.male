It sounds very relaxing.  Our refridgerator is being fixed today, so we will finally be able to keep things cold.   I think I am going to an improv show with Elizabeth End this tonight.  On that same note I have been working on the DTA Website  urlLink http://laugh.at/donttellanna   I found a good instructional baseball site today with a link to a book my dad bought and loves.  He says that when people say play baseball by the book...they mean this book.  urlLink FrozenRope.com  is the name of the site.
