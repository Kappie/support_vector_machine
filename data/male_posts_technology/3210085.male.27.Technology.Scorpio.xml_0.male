The pictures were of Natwar Singh and Mani Shankar Aiyer in the South Block (India's Foreign Office). The article was on how the foreign ministry was going to be shaped up.  These two "experts" on foreign policy are likely to reverse the 2 most creative initiatives of the Vajpayee government - building a strategic partnership with the US and Israel. Mani Shankar Aiyer, in addition to his duties as Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister will also be "assisting" Natwar Singh on foreign policy matters.  I wonder how he manages his time! Aiyer is an outspoken critic of the US and Israel and "know it all" Natwar Singh is a champion of that Humbug called the "Non Aligned Movement". With the communists as the chief patrons of this government, this is one motley crew that India has to put up with. It is said that the civil servants are like the pillars of a house. If they are upright and strong, the house(and the country) stands, if not it collapses. India has the misfortune of having these two people with attitudes that seem frozen in some other age, in control of a vital portfolio. On the positive side, there is J.N.Dixit. He is the only silver lining I see in a dark dark cloud. We can expect more empty rhetoric and knee jerk anti americanism. Our already testy relationship with the US (I should say the US is as much to blame as us) is likely to go farther south.
