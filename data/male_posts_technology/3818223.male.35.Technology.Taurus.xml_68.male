Note - my real goal is 1,000 per work day and 2,000 on the weekends and holidays. A couple of times I managed 5,000 on a day off, but I don't think that's a standard I could realistically maintain.  Did I mention that, in addition to my $6 payment bouncing, my bank also levied a $10 fine for rejecting my check? I hope I never sell as many books as  urlLink Stephen King . I'll never get out of debt.
