Since I'm going to be part-time, and only going to be working for a month and a half, the safety rep of the company said that I might be paying this fee out of my own pocket. I guess only full-time peeps have their courses and screening paid for. Seems only fair because moving along in time, long term/full-time employees pay back to the company what the company pays for them. It goes something like this...the company charge the oil/gas companies around $22 an hour for a person ($22 an hour usually being the top pay around here for experienced peeps), and that person is only paid half of that $22 charged, or more (peeps with the years and years of experience...the ones making somewhere around $18-20 an hour), or less (peeps with less experience which are paid between $7-9 an hour), depending on that persons experience. What the company charges to the company they work for also depends on the experience of the person being used, it could range from $16 and hour to $22 an hour. Anyhow, the reason why I'll be paying out of my own pocket is...basically because I'm not going to make enough money for the company working part-time and for a month and a half or so. *shrugs*   I'm having second thoughts on this because...well I was going to work there just to earn some school money. The last couple of months I've been spending my savings because of the incident that happened within my family and I don't have much left in my account. And I'll be using more of my savings to pay for these course/screening fees. I need the money thatâ€™s in my account now and the money I was suppose to make during the next month and a half for school and other important stuff. I was also planning on taking a trip sometime in the fall...I don't think that will be happening now. *argh* money sucks @ss. Well "Dick Fuckin All"...*said best by a friend of mine*...*L* I guess for now self-contracting will do.
