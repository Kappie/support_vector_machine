I do want to bring upon another vital point. Very often, we do things so unkowingly that we may be doing a grave legal mistake... We frequently need to get content from google for a lot of our personal/official purposes, but how often have we worried about IPRs... It takes to be the owner of an IPR to feel the pain when someone infringes that... As "friends" we do have the habit of sharing some information from/about our organizations without giving a second thought to the IPRs and piracy.   So, please take some time to learn about these aspects. Googling would surely aid u in this... Let me tell u some facts I'm aware of. ..   1. Can the material available on the Internet be copied?  Free content available on the Internet can be copied for "personal use" only... This means, if you want to share some information available on the Internet, then you can only give a link to the place where it actually exists... You are not allowed to copy it and transmit it to any group of people...   2. Can the material available on the Internet (or other publications) be used as a reference material ?   Borrowing segments of content from a source as is does constitute a violation in most cases... though many websites permit this form of "violation" as long as two conditions are fulfilled: The user indicates the source of the original content along with the terms and conditions of use as prescribed by the original creator and No modifications are made on the borrowed content...
