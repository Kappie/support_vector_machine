Where's the problem? - Dave Lieber IN MY OPINION  --Middle School Student Suspended for Using DOS Messaging System (6 January 2004)  A thirteen-year-old Texas middle school student was suspended for three days because he sent a message saying "Hey" to every computer in the school using an old messaging system his father taught him while tutoring him about DOS (the operating system).  The columnist feels that the punishment was far too harsh for the student's actions, particularly because his actions were not forbidden by any written school policy.
