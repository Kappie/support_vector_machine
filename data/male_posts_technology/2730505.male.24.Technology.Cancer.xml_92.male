Emeka Okafur was outstanding in the paint.  Grabbing 15 rebounds to go with his 24 huge points.  It was a no contest really.  UCONN was able to pull away by as much as 24 points with 14 minutes left.  That's really a telling sign of how good a team is.  They won each of their previous tournament games by some 70 points combined.  That just screams dominance.  Gordon was just as crucial as he scored 14 first half points and played it cool the second half.  He ended up with 21 points for the Huskies but his main contribution was the way he played the game the second half.  He was the floor leader.  Dribbling away precious time, time that Georgia Tech needed to make it interesting.  GT made it to within 8 points with a minute left but it was a case of too little too late.  UCONN did lose to this team in November of last year.  Okafur didn't play well as he was bothered by a bad back.  His play as well as the play of the whole team was indicative of how much more they wanted the title.  The play that I recall that has Champion written all over it was when Okafur was scraping on the floor for a loose ball to tap it to one of his open team mates.  It wasn't that he did that, it's expected.  It was he did it while they were already up 20 points.  There was no need to risk injury for a loose ball if you are already up 20.  I was really impressed with that.  He's no superstar in my opinion, he's a star, a great player but I don't think he has it to completely take over a game the way MJ did or AI or Kobe or KG.  If anything, I think he will be an Elton Brand when Okafur gets to the NBA.  He will work hard for you, he will get you 20/10 every night but he's not going to be taking over a game and putting the whole team on his back.  That's no knock, he will have a long and productive career at the NBA level.  I just think that the superstar X-factor is not present in the guy.  Anyways, congratulations to UCONN, it was a no brainer.  as long as Okafur was in the game, there really was no way for any team out there to beat them in the NCAA tournament.
