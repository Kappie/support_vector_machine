Of all the things that could have gone wrong with the U.S. plan to topple Saddam Hussein, who would have predicted that the Iraqi people would be harming themselves?   urlLink Anarchy and looting continue as U.S. troops stand by   I mean, the U.S. tried hard to wage a war that didn't hurt civilians. Now civilians are running around like wild bulls in a China shop, destroying everything in sight. Today I was reading about the destruction of schools and hospitals. People were walking into banks and walking out with an arm-load full of cash.  What do you do? You're committed to not hurting civilians, but the civilians are not behaving as you had expected. Parades, yes. Bank robbery, no.  Perhaps this was Saddam's plan all along. "You want Bagdhad? Here it is... take it. Good luck, I am outta here!"
