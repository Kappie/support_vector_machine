Boys really, your "concern" is not appreciated. Thanks.  A plethora of Tpiddy kiddies were there as well which was funny. Especially when Manic Mary showed up randomly and MD bounced in 2 shakes of a lamb's tail.  So then I'm getting a beer in the kitchen when I was accosted by a Mike Abs and an extremely inebriated Georgetown Jay.  Umm, also inappropriate.  Fast forward to about 15 minutes later when Jay is screaming and trying to take on the entire party "FUCK YOU ALL! WHOEVER WANTS TO FUCK WITH ME, COME OUTSIDE!" Umm ridic. So the ENTIRE party runs outside to see this shit. I run to the front of the house and get Mike "THERE'S A FIGHT!" "A fight?" And with that he whips off his hat and races to the backyard. hahaha. Funniest thing of the night was the random kid who stumbled outside where I was and asks for a pen. I didn't have a pen but what do you need a pen for? "I need to write down a number" At this point a short fat chinaman girl runs around the side of the house and punches the guy and starts screaming about how he's an asshole. This random chick thought he was asking for MY number and flips out. I was like fuck this bitch I'm leaving. Went inside and DIED. hahah.Jeremy shows up WASTED so me him yast and MD are sitting around sipping Triumph burr and generally being sloshed. No J, you can't see my boobs. Holla at the bowl me and Mike bonded over, now we're best friends. Don't holla at the random dude MM brought back to my place...so shady. Hahaha so @ 4am I think my night is over but my smell rings. Yaaaastine.  "Can you come pick me up? I just had the worst sex of my life." HAHAHHAHHA that is possibly the freshest thing that happened all night.  The next morning I went to OTB, where creepy manager Brian insisted that I meet his parents, meettheparents style. Apprently his parents loved me and want me to date their son.  Heeeey manager Brian...has it occured to you that you are my BOSS? Maybe you have forgotten that you SIGN my PAYCHECKS? CHRIIIIIST.  Alright so Yastine is making us dinner in the haunted house.  I am a fan of Tammy Faye   Smash
