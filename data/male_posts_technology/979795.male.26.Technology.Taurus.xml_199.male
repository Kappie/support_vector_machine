Now I need to retype everything because I think I need to refer what Pauline Sensei had taught me for bokken class lastnight.  ARGH!!!!! When shit happens, they really come in 1 big chunk. I'm really not sure I'm in the mood to retype everything now but I'll probably do it later after my Jap class. Sigh.  Lastnight I had a bit of a tiff with my girlfriend ... again. My house had arranged to eat 'Yu Sheng' lastnight after I returned from Aikido and they had invited my girlfriend the night before too. I had turned off the sound to my mobile during Aikido. Lastnight we couldn't get a lift back and took a bus back instead. Maybe we were still pretty excited over our bokken class and David and I were talking about it all the way home. We dropped by the pizzaria and bought 2 small sized pizzas (buy 1 get 1 free) home. The moment we stepped through the door, David's phone rang. Apparently, I had forgotten to turn on my phone after Aikido. My girlfriend had smsed me and called me a few times after my Aikido timing. She was expecting to join us on the way back to my place for 'Yu Sheng' when we were passing by her place. She was really pissed when we spoke on the phone. I went down to her place and followed her back to my place. It was my fault I really think so in this case. Because I seriously forgotten to turn on my mobile again when I should have. I apologised to her twice, but she'd make passing comments about how she's used to it (my kind of attitude) and that I won't change. She feels like I'm not really putting much effort into a relationship. But I'm really not sure I want to change my lifestyle and habits. I dunno is it because I think it's not worth the effort. But I know I do feel very sian when I see her 'sian' expression. Last time she once commented that I tend to ignore her when she tried to contact me. Though I've told her I didn't do it purposely. At least now I do make it a point to carry my phone around more often, that my phones are almost always charged. That I check my phone a bit more frequently than I did. That I grab a seat in my lab that's near the window where there's a decent mobile reception. My computer labs I think is kinda magnetically shielded from all the networking equipment and concrete building. That's why in the labs I'm quite hard to be contacted. But it's gotten to such a degree that I'm beginning to feel that I'm being artificial now - dunno if that's the right word to use.  I'm not trying to defend my actions above. I know a lot of lazy things that I'd do. Sometimes I don't call her daily / regularly. I know there have been times when I don't call her for even a week. Of course, if I was really doing serious work that's probably still a reason. There are a lot of times when I was just being lazy. It's quite sad. I think we humans are sometimes just like that, we know there are things seriously wrong with some of our usual habits but we just refuse the change them. Thats a big flaw on my part. It's a very bad flaw in fact.  I also know that my housemates just want to help. But I get very sian hearing that I'm the one at fault ALL the time, that I'm the one who don't put in effort. I think it's not I don't put in effort but instead what I put in is what the other party (or even what some other people) would expect in a relationship. I don't know what that's saying about me, it might not mean a big thing, but it might also mean that I'm not ready to be in a relationship now. All this shit just goes to tell me I'm a very kok-up person. Everything I do can never be right. I've zero credibility, that I'm just a pretty useless person just because I don't do what other would people do. I hate the feeling I'm getting out of this relationship now. My personal esteem seems to be at a all time low (zero!). Juliana (housemate), was trying to talk to both of us lastnight (well I'm pretty sure she's talked to my girlfriend). The moment she started, I really had to ask her to stop. I was just simply not interested in hearing that I've been doing this or not been doing that anymore. I'm also sick of hearing about things from other people. Sometimes, I've been told I don't speak up enough, hence don't communicate sufficiently with my girlfriend. Whatever I did, I must've made my girlfriend really sian about talking to me because she don't anymore, she'd jsut show me a sian face and be very cold whenever she's not happy. That's the only way I can tell that I did/didn't do something. Makes me very jumpy about what I say and do whenever I'm around her.  Aikido seems like the only thing that calms me and makes me relaxed (mentally). I can't really find the 'peace' in my mind outside the dojo.  I'm probably going to give myself a few days to think things over lah. To see which direction we are headed. If I think I'm going to be hurting the both of us a lot more in the long run, I'm just not sure we should go on. We sure don't need this kind of a distraction at this point of time as well.  I've mentioned the word breakup twice before. And I really hate to make it even seem like I'm threatening her or anything. It's never never been my intention even hint that at all but she has said something which seemed to say that's how I sounded last time. Maybe that's really how it sounds like. This time, I want to be really really really sure about what I want, or what I don't. No point dragging on if I'm (yea yea it's me again, always me me me) just going to hurt the both of us in the end.  I just need a place to vent my fustration and I think blogging is a good way for me to do it. It doesn't matter how many people reads this (or don't), it's just for me to rave and rave about my moods. Sorry if I've bored anyone to death. But you can expect a more interesting post next time as I'll have a lot of details about my Aikido class lastnight. Cheers.
