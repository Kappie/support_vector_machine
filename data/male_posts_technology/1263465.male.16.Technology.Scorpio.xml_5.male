The project we're doing is archiving all the old aerial photos of the region (some as old as 1926).  This includes scanning them in at the best dpi (hell to calculate) and then adjusting the curves in PS so the histogram is balanced.  It seems like it may be a cool project, because there is a web part, which I am going to get, earning me $3000 by the end of the 10 weeks.  After work I was uber tired.  But, I went and took some shots of the gardens because it was a really nice evening.  You can see those pictures  urlLink here .  I am learning better how to focus the camera with the AiAf, and have managed to get several really crisp pictures.  The 4.0 mp does wonders, and the colour is sooo rich!  Take care, TGIF tomorrow x___x  m.
