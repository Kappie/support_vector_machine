Anyway it helped me do a lot of things which were pending and gear up my way of work.  Hei one more news guys, really speaking i have joined carnatic vocal classes from last week and hope to continue. Not only that, i have also joined Classical dance class too. Adha mattum yen viduvanennu thaan. But ya its for my sake i am learning and not for entertaining others. So people dont worry, i wont test u to hear all my songs. Innum kathukkave aarambikkala adhukkula ippadi oru padam pottutu irukken.   both are tough and i wish to manage it atleast for a year or so. Wish me u all please!  Hei thanx for ur response to RWH, though i couldnt read much due to net problem. Once its set right i will read and post back my opinion to our cm rajesh.   Jax that article was sent by srini and i dont know where from he had picked it up.   It ofcourse was a controversial article in his group and thought such discussion would be triggered in our group too and posted it and i could see no response. Its ok, it happens. Valli where r u photos? Have u made me eligible to access? If so send me the link. Ok. by the way i have uploaded my snaps on to our group , there are few which i dint send to u people. so check out for those in our group.  Ganesh "Midnight walking" made me feel that u r going to review some english movie. Never thought u were the hero of that movie. Thrilling it would have been.....  Hei i forgot to tell u guys .... cha blunder of my life!  Ofcourse, u people know that i am not interested in watching movies and for the first time, srini was successful in convincing me to go to a movie. He told , the movie choice was mine. I am totally untouuhed by any movie these days and i know only those which my colleagues or friends talk about, or the one whose critic or review i read. Other than that i was totally cut from movie world.   Dint know which movie to go..... But then remembered that "Koi Mil gaya" got released and read about it in some magazine and heard one of my colleague telling about the demand for the movie tickets and many hye stories about the movie and opted for that. So we along with 2 of his friends decided to go for the movie and started.....  Kadavule padam poi utkaarntha illa theriyuthu, namma oor Jagan mohinila varra alavukku kooda maayajaalam illatha uppu chappu illatha Kolanthainga padam. I was bugged up totally. Such a nasty acting by Hrithik and very weak story line. I had a good headache when i came out of the theatre u know. Dhath......... But then he had to get me Pineapple papaya ice cream @ Baskin robbins to get rid of that nasty feeling of having watched a kothu movie. Adhu supera irundathu.  It was hyped in a way that i imagined it to be full of graphics, special effects and my disappointment was deeper than Mariana's trench. Cha inime padame nee paarkaama irukarthu thaan nallathunnu srini feel panra alavukku aaiyi pochu en nilamai.  Really my hope on movies got lost like anything.  The worst part was, the two friends who accompanied us knew that the movie was not that good and still they made way, since i had opted for. Really it was sick saturday evening this weekend.  Ok then will blog more about my weekend tales in my next blog if my n/w is set right. till then bye
