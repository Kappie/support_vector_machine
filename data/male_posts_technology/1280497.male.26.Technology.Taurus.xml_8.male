So I listed it on eBay and within 24 hours someone had bought it.  It was nice.  It's not magical when you just think about how it exists now, but it's magical when you think about how it was without it, and then somebody made it exist.  Yeah!  In the spirit of the weblog, here's the link to eBay:   urlLink eBay Is Cool
