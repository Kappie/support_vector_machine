Are these new OS? - how I can get the best prices on OEM software - I received email from Nitwi M. Sigh (nice name!) - About the email advertising that I'm not doing and my "inquiry x" that I never made - But hey, there's effective weight loss now available  Don't you just love scanning email subject lines? These are so obviously spam that I would never click through to any of them.
