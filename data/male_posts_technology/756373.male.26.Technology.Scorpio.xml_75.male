(Does anyone take this idea seriously?) They executed him because we were shocked and outraged and because they hoped that, wallowing in our own scandal, we would blame ourselves for his death.   Those recriminations, they figured, would weaken us further. And just to make sure, they even read a slavering statement making the murder's connection with Abu Ghraib explicit.   Hey, it worked with Spain, didn't it? There, following the deadly train bombing in Madrid, more than a few citizens took the bait the terrorists intended: that the country had been a target because of its participation in Iraq. Staging their slaughter a few days before the elections, the terrorists correctly predicted it would create a miniwave of self doubt sufficient to elect a government more to al-Qaida's liking. "  Decent editorial, props to Boots for the heads up.
