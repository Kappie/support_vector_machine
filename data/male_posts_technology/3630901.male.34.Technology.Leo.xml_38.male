I've decided that even though I can afford to keep the house, I think I'll sell it, primarily because of the psychic remnants of my broken marriage, but also for financial reasons, and because I don't want to work hard constantly to maintain the house and property, and because I'd love to live near the beach.  So I'll put the house on the market, look for a new house.  I think I'll limit L to putting 20% down on her condo, with money from the HELOC.  I may need to the HELOC to place a deposit on the house I'll be buying (let's see, 100k heloc, -22k current debt, -40k to L for her condo ... leaves 38k available in HELOC .... +23k sale of stocks = $61k for my down payment).  Yeah, that will work.  I mean, it is my HELOC, not OUR HELOC.  Then when the house is sold, the money goes to pay off the heloc.  Did I ever mention that I've lost 25 pounds over the past 6 months?  I think I did it by reducing my calorie intake and by exercising more.  Someone at work complimented me on the weight loss.  I still have another 10-20 pounds I want to lose, and I know I just have to remain diligent in my efforts.  S also has some ideas to consider once I plateau.  I'm also contacting another lawyer regarding a second opinion on my mediation so far.  I'm still leaning back towards 50/50 split and no alimony.  I even think that she should cover some of the day care costs, and regardless of whether that's going to happen, she  should cover on-going child care expenses - I think 50/50 is fair -- for ongoing expenses, major expenses (dental, eye, health), and for college education.  Stuff with S that's in motion.  She decided against the baseball game with the kids, but we'll go to RI for a reggae concert together that weekend instead.  I'll try to ask Mike or Lisa or maybe even Dean? to join me for the game.  Then the week of 8/9, I have training in Norwich and will get a hotel -- I asked S to join me for each night.  That's it for now.  By moving into a less expensive place, I'll have more cash available for other weekend trips.
