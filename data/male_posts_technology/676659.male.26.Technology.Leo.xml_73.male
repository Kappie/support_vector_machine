Mommy Ruth makes the yummiest  urlLink turkey ! hehe I'm glad to know things are going well. :)   BE STRONG AND TAKE COURAGE   Be strong and take courage, do not fear or be dismayed For the Lord will go before you, and His light will show the way Be strong and take courage, do not fear or be dismayed For the one who lives within you, will be strong in you today.  Why don't you give Him all of your fears Why don't you let Him wipe all of your tears He knows, He's been through pain before. And He knows all that you've been looking for. Nothing can take you out of His hand Nothing can face you that you can't command I know that you will always be In His love, in His power, you will be free  Gemma, thanks for your time yesterday. I certainly enjoyed our 'talk'. We should do that more often, minus the food! haha ;)
