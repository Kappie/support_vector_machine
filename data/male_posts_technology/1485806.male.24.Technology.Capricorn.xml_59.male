E03 dinner appreciation have been fanstastic to hear so much good news from team leaders and even a small role player like me ...well encouraged.. The huge amount of food that is available..and yeah Ice Kacang..so much Ice Kacang...and of course the video ...of what have happened particularly the champion of the week and the funny advertisement by Chee Siong...SIB homegrown Austin Power...with his funny antics of a Kit Kat and Snicker's advertisement as well as advertisement to Ps Nick Resce 's church...thrown us off the table laughing... Really the reports of E03 of how God have used this to start a generation that will will really impact this generation. There is a bunch of delegates from Teluk Intan who came for E03 aged around teens, went back to their hometown and started their own mini concerts featuring the Power album...and start to minister to people. A lot of pastors and ministry leaders reports of how their youth have been deeply impacted as they went back into their own churches and really blesses their pastors. Truly the planning committee have started to build upon what God have instilled in their hearts and that is backed by popular demands...E05...yes E05 is gonna come back with a bigger bang than before...  Jayne Wong, one of our creative art facilitator challenged us , that those who have went for E03 will come back to E05 as a facilitator...not just the ministry leaders but the participants from E03 themselves...since they are empowered so..they are gonna go back to E05 to impact others...  This year is a year of preparation for the collegezone to move forward as a Joshua Generation to start conquering and start claiming God promises not just on our own lives but lives that will be impact this year...as well..a call to disciple other people....  A year of victory and a year of impact...so exciting..  Regards from Fellow JesusFreak Joshua Tan
