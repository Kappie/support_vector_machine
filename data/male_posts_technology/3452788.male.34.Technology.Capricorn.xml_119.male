Dan claimed he saw Nikki and her friend ripping the manual to his Nintendo game, and that they ripped it again after he caught them.  Nikki's defense was that it was "an accident".  We set up a court, and I was the judge.  I made them take turns speaking just like in court, except I did the questioning.  Dan objected, and Nikki thought objecting meant he could lie.  The evidence showed that the the first rip may have been an accident, but the next 3 rips were not.  Anyway, Nikki was found guilty, and sentenced after she offered her apology (and attempted to bribe me with $50).  They both decided it was fair, even though Nikki was not really sorry about it.  They both had fun, it was fair, and it was a different way to solve a problem, in ... the Sibling's Court.
