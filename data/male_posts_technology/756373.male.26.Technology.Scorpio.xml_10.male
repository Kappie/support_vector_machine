Listening to it, a familiar emotion surfaces. Sometimes I get this feeling that I should have died at birth, or at a young age. I was not born 100% normal. Nothing too weird, mind you, rather I was born with a condition that may have resulted in my death a few years later had the doctors not operated when I was around 5 years old. Today I am a pretty much a normal guy - at least on the outside. Overweight, not much to look at and so on, but otherwise normal. Despite this though, I just can't really get along with my fellow man. Sure I have friends, but not real  friends , not the kind of close buddies that you share everything with. Perhaps I distance myself from them, perhaps they distance themselves from me, who knows. I guess I crave loneliness, as if by shunning the world that shunned me, I return the favour. It's the same with those of the opposite sex - I've never really been in a serious or meaningful relationship. Perhaps it's because I'm not actively seeking one, perhaps it's something more - perhaps it's a subconscious thing, a knowledge or instinct  that the weak should no be allowed to reproduce for fear of polluting the gene pool. We are animals after all. Can other human-animals 'sense' or smell, if you will, that I was meant to die at a young age? Had the miracle of modern science not been around, natures law of "Survival of the fittest" would have dictated that, at 7 or so years old, I would have been buried. Not walking around, leading a life today. Can people 'see' this? That I am not one of the 'strong', that I am one of the weak, that I was not meant to survive? Sometimes I feel hollow inside. Like my soul was meant to fly free at that age, but is now instead tied to this hollow carapace, doomed to walk an Earth that turned it's back on me. . It's not a happy feeling. It also explains the deluge of conflicting emotions felt almost daily. It explains the impossibility to 'fit in'. It explains why some people, particularly those 'perfect' specimens, tend to take an instant dislike to me. It explains this useless self pity that follows me around like a hungry dog. And it explains why my sole ambition in life seems to be to find a comfortable spot to await the inevitable. Get a job. Earn a decent salary. Use loads of useless materialistic crap to buffer myself from the world. Wait for time to go by, wait for the breathing to stop. Perhaps then I can find peace. I do not expect to enter paradise, if there is one. I just hope that such animosity does not result in an eternity of torment. All I can hope for , is that death is like a long, eternal, dreamless sleep. That wouldn't be so bad.
