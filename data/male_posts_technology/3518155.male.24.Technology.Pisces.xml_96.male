As we walk into the Campbell store, what do I see: Michael Jackson's live, 1983 performance of Billie Jean (during which he first unleashed the moon walk), playing on a plasma TV right at the entrance.  So I hang out in front of the TV until the moonwalk arrives. And it does. And I leave, a happy man.   Guess I'm still a fan. *shrug*
