If I were to put links on this page, I was thinking of placing them in the space between the dark title cell up top and the white blog cells below. I'm not sure about it though..I'm guessing it'll look like crap.  So the alternative I'm thinking of is to change the redirect page to be a splash page. Nothing fancy. Just the same colour scheme, no graphics, the title and a bullet list (or something) of links that would take you to different areas of my piss poor mishmash I call a website.  I'm sure I can pull it off but the only problem is I doubt it will look good! Arghhhhhhh
