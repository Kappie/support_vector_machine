All we are doing is draining up it's resources.  *Sigh*, I guess humans, or any life-form could be considered a parasite, since we depend so much on other organisms to live.   There has to be more than this... there has to be more than just living in a piece of land and earning some paper to buy things. I'm not saying anything about an after-life, but, if you look at it this way, it doesn't make much sense, does it?  Or maybe it does. Truth is, I shouldn't even be caring about stuff like this. I have a brand new computer to take care of.   I just wish I had more answers, that is all.
