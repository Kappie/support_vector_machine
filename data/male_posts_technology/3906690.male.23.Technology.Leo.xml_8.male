It sucks that it has to be written in the style of object oriented programming...even though html isn't considered programming. What the FUCK! Anywho, I think I have lots on my mind. Earlier I was writing a song on being brainwashed. I have the guitar part somewhat down. Not sure if I want to use the riffs I came up with for this piece. The lyric itself isn't done yet...so, yea. Damn it Shit to Hell...I'm just pissed. Why? Why?...Fuckers!!! When this song is done with...and eventually gets into an album...hell, the credit is going to read..."This is to that fucked up family..." or something along those lines. My lil brother once said, "If shit goes down like this again...I'm going out there and gonna start blasting away..." That's been on my mind as well...so yea, next time (I hope there will be a no next time), oh yea...I'm there standing beside my lil brother. I always wondered what it would be like to do something like this.   Yea...well I was told to come in today, Friday, to check in with the safety rep. She has to see if my H2S and 9 element cards are still valid. It's been 2 years since I used them. Might have to take a refresher course. Monday is when I officially start. I'll be working part-time, thank god. Doubt I could take full-time in this weather, especially with the skin condition that I have. I got an insight of what I'll be doing. I'll be going out to this location called Area 6 with a small crew. We'll be doing patch-up work with fiberglass. Last time I did that was at Area 4 with a co-worker and it sucked, just because we had to dangle by harnesses attached to overflow tanks and all the itching afterwards. Oh well...I'm ready.   Something cheesy...   *UNTITLED*  message in blood  engraved in flesh  you call my name  you want me to play this game   kill death kill  all for the fukin thrill  come a lil closer  a lil closer   whos got my back  im not the one to blame  fuck this  i'm dead to the world  trapped inside my own  a noose around my neck  what the fuck?   kill death kill  all for the fukin thrill  a lil closer  closer   there's no time  stand here with me  as I take one last breath  before I die  save me from myself  set me free  Copyright Â© 2004 SJohnson
