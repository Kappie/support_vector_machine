I am in a great mood again, I think I am actually back up to my old form, which is great because being down has not been a pleasent experience for me.. It's not something I am used to and I don't like it damn it.  Anyway.. My life.. I have to say the conversation I had with Bubbs put me in a great mood for Tuesday. It had been a bit "old times"-ish and had reminded me what makes me me.. Childish idiocy and bizarre conversations that really are TRUELY wrong to begin with. It had been ages since I had spoken about all kindsa random things that people don't normally talk about, a situation I fixed on Tuesday night with two different conversations that were great.. One was a guy that walked into a conversation me and tamara and alison were having about Testicles.. Poor guy was as red as a fully loaded beetroot. The other was a long conversation I had taking in everything from my quest to get the hair on my scrotum permenantly removed and my knob getting it's superfluous skin removed to being asked if I wanna "go fuck little boy" when I was 13. Admitedly the girl I was atlking about all this with was more than able to handle the conversation and gave as good as she got which was even more fun :)  And that has carried me through to today. Yesterday was a calm enough day till Gordon came over and we had a great conversation about all kinds of everything (remind me of you...) and I wibbled on about all kinds of stuff. T'was great..  Although apparently the day got much better after I went to sleep. I woke up to find soot marks all over my bathroom sink and the burnt and twisted remains of a BRA on my kitchen sink.. I let that go for the moment and went to work only to find out in a recap of the night before from bubbles that Janet had decided to burn her bra in our sink and then Jonny, Janet and Bubbles played strip poker (not sorry I missed that because Bubbles lost.. I see enough of him as it is). Then after bubbles went to Bub, Jonny and Janet left the flat wearing shoes and socks only. Apparently all they did was "walk down the road and headed into the alley".. That doesn't sound dodgy at ALL  Ho Hum..  Anyway, the point of my blog is to tell the world Life is good :)
