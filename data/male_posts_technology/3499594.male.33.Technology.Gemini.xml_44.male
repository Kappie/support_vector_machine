I know I won't get anything accomplished while I am at Corporate, I never do. Too many meetings, interuptions ect.   I got my Bush/Cheney 04 bumper stickers in today! I didn't think I would get them before I left. I can now at least take some with me on my trip. I plan to at least put them in my windshield (tape them not actually sticking them ) on my rental. I also met Daniel Hill this morning and acquired some Tom Coburn yard signs. I put them up around Pocola on my way home. I met him around 7 a.m. this morning and then went on to my Chiropracter. Still doing that bid. I admit my wrist had not hurt since going to him (it was an old sport injury), so something must be right.   I took two tylenol pm's and I am feeling it. I also gave my 2 kiddo's a benadryl the same time ( alergies )but they are not feeling it.   They wrestled me to death and I had to steal a break, hence writing this blog. Man, where do they get their energy?   I am already packed for the week out, and plan to spend the morning with the family. I am leaving out around 2 p.m. tomorrow and we plan to hit Mcdonalds for the kids prior to.   I did find a cool website,  urlLink http://www.cwfpac.com/ . It contains a scorecard of your Representives and Senators. Also they have a thing called  urlLink Megavote  where you can put your zip code in and recieve emails of your Senators/Representives votes, upcoming legislations, ect. I signed up for it and will let you know how it is. It sounds cool, bue we will see.
