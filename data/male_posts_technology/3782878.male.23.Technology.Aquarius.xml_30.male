Akcron is leaving for her family reunion tomorrow morning and she will be missed. Work has been slow paced in terms of calls, but the day is just flashing past me in turbo, I just hope it settles down enough for me to get lots of satisfaction out of my Everquest tonight. I'm going to read some comedy links at the  urlLink EQ Forums  which have been really funny so far, so if you're a huge EQ nut, give it a peek. You'll enjoy it. Anyway, not too many thoughts to comment on other than my pride and current events, if something comes up you'll see another blog from me :)   Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix
