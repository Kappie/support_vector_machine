I went from controling five supply centers to one.  I really ought to be ashamed. BTW if you understood any of the above you are a big geek. Anyway, it was an otherwise excellent game with a full seven players.  Congrats to Kool Lee on the victory and to my brother and the Canadian for their second place tie.
