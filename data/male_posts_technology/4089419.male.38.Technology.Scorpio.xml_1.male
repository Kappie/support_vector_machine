I'm not talking about 9 and 10 year old kids, but kids that look to be between 3 and 6. Guess what! A 4 year old kid has no sense of direction, no thoughts of avoiding collisions with the sea of legs around him or her, and definitely not enough speed to keep up with your normal gait. Yet I see parents all the time walking 15 feet ahead of their kids, not paying attention to them, and every once in a while turn around and scold the kid for not keeping up or causing a traffic jam in front of him because no-one wants to run the kid over! Come on parents, What the hell is wrong with you?!
