Or are you bad with good habits? Are you noisy with quiet times? Or are you quiet with noisy times? Are you happy with some sad days? Or are you sad with some happy days? Are you neat with some sloppy ways? Or are you sloppy with some neat ways? And on and on and on and on And on and on he went. Iâ€™ll never ask a zebra About stripes Again.   -- Shel Silverstein (A Light in the Attic )  I like simple poems with simple words.  And with talking animals.  Talking animals are fun.  .. look ! A Balloon .. !
