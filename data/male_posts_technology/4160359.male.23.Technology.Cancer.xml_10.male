I just want a place that I can put my thoughts to word and let others share them.  Whatever becomes of it, I don't know.  Here's a brief biography for you.  It will make it easier for you to generalize me, until you get to know me better.  I'm Male.  That alone will give you enough insight into my life to distinguish me from over half of the rest of the world's population. I'm 23 years old as of the time of this writing.  My birthday is June 23rd. I am white.  Does that matter?  You decide for yourself. I am 5'10" tall. Oh, I live in Buffalo, NY in the United States, but I didn't grow up here.  I was born in Rockford, IL, but I'm not sure if I really grew up there either.  We'll talk more about that later. I have 1 Sister, and one Step-Sister. I have one father, and 1 mother, and 2 Step-Fathers... sort of.  Yea, I'll get to that later too. And I have a very important lady in my life. Oh, I'm a bit of a computer geek too, so roll all that together, and you've got a framework for me.  Thats a lot to digest, and a lot for me to type, so I'm going to leave it there for now.  Have a good night.
