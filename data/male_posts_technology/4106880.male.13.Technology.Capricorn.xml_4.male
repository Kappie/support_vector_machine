Well, try EarthViewer, it is a little pricy, but you can always use the 7 day trial, and then use Kazza or Limwire to get a serial, etc. All you do is load it up, and persa I would enter my address and zip code, and it took me to an area of Mckinney showing my house, and surrondings. I got pretty darn close, and for a 2 or 3 minute wait, it got High-Rez. However, I noticed it is about 2 or 3 years outdated, and I am not sure on how they handle their updates, but overall a great program. You can swirve, swivel, zoom in and out, its great. And you can view Poland, Russia, every place on Earth, just not in High Res.  Maybe some of you watch these family drama shows, but I just started watching, "The Days." It is actually great, its about a family, where the mom is pregnant, the dad is in a mid-life crisis (seems like in next episode hes getting better), their daughter is pregnant, their gothic & dark son writes, and their little smart boy becomes evil after visiting some kids house he beat up. :p Im not really good at these sums up, so check it out on Sunday's at 9pm for me. (Im in Texas) And for those who watch "Life as we live it" It looked great, but I missed the premiere.. should I wait for reruns... or?
