Speaking at the Democratic convention (the one where bloggers have been given  urlLink a position of preeminence ), Kerry spoke, among other things, about closing loopholes in US tax laws so that incentives will no longer be available for companies that ship jobs to other countries. Which effectively means a blow to outsourcing and in turn... a blow to Indian interests.  One of  urlLink Gaurav's posts  gives more reasons on why Kerry should not be an Indian choice as the US president.  Another thing that Kerry said during the convention... i.e. " The tax breaks given to the rich by the Bush administration will be rolled back under Kerry's plan, and that money would be invested in job creation, health care and education " reminds of a  urlLink recent post by Yazad  which considers the concept of 'job-creation' as a wrong goal to work towards.
