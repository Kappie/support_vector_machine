I quickly created a game and invited him.  It wasn't long before he joined.  Finally we get to race! We are both pretty close to the next Kudos Rank, so I create the best car/track kudos combination I know of (so far); Moscow St. Basil's Circle and the Saleen S7.  If someone knows of a better combination, please feel free to educate me.  On a good run, I can usually get 2000+ kudos.  It took a few times, but we both leveled up.  One of BeltFed's friends joined and we switched to the NÃ¼rburgring for a quick run (in which I did horribly).  Signoff time for BeltFed.  Hmmm...  I really should be doing story mode in DOA3, but I've been reading up on Lei Fang's moves and I really want to get away from all the button mashing.  I do some Sparring for a bit, seeing how the moves work.  After a good bit of this, I go back to story mode and do Brad Wong's section.  Woah - there is quite a difference in style, and much of what I learned from Lei Fang's sparring does not transfer.  I wind up button mashing my way through a lot of it, although I was able to pull off a few throws.  Eleven down, five to go.  It's getting late, and I know of no better way to wind down the evening than with some Volleyball.  I finish up Christie's vacation early and start with Lei Fang, mainly so that I can check on the status of her collection.  I refuse the tour and go looking for Christie (during Christie's vacation, she partnered with Lei Fang).  I don't find her for three days.  I ask her to partner, but she is not interested.  Bummer.  I butter her up with a couple of "like" gifts and a "love" gift and finally she agrees to join me.  We play a few games of ass-kicking v-ball and I call it a night.  Since Lei Fang is behind on her collection, I plan to finish out her vacation and then I will go through one vacation each for the girls I haven't played yet (Helena, Ayane, and Kasumi).
