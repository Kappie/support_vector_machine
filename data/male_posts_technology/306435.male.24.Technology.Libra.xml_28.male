It seems Ann's group won the XU programing contest with out her so that is cool...way to go Devon.  Not much to say...I am working on a cast of characters section of my page with backgrounds of all the people I write about here....this way if you have any questions on my references you can check it out there.  Okay...time to watch baseball...until then
