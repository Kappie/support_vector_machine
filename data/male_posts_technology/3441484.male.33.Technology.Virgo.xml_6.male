I have tried using some of the other sites, but I can't seem to get past one or two posts before I lose interest, or the desire to maintain anything of substance.  In real-life, I can ramble on and never say anything of great importance, but for some reason, when it comes to online, I get stage fright or something...not really sure why that is. It irritates me to no end sometimes.  Well, I will try to write more later. (We'll see how that goes.)
