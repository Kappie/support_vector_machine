There was 21 airplanes in line to get underway and I think we were the 20th in the line. We were about 1.5 hours in delay just to get off the ground at Dallas. Once in the air, it was pleasant enough. Seems there was a Mary Kay seminar/class in Dallas over the weekend. I  sat by 2 elderly ladies that were reallllllyy into it. Fortunately, they were tired and I had my son's gameboy. They crashed and I played 'The Legend of Zelda'! I was kicking but in Hyrule and only cursed under my breath from frustration a couple of times. :  )  This morning my wife's parents basically forced her into going to Kholes with them. They wanted to buy our kids some school close. No harm there but they can get pushy on certain things. She left with them a little before 7 a.m. I had the coffee going, thinking her dad would stay for us to chat ( he makes a good debater and actually knows what's going on in the news ) but he left with her and her mom. Oh well. I finished up the packing of the laptop and let the kids sleep in.   Wasnt long a phone call and they want me and the kids to meet them in Ihop to eat with them. Needless to say, they politely asked us to come now. We did eat breakfast there, but thereafter myself, her dad, and my kids got haircuts. All this paid by my wife's parents. I don't know what the occasion is nor why their willingness to spend it now. But, I am gratefull for their generousity. ( prob spelled that wrong ) but heh its after midnight here.    The morning basically flew and before long I had to hit the airport for the flight. I did get to eat lunch with the kids and spend a little time with the family alone before leaving.  Ever look at other peoples shirts to see what they are wearing? I can't help myself. I normally always read other peoples shirts they wear. Some are funny, some candor and others are pretty generic. When I have to travel, I like to wear christian shirts. Ones that actually have meaning. I don't get much comments, nor stares, nor even converstation starters. But I do notice others read it. I guess you can't help yourself (much like me ), you have to read them, just to see what it says.  Anyway, I am in Dallas and a couple stopped to say 'Hey that's the shirt we were going to buy'. They evidently had forgotten to pick it up but wanted to buy it. Needless to say they looked  at my tag in the back to see who made it (it was Gilban). Like I cared for her to look at it. Although my twisted mind later thought, what if she had a needle of something and stuck me. oh well. The guy asked if the sandwich I was eating was any good ( I had an hour layover in Dallas ) and wished me a good trip. Only a couple of times that has happened to me in regards to a shirt I am wearing. Please note I have many Christian shirts, ana I normally only wear these T-shirts. I just have alot of them from gifts and I enjoy wearing them. I can't really sit at a bar drinking a Corona with them on, but that's probably better for me anyway. This shirt had simply on it 'AMERICA' with a flag under it and then under the flag 'One nation under the Son, Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord Psalm 33:12'    So that was basically my day, mostly traveling. Its after 1 a.m now in Pennsylvania. I arrived at the airport, grabbed a rental car (National), drove to 'King of Prussia' ((yes its a real place with a huge mall)). I stopped in an ACME first to grab some bread, chips, pepsi edge, sausage links, mustard and yogurt (healthy huh) then hit my  hotel. Now I sit here munching chips, eating my second sausage link with bread and mustard, sipping pepsi edge. There is nothing on TV, no surprise there. I already called my wife on each stop and arrival at hotel to let her know all is well.   So if you read this, those 4-5 that do and see any grammer errors, ect. Sorry but it's late and getting a bit blurry.
