I am a (almost) 27 year old computer tech, I have 2 children, a 10 year old boy, and a 6 year old girl, I had a wife of 6 years, until about 2 months ago when she decided that the mom/wife life wasn't as appealing as she thought it would be. I own my own home (for now) in am a small town man at heart. Well thats all I can think of for now, I'll post again soon, oh I'll put a pic of my ugly mug up here as well.
