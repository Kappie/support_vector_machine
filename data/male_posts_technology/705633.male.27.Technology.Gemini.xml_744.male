If truth be told, there is a fairly good reason for my prolonged silence... I have just been very busy lately!  I had to prepare alot of kit for the Jersey Revels, in which I took part and thereafter my tim was spent recovering from it all.  Another reason is that I haven't done anything worth mentioning lately as I have had to take it easy due to my back injury (says glumly). However, it is getting better so hopefully before the end of the year is out I shall be able to have fun again!!!  So apart from my story of medieval antics and the usual show of me harming myself in different ways, there isn't much to report unfortunatly!  Oh yeah... ITS MY BIRTHDAY!!! Yup today I hit my 23rd year of excistence... and to be honest it's no different to any other day, apart form tonight I am out with as many people as I can muster. Plus tomorrow it is my cousins birthday and he is coming out tonight too, so there should be a large number of people out. Anyway I must get ready now so if there is anyone who knows me and has not recieved a text msg from me then I do apologise as it isn't intentional, so come out and have a drink, ta ta for now.  Baity signing off.....  'Into Glory Ride'  P.S. To all of my friends abroad at uni, wish you could have been here (especially one of you :o)
