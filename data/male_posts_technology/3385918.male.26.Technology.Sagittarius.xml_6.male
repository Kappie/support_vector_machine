So here I lay claim to it. Hope you like it.)  Freedom By Sailor Ecchi (ehudders@coqui.net) - December 20, 2003   Running toward the crystal blue water, my body burns scorching hot. Blazing sand feels like hurdles, making me loose track of my one, true goal. To return to that place which is more home to me, than home. My second home, my desire, the warm ocean water.   I see it, near me, yet far away. The ocean calls, so I reach for it. Grasping wildly, always running toward it, but never reaching it. Too many walls, too many roads. They stop me. Responsibility, time, words… My job. My life. My wife and kids. Me, myself and the brick house that is no more real that the payments I make on it. Money, power, greed… Two suits and a tie. Coffee in the morning. Madness flows, smashing against me, pulling me back, away from the waves.   I suffocate, slowly, near the edge. Fall on my knees and beg, but my strength is gone. My mind shattered, no escape, but I run still. I run cause I rather swim. Swim away. Swim away from sorrow and fear.     Finally, a choice is made and the tied rumbles. I hear it. Oh, Lord, how I hear it. It’s music, which I wish I could sing to the world, but the medley is silent to busy ears. It rings out eternally, so loud that in beckons like a beacon in the night. The fish swim toward it. The fishermen look on; they smile at it. If it’s so loud, that I can’t escape from it, then why does the world ignore it?  And at the end of my trek, where even my soul is broken and torn, I reach the water even before I feel the cool of freedom and the sensation of euphoria of homecoming. I soar in, no fear. There is nothing there to hurt me. It’s where I belong, so I jump into the crashing waves and become one with it at last.   I become a shark, with remoras on my side. The unruly current pulls me away, bounding me. There is a rush and I panic. The waves become cruel and violent, driving me further from the coast. Deeper, falling, my body turns cold, drifting in the undercurrent.    I look back and I wonder where my dreams take me, but I know the answer. They take me away, farther. Fear grips me, but only because the shore calls my name and I know that my trek is almost over. Close my eyes, soak in the wonders of this moment and breath deeply under the weight of my own release. This is my moment and, for an instant, I sink and the voice calling me back becomes muffled and distant. Still, my heart hears it and I struggle back, fighting the currents, going against reason…  My swim back is quick, to say the least. As I rise up and step unto the unkind beach, the water waves me goodbye. Feeling out of breath, I look onto the horizon and cry. Tomorrow I won’t be here. It will be a while till I return, if ever I’m allowed to return.   Today I take small breaths and try to remain calm. Looking around, I see people that want to run and swim, but move as adrift with the current that is so artificial and unreal as the forces that rule over them. Again I wish I could sing unto them the call of the ocean, but I know that it’s not for me to guide them, but to pray that they, in time, hear for themselves. Hear the truth that is spoken. That same truth that I learned and cherished. The only real truth that can be felt when the walls crash down and you look up and see, not sky, but the towering giants that imprison us in a harsh reality. This truth is that I rather drown than live without air.
