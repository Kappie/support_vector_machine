Along the way, I have read good texts and dopey self-help platitudes, but I have a pretty good ability to filter our the crap and get what I need or what I feel is important to me.  My new favorite book is "The Inner Enemy".  Anyway, I am currently reading "When Anger Hurts".  I have got a lot of help from this so far.  I thought it would be more about physically abusive anger, but I am finding that there are many forms.  Perhaps mine is the most destructive, where I just keep it inside for a while and let things stew until I "blow up" at the least appropriate time, at people who have very little to do with the actual source of tension.  I think that I am understanding more the reasons why I have behaving the way I do.  I am not trapped into continuing negative behaviors, and I can change how I react to certain triggers that get me upset or angry.  First I will work on the outside anger; then on the inward anger, by controlling my responses to outside actions or situations.  I cannot control others, but I can learn to control myself better.
