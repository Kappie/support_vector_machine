Following is an excerpt from a press release from her office:   "Wild salmon from the  pristine  waters of Alaska are as close to 'natural' or 'organic' as any product of any type anywhere. Alaska salmon is as wholesome, if not more, than any other organic product on the market. It is hard to believe that some in the government don�t believe wild-caught natural salmon from Alaska are �organic,� but are supportive of organic labeling for farm-raised salmon �- which  could  contain contaminants not present in wild fish. This amendment will help consumers gain balanced and complete information on the food they buy," Murkowski said.   How will it help?  Let's go find the amendment...    Okay, very hard to find anything on senate.gov.
