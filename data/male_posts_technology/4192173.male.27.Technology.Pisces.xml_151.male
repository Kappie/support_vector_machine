Bradish, informs me that we must never, EVER talk to the Mondu, which is a korean dumpling that Irene's mom makes that is blow away the best dumpling I have ever had. However, we're not allowed to talk to the Mondu, especially when we are eating it. I trust this 5 year old, so I will proceed to eat said Mondu and never EVER speak to it. I wanted this on record.
