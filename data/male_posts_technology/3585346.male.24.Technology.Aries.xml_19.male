It was kinda expected problem for me and I told her she have to go through all these obstacles or problem to come if she made a decision. Life isn't a bed of roses so problems are there for a reason. But this some how or rather also remind me of a sentences that goes like these...."There is always a solution to a problem is whether we accept the solution as a solution to the problem. People who do not accept those solution to the problem will say that there is no solution." Making a wise decision and applying a solution wisely at the toughest condition is one of the most difficult stuff to do simply because human get too emotional. Human without emotion is useless as well. Usually is because of someone that affect one's acceptance of solution as solution. They put themselves in other shoes and feel it and get emotional about it if they are in their shoes they will not accept this solution as solution and thus affecting their ability to solve problems.  Coming back from preachy stuff.....I been sleeping all the way till 4pm. Just finished my sumptous dinner at my mum's place and at the same time stole some receipe from her on the soup she made. I always look forward on Sunday where I can sleep till crazy and proceed to have yummy dinner at mum's place.  Went for a car wash at geylang! As in why geylang cos they simple wash every spot they possibly could! While waiting i see two pure white rexes washing....admiring it and wondering why they take so long .....but I really do not mind waiting for a good job done on my car. Just when I lighted up my ciggy, a couple of China pros walking pass. I realise what my secondary school friend, Freddy, mentioned about how his camp mate describe the China Pros. They got such a overflowing breast that their normal hand cannot grab hold of. So i was wondering can my big hand do the job! Then there was taxi driver waiting for car wash as well suddenly chatting with me about how clean the car wash and he always come down to the shell station to wash after sending three China Pros down to work. And he say he sianz of China Pros and trying to go for Negro Pros ......while i find him crazy i was called to shift my car for vacuum and drying.  Enjoy my clean ride home and been trying to improve on my bloggy and finding out the coding...and chatting on MSN now...  I forgot to iron my clothes and will keep on improve on this thingy.
