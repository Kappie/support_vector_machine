However, this does not mean that the other guys won't get help or information here. I want to make this as a last stop or a one stop shop for all us IT guys.. Feel free to post any comments, articles, news bits on this blog. NO PORN MATERIAL, PERSONAL ABUSES AND ABUSIVE LANGUAGE PLEASE!!!  Happy blogging.
