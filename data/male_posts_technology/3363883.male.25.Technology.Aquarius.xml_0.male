To do this, you have to pass a number of criteria. 1] It doesn't involve drugs 2] It doesn't involve getting drunk 3] It doesn't involve Sex 4] It doesn't involve breaking the law 5] It doesn't involve more drugs  Some people would argue that if you had a night out without performing at least one of the above then you're either dead or a mormon.  If I offend any mormon's reading this .. .. .. .. what the f*ck are you on a computer for?  Still.  I went out last night and managed to not do any of the above and still have a great time.  How I can hear you all ask.   Bowling.  I think it might be making a comeback.  This was the way to spend your days in the 80's.  And while I didn't spot anyone quite like "The Dude" from the Big Lebowsky, I'm glad to say that there are still some freaks that go bowling.    Long live the mullet.  I managed to surprise myself with the scores.  There was 11 of us.  A mixture of people from work and some friends that I go dancing with.  It was all pretty relaxed with people finding amusing ways of running the ball down.  I ended up winning both games with scores of 160 and 146 respectively.  I think I was pretty damn lucky.  But luck doesn't pay the bills so the bets that I made with people paid for my game. :- )  I might find myself going out again at some point further down the track for a game.  I'll need to wait though.  Have to give my mullet time to come out.
