I was talking to Sara last week and she mentioned going to see the Bourne Supremacy, Thursday night at midnight, so I thought why not have everyone else come too? Unfortunately Mandy, Adri, Katy V and Steven weren't able to be out that late for one reason or another so they came to the party but didn't come with Mel, Katie, Matt R, Josh H, Andrew, Pat, Allen and I to the movie.  The party was interesting... we watched two different movies at the same time, The Bourne Identity (since it's rather essential to see before seeing the sequel) and Good Burger. Then arm wresting and... er... leg wresting - something I'd never seen before.  The movie was fairly good... great plot, but I hated the ending and the cinematography during some of the action scenes was heavily annoying... infact the final chase scene was downright boring as a result.  Pat, Matt, Andrew and Josh stayed overnight afterward... we watched Kill Bill - strange, strange movie (directed by the same person that did Pulp Fiction) one of the scenes had to be black and white just to avoid an NC-17 rating. LOL  We woke up at noon or so and I took Andrew to work shortly there after... Then we that remained had fun shooting some bottles and fences and... houses with Pat's AEGs. Then came the water balloons... that kept us occupied for a couple hours (it's just a couple degrees shy of 100 today). I finally pegged a car that I was trying to hit for a while then we focused our effort on more... shall we say, mobile targets.  Josh, Matt and Pat left around an hour ago and I'm in my room listening to  American Hi-Fi - Nothing Left to Lose
