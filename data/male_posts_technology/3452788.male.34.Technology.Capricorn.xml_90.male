I think I am much better when I am busy and fixing many small things - as opposed to working for days on one big problem.  I am so juvenile right now.  I have the attention span of a 3-year-old, with about the same social skills.  Honestly, some days I feel like I relate to teenagers better than adults, bacause in a sense I am emotionally in that same tumultuous state (minus the acne and hormonal changes, thankfully).   Oh look, a funny.  I have not had much humor for several days; its return is a sign I am improving somewhat.  However, I am still weighted down by what happened.  I will struggle to deal with it, and Anne's reaction to it, for a long time, methinks.  I hope to sneak away and watch the Bourne Supremacy this afternoon.  I really liked the novels, and the 1st Bourne movie was great.  Matt Damon is so much better than his inept, cheesball friend Ben Affleck.  Another great movie - The Talented Mr. Ripley.  I saw Matt throw out the first pitch at a Red Sox game 2 years ago.
