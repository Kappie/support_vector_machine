It is 12 mid night as the BBC is playing some very dodgy programs so allas it was time for me to edit the blog. Well, yes I did arrive - only after feeling incredibly tired and emotional on the plane and getting misty eyed over the safety demonstration video leaving melbourne - maybe just don't ask. So anyway arrived in London - got the train to Paddington and then out to Brixton - yes Anne did warn me about the funny people standing out the front of the tube station - let me tell you London "funny" people make the laughing man on the Epping line look like my best friend. Anyway have got the knack of Brixton - head down walk fast so all is well.   Spent Friday night at a very funky club off Oxford st - danced until four and had a brilliant time. Saturday was also spent dancing although I nearly fell asleep on the dance floor so didn't make it that late - although managed to entertain many people with the term "tracky dax" for much of the evening. Put Gede on the train yesterday and spent today being all cultural at the tate gallery. Tomorrow will involve more shopping and then a show in the evening - I know I am sooooo posh! Off to see mum and dad on Wed so very excited. Anyway, that's all from me - the BBC is getting VERY interesting. Carrie and James - I am officially worried Caz - caught up with Emma and had a great time. Love to all and take care - James I am sure Fred is alright. Much love. Kai
