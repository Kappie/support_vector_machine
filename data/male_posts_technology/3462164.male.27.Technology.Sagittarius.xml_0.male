Pride Pride GP: CRITICAL COUNTDOWN 2004 was worth the hype, and is one of the stongest Prides yet not just in terms of match ups but also quality of matches.   Kazushi Sakuraba vs. Antonio Schembri   Nothing suprising here, Sak worked out a smooth victory over Elvis who still needs to learn to be more aggressive.   Quinton Jackson vs. Ricardo Arona   Now this one came as a bit of a surprise to me. Rampage has shown a weakness for very technical BJJ fighters on balance. His slam of Arona was sight to behold and pretty much eliminates any concerns I might have had about his head not being in the fight [no pun intended here]. As for some of the complaints about the headbutt -- Arona was KO'ed by the slam and it is clear by watching. The unintentional headbutt could have worked against Quinton, if Arona had not been KO'ed the cut on Rampage's brow would have ended the fight in Ricardo's favor.    Semmy Schilt vs. Sergei Kharitonov   Kharitonov is one hell of a good fighter in my book. His beating of Ninja should have clued everyone in and left no doubt this guy can hang with the best. Semmy seemed to frustrate Kharitonov early on with his reach and powerful left, however, on the ground Kharitonov took the fight to him and pounded out the win. I like that Kharitonov seems to strike hard and often on the ground to fend off submissions and set up his own. Hamanaka used this against Schembri to great success. He is flexible enough as a fighter to give anyone trouble like Sakuraba. There is no doubt he has a big future. I would love to see him fight Randleman on the Final Conflict card in August.   Paulo Cesar Silva vs. Naoya Ogawa   Ogawa is a world-class grappler, and Silva is a white belt. Was there ever any doubt on this one? Ogawa easily defeated the Giant with strikes after neutralizing any defense Silva could mount. I do have to say though Silva couldn't have lost either way. He still looks good on paper for getting this far and he wasn't injured at all. I like Ogawa; I hope he gets Nogueira in the next round that will make for a great fight.   Anotonio Nogueira vs. Heath Herring   Hands down the best fight of the night. This fight was intense with or without build up, which it didn't get enough of. Once again Nogueira proves he is just a bit too slick for Herring by working in a very slick side choke variation. Honestly, Nogueira is showing the greatest promise so far in the possiblity of taking home the belt. With Mirko out of the picture and Nog in the best shape of his life I think Fedor is going to be pushed farther than he ever has before.   Hidehiko Yoshida vs. Mark Hunt   This one went pretty much as expected if Yoshida got the take down. I must say though Hunt looked great in his submission defense. This guy has a great future in Pride if he gets over his fear of being taken down. Anyway, Yoshida by armbar, again.   Fedor Emelianenko vs. Kevin Randleman   Big build up, big slam by Randleman, big win for Fedor. This one went pretty much like Fedor's last fight -- Fedor is taken down and ends the fight with a quick submission. Though the loss isn't all bad for Randleman. In the past Kevin has seemed very lackluster with only moments of brilliance. With this fight however I think he is on a new path. Yes, I know he lost, but had he been in the ring with anyone but Fedor that fight would have ended with the slam. If he would just follow up, the fight may have ended there. I think Kevin needs sometime to get his life in order after the tragic passing of his father, then we are going to see him move on to great things. If he continues to fight at this intensity he will dominate the heavyweight division and perhaps take the title. Fedor on the other hand, it seems, has proven his resilience yet again. The tournament is clearly now down to Nogueira and Fedor. So far he seems unstoppable.
