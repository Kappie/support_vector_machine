Armagedon really is pants, and a bit silly. I did not enjoy that movie, sorry. Girls, please explain, why are bras done up at the back, and not at the front? This evening, I went to a rather amsuing performance of Puss in Boots which Jo has been talking about, and it was very good - highly amusing. A few lines where wrong here and there, but it was all a good laugh. Nicki - who is Ryan Merriman?
