Imagine this, I'm driving onto the 520 bridge in horrible traffic with cops and ambulances passing us and I'm like frick, this is gonna freakin suck.  And all of a sudden my car starts shaking back and forth like freakin crazy, and I'm like, "Eh?"  Then I look at the other side of the bridge and it is swinging all over the place, and then these huge ass waves shower over my car and I'm like "Eh?"  So I sit there going 2 miles per hour and I'm like, "This freakin rocks!"  So I turn on some Coldplay and sit there swaying back and forth like I'm in a 8.0 earthquake for atleast 30 minutes, and my car is getting drenched, and I'm just chillin' thinking, "This is the coolest moment of my life..."  And then I got sea sick and almost threw up and I was like, "Freakin' A, I gotta get off this bridge..."
