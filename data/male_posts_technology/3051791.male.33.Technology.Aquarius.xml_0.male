Damnit, I knew that the three types of firewalls were filtering, stateful inspection, and proxy, I knew that traceroute worked by sending ICMP packets with varying TTLs to get responses from each hop, but I just wasn't getting anything out properly. When he asked me the first question that I didn't know, I think it shook my confidence and I just slid downhill from there. I mean, I held it together, but my answers were clumbsy. It was more like a George Bush speech than a Bill Clinton speech, and I know I was capable of nailing it Clinton style. I guess I'll have to go to this next interview Thursday wearing a flight suit that I have no right to wear and maybe just intimidate my way into the position--worked for Bush, right? Damnit! If I fuck up getting this job because of that performance, I'll need to mete out some serious self-justice.  I finally found the Benni Benassi video for   urlLink Satisfaction  . I must say I'm strangely allured by these scantily clad, sweaty chicks with power tools...  Great article ( Flying Solo ) in last week's MW about being alone in the Big Apple. An entertaining read: "Or there's roof access, the ultimate apartment feature...I don't need a TV if I have roof access. Apparently someone else in my building felt the same way, and they tossed their TV off the roof onto 4th street. After that, our landlord padlocked the door to the roof and I bought a TV." It's not on their site, gotta find a printed copy.
