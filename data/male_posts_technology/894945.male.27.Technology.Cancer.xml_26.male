I know you can buy  urlLink third party software  to get it working, but surely that's missing the point. The iPod isn't cheap anyway at £300. Why would I want to pay again for the software to get it working under Windows? Or was Apple expecting Windows users to buy a iMac just to use a iPod? Chaaaaaaa, right...  I would give it about five months before Microsoft release a MP3 player of their own, almost identical to the iPod, and blow it out the water. The sad thing is, i'd much rather give my cash to Apple than Microsoft.
