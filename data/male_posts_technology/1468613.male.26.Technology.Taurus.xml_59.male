However, while waiting in the line to get ont he train I noticed just a few people wearing Scotland rugby tops and most of the men were wearing kilts. I thought either there was a really big sale of rugby tops in Glasgow - particularly if you were wearing a kilt - or there must be a match in Edinburgh. I confirmed my hunch when I called Anne and she gave me some directions on how to get to the match. It was good fun - I don't really quite understand some of the rules though... and why they hell do they do the scrum, I really don't know. Scotland was playing Italy and lest to say the Italians are not a  rugby  nation. They were whipped by a margin of 22 if I remember correclty. They also seemed to have a bit of a problem with some of their players to because for some reason they kept on swapping player number 15 with 22. There was a point where 22 stayed on for about 3 min when he was substituted again! About 25,000 people came to the match and when they exited the stadium we were blocking traffic most of the way back into the centre of Edinburgh - it was a great experience.  So after watching something very blokey I thought I'd better do someting a bit more cultured and so I wandered up the hilly side of Edinburgh to find a festival program. Aftera bit of exploring some of the streets I happen to come across the centre of the  Fringe festival  where they'd blocked off a street and people were performing on small stages. Finding myself a festival guide, I wondered off again to find a pub or a bar to sit and find something to see. I found a funky little bar off the main road called the Brass Monkey and perused the events while sipping a pint of Red Stripe. However, the task of finding something to see was a little hampered by the fact that there were over 150 venues and even more performers. Thinking finiding something good to see would be very hard I came across an ad in the guide for " Shakespear's Italian Job ". I thought FANTASTIC - this is something I've got to see and the plus was it was relativley close by - only thing was that it started about 5 min ago. So I downed my pint and rushed over to the venue. Only to find out that it was sold out. Along with it was the Umbilical Brothers which is always a good show. But my like changed when I was standing outside looking for something else I could see there when a guy came up to me and offered a ticket for free - they'd bought to many. So I headed in to see the Illusion Brothers. It was a play and I didn't figure what it was about until I read the blurb for it in the guide - something to do with escaping boredom. It was a little abstract but nonetheless enjoyable to see. Though because I'd just sculled a beer and inside it was very very warm, I couldn't help but feel a little sleepy in some of the slow parts.  By the time the play was finished it was about 9ish so I thought it was time to head home. It was also the time that the Scottish supporters were heading home to so it made for an eventful ride home.  They'd obviously headed to the pub before and after the game and obviously were pretty rowdy. I was just standing in the train because there were not seats left and about a dozen loud and drunk guys pushed in also. A poor girl was sitting on her bags in the doorway to and nearly got crushed when a couple of the lads decided to have a bit of play fight there. They were singing and talking dirty at the top of their voices and then to top it off, one of them threw up 15 minutes before Glasgow station.  In addition to seeing a rugby match and a play for free in Edinburgh, my luck was with me yesterday to. I was just wandering around Glasgo when I got a call from Richard saying that he head a extra ticket to the Big Day Out @ the Green here in Glasgow! So I went and saw  Queens of the Stone Age  and  The Red Hot Chili Peppers!!!!!  It was very very very cool. The peppers were the headline act and it was an amazing show... soo many people there.  My credit is about to run out at this Internet Cafe so it's adios for now.  Are my posts getting a little long? I think they are...  lots of love -gede
