I say don't get off with 15 gold digging slappers... get off with 15 young rich office managers!!!! I say more photos of our nights out.... I say more scantily dressed women.... I say more trips to Guernsey…. I say Toaster; you couldn't stop being a slapper if I tied you down on a raft in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!!!!!!  If 2002 taught me anything it was that I have not been having enough fun....You made me Danger this year and that is how it's going to stay.
