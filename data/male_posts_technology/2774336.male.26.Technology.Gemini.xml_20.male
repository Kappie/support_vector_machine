       Stubborn Belching 

 Abdominal cramping 

 Uneasy feeling 

    

     

 

 

 Well, I guess I was wrong, my intestines are still cramping at almost 8:00 now. It was under my notice for a while though. 

 I'm watching "Windtalkers" now on DVD. John Woo shouldn't make war movies, his style of filming action just doesn't portray war the way that Spielberg does, but then who can match Spielberg...
