Possibly, you say something to yourself or one of your friends you happen to be with.      This - somehow - is different from that, yet strikingly familiar.      I work with her; of course. She's a tall,  long-legged  brunette. I placed that one part in italics for a reason. Lots of girls have long legs. Others have really nice legs. Very few have long, sexy legs AND are hot as well. At least, that's my opinion. She fits this prestigious and illustrious category and that means EVERYTHING to this writer/blogger.      We're both married and I try not to pass judgement on her relationship with her husband, even though he is ajerk to her, because everyone sees something attractive in their mate that others may not see.      We flirt; way too much. In fact, I admit that I'm guilty of responding to comments she makes to me via email in such a way as to force the topic into a direction that can be sexual in nature. But, I really believe that she has mastered the use of comments which can be interpreted either x-rated or g-rated at the same time.      For instance; I mentioned that I had brought in some red grapes and offered some to her. Her reply was, "I do need to stuff my mouth with something. I'll be right over." I cut and pasted that into this document. I'm not making that up or leaving anything out.      C'mon! No one just  says  something like that, right? I  know  that she knows I'm attracted to her. I feel that she is to me as well, but it could just be "harmless" flirting.      Women.      They really love to play with a guy's mind.      Don't you know of a girl (or guy, whatever) that you'd just love to hold hands with, kiss and play with (tickle, caress, etc.)? My crush is starting to make me want these things with her. Granted, I married someone who makes me feel this way too. But this is starting to make me think that human beings really shouldn't be monogamous.      Before you go there, YES, I have been cheated on and YES it hurt like hell. But the reality is that the girl I was with at the time simply didn't want to be monogamous. I wasn't "bad", I just wasn't "different" enough.       Face it! We all go out with our friends and/or loved ones looking as good as possible. We really could not care less who pays attnetion to us; as long as someone other than the one we're with does! Especially if that person paying us attention is with someone of their own! It's an ego trip. It's a power thing.       I believe that it's in our genes (not jeans!).      In this particular case, I would never leave my wife for her. But, the sexual attraction to my crush is incredible! I sometimes want to ask her if she feels it as well. Then, common sense kicks in as well as some fear of not really wanting to know - one way or another - if she does.      Well, I guess its all done for another week. Over the weekend, I don't think about her and I.      Ever have one of these people in your life? I hope so...
