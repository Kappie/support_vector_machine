What made the day though was belting out a bucket of balls after work. I'm loving this new driving range. The bugs were out in full force tonight, which was my good deed for the night i guess, offering up a half teaspoon of blood for mosquito meals. It seems a little crazy to me that it could get so damn hot in one day.  it's been freezing the past while and today was scorching. Not complaining though, you don't have to shovel sunshine.  I'm out.
