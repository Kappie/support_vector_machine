But if you hit something make sure you don't run off. ... "The man was convicted of hit-and-run and sentenced to a fine of 600 euros," court spokesman Juergen Mannebeck said on Tuesday. "It's hard to believe but in fact no law was broken with the intercourse on the motorway. It's a situation lawmakers never thought about."  Ahem Ahem!! LOL!!  The courts worldwide, are an endless source of mirth!!
