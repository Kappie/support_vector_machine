Its funny that they let me do my blogs at work while they buld a giant firewall on something that doesn't take that much bandwidth.   My DengMangalagu project is however still consistently getting at least 1 invite every 2 days.  I dont get to check as much as I used to.  I have to go to an internet cafe just to follow up on my testimonials and messages and stuff. (Yawn) life is peachy.
