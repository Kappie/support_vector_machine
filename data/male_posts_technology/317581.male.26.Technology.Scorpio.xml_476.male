It's just 1 more thing on a list of things that have happened on an ultimately frustrating week.  Now I find out I get to have the house to myself pretty much this weekend. Not really looking forward to that. C'est la vie.  If you're reading this, email me and say "hi". I can always use a little mid day pick me up.  urlLink EMAIL   Peace-
