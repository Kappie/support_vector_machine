While I think Robert Silverberg is my favoriate author of all time, science fiction is not the only thing I read.  If I had to list my top 10 books or series of books, they would be (In no particular order):    urlLink The Chronicles of Narnia by C. S. Lewis    urlLink The Man in the Maze by Robert Silverberg    urlLink Great Expectations by Charles Dickens    urlLink The Winter King, Excaliber and Enemy of God by Bernard Cornwell    urlLink Lightning by Dean Koontz    urlLink Sphere by Micheal Crichton    urlLink Daughter of the Empire, Servant of the Empire and Mistress of the Empire by Raymond Feist and Janny Wurts    urlLink Cry, The Beloved Country by Alan Paton    urlLink Zoo Doings by Jack Prelutsky    urlLink The House with a Clock in it's Walls by John Bellairs
