Apparently this guy was waiting for one of his investors to transfer 25 million dollars into his bank, but discovered that the investor had actually been killed in a car crash! Now this man left no will, but clearly the banker still had the smell of uber cash in his nostrils and came up with a plan. He needed someone from the UK to act on the investors behalf (according to ethiopian law it has to be a foreigner, imagine that) and transfer all that money into this reputable mans bank. And can you guess who this ethiopian chose for this enterprise? Yes, that's right, of all the people in all the world, he sends ME an email asking ME PERSONALLY to help sort this situation out, and I am going to get a whopping TWENTY PERCENT of that cash!!!  Now that's pretty lucky I hear you shout. But wait, it gets better. I returned home from work today to find another email. This one was from a big cheese in the Nigerian oil industry, the story goes that this man needs investment into his petroleum ventures, the email states everything quite clearly that any investment, no matter how small, would bring unbelievable returns. Now, at this point I have to admit I was pretty flabbergasted, I couldn't believe my luck, I had only just that day been told I am the proud owner of five million dollars and then along comes a completely sound airtight business venture for me to sink my teeth into.   The world is a funny place, but I have a feeling about these emails, they simply ooze legitimacy. Ill keep you all posted.
