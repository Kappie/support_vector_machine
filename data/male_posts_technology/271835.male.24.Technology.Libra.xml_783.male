Has sound (Eve of Destruction as backing track) but can be watched without. Well worth a watch if only to remind us of what a fscked up world we live in.   via  urlLink Space Hardware  but I've just seen it again on  urlLink Flophouse  this morning which reminded me about it so they can both have a link!
