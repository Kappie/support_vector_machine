It is packed with tourists speaking Italian, German and Norwegian (or something Scandinavian).   I went and saw the dolphins this afternoon. They were awesome. I felt like a bit of an ass being on a boat out bothering them in their natural habitat but I really wanted to see them and seeing them won out. They look unbelievably beautiful, graceful, andsort of Mona Lisa'ish with their "I know something you don't know" smile. I wonder what they think about the big boat full off idiots with camera who come by every two hours to look at them.   I haven't run into Tiger Woods here yet as he's at Troon about a 4 hour drive away but somebody in some goofy union jack pants is on the cover of all the papers. Golf...  The breakfast's here have been good but they keep sticking beans on my plate and I keep on not eating them.Coffee is always good, especially so in Europe but...Starbucks here is ridiculously expensive (Â£1.60 for a regular) so I've been getting my fix elsewhere. I've only been having 1 a day with breakfast except for the days when exhaustion has overcome me and then I have a cup.  I haven't met anyone here. What's up with that? I guess I haven't been trying to meet anyone - bopping around like a mad person and then sitting and writing when I stop or collapsing in my room. But, in everyone else in the country's defence, I realize that I'm haven't been talking to anyone and I think I'll have to try harder to engage someone in conversation soon.
