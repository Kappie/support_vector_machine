"Wherz are youz goin', wez should share a taxi!" they were pretty cute, so I thought.. yeah, fuck it.. so the first one got dropped off around the corner and they spent about ten minutes saying a very emotional goodbye. ("I fucken lovez yooooou! uzz a babe alroght?" "I lovez you more yoooou!")  So then it's just me and this little Scottish brunette, heading around to hers. We start talking about chill-out music and I say I like Morcheeba a lot, and she says she has the CD and would Iike to come in for a drink and listen to it.... so i say yes.. we arrive at her place. She is lodger with an older guy. The place is a bomb site, wallpaper peeling off the walls and a serious damp problem. It's like Laurence Llewyn-Bowen's worst nightmare. Except the guy is obviously in IT as he has a computer rig worth about 3k, and about 10k worth of home cinema gear. Weird.  So I get a cup of tea and sit down, while the girly sticks on the Morcheeba CD. She is tweaking various buttons on the amp to get the sound on, then she passes straight out, hitting the deck with a thud.  I sit there for a few seconds, not completely sure what to do. I utter a rather pathetic.. "Umm... hello?" and she doesn't move. I go over and check her pulse, breathing etc.. then put her in the recovery position and walk back home. I sure do pick 'em.
