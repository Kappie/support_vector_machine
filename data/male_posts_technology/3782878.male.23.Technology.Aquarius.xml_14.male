The unity between my mind and my body has strengthened further as of late, as now I can consume my flesh to fuel my mind at a faster rate, allowing me to perform my tasks easier, and with less rest in between battles.  Once I had reached 16th season, I began my hunt in the Paludal Caverns in earnest, where before I was dying more than I was living, I now thrive. Since none of the foolish recondite camp raiders will invite me to assist them, and the ones that do have been nothing but trouble. I hunt the phlarg fiends, with my skeletal assistant I can handle them very easily now, though their disease is quite potent.  I have reached 20th season now with the aide of a Mage who came to assist me, a friend of Mheat's, a person I met and befriended in the recondite camps the one time that I got invited. The mage was powerful and it seemed as though we could take on three or more at a time with this combination. We were successful at getting my 20th season accomplished even with the set backs of being what people in common parlance call "trained".  Afterwards I gated to Shadowhaven and made way to the Plane of Knowledge as I had missed picking up my latest summoning spell from the vendors there. With it, I shall be even more powerful.
