He's only went and took his pack of ill begotten offspring and  urlLink piddled all over  the People's Princess' Memorial thingummybob. He should be put down for treason. "'The critical issue is that this is a memorial. I don't think any responsible person would want to see people allowing their Dogs in it.'" We're very sorry and we promise not to let him out again.
