He's funny. His latest blog is a theoretical analysis of leftist and rightwing political strategy during wartime. All of this is simulated via Warcraft III on his painfully slow computer. His conclusion (if there was one) is "that I suck at Warcraft 3 even worse than I suck at life."   Ben reminds me that, despite all the people I see on TV, there are a few thoughtful, intelligent conservatives out there.   If not for a few friends who don't have blogs, I'd think the same about liberals, and libertarians for that matter. And on and on.   Mike Sheffler's  urlLink Cone of Ignorance , similarly, reminds me that math majors, though generally not to beseen within public, can be interesting human beings and are worthy of our friendship--or at least interesting to put behind glass and study.     **Bonus points if you can pick out the sentence I stole directly from Kurt Vonnegut. This is getting ridiculous.
