Grafigo is an uncomplicated graphics program that integrates shape recognition, handwriting recognition, and real-time collaboration tools. For general Tablet PC use, Grafigo is a logical complement to Windows Journal."

 

 This is the application I have been waiting to use for a long time. This would be great for sketching ideas and passing them onto other people. I imagine Microsoft Visio will have similar capabilities.
