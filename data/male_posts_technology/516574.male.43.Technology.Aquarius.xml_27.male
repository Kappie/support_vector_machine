True -- I'd phrase it more like "I'm  comfortable  with my job" (Lord knows it's not like I'm back working on the sewage system of a church-based wilderness camp or anything), but I'd *love* to be working on something that combined computer programming, music, poetry, aesthetics, psychology, chaos theory, string theory, fuzzy logic, the properties of concrete...   2. I find time to 'smell the flowers' so to speak.  False -- I don't *like* the flowers, I'm *allergic* to the flowers, and I can't smell  anything  anyhoo with my current set of sinuses...   3. I have no problem thinking of things to write about in my blog.  False -- check the past week for evidence...   4. 'Organization' is my middle name!  True -- although 'overly-endlessly-organizing-to-the-point-of- urlLink OCD ' might be more apropos...   5. If 'Plan A' doesn't work, there's always a 'Plan B.'  True -- but when you're down to 'Plan Z', it might be time to reconsider your goals...   6. I adjust easily to new surroundings.  False -- I  adjust  to where an outside observer would *think* it was easy, but internally, it rarely is...   7. I'd rather work 'behind the scenes' than 'in the spotlight.'  The terminology used in this question incline me to want to answer False: in the contexts of 'performance' (concerts, theatre, etc.), I tend to gravitate towards the spot -- in an everyday-life context, though, I'd tend to answer True (in the words of Adam West's Batman, " urlLink I shouldn't wish to attract attention "...)   8. I'm happy where I am, at this point in my life.  False -- I can relate a little too well to  urlLink Woody Allen 's  urlLink oft-proclaimed sense  of self-suspected  urlLink anhedonia ...   9. I can wake up in the morning without an alarm clock.  True (I *can*, but no bets on if I *would*) -- I don't typically use an alarm clock myself now, but J does, then  she  makes sure I get up -- in her absence, if I want to get up  on time , then the alarm clock becomes a necessary evil...   10. I can function pretty well on less than 8 hours of sleep.  True, if we emphasize the phrase 'pretty well' --  I  typically  function on less than 8 hours...
