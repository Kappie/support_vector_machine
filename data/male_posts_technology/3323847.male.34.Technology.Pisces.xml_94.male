He seems to indicate, in a round-about sort of way, that it's the responsibility of the developers to create games that are more palatable to younger players.  I find this to be complete hogwash.  The developer's primary objective is to provide a product that their potential customers  want . Should that be ultra-violent games with little plot, so be it. So long as they make a concerted effort to label these games accordingly ("Not for anyone under X years"), I have no problem with that.  Sure, this won't stop kids from getting the game, but is this  really  the fault of the developer? Should I sue RJ Reynolds because the local Kwik Trip sells my teenage daughter cigarettes? Should I blame Playboy because my son obtained an issue from his best buddy? Do I need to take Smith  Wesson to task because a local crack-head shot my cat with a gun made by them? I would certainly hope the reasonable answer to this is "Of course not!"  Like it or not, this whole "Violent Video Game" topic, so far as I'm concerned, lies  solely  on the shoulders of us parents.  These games (or at least every one I've seen) are  clearly  marked as such, so any claim of ignorance by any parents is, well, simply ignorant.  No matter how I flip this coin, it's always coming up "parent" for me.  Even if my 12-year-old son had $50 to go out and buy one of these games, it's still  my  responsibility as a parent to instill in him that this is really not content he should be dealing with at his age (the same argument goes for porn, alcohol, cigarettes, etc).  Basically, pointing the finger anywhere else is simply irresponsible and, in my obviously strong opinion, ultimately teaches our children to shirk responsibilities, blaming anyone but themsleves for the problems of the world.  Wow, I really took that one around the block, eh? ;)  PS: I was initially going to partially agree with that author on the topic of having developers create clearer delineation between "right" and "wrong". As you can probably tell, I changed my mind. Like many things these days, video games are slowly moving into the "reality" realm that sells so well. Quite honestly, in the "real world", the difference between right and wrong is often not all that clear-cut...
