The snowboarding and skiing has been giving a rest today due to a dangerous drinking session last night. Myself and Dougal ended up in a club called "Aurora".  The music was, frankly, rather awful to start off with. A mix of drum and bass and Luther Vandross. However they started playing a bit of hip-hop later on. Boosted by a few double T's I took my place upon the stage and began to stoke the fires of the soul train. I made friends with some homeboys (called Chad, Brad and er.. something) and showed them a few of my dangerous b-boy moves. Later I indulged in some of the gyrating that homeboys do. Which basically involves finding a willing (or very drunk) young lady and rubbing your crutch in a circular motion around her botty. It was fun.  Dougal and I have distressed many people, not least the waitresses that told us our 'plates were very hot so be careful' then we instantly tried to press each others hands on them and burn each other.  I think we have drunk Banff dry of most of it's Kokanee (the local brew) and gave the locals a damn good thrashing at pool, even with their silly rules.  Anyway.. i'm offski for another beer as i'm starting to sober up.
