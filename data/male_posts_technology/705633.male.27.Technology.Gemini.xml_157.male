"So what has that lazy head-banging son of a bitch been up to then!" ...Well just that really, I have been spending allot of time up at the Splash (best club in the island, and I will make anyone who disagrees hurt real bad). Custard and myself went up this Saturday gone with a few mates and proceeded to get very, very pissed! I even managed to knock someone out cold with my thick skull (by accident of course, don't want a lawsuit). All in all it was a sound night except for the fact that I missed a phone call from my girlfriend who is currently away in Belize (that’s South America) for three weeks, and that really sucked! Guess that’s the price you pay for listening to 'Satan’s Music'.  Like I said my girlfriend is away at the moment for three weeks and I really am missing her. The funny thing is that I am dealing with not seeing her for three weeks, it's just the fact that I can't even contact her. It really is amazing how much this sort of separation makes you realise just how important a special person is to you! Whilst the body can cope without any contact for such a period of time, my mind yearns to be able to simply talk to her. What can I say.... It’s the simple things that we take for granted that we really miss. Oh well, she'll be home in twelve days now so I will deal with it. Oh by the way...  HAPPY 21ST BIRTHDAY TO ME!  That’s right, its my 21st birthday today and I am going to get pissed at the Splash this Saturday, and if any readers of the Toaster Files are up there then feel free to buy me a drink hehe. Well there may be some photos kicking about soon so keep your eyes open. Baity signing off...............................................................
