     

      So, I finally found a place to live.  We have yet to sign the lease, so this might be premature: 

4 bedrooms (2 singles, 2 doubles)

2 bathrooms

2 floors

Dishwasher

Air Conditioning

Only one parking space.

 

The apartment complex name is 'Canterbury Lodge' and the apartment name is 'Penthouse C'...  you can't get much better than that.
