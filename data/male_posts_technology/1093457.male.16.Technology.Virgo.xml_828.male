But anyway, if your trick or treating don't bother coming to my house because we never open our door to any person silly enough to knock on complete strangers houses.   I got back from Birmingham yesterday. It was cool. The uni is right in teh city centre so a five minute walk and there is the train station and many a shop. HUGE shopping centres there. I got some new clothes but I've run out of room so I need hangers and I need more drawers. Sorry about not blogging Jackie, I haven't had time. Harass Max. He hasn't said a word yet about Max Payne 2.
