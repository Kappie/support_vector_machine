Today I was playing with ADO.NET accompanied with the great book of Wrox guys Professional ADO.NET. Well, things seem a little more clear now, but a migration from ADO 2.x to ADO.NET is a pain in the ass. After 3/4 unexpected failures I got my idea working and I now I feel ready for the real thing.
