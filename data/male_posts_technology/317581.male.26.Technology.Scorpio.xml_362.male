Go get oil changed at 10 in order to be home for Houck's visit at 11:45ish.   Oil change gets done at 12:30, Houck's waiting when I get home. Get Manga:)   Eat lunch with Kevin and Houck at Olive Garden(Cafe Veloce was closed)   Back to the house for a little Simpsons road rage.  Next stop, Jarred's for reading Manga/comics/books/slam dunk contest.  7:45 - dinner at piecola's(sp?)  9:10 - Metropolis (Excellent movie)  11:30 - drive home:) (Cliff got yelled at by the crazy lady 2 doors down, "FUCK YOU CRAZY LADY")  Thumbs hurt from too much comic book reading. OUch.
