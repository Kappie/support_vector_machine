I haven't trained as well since I've been working, apart from just some pushups and squats.  Well to be honest, I didn't start the session off so well. But I took a moment to focus and give myself a little "mental re-adjustment", just before getting in the ring with John (yes we have a ring now!) and it worked wonders. :)  Watch out (at training) on Monday, everyone. *muahahahaha* (evil laugh)
