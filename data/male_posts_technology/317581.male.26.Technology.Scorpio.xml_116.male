I just wish they'd make up their minds. It's tough to get into a normal routine when your schedule seems to change everyday. On a bit of a side note, my lead can be kinda weird sometimes. Like Saturday morning, I forogot to shut my web browser after I checked my hotmail account before work, and he's all giving me some inquisition about having a web browser open while I am working. Then yesterday my co-worker had a web site open while working and nary a word said by the lead. Of course, this is the co-worker who the lead always goes to lunch with and carpools with. Draw your own conclusions. It's just wierd to have a lead who acts all cool one day towards you, and then acts all superboss the next. Argh. At least I'm enjoying the game I'm working on a bit more.   Anyhowie.... this weekend is moving time, so the temporary living situation is almost over! Finally!   Time for sleep.
