Their is a good article on  urlLink Indymedia  about the destruction of the free press. With the corporate media being escorted by the us goverment, and the non-corporate media being target by the US miltary and being restricted in Israel very little information will be pubished. Only propaganda is being fed to the people it is very disgraceful. Without a semi-objective view point we will al be in the dark. What journalist would want to go do a fair report when they could be  urlLink targeted .
