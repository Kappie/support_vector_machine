       Throat constriction 

       Cold Esophogus 

       Belching 

    

     

 

 

 I've been taking long pulls of water from my room temperature water bottle, and I'm getting a lot of belching, bloating, cold throat and a feeling of my throat constricting.  All of these things are common when I drink a lot of water.
