(well, my buddy list is like 46 strong, given I don't talk to all of them, but some) Anyway, I was just wondering what the FUCK "heh" means. I mean, I've talked to about 10 people that use it. Are you trying to say Hey? or are you almost laughing? like, "heh, that was almost funny enough for a hehe, but you're a fuckin tard, so I'll only give you a heh". So if someone could please explain this mysterious word for me, I would be most appreciative.
