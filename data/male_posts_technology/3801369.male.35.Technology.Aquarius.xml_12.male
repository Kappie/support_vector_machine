But thank the pagan gods I happened to not be under huge time pressure, as the learning curve resembles an olympic ski-jump. Much of the complications in my case arose from my need to integrate with a variety of technologies, including  urlLink Jakarta Tomcat ,  urlLink Jakarta Struts ,  urlLink JDO , XML, JSP,  and others.  To use these efficiently from within Eclipse you need to:       choose an appropriate  urlLink Eclipse plugin  for each technology (this is not as simple as it sounds - there are several to choose from for each technology, both free and commercial, not all of which necessarily do the job particularly well).     get the chosen plugins to work individually with the particular version of Eclipse you happen to be using (3.0, in my case). Again, this is not trivial, given that Eclipse 3.0 was only released quite recently, and not all of the plugins have been tested with this version yet.     get all of the chosen plugins to co-exist happily. In many cases this is simply a case of selecting the appropriate options correctly, and learning how to use them together - by no means an indictment on the Eclipse plugin architecture. But it's not difficult to end up overwriting the output of one plugin with the output of another, or ending up with more than one copy of the same file, simply 'cos you can't get the different plugins to all read from the same config file in cases where this makes sense.    It is my suspicioun that integrating a number of independent technologies like this is the norm rather than the exception, so I imagine that a lot of people are going through the same pains as I did. To make matters worse, I would guess that a number of developers are both learning the technologies (in my case JDO and Struts were relatively new) at the same time as the IDE (Eclipse in my case). Ouch!    Rather than try to explain all the problems I had, and tell you all the answers I found, I would suggest that it makes more sense to start with a "commercial" distribution of Eclipse, where someone has gone and done all the hard work for you.  urlLink myEclipse  and  urlLink Yoxos  appear to be amongst the contenders in this area. Although I have not looked at either of these distributions, my guess would be that it would be welll spent money for any professional developer.    Anyone have any experience with these products, or any opinions on the matter?
