I just heard today that Morgan Webb, the beloved host of G4TechTV's X-play posed for  urlLink Maxim Magazine  Appearantly this has been known for quite a while, but its news to me.  Geek's all across America have begged and pleaded for something of this nature. Just imagine how much one of those 50 year old guys that pretends to be a teenage girl on the internet finally getting a hold of a Playboy with the Olsen Twins in it. Thats what this is like to Geeks.  On a completely unrelated note, Trent, aka God, got a new blog a couple days ago, and he mentioned my blog in there, even had a strange little picture, which looks nothing like me....so, to both of you that read this blog, go visit his.  urlLink http://thenewtrent.blogspot.com/
