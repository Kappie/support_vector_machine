Basically I called Karissa and she did not want to talk to me at all.  Not even to say her usualy can I give you hugs and kisses and hang up.  Today I have a little more to write about.  Isn't it interesting how I talk to   SFW   and I have so much more to talk about.    I did talk to Karissa and the conversation went pretty much like I described above other then to say I am tired daddy I did not sleep enough.  I had the fine opportunity to argue with   SFW   today after my conversation with Karissa.  She basically said what days this month do you want to see Karissa since you have to give me 2 week notice (really it is only 1 week and I sent her an email with the court order stating so), when I asked are you going to WA or TX she said I don't know which is bullshit.  The day you plan to leave and you don't know whether you are going South or West?  Is she going to get in the car and drive randomly until she arrives at one of the 2?   I also sent her a copy of the section in the court order where she is once again in contempt by not telling me.  It reads (paraphrasing here) when the move is unintended or could not be forseen you must notify other party as soon as you know about the move within 5 days.  So since the judge gave her 10 days to move my argument is she knew about the move 5 days ago! Not to mention she knows where she is going!   Of course I had to listen to her tell me how I did not care about the kids so why would I wish Jeremey a happy birthday. She told me how I Jimmy missed his sister so much while I had her that he slept in Karissa's bed for 3 days.  To that I said so because Jimmy misses Karissa I am not supposed to miss my daughter?  Because I am a male and could not possibly be a good father or Jimmy's love for his sister is more important then mine is that what you are saying?  That stung but at the same time pissed me off.    What was even better was as I was talking to her she stated that I just want to take Karissa away from her brothers anyway.  In the background in a loud yell I hear "YEAH!" from none other then Jimmy.  I said to   SFW   that I did not feel that was appropriate and she simply said that he knows what is going on I have informed him of it.  I simply responded with first of all your almost 14 year old son does not need to know what is going on in a divorce case.  In addition the stuff you are telling him can and probably does get repeated around Karissa.  This did not seem to affect her decision at all.  She simply said don't worry about it Karissa is not in the room.  She of course ends the call with the whole if I thought it would have ended like this I never would have married you!  Oh not me I know I dreamed of the day that she would kidnap my daughter and the sexual turn on I got from thinking that she would have numerous affairs is what kept me going.  Hell I wish she would have had more!    Please!  You know I was really thinking about things today and I realized what is driving me is 2 things.       I love my daughter and care for her upbringing and the stability in her life   Contrary to   SFW   thinking I am "just trying to make her life hard" I am being cheated out of a relationship with Karissa!  For that I am angry and Jealous!       SFW   wronged me in a way that can never be undone and for that I hope she gets hers...if I can help in that I will!  I don't really know   FS   and in a different situation I might like the guy but he is an unethical and immorral piece of shit and if   SFW   wants to be in love with that more power to her.  After all it is my opinion that "birds of a feather..."  I hope and pray that I can save Karissa from that.  I hope I can get the relationship I deserver to have with my daughter.  She deserves more then what she is going to get with   SFW  !  If I cannot get Karissa maybe I can help another child get to a better place...
