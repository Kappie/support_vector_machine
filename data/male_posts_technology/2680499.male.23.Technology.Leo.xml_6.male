And the birthday boy offered each of us a drink. Well that day, I did not get the drink coz we have to collect ourselves at his sisters stall. So my colleague and I got it today after lunch.  But what's important to tell is, I went windsurfing on that Saturday. It was very fun although I'm kind of suck at it. At least I did not fall as much as I did the first time. But I can't seem to control the direction. I happened to surf my way to the village close by the surfing point. Bad, bad, bad.... That was no good until one of the workers of the water sport center came to collect my sail and we head back to the center by walking cross the sea. I felt sorry for that guy for troubling him. And that's the end of my windsurfing experience.  Sunday has nothing much happened. As usual, I went out for breakfast with my mom and we went to buy some sundries. However, on that day my grandmother came down from other district and said wanted to visit one of my aunt's house, which she just moved in. So we brought her there. The housing area is still quite new. Many houses are still under renovation.   When I stepped into my aunts house I think it's nice. Everything is designed and decorated nicely. Then we visited the whole house. Everything is just fine and comfortable to live. I wish my house could be like this. Too bad I'm not a very good descriptor, or else I'll tell you how nice it is to be there.  Guess I have to stop here. Nothing much happen today. Just many people have asked me to bring something for them for another colleague in other district. By the way, I'll not be here for two days from tomorrow. Going outstation until Wednesday. So I'll be back to this blog on Thursday. See ya!!
