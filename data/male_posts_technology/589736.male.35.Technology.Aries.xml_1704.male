The thermal imaging thing is basically a double check to make sure that there are not more votes recorded on the computer's memory card than were actually cast.  It does it by having heat sensors that detect the heat from your fingers as you touch the screen.  The problem that I don't understand is how do you keep that number from being messed with?  Then again, I am not a computer software exper.  As for Franken, I ignore him just as I do Bill O'Reilly.  Thinking about, the reason they hate each other so much is that they are just alike except for the extreme opposition of their political views.  As for Rush, I am currently in a phase of not listening to him, but it will be interesting to see what happens when he comes back from rehab.  Never having had back problems (knocking on every piece of wood I can find), I can't imagine the pain that people must go through to become addicted to Oxicontin.
