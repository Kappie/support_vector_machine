They have the most awesome drink specials, at least... on Thursday (1.75 coronas and miller lites bucket of 6 for $10). Needless to say I drank my fair share. It was my roomie's and one of my other friend's birthday. Since my roomie was on his way back from Thailand I decided to make the beer I drank in honor of my other friend who was actually there. Little did I know picking up my roommate today from the airport would be a saving grace. I was pretty drunk and decided that I would go with my friends to the Big Hunt bar across the street to further celebrate the birthday of my friend. Luckily, she and her roommate had made friends with the bartender there and they could get better discounts (but not me of course, damnit, I don't have any boobs). I had two there, they were Red Hook ESB, which are pretty awesoem. I made it on the metro on time, luckily, because before I downed that last one I couldn't really stand up correctly. I passed out in my bed naked which I hardly ever do,mostly because of morning wood, which if I dont' wear underwear then wakes me up early (what a bitch). But, at least there was a reason for it, because I have to do laundry which requires quarters and I don't have any quarters. When I woke I was really thirsty and got some cereal in my stomach. I was running late until I drove to work, and I got there 25 minutes early. Apparently walking to work kind of ruins my sense of time since it took me like 10-15 minutes to drive there and when I walk it is like... 35. I was going to sit in my car but decided to walk in. I was sitting there the whole morning wanting to be asleep and my stomach feeling weird which is a reallycrappy feeling (if you have not gone to work hungover before I don't really recommend it). Then 10 o clock came around and I was celebrating in my mind because I got to get off of work to go pick up roomie from Dulles. I was so outta there. My saving grace, got to leave early and I called later and told my program manager that it wasn't worth coming back in and he said I didn't even need to use my leave time! "He is the coolest" in the gushy teenage girl (in the 80s)kind of excited way.Although if I actually behaved like an excited teenage girl from the eighties around anyone, then you have my permission to shoot me. Now recovery time, and time to find quarters.
