(see Sept. 11th post #1)  Uh...it was typical Monty Python and had a few good laughs but doesn't even come close to Quest for the Holy Grail.  Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for their brand of comedy, but I can't give it a single thumbs up.  Note that I am NOT a huge fan of British humor but for whatever reason have a weakness for the Holy Grail film.  The camping trip I had been looking forward to didn't happen.  Bubba was slightly sick and didn't want to go, especially since it was supposed to rain (which it did).   Instead Josh, Bubba, and I had a celebration of red meat, beer, and football at my house.  It was a great day for grilling and we had a good time, it sure was good to hang out with those boys.  Bubba's wife changed jobs recently and now works for a beer distributor so she can get cases of beer on the cheap.  (Thanks for the brews Bubba.)  The red meat and beer were good but the football left a little bit of a sour taste in my mouth as Wake lost to UVa.  Wake was up by a field goal late in the 4th and decided to go for it on a 4th and 2 instead of kicking an easy field goal.  They ran an ugly run play off to the side, got stuffed, and forfeited 3 points.  (Sound familiar?  Read my post from Sept. 15th.)  They then proceeded to let UVa march down the field and kick a field goal to tie it.  A few plays later, Randolph throws an interception which leads to a winning field goal by Virginia as the clock winds down.  What kind of bush league play calling is that?  NEVER GO FOR IT ON 4TH AND 2 IF YOU ARE UP BY A FIELD GOAL AND IN FIELD GOAL RANGE.  By calling that play Grobe not only gave away an easy 3 points but took the air out of his defense by saying "Hey, we gotta go for it and get up by more than a TD because there is NO WAY my defense can keep Virginia out of the end zone for another 5 minutes of play."  What a crock.  I just finished reading Umberto Eco's "The Name of the Rose" last night.  It's a murder mystery set in a monastery in the 14th century.  There was quite a bit of Latin (I'd say about a tenth) scattered throughout the text.  I don't comprehend ANY Latin words unless they are cognates or are in Requiem and I remember them from my choral days, so you would think that  I would have zipped right through this one.  You would be wrong.  It took me forever because I read this book 5 pages at a time.  After 4 pages my eyelids would begin to flutter as I struggled with consciousness and by page 5 I would be asleep.  I don't know why, it was a thoroughly entertaining story, but something about the style of writing knocked me out.  I would still recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good mystery.  Of course,  I only understood 90% of what I read so don't listen to me.     Alison and I watched "Sidewalks of New York" on Friday.  Neither of us is quite sure whether or not it was worth our two hours.  There is some good comedy but I think it was supposed to offer some commentary on life and love and I just didn't get it.  I like Edward Burns' voice, Brittany Murphy and Heather Graham are fun to look at, and that guy David Krumholtz cracks me up so I will give it one thumb up.      I've been riding my bike around Salem Lake often in the evenings.  I like riding that trail a great deal but I had to go buy a new saddle for my bike because my penis started going numb.  What's that?  No, you heard me correctly,  my penis would go numb after about mile 5 of the 7 mile trail.  I'm sure I don't need to explain how bizarre and VERY VERY BAD that is.  The new saddle is wider and has solved the problem.  I have resumed sleeping at night.  My fantasy football team lost 2 more this weekend.  I am now 9th in my league of 12 at 2 and 6.  I think Willie Nelson said it best regarding my fantasy team:  "Started out with a dream and the plans of a wise man, but ended up with the heartaches of a fool..."   -- Heartaches of a Fool
