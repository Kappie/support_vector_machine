I tried to run in the same place as Tuesday night (Beckett Ridge) last night but it was after dinner leaving me feeling sluggish and with a pukey feeling as my food tried to digest.  I set out again into the gorgeous weather of the evening right as the sun was setting.  My body never had a chance to catch up after dinner though as I tried my best to carry a decent pace and finish my intended 4 miles.  I slogged through 2 miles, debated stopping there since I was running by the house but kept on going only to stop a mile later in disgust of how bad I felt.  I walked back the mile and didn't even bother stretching.  The pukey feeling didn't really leave me until the Mayberry sister hooked me up with some gingerale after I took her back to Mayberry (Loveland).  The only redeeming qualities of the run had nothing to do with the run at all.  For starters, the Big City sister is in town and she has brought my two favorite nieces (Squidlet and Feral).  Secondly, the sky was gorgeous which leads to my final thought for the day.  Nothing else good to report.  At least it's good to be back to some semblance of running.  Now for a positive final thought after such a bad run. So amazing, as You paint the sky. So amazing, makes me wonder why You love me like You do.  Have a good day! TW
