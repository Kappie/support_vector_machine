With Drew's death, I have this overwhelming feeling that I have gone off course - I don't spend enough time with my friends or my family. Colm and I have our special time, but it's just not enough. His work schedule and my work schedule seem to conflict way too much. However, we did have the chance to spend some good, quality time together this past weekend. I had another job up in the Santa Barbara area, so that gave us the right reason for going back to that beautiful place. Here's a totally tangential thought - "Karaoke Revolution"! If you haven't tried it, do - you'll have a blast making a fool out of yourself and enjoying everyone else's foolishness! Peace!
