If I see another man hitting on Girlfriend, who is already aware that she is taken, I become upset. The feeling is like someone puts my ribs in a vice and squeezing. I don't know whether I want to throw up then go cry myself to sleep, or fly into a rage and beat the snot out of the intruder.  Girlfriend, for some reason which eludes me, does not like it when I speak to her about this. She remains oblivious to the fact that a man was even hitting on her. In her mind, he was just being 'friendly'. She does not realize that what he really wants is to reach one hand up her shirt and the other down her skirt. I know their true intentions. I've been around males enough to know this, not to mention I'm a card-carrying member of the man-club.  So anyways, Girlfriend gets mad because I get jealous. In my mind, she has no right to be mad at me, and I have every right to be angry at someone for hitting on her. What am I supposed to do? Just smile and say 'Hey Larry, how ya doin? Yea, I saw you hitting on Girlfriend 5 minutes ago. Sorry she turned you down. Naw, I don't mind that you put a move on her. Its not like we are a couple or anything. Oh wait, I forgot, we ARE a couple. Oh well, lets go shoot some pool." Is that the reaction she wants? Does she want me to encourage guys to go hit on her?  Now, let me clarify here that if its a stranger who doesn't know she's in a relationship with me, I don't get quite as upset. He doesn't know, so he's not at fault. In fact, I usually think that the guy has good taste in women, but poor research skills. But those bastards who already know drive me to the desire of beating their skull in with a baseball bat. And yet, I'm the bad guy. Go figure.  Then, I see in her livejournal an entry that says "Being hit on at work by a sexy guy is cool". I'm not going to make a big deal over it. I can't blame her for enjoying a little attention from the opposite sex. And its not like she flaunted it in my face. But still, I can't help but feel that tightening of the chest. It makes me wonder what exactly this 'sexy guy' did to make her realize that she was actually being hit on. .... No, I can't let my mind wander down that path. That way lies madness. And I'd have to kill him.  My Jealousy stems from fear and a view of self-inadequacy. I know I don't qualify as a 'sexy guy'. I don't even think I qualify as 'cute'(she says I do) and I can only semi claim that I'm 'intelligent'. I'm afraid that she will someday find someone better and she will leave me. That would suck for me. If she dumped me for someone who really was a better person for her, who made her happier than I do, who fulfilled more of her desires, I would eventually get over my grief, and be happy for her. But I know it would hurt to find out that I wasn't good enough. Rejection would suck. If she dumped me for someone who was clearly an inferior to me, I'd be eternally in grief. Fortunately, she's too smart to do that.  At this point though, she has been hit on by 85% of every male I have ever seen in contact with her. And yet, she's still with me. Its been 5 years since we first got together. She has broken up with me twice in that period of time to be with other guys. Both times, I was against it, and I said as much. I didn't believe that those two were better. Neither of them lasted more than a month before she broke it off and got back together with me. I feel more confident than I did at first that she will stay with me. But there are always going to be those moments where I feel uncomfortable. I can't speak up without angering her and I can't keep silent forever because it just doesn't feel right. Hell if I know what to do.   For now, I just suffer in silence, and keep my eyes on those bastards.
