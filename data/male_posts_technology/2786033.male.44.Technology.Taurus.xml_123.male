No disrespect intended to Anderson's situation, but he was  my daughter's frickin' teacher,  and he did a lousy job.     Deputy Lane County District Attorney Debra Vogt said Anderson "had a really good life going" until he started using methamphetamine.  He lost his job, and his home quickly became "a shambles."  He was a respected teacher  before he left the profession early this year.   Um, no he wasn't. I didn't respect him - he was amazingly unorganized and completely ineffectual, and now I find out he was a piece of trash drug addict. My daughter would tell us about what she did at school, and sometimes I thought she would have learned more staying home with her Game Boy. Our concerns were made known to the school administration throughout the year by parents who volunteered and worked at the school. No surprise that no action was taken until the following year, at which time Anderson was put on some sort of teacher improvement program. Guess it should have included a UA.   Sure, my opinion of Anderson built this post, but whom are you going to listen to? A member of the community he was supposed to provide a service to, or the County DA who knows Anderson as file #305872? I'm not alone in this opinion - my wife reminded me last night that she was lamenting with another parent about Anderson's lousy teaching, where she said "Either he's on drugs, or needs to be." Damn, the wife was right again.     Anderson's parents, Dan and Marilyn Anderson, said Aaron Anderson was drawn to people who were down on their luck and  was perhaps a little too trusting . But he didn't deserve to die, they said.  Don't make me post  urlLink the sign .  " Aaron will never be able to receive help.  We know he could have risen above the problem," Marilyn Anderson said. They asked for a maximum sentence, which is 20 months under Oregon sentencing guidelines.   Help? How 'bout a grain shovel full of 'you're an idiot for using drugs and trying to be employed to teach second graders'? Ignorance cannot be the plea here - you work in the  public school system .   Anyone know if there is any money spent on drug education in public schools these days? Anyone? Maybe lack of funding  is  a major concern for public education. Well, I gotta get over to the progressive party's sign-up list. Maybe we can get a program in place to have kids say no to drugs.   Moral of the story: Be skeptical as hell, especially when your kids are involved.
