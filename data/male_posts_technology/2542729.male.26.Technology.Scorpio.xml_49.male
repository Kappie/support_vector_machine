Additionally, normally the response by the other party is given...by the other party. Seeing as tho they have been reluctant to post their thoughts I thought i'd do my best to give an unbiased window into their feelings on the matter.  We agree. Thank you  goodnight.  Well, that was quick... Their other thoughts are too personal to post and are not available to the general public at this time.  In other news, finally caught up with web site maintenance. Posted updates to the  urlLink main site  and am now in search of something to do. I need to call some paint people and get some estimates on paint work for the "new" Wagoneer I bought yesterday. For those who don't know, I used to own a model that is nearly identical to this one. Only things different are the color (white) and tape deck instead of the cd player that was in the old one. It brings to closure a week of looking for a descent ride and ultimately i'm excited about it. In time I hope to get some better wheels put on it to complement the windows xp blue paint job its gonna get. Arite, that's my time. More updates to be posted as they becoem available.
