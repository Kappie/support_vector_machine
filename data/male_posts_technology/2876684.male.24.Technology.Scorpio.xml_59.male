So yes work is demanding, but it's all good. I survived my first week of work with no complaints, it's definitely a step up, dare I say it... the corporate ladder. Funny thing is, I wasn't even on the ladder last week. Stranger things have happened I suppose.  Speaking of moving up in the world, have a look at this post a classmate of mine who's back in London wrote on our post-graduation forum:  -- OK, I've started to sink my claws into the studio now and working three nights per week. The Black Eyed Peas are in for a long stint (6 weeks) at the moment to coincide with playing most of the European festivals. The Libertines have just finished recording with Mick Jones (Clash) producing and Bill Price (Guns 'n Roses, Sex Pistols, Clash, McCartney etc.) engineering. The White Stripes are in next week - I think my "choice" of studio turned out to be quite alright considering the talent coming through these doors at the moment!  --  Woo hoo, I'm gonna know someone who's worked with someone famous now! :P
