He said it was no problem handing it in 1 day late. He just asked me if I was a teacher in the school and I just told him I'm one of the IT trainers there. The journey back to CHIJ Katong Pri was a long and demoralising one because Bt View was at Bt Batok (West). Considering that after work I had to travel back from East to West again ... Anyway, I decided to take a slight change of route. Instead of taking to Paya Lebar MRT and taking 135 back to school, I decided to go to Dhoby Ghaut, 'tabao' bfast at Mac before taking 36 down. It's not really diverting myself off from the route to school, bearing in mind that 36 travels one heckuva direct route via Expressway down.  After work, I met up with Tang at City Plaza where we grabbed lunch at a hawker centre nearby. Food was cheaper than most places these days but it was horrible. Tang's words, "Life is just like gambling, it's just that we lost this gamble." haha. And another was "But life is not just 1 round of gambling." ... so there's still hope yet, heh. On our way down to ARCC he explained to me somethings about investment planning, unit trust, etc. Was quite interesting.  Today's training at ARCC was on jo. Very good because we did some co-ordination exercises (musubi seems like a regular practice ever since Williams Sensei introduced it to us), followed bu how to thrust with a jo. I never thought there was so many points to take note. What I learned yesterday, when thrusting the jo you should extend ki. Both hands should be extended (but not to the extent that you have your arms all straightened and elbows locked. Your hips will be twisting a bit to bring a bit of the force into the thrust. (Starting from left stance,) at the end of the thrust, our hips and body will be straight and facing the front. When thrusting, we take a step forward. Point of balance should be on the front leg and not the back. One test would be we can raise the back leg and we still won't topple over. But care needs to be taken not to over extend and fall forward. Right hand when thrusting forward, will twist the jo in a screw-like motion. You push the jo forward and the left hand just holds on as a guide. Finally at the end of a thrust, right hand will have contacted the left hand (if not, it means you haven't completed the thrust fully). If partner holds on to end of your jo and you do it right, they can't resist/stop you from thrusting forward. All these just for the thrusting motion. When pulling back the jo (meaning back to starting stance again), same un-screwing motion with the right hand. If done properly, partner will not be able to stop you from pulling back either. There's also some movement with the hips which I don't seem to have managed to understand. After pulling back, we raise the jo to our forehead as a protection to ourselves. Right hand should be just above our forehead, tip of jo should be pointed out at uke, I can't quite explain but the jo needs to be able to be high enough to protect a blow coming towards our heads from the top, and also prevent your left shoulder from being hit when a top strike comes down. All these 3 movements should be co-ordinated with ki extension to make it more powerful and graceful. Not 1, 2, 3, but a more fluid motion of ooooone-two. So many points and that's only trying it on my good side (left stance). On changing to right stance I can't even move properly anymore haha.  This morning I dropped by Tanglin CC for a look. AFS was invited for a combined training there. Guest instructor was Takezawa Shihan (7th dan), from Japan's Hombu. Was interesting just watching but I didn't stay for long. Basically slipped off before they bowed to the kamiza. Didn't feel like it after a morning's run. Not to mention I'll be catching Spiderman 2 at Lido right after lunch. I've decided to go to town looking like a satay-man haha ... can't be bothered to go in jeans and shoes on a Sun, especially when it's so close to home.
