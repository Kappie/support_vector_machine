Oracle claims it is ready for the market ( urlLink http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/os/linux/story/0,10801,94637,00.html ). Asianux was developed jointly by Red Flag Software Co. in China  Miracle Linux Corp in Japan. Oracle holds a 58.5% stake in Miracle Linux Corp.   So what's new  different with another version of Linux coming out? The major difference that I can see is this flavour unlike others is supported by an industry heavy-weight  Oracle will definitely want Asianux to be profitable commercially as they have a major stake in its development. Oracle is well established  can push their products on Asianux  can promote it to their existing customers and dramatically increase it user base.   I feel Asianux is one Linux distribution to watch out for in the coming days...
