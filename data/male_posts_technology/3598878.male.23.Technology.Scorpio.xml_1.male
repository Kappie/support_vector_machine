The moral of the story, as I see it, is if you life blows - try gambling. Bingo to be exact. See, Slim Shady's mom is a heroin addict looking lady with out much going for her. And her son is getting his lunch handed to him at work, on the mic, and by random dudes he catches boning his girl. But then the incredible happens... Shady's mom wins big at bingo. The family is happy. The movie ends on a high note.  When your down and out put all your money on the table at the local YMCA bingo parlor and God will do the rest.
