Went to collect my race entry pack at Pan Pacific Hotel for tomorrow morning's marathon, and had dinner with my friend. Apparently he's also interested to participate but had not been able to register before the closing date. Anyway we've arranged to meet at the luggage/bags deposits area instead.  Went straight home after that to rest and book a cab at 4:45am. Still have to pick up my friend at his home before we go down to National Stadium (start pt). At least I'll have co. for tomorrow's run.  OK. 8:30pm liao, time to sleep. Looking forward to an interesting morning...
