Okay, I had a head start at finishing them off.  But the best part is, you get a giant box of 'em for only $1.50 at the corner store (assuming your corner store has swedish cookies).  As far as scandinavian sweets go, I'm also a fan of swedish fish, but apparently there are some that will  urlLink summon  a plague of flies when opened.
