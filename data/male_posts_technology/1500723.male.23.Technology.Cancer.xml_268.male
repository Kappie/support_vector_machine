Havent studied it properly though:  urlLink Intrusion Detection Systems a Market Failure   But to be fair, there are exceptions, so we'll put up the rest of the voices:  (Grefer): Distributed IDS with all their sensors can provide a wealth of information not readily available from the intrusion prevention systems he is touting.  The audit function of an IDS should not be eliminated from an information security in depth strategy without spending considerable thought on the ramifications of such a decision.  [I agree]  (Schultz): The Gartner Group has done it again--made yet another wild prediction from its "ivy tower" in the complete absence of hands-on experience or having to live with the consequences of its  prescriptions. Part of what Gartner has said, namely that intrusion detection involves a high financial cost, is true, but writing off intrusion detection altogether, as Gartner has done, is completely irresponsible. [Just a polar point of view, lets keep it in mind]   (Ranum): In private communications with Stiennon (the Gartner analyst), he offered the shocking fact that - for all that they are hyping IPS - the team at Gartner "doesn't know anyone who is using an IPS in inline mode."  That runs utterly contrary to the perception they are trying to create that IPS is the "wave of the future"  It just shows that P.T. Barnum underestimated severely when he made his famous assessment of Gartner's customer base. "There's a Gartner Customer born every minute." [Ditto]  (Northcutt): HYPE ALERT, they aren't actually saying ditch IDS, they are really saying use a firewall with IDS capability instead, the so called intrusion protection approach.  This is an ancient discussion; is an all in one plastic stereo like the one you had in your college dorm room better than a carefully selected set of devices.  It comes down to the level of investment an organization wants to make, is the increase in quality worth the price from an organization's perspective? Since well over 50% of most organization's value is intellectual property, the answer is probably a resounding yes; it is worth having monitoring systems and people trained to analyze what they detect.  An intrusion detection system with trained analysts provides a means of seeing the attacks and adjusting your defenses. IPS does not. [I agree]  Here's what other people say about the value of IDS: Arrigo Trizulli - Phd.  IDS Designer, Geneva  The reason IDS has been ineffective is that it has been badly deployed and nobody bothered to train the analysts.  An initial, guaranteed, road to failure in any security model is to deploy monitoring systems and then never look at the screens.  Then you can complete the failure by mis-configuring the monitoring systems:  CCTV cameras pointing at the sky have rarely caught burglars coming through the front door. [Absolutely true, the best for last :)]
