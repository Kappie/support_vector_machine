Walked to the train station and boarded the train back to Oslo.   Before 0800 hrs  Train pulled out of the station. The journey to Oslo will take us about 6+ hrs. We're scheduled to arrive around 1420 hrs or so. The train was a new one. Reasonably comfortable with a fair amount of leg space. I spent about one third of the journey sleeping. The rest of the trip I just read my book.  In Oslo, we have just less than 2 hrs before we need to board the ferry bound for Copenhagen. We're probably going to look for an Internet cafe and a bookstore (Daniel's still hoping to get a book for the rest of the trip).   1600+ hrs  Arrived and boarded the Crown of Scandinavia. Cast off timing is 1700 hrs. It's an interesting experience. This is the first time I've been on a ferry / cruise like this. Dinner isn't included in the price of the ticket though. But we're still planning to go for the buffet dinner in the ship's restaurant later. It's my turn to treat the guys. I just can't wait to explore the rest of the ship. So exciting. In the meantime, think we're all gonna grab a nap first.   2000 hrs  Finished dinner. It costs 195 DKK each but it was really good. There were seafood, meat courses, cold dishes and desserts. I only managed the first 3 sections. The dessert section I had to leave it out as things didn't look too tempting to me. I ended my dinner with a green apple instead. It's been a great trip so far making our way to Copenhagen in this fashion. In fact, I hope someday in future, I can do the same again with my parents or family on something similar.  I felt that the waiter serving us wasn't really comfortable serving us. It's either because we seemed like some young punks or it may be because we're all Chinese or both. He wasn't like particularly nasty to us or anything, it's just that he didn't seem friendly enough as a service personnel. He just gave me the impression that his level of hospitality was not like the other crewmembers we have come across earlier on the ship. It was only when the bill came that he seemed to be friendlier, but only slightly ("I hope dinner was OK."). I dunno lah, like I said, he wasn't exactly mean to us.  After dinner, we walked and explored the ship. Getting out onto the open deck was a bit scary and exhilarating at the same time. When I first pushed the door open, the breeze from outside was so strong that it nearly pulled me outside. Stepping out into the open, it took me awhile to get used to the strong breeze and the wobbly feeling. You can feel the seas-spray almost everywhere. You'd realise it if you lick your lips and you'll find that it tastes salty. After awhile, I managed to find my sea legs. It just felt damn shiok to be out on the ship's deck with the strong breeze all around. It made me feel as though I was flying. The guys kept jokingly asked me to sign on with the Navy when I got back to Singapore.   2343 hrs  Justin and I just finished a film we caught in the ship's cinema. We each paid 40 DKK for it. We watched the Recruiter (starring Al Pacino and Colin Farrell). It was quite OK. Daniel caught another film instead as he had seen the Recruiter before. We're probably going to grab an early night and just ready ourselves for tomorrow.
