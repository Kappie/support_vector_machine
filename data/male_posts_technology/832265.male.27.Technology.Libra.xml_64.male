Sure he's on his way out and this is really an extension of the moratorium imposed 3 years ago, but it's an amazing decision - especially coming from the heartland.  If you ever wanted to know why the death penality is wrong, here's a pretty good  urlLink breakdown :
 Because our three-year study has found only more questions about the fairness of sentencing, because of the spectacular failure to reform the system, because we have seen justice delayed for countless death row inmates with potentially meritorious claims, because the Illinois death penalty system is arbitrary and capricious -- and therefore immoral -- I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death.
