Now her mom was grilling us, or at least upset with us for rushing into things.  S looked over at me with a pained look on her face, saying that I'd ruined everything.  ---------------------------- I called S to discuss the dream with her.  She thought it was really weird because she and Mo had talked the night before about what story we should tell her siblings and her mom.  They agreed that total honesty could wait until later with regards to her mom, but her sister could be told the truth.  For example, "how long have you been divorced?"  That would be an awkward one!  S said that her family wants to meet me.
