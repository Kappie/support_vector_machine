"Today's story is called, 'Albert the clown', written by Andy, age 29. Wonder who that could be? There was once this funny clown and his name was Albert. Sometimes people tried to be CUTE and pronounce his name in french, which was 'Al-bear'. People did this so much that Albert started believing he WAS bear. He moved to the forest of the Northwestern United States, to live on nuts and berries. Soon, 'Al-bear', became a tall hairy man with long hair and fingernails and bare feet. Because he was an ex-clown, he had BIG, HUGE FEET. Today 'Albert the clown' is better known as big foot. So the next time you're camping in the great Northwest, remember to raise a big 'Hey-diddly-o' to 'Al-bear'." -  urlLink Brak
