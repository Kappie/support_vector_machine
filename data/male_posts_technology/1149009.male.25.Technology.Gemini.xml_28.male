He goes on to say that his WinXP powered laptop is constantly infected with virus/worm(s) and ad/spy/malware. But, this guy is totally missing the point. He thinks that by virtue of the fact that he's running linux, he's automagically protected by the mighty hand of Torvalds, or something. Sheesh. Don't get me wrong, *nix is great, it ranks right up there with Netware, in terms of stability. So what's my point? It doesn't matter what OS you run, what matters is the fact that your OS is (1) Updated with any patches/fixes. (2) Running adequate antivirus software with current defs. (3) Behind a firewall. At least use NAT, people. C'mon. (4) Only install software from reputable firms. If you install KaZaa to steal music/video/software, then you deserve the ad/spy/malware! That's right, I said it.  Commence flames...
