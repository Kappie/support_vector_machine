I am trying to take care of all these little things before the days over, but it's soooo nice outside. I can't wait for Pin-A-Go-Go this weekend in Dixon, it runs from Friday to Sunday (more info @ http://www.pinagogo.com ).   Kings won lastnight so I'm in a good mood...  Well the games on so I better get going (actually it started but Tivo RULES!!!)...
