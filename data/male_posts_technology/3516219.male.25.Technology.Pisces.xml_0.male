A well known cause for most of these problems is the eternal battle between Microsoft and Hackers who want to end Microsoft's monopoly in the software market. One of the main targets is Microsoft's mail client Outlook which ships in an express version with Internet Explorer and ships in a complete version with Office. Using alternative clients such as Eudora and Netscape Communicator is one way of solving problems with e-mail. Also a lot of websites have hidden scripts which install small programs making it possible for others to track your internet history or in some cases use your broadband connection for sending spam messages. A lot of these scripts are exclusive to Microsoft's Internet Explorer. A good alternative is the open source Mozilla browser, which uses web components from Netscape. Mozilla can preform as a second browser next to Internet Explorer. The problem is not with the qaulity of Microsoft's programming, the faults in Microsoft products is not that it's a bad product, it has to do with the wide usage of its products. Using a Macintosh or a PC with Linux greatly reduces virus threaths. Linux can be installed next to Windows on the same harddrive and can open the same documents as Windows.   In the professional field we have the Windows server platform which is very widely used, the windows server platform has also become a very welcome target for hackers. By using a BSD distribution as server, you have a much more secure way of using a server with internet. The biggest problem and the most used open relay MTA-program is Microsoft's Exchange Server. I know it works perfectly with Outlook and can sync agenda's but it still gives headaches and need a lot of updating. A good alternative is the MoreGroupware project which runs like a charm on a L.A.M.P. server config running Sentmail als primary MTA (LAMP = Linux Apache MySQL PHP) and let's you dump outlook and gives you access via your browser. A closed source Groupware/Mailserver program is offered by SuSE and is called OpenExchange.  Many people say that frequent updating keeps the problems out of Microsoft Products, this is somewhat true, but updates always come AFTER problems. And updates seem to take forever on Windows, whilst stopping and updating a server on a Linux or BSD machine can be done with a script in seconds thus minimizing application downtime
