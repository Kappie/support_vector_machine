We truged through the snow to Mac's Old Mine which is the local bar and grapped ourselves a whole lot of drinks. A couple too man actually. The next day we walked around for a while admiring the mountians and the old mining setups. The easter brunch at the bar was full of fantastic food which we managed to eat a some of dispite our hang overs. We took a nap and got up walked around some more and ate the left overs at the bar. On monday we slept in and took off back home stopping in Santa Fe to walk around and look in some shops. All in all it was a great trip.
