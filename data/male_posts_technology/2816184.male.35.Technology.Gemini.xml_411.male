Zara is still inside, talking to the police.  Beneath a tree across the road, ignoring the action and the crowds, Robin holds on to the pipe bowl and watches the smoke rise out of it.  The majority of the crowd is whispering (and not so whispering): "So what happened?"   "...heard Samatha Paxhill was shot..." "...know who did it?" "I heard a gang of robbers." "Really, I wonder if it was a corporate hit..." "Man, I'm not gettin' coffee today!" "Saint Oswin, we ask in thy name, the protection of our fallen sister..."
