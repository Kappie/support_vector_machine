This is what I have to look forward to this winter... things that make me happy, dammit.  1.  Snow  I hate snow.  But not this year!  Nope.  I am looking forward to it.  I must do at least three things to interact with the white stuff this year:  One, snow-boarding.  Guy I work with goes snow-boarding every year.  He asked me to go last year, but I said no.  Can't remember why... oh yeah, I hate snow.  But this year shall be different.  I want to volley myself over the hills and through the woods into speeding, reckless abandon.  Two, sledding.  I haven't been on a good sledding hill in years.  There's a huge hill near my apartment, however it's about ten feet from the interstate, which seems to me a little dangerous.  Either way, I will make some of my friends go find a good hill with me and go snow surfing on our asses.  (Yes, if you're reading this, you're probably going with me)  Three, build a snow man.  I want to reenact Calvin's spectacular display of winter madness.  2. Christmas  Yeah, I know we Jews don't celebrate the old Xmas, but I'm an open minded kind of guy.  For Pete's sake, people give you stuff on this holiday!  How much better can that get?  I might send some cards out this year too.  I saw some great ones at the Wexner Center Museum shop.  I think I get a discount there.  And, food.  Lots of it.  And family.  I'm getting closer to those people.  I can remember most of thier names now.  Might be nice to hang with them.  3.  Thanksgiving  Eh.  I've never had much of a problem with this aspect of the winter (Fall) but this year Amy Castaneda has decided to usher back in the age-old, Ed Castaneda tradition of having way-ward children over for a turkey dinner.  And pot.  Ted plants.  Potted Plants.  Yeah.  4.  New Years  Did you know caviar costs like $60-$200 a jar?  For Christ's sake.  But anway, I'm bringing caviar with me to whatever New Years party I'm going to.  And I'm looking forward to it.  5.  Possible war with Iraq  Oops, sorry, that's not a happy thing.  6.  Toldeo  I'll be making my way up to Toledo sometime during the winter.  Toledo is just cool as it is, but as an added incentive, my mom's side of the family all live up there.  They are too cool for words.  So there.  That's what will make me happy all winter.  Satisfied?  Sheesh...
