History was good, he said that my coursework was very good and Q2 of womens suffrage was excellent. Then I moaned at him for not putting comments on it except 'reorganise'. LOL. Um, maths, my mum likes him, lol, she thinks he is really nice. He said that all I need to do is to get 4 more questions irght in the exam and I'll get a C!!!!! Yipee! English, fine fine, briliant, marvleous, excellent. Textiles, my machine work has improved considerably, everyhing is good, my paperwork is currently at a grade B so don't be surpise dif I end up getting a A or even A* apparently. Cool. Mr G is so lazy. Throughout the whole hour and bit we were there he spoke to 2 parents. The rest of the time he was just milling about or writing something. Tutt tutt. he shouldhave found something constructive to do.  Now Tom, I agree with your last paragraph in your previous blog. Very well said. Email them, complain. I might. Actually, about the firefighters. I agree with their strikes, I don't agree with how much they are asking but striking is giving them the attention and support they need. However, I do not agree with them going on strike now when we are about to go to war with Iraq, which I reckon will happen in about 10 days time if that. (They better leave korea alone btw, just look at what happened in Vietnam!!!!) They are tying up valuable troops. Even the Gerkuas or however you spell it are helping out and they are extremly valuable! These are the guys which is their sword is drawn they must produce blood with it or kill someone before it can be put back into its sheath believe it or not. Now I will continue to support the firefighters, my Dad used to be one and we tend to go to alot of the these firefighter things, shows etc.. but I really do think they should stop all this striking until tropps are available.  Have a nice day ya'll.
