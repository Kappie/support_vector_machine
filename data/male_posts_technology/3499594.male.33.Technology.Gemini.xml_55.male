It's like being a week at Corp., first couple of days were nice but then I was ready to have them back. It sounds like they had blast and was spoiled like crazy. Kell's mom and dad (nana and papa) had to tell me the story of them at a biker bar. Seems they had picnic tables there and sat outside watching all the bikers drive in and out and the food was excellent (or according to nana -to die for). My son loves motorcycles. But everyone made it home safe. Still washing their dirty clothes. :  )  In addition to the kids coming home, Kell's parents brought back a freezer, refrigerator, couch and love seat. We get the refrigerator and her brother will get ours. We were told we would acquire it, which will be nice since this one has a built in water/ice. I never had one of those before, so we are looking forward to having it. Ours is a bit smaller but its the perfect size for her brothers place, as he does not have on yet. ( he moved out recently ) So it works out well.   Yesterday, all day my wife and I just shopped. We were looking for calendars/organizers to buy the teachers, from the PTA. No luck. Seems to be the wrong time of year. We will probably have to order them online (internet) for them. In looking for them, I think we hit 20 stores. MOstly we browsed around while in them but it was nice, the fact we didn't have,"I want to go home", after ever other store. So we spent most of yesterday evening out and about.   During the weekend we also managed to clean out and rearrange our garage and today I  deep cleaned the floors. Even took out all the rugs to beat and hang in the sun. Kelli and I worked on getting geared for the PTA this week. We will have a member drive during open house Tuesday night. Unbelievable to think school starts this Wed. My daughter will be in 1st grade and my son in Kidengarten. Man time flys. I mentioned I had started on the PTA website and the site is located  urlLink here .  I can't recall if I mentioned us putting on a lay-a-way for Christmas while they were out. Well, we put on a PS2. Yeah, its as much for me as them. :  )
