My body is still confused about why it is up at that time torturing itself and it takes about that long for it to wake up.  All in all, ignoring a few aches in my calves, the run was really good today.  I realized how much I love running in East Walnut Hills/O'Bryonville/Hyde Park.  I got to go down Madison, down Grandin, down some wonderfully (that's right, I said wonderfully!) hilly road that I forget the name of, up Observatory, and back on Madison.  I probably went just over 5 miles in that time frame.  It felt like I was going at about a 9 minute pace.**  With a mile left in the run I sped up to approximately an 8 minute pace and with a quarter mile to go I sped up to a 7 minute pace.**  I am greatly encouraged to feel that good at the end of the run to be able to speed up as much as I did.  It is also just as encouraging to kick Madison Road's butt as I sped right up it in the end of my run.  I didn't see no stinkin' hill!  Alright enough before I get any weirder for the night.    ** All times and speeds are approximate and cannot be used in a court of law.
