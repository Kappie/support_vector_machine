I'm sure that there are people who hit their 1GB limit, but under normal use, it'd take me quite a bit of time to do so.  Maybe google's "never delete an email" push isn't that far from the truth.    Thus far, I find their conversation view to be very clever, useful, handy even.  Other webmail services seem to me to be offering a poor man's IMAP.  Gmail actually does something differently in a way that is useful.
