I haven't blogged for ages, don't know why.  My business studies results are as follows... Unit 1 = 29/35 (distinction) Unit 2 = 35/35 (distinction) Unit 3 = 29/35 (distinction) Distinction is the equiverlent to a A/A*, all I have to do now is get me coursework up to distinction level and I will have my A/A*!  Unfortunatly my photos of New York didn't go very well because the film I used was the film my brother used when he went to Germany and he didn't rewind it properley. So I only managed to get 2/25 photos.  urlLink Times Square  and  urlLink a building a couple of blocks away from Times Square . I did have another film which is being processed now, but I can't remember what's on it, I think a photo of the Statue of Liberty's bum (that's all we could see the weather was so bad) and a park.  I have had my teeth operation explained to me. I am quite impressed with my teeth, I have a severe class three case on the top and bottom of the mouth, what ever the means, but it don't sound pretty does it? The whole process takes 2 years from start to finish. Braces for 1 year to align my teeth up straight, and then 2 days in hospital after an operation to move my jaw into the correct place, then back to braces for 6 months to finish is off, then to retainers for however long is needed (normaly 2-3 months). So that sounds like fun, I won't be able to speak for two days! How will I ever cope? Which brings me nicely onto my next point...  ...tomorrow Christy is doing a Sponsered Silence! So I am going to walk up to her and ask her a few questions which she can only respond to by saying "yes" or nothing at all. Mwhahahahhah power.
