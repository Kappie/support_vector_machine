After some protracted running around, my beloved character was killed in a most unfair manner.  This prompted the creation of a new character.  Using a small portion of my knowledge of the system, I crafted a significantly effective character... and then was introduced to the other PC's.  Or more accurately, not.    The entire session was spent running around, trying to find the others, or being spied upon by them.  All in a days work for a Psi-Tech.  I also got the redesigned  PC Gamer .  It looks like they're back to using a font circa 1995, and the content, while slightly prettier, was altogether lacking.  I'm a minimalist when it comes to design.  A  GURPS  game started today.  It hasn't had the opportunity to get going yet, but I'm sure it has the potential to be good.  Still playing  UFO: Aftermath .  The human weapons show no signs of getting worse, while the alien ones are generally disappointing.  I even  dislike  the alien-human armour, as it looks too  icky .   WoD  has been moved to Tuesday next week, as the bloody football is on.  There are two things in this life I most definitely detest.  One thing is Collective Card Games.  The other is football.  Damn it.  Hopefully, tomorrow I'm off to see  The Day After Tomorrow , assuming I can wrangle the use of the car.  Fingers crossed...
