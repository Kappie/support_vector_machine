They say it's the hottest new operating system with the slickest user interface, but all I could muster was a shrug. Some new bells and whistles, but I wasn't fooled: This is basically the same interface the Mac made popular 20 years ago. What's going on here? Why hasn't usability made any progress since point-and-click and drag-and-drop replaced typing in command lines? It's as if the user interface folks have had their clocks flashing 12:00 for two full decades."

 Hey, hey don't blame all the designers. It takes a commitment from management to spend money on user interface design resources to insure usability. Management certainly worries about functionality, regardless if the user will even understand how to use it or not.
