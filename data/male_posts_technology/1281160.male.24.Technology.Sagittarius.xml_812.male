The first sentence reads, " Five frogs are sitting on a log. " Ok, this is a simple fact. The second statement, " Four decide to jump off. " is an ambigious statement. Are the four mentioned in the statement, a part of the five already present on the log. Or maybe there are four frogs that are ready to jump off some other log on to this log? You can never know. The same logic applies to the third statement," How many are left? "  The riddle, split up into individual sentences, makes logical sense but it does not provide any meaning. This was just a simple exercise in semantics. The phenomenon is known as intertextuality. Intertextuality, as defined by Michael Riffaterre, "depends on [a system of] limitations in our freedom of choice, of exclusions, since it is by renouncing incompatible associations within the text that we come to identify in the intertext their compatible counterparts."  Those of you who are still puzzling on what the last paragraph meant, relax. I'll provide examples after the New Year. Till then send your thoughts on how the blog looks now. It is still a work under progress. It will be gradually improved in the days to come.
