In one day, four men showed up at American military sites in Baghdad claiming to be the former Chief of Police for that city and wanting his old job back. After doing some background checks, the Americans determined that none of the four men were actually the police chief. That strikes me as funny. Can you imagine the number of people who show up wanting their old jobs back, as government employees, etc.? How on Earth would the Americans be able to tell if someone is telling the truth?  I also saw a piece where people are annointing themselves to certain positions without U.S. approval. One guy is going around calling himself mayor of Basra. Many men are claiming to be police officers, and the Americans are having a tough time recognizing the real police officers from the self-appointed ones.  And finally, this morning I heard the Americans found $600 million in U.S. cash stashed away in one of the palaces. $600 million. In cash. Wow. Three things came to mind. One, that's a lot of paper currency. How the hell did Saddam acquire so much? Did he just call the U.S. Treasury one day and place an order? Second, do you think the soldiers were tempted, just a little bit, to stuff some of the cash in their boots. I mean, if $100,000 goes missing, noone will notice. Heck, maybe $605 million was found, but they decided to "round down" if you get my drift. If I was a soldier, I would certainly think about "liberating" some of that money if I thought I could get away with it free and clear. And the third thing that came to mind is, I wonder where that money ends up. I mean, is it like "drug money" in which the army gets to use it to pay its expenses? Will the CIA use it to topple the next regime? One thing is for sure -- you and I will never hear about this money again. People will forget, and the money will one day just disappear from its storage location.
