In the Good News category, I'm supposed to race with DaftApeth tonight. Maybe others will be online.  In the Even Better News department, Sudeki is being released tomorrow! I have good hopes for it. I will not be getting it on release; I will wait for the reviews, and the inevitable short-term price cut which should come in two weeks.
