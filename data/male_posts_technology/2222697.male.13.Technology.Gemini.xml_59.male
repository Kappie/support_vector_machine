Well, now's not a good time for a rant becuz I really want to watch that videO!!!!:))  I know you want me to complain about something, so I guess I will talk about this series i'm watching called "FullMetal ALCHEMIST" the anime is about two kids alphonse (AL) and edward both sharing the same last name of Elric. What got me interested in the anime in the first place is that morgan webb had a feature of it on xplay of the video game coming out in japan. Well the story starts out as the brothers are looking for the philosipher's stone (not related to the english rough-draft of harry potter). Al had lost his entire body and his soul is binded into some armour, Edward had lost his left leg and his right arm and it was replaced by auto-mail. They lost their bodies (or parts) by trying to ressurect thier mother by using alchemy...  ---  I really want to watch naruto, so you'll just have to wait for an episode guide!^_^  g'bye  alt code of the day: alt0505 = Ã¹
