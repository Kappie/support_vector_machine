Usually there is an orbital (or at least a fixed) path associated with the surrounding particles. The center not only provides the centripetal force which is necessary for orbital motion but sometimes has other very important functions to perform. For example,  urlLink here's an article  which states that the nucleus is really the living cell's mothership, a crucial and very active source of information, support and control.  Though not exactly orbital, blood circulates in the body following a fixed path, going through the heart. The heart is the center and the only instance of blood violating it's definite path is when bleeding occurs.   The orbital motion is very prominent in the electrons tied to every atom's nucleus; the moon of every planet; the planets of every sun, etc. Not surprisingly, Muslims revolve around Ka'aba during Haj. This center of all the activity has to be practically demonstrated at least once in a lifetime.   If something breaks its designated path, it goes astray.  The suns and moons are very obedient creations (some people would like to replace the word  obedient  with  dumb ). But man has been given  choice , which unfortunately is a very complex topic. The life of a human being can revolve around many centers. Or in other words, the center keeps shifting. To realize/ recognize our true center is the first and foremost duty.  A long time ago, PTV telecasted a very good drama with the title,  "2 Suraj ka Siyara"  (which translates into  A Planet of Two Suns ).  Are you a planet of more than one sun?
