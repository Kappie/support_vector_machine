    
       I remember during one of the Clinton scandals (I don't remember which one... doesn't matter ... take your pick) that Dick Morris was on some talking heads show saying, "If there are two things out there that can hurt you, then admit to the lesser one and that will give you cover for the more serious one."  That's what this is about.  Nobody resigns from office in 2004 because they're "outed."  Has anybody ever heard of Barney Frank?  No sir.  This is McGreevey admitting to the lesser scandal.  Mark my words.  This is not over, and its not about how he spends his recreational hours.
