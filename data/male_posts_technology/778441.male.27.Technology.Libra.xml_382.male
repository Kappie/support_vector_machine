But unfortunately for them,  urlLink Dell immediately issued denials  stating that there were no plans to shut shop in India and take jobs back to the US. The media, hungry for some news to quell the ever-growing unrest among the unemployed masses back home had reported the news, about customer complaints to Dell, without checking it out thoroughly.  So in the end...  urlLink Metafilter posts like this one  end up looking foolish!
