I dont know about the rest of you, but for me the smell of KFC is particularly alluring, the kfc however, hasn't for a long time, lived up to the hype. I usually end up feeling bloated and let down , by the greasy after-taste, of not just kfc, but by most of the major 'junk food' brands. It's weird. Did KFC ever taste how I remember it? or am I remembering the 'ideal' of what kfc should be? Who knows. But the junkfood least likely to dissappoint is pizza... unless you live in rotorua and order pizza hutt pizza.. then if it actually arrives, it'll be stone cold, and dissappoint - not that cold pizza is by any means bad, but cold garlic bread, cold chips, and luke warm beverage -are-. I think expectations are a lot like this. Birthdays are one thing a lot of people seem to get anxious about, myself excluded - I've never seen the point, but recently one friend has lamented the passing of a perfectly good opportunity to party hard, and another is dreading -missing- the opportunity but assures me that while planning meticulously, that she's not getting her hopes up, yeah right. Planning is something I love, and I think by and large things I plan go well... I've had plethora of feedback from various parties and 'do's that I've put on, commending the effort. I offered to plan the party of the lamenting friend, but she had something to prove to me, by doing it herself.. I guess she did prove something :D Just not what she wanted to. Another thing that fails to live up to expectations, generally speaking, geek upgrades. I recently trudged into town to confront in person, the store that should've already rung me to let me know the cpu I wanted was in, but they hadnt rung, surely an oversight. Alas, they tell me that it had come in, but that they used it for something else. That'll serve me right for giving my business to locals, I could've ordered it from auckland for less, and had it quicker. I told the manager in no uncertain terms, that it simply wasnt good enough. He promised to have me one by Thursday morning. Again, not good enough. Poor effort guys. Ahh well, I was not as disheartened as I could've been - because Cpu or not, the ram hadnt arrived yet, so I wasnt going to be doing anything with it -anyway-, reluctantly I trudge away from the store. I check my bank balance to find out that not only had the cancelled gym subs -still- come out, but that they'd bounced, and the admin fee also bounced, not a big deal for the actual subs and admin fee, only $15 a piece, but the bouncing fees were $25 each.. $50. Bugger. Because of that, no spare cash. Gutted. So I walk off to where I think my meeting with my business advisor is, only to realise I have to walk a km and a half, to the -actual- location.. ahh well. At least it wasnt...and then it did.. yep.. it rained on me. All dressed up, smart gears, walking for 1.5k, in the rain, with paper work. I arrive, cant find the office in the building, finally do, and have a laugh with the business advisor lady, about how much days can suck.. she repeatedly tries to coerce me into having a coffee - even after I pointed out that I'm trying to cut down. The meeting goes well, and as I leave, it starts to rain again. ahh well, at least when I get to town, I've got $1.50 for the bus. Score. Everything was finally coming up millhouse! just as the bus arrived at my stop, my cellphone rang, it was the lady from the computer store that I just used my last $1.50 to be away from, telling me the chip had arrived. RAAAH!!! ahh well, calm down Christopher, your ram isnt here, so as I start down the driveway of my house, I notice a courier packet, in the letterbox. The ram. Gutted. So I get home, peel off my wet clothes, make a coffee that I'd been turning down all afternoon, and started playing sad music, when mike and his gf turn up and offer to take me into town after hearing my plight, I agree, we head off, and return triumphant, 3000mhz faster :D so I fix the ladies computer I was working on, she turns up to claim it, gives me $10 cash, after hearing the story of my day, the rest to be deposited on pay day, into my now overdrawn account. Hurrah! the roast I put on, topside, slow cooked in red wine, smells gorgeous, mike stays for dinner, the new computer re-install goes almost flawlessly, and I roll, once more, smiling, into bed. I should've had a shit day.. but fuck that =D what a waste.
