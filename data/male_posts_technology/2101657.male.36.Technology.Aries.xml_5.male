I tell you what, the two cabins we stayed in, were nicer then what I live in.  The cabin we stayed in, had a wood burning stove upstairs, a spiral staircase going downstairs, 2 bedrooms, and a bathroom.  In the basement was the kitchen, another bathroom with a shower, a piano,  and another door leading outside.     The only draw back to the entire place?  Not a single curtain in the whole place.  Was very odd., but from what I could see, there was only a family camping in a larger building. We had 20 people total show up, so we had 10 to a building.  We had a great time!  We did a hike, taking the Scouts down to the lake, and walking around it, and then hiking up a steep hill through the leaves, and trees. We stopped several times on the way up as it was hot work, in the 45+ degree temps.  At the top of the hill we took another break, but this time got to sit on the edge of a platform that in the summer time would be occupied by a teepee.  There were five teepee platforms, and two buildings. The cabin itself, had a huge glass front to it, that formed a wedge facing south. Would of been awesome to see a sunrise from there.  At this point, we had gravel rode, and took it a half-mile back to our area.  It was very surine in the area were we walked through a bunch of pine trees. The sounds changed when we entered. Almost like when you realize you've just entered the "Haunted Forrest".     We had left two or three leaders back at camp as we had started a fire and they were monitoring it.  We showed the Scouts how building a "log cabin fire", the wood stacked like a log cabin would be, burns fast and gives you a good bed of coals to work with.  We had the boys go up to the cabins kitchen four at a time, to make foil packs.  Basically they got a piece of aluminum foil 12x12.  They then put on some of following based on their own choice: hamburger, onions, carrots, potatoes,     salt, pepper, seasoning salt.  You just pile what you want into the middle of your aluminum foil square, and fold it up, so it's sealed.  Write your name on the outside with a nice magic marker, then take it to the fire, and have a leader sit it right in the coals.  After 10minutes or so, the leader will flip it over, and cook the other side.    MMMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM, did it taste good.  I had some hamburger, onions, potatos, all the seasonings, and a little catchup.   Boy did it taste good!    My assisant leader had brought the makings for a popcorn popper, and had some of the Scouts help him put it together.  Basically, you take two bread pans, and you get a piano type hinge. You drill holes through the side lip on the bread pan, and pop rivet the hinge on.  Get a strip of aluminum, and you can easily hand bend it, shape it to one end of the breadpan, with about 4-5 inches extending past.  You drill and attach it the same way to the pan.  Then, take a fairly straight branch, or something roughly a 2x2, thats 4ft long or so.  You use some screws into the extended part of the aluminum strip, and attach it to the handle.  Then, you take and punch a hole from the inside of the pan, and run a screw into the handle, attaching it from there too.     You now have a handy dandy popcorn popper, that you can give a quick shake, to open it up and dig in!  We made some kettle corn. It's made the same way as regular popcorn but you add some sugar to the oil.    A good clean up tip?  Rub some dish soap on the outside of the pan, when you go to clean it up, the soot from the fire will just wipe off easily, instead of discoloring the pans.
