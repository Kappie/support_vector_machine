I got short stacked and finally got a pocket pair of fives.  I go all in and of course one guy calls me.  He's sitting on a 10 3.  Who the hell calls on a 10 3?  They were even off suit!  So I think I have a shot.  The flop produces a 3 for him.  I'm still good.  The turn doesn't help either of us, and then the river comes out with a 10.  How cruel is that?  The river was cruel to me tonight.  I lost three big hands to the river.  Just not my night.  I finished 47th out of 79.  Better than last time.  It was a no limit game too.  At least I'm playing different games. I ordered everything I could from Wilson Software today.  Hopefully that will help me to improve my game even quicker.  I'll let you know how that works out.   If you're wondering why I don't post on the weekends, I don't play on the weekends.  That's family time and I don't want to waste it playing poker for 2-3 hours a session instead of getting quality time with my wife and daughter.  So don't look for me on weekends.  Just my rule.
