Below that: "Olympia City Council".  Um.   I'm a geography geek, and I am aware of no Olympia closer than the capital of Washington.  Mr and Mrs. Johnson: I'm sure you're proud of your child T.C., but that particular sign isn't gonna generate a single vote. Unless you're voting absentee in Olympia.  Just saying.
