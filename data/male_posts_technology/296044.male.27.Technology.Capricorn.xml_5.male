Listened to this group of guys from somewhere in Columbus called the "Bog".  I've heard of the "Bog" before, but I never knew exactly what it was or who lived there.  Apparently a group of spoken word types live there.  Hep cats.  Good jazz tonight.  Really something I needed and was into.  Now I'm sitting here in front of my computer listening to my loung and jazz mp3's gettin ready to go to bed.  Yeah, I meant to spell gettin that way.  No g for me.  Too cool for school.  Know what I mean, daddy-o?  Night.  Peace.  Out.  Yo.
