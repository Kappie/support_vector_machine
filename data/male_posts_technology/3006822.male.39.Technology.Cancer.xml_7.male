I thought the catchy headline, NASCAR and wine would catch a few of you and make you read this totally technical summary of sulfur and wine.  Not to be too geeky, here is my best effort to explain this phenomenon.    Volatile Sulfur Compounds in Wine   Volatile sulfur compounds can contribute to "reduced", "sulfide", "rotten egg" aromas in otherwise acceptable wines. These unpleasant aromas are almost always caused by sulfides or mercaptans. Sulfide formation in wine has been a persistent problem. The chemistry of sulfide formation is complex. There are many potential interactions with vineyard and winemaking practices. Corrective options are limited and current winemaking techniques often include risks for sulfide formation.     Compounds Found in Wine    Nearly 100 volatile sulfur containing compounds have been found in wine, although fewer than ten are normally found in wines with sulfur related aroma defects. Sensory thresholds for volatile sulfur compounds vary depending on the type of wine and interactions with other wine aromas.      Table 1: Reported Sensory Thresholds for Sulfur Compounds    compound              structure       sensory description range     (ppb)  hydrogen sulfide         H2S         rotten egg, sewage-like       0.9-1.5  ethyl mercaptan       CH3CH2SH       burnt match, sulfidy, earthy  1.1-1.8  methyl mercaptan       CH3SH        rotten cabbage, burnt rubber     1.5  diethy sulfide        CH3CH2SCH2CH3        rubbery                 0.9-1.3  dimethyl sulfide        CH3SCH3    cooked cabbage, asparagus        17-25  diethyl disulfide     CH3CH2SSCH2CH3 garlic, burnt rubber          3.6-4.3  dimethyl disulfide      CH3SSCH3     vegetal, cabbage              9.8-10.2  carbon disulfide          CS2         sweet, ethereal,                 5     Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S )  H2S production is a natural by-product of yeast metabolism. Yeasts form H2S by reduction of sulfates, sulfites and elemental sulfur during synthesis of amino acids. Problems arise when yeast H2S production exceeds its utilization in forming amino acids and excess H2S "leaks" into the wine. Additional H2S can be formed by the natural breakdown of sulfur containing amino acids.   H2S is the most frequent volatile sulfur compound found in fermenting wine. Large amounts of H2S may be produced during fermentation. Under normal conditions, much of this H2S is volatilized from the wine along with CO2. The residual H2S may pose a serious problem due to its low sensory threshold and its potential reactivity. Several other volatile sulfur compounds arise from chemical modification of H2S.     Mercaptans (R-SH )   Mercaptans (thiols) are commonly found in wines. Their "burnt match" and "rotten cabbage" aromas may be even more pungent and offensive than H2S. Although the mechanisms of mercaptan formation are not clear, mercaptans are probably formed during fermentation by reactions involving H2S or breakdown of sulfur containing amino acids. Fermenting samples received at ETS that contain H2S usually also contain mercaptans.   Methyl mercaptan is the most common sulfide problem in post-fermentation wines. Ethyl mercaptan is less commonly found above its sensory threshold. Under certain conditions, mercaptans may be oxidized to form mono and disulfides. While this may remove the objectionable sensory effects of mercaptans, the effect may be temporary (below).    Disulfides (RS-SR)    Disulfides are common in wine, but are usually found below sensory thresholds. They are typically formed after fermentation from oxidation of sulfide or mercaptan precursors. They are a serious concern due to their propensity to revert back to mercaptans. Because of the lower sensory threshold of mercaptans, this conversion is often accompanied by an increase in objectionable odors. Disulfides are not responsive to copper without pretreatment to break the disulfide bond.     Diethyl and Dimethyl Sulfide (H3C-S-CH3)    Diethyl sulfide is usually present in wine at levels below its sensory threshold.   Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is present in almost all wines and is probably a breakdown product of amino acids. The formation of DMS does not appear to be related to H2S production. At low levels (15 to 20 ppb in whites and 20 to 30 ppb in reds) DMS can contribute "roundness", "fruitiness", or "complexity". DMS concentrations increase with wine age and the "canned corn" or "truffle" sensory characteristics of DMS may develop during bottle aging. At higher levels (> 30 ppb for whites and > 50 ppb for reds) DMS may contribute vegetative, "cooked cabbage", or "sulfide" smells to wines. DMS does not respond to copper applications.    Carbon Disulfide (S=C=S)    Carbon disulfide concentrations vary widely in wines. Wines analyzed can range from less than 1 ppb to over 60 ppb. Generally, carbon disulfide is not considered to be a problem and may contribute positively to wine aroma. Very little is known about factors affecting carbon disulfide concentrations in wine or about the chemical mechanisms of its formation.     Causes of Sulfide Problems in Wine    elemental sulfur residues from vineyard spray programs  high turbidity  yeast strains  must nitrogen deficiencies  other nutritional deficiencies  high fermentation temperatures  fermentor size and shape  inadequate aeration during fermentation  gross lees contact and extended lees contact
