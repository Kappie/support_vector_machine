But if this is any indication, there seems to be a minor inclination on part of the parents to getting their daughters married to someone who has had a similar education as her... Irrespective of the girl working after marriage or not, there seems to be a mindset that there might be a better understanding if the two have learnt similar things in their "student" life.. or is it..??  I'm saying "similar learning in student life" because in quite a few cases the girl may not work post-marriage or after some period after marriage... So, the case of having relatively "similar job nature" and "similar work pressure" and "similar timings" cannot be made generic...  So, what could be the big idea... does learning similar things as students got to do anything with better understanding in marital life... If so, which kinda parents would get their daughters married to the umpteen marketing professionals, does a financial consulant necessarily need a wife who did something sort of MBA Finance, so that they understand better in their life... or is it all only confined to the big fella called "Information Technology"... ???  PS: Only arranged marriages are in the purview...!!
