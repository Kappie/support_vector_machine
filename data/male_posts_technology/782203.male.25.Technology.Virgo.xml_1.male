To escape this grim reality she daydreams that she is in a musical becos like she says , "nothing bad happens in a musical". halfway during the movie a quick succession of tragedies occur and her life rapidly takes a turn for the worse and her daydreams become more and more frequent cos thats the only way she can cope with them. The ending is really tragic and I couldnt help letting out a tear or two , it was just that painful to watch. I read that when this picture was awarded Best Picture at 2000 Cannes festival (Bjork got Best Actress) there were people who booed and jeered , cant really understand why !  I downloaded A Clockwork Orange yesterday gonna watch it later .....well nothing else to do also ......
