Its damn cool tool with all these  urlLink features .  But I use only these following features   * Finds References Quickly  * Keyword Searches Like an Internet Search on Your Code Base   to understand  urlLink large code bases.   The above mentioned feature which I use is already available to Linux user in the form of  urlLink lxr . But I would like this one getting integrated with  urlLink anjuta.
