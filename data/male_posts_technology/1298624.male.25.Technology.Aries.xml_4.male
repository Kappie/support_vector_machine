For the first time, I was able to build an army (air force is more like it) and support the main horde that Paul was building. I've decided to go Night Elves though. Building two groups of bird archres and chimeras takes A LOT of resources...and I have to make sure that my base will not be attacked while I'm building that primary force. I'm trying to figure out the build order myself...and how fast I can build the two air groups that I need. I've been thinking about building two of each Ancient of Wind and Chimera Roosts...but that would take more time....almost the same time it would take with just one of each building.   I've been thinking of going through the campaign for both the original Warcraft III and the expansion. it seems pretty easy since I've been thrashed around by the computer so much. I'm really liking this game now...and to think before I really didn't like it at all. I guess my opinion will change once the computer kicks my ass again. I'll hate the game, I'll love the game.   There's nothing like seeing five chimera dragons flying towards an enemy base...
