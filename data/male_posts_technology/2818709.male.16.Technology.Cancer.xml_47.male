I'm going out, I don't care if you're angry. I should've thought things through. I'm holding out, but not getting an answer. I wanna do right by you. I'm finding out, cheating gets it faster. I'm holding out, not getting an answer. I'm finding out that cheating gets it faster. I'm holding out, but not getting an answer. I'm finding out, cheating gets it faster. I don't care what you do. I'm getting out, no nothing ever shames me. Don't wanna thing from you. I'm going out, I don't care if you're angry. I should've thought things through. Yeah I'm holding out, but not getting an answer. I wanna do right by you. I'm finding out that cheating gets it faster. I'm getting out, no nothing ever shames me. I'm going out, I don't care if you're angry. I holding out, but not getting an answer. I'm finding out, cheating gets it faster.
