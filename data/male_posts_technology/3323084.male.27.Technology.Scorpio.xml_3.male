But I plan to upgrade to Fedora Core 2 just as soon as I can get all four disc downloaded.  The new Fedora Core 2 takes advantage of the new linux 2.6 kernel for better performance and stability.  Some other nice improvements include: Gnome 2.6, KDE 3.2.2, SELinux, and more Java tools and support.  After trying the latest test release before this final release I'm very excited about installing it on my pc.  I tested the latest test release on an old machine that I more or less just play with.  I was shocked, in Gnome, the desktop seemed to run smoother and faster, it was more organized than before and they added a My Computer Icon to the desktop that brings all of your drives together in one place, very nice.  If your thinking about trying a linux distro then you might want to give Fedora a shot.    Until next time...
