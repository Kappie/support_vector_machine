I beleive that things like stun guns should be made standard issue for  policce officers as they are far less dangerous. But there again jo has made a good point, crimals wont be so inclined to perform illegal acts if they see police carrying guns.  But if you think about it there will always be crime, whether it be viscious or not. There is nothng we can do to stop it. In my view prevention is better than stopping it mid way.
