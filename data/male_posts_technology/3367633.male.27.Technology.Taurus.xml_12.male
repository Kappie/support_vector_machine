I dreamed that I was sucked into the TV world and still knew all about the show and what happens to everyone on the show. Its all very strange to me. Its not that I feel that I can change the out come of the events in the show just that I always try to find a way to hid in the back ground and watch what's going on. Its just a strange dream I guess.   Man its cold in my office today and I am feeling a little bit upset at what I don't know. I just hope I get the job in Huntington. I am feeling the need to get out of this place big time.
