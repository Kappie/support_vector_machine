Daily update on my life includes my mom being out of town in Baltimore, MD. She's working in the Social Security Headquaters for three months and she won't be back until October or so. Meanwhile, I'm sitting here in front of the computer all day long and boring myself to death...I wonder how "in-shape" I'll be when soccer season rolls around. And I also wonder who's going to be coaching our soccer team this year since our other coach left for a better job. Anyways, I'll be heading over to Baltimore myself to visit my mom around August. And since Washington DC is about 30 miles away from Baltimore, I can also bug Joe Grable until he gives me back the money he owes me.  What else can I talk about...? Um...hmm. I'll be heading over to the library to pick up some Dilbert books...they're pretty funny and addicting. But I shant rant about them yet...  Oh, and a guy was over at my house the other day and he showed me a wierd website. I'll write it down here so I won't forget it: http://www.abovetopsecret.com I can give a review of it later.  And I guess that's about all for now.  -RC
