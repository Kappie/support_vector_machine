I went a bunch of places and got the hang of things quite nicely. But at the end of the weekend, I realized something: the truth is, it's not the most comfortable thing in the world.  But thats part of the design -- solid instead of pneumatic tires, low to the ground, bare bones seat. Its built for portability, not for comfort. Even at that, its 87 pounds and either airlines will refuse it or they may charge me a weight penalty for it. So there is no way I could get something bigger and exoect to travel with it. But shit, at least half of the reason I finally decided to get a scooter was for the trips out of town. So I have to get this little scooter....  So I started wondering --   why not get two scooters  ?!?  This little Go-Go is gonna cost under $1000, even with extras. So why not buy it myself (out of pocket) and then fight the insurance companies for a bigger one like the Victory or the Legend? I got so excited about this idea that it almost depressed me that among the cabal made up of my neuorologist, physical therapist, and the company that will eventually provide the scooter, no one is around since it is Sunday night.   Ah well, I will get cracking on this tomorrow. Its gotta get easier, truly. All I know is that I probably "walked" 15 miles over the weekend between mall, shopping centers, and stores -- something I have not been able to do for YEARS. So one way or another, at least one (and maybe two!) scooters  must  happen.
