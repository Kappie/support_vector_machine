In it, he wonders about the media apathy as the terrible tragedy in Daman was largely ignored by a media dazzled by the high-profile terrorist bombings in Mumbai and the much-publicized elimination of Ghazi Baba, two events that occured on either side of the Daman tragedy.  This sort of a contradiction hugely benefits two parties: One, the terrorists, who ADORE the media for giving their ‘hard work’ so much attention. And two, the public servants responsible for the poor maintenance of the Daman bridge. They, too, must LOVE the media. For exactly the opposite reason.  Touché!  Time, surely, for some introspection by the media!!
