It is hard to explain but it has a lot of taste cues that are reminiscant of the Tea family of spices.  Since I have had only 1 cup, the jury's still out on the final verdict. However, I think I kind of like it. I doubt it would become a staple bean but for a change of pace it is quite nice. Its fairly clean and doesn't leave a strong aftertaste. However, if your idea of "coffee" is the heavy, smokey stuff they often serve at diners and the like, you will be amazed that any coffee could taste like this.   Think of it as "The Last Action Hero" of coffee. Its quite different than what you probably expected, based on what you had experienced before, but taken by itself it is actually quite entertaining and satisfying.
