Helped us to try to maintain a level of awareness, not that we did manage to achieve this heh heh... anyway, I think we connected with each other rather nicely just now. It wasn't particularly tiring either.  After that I had my usual Aikido talk with Richard as we took the same MRT line home. He again advised me to go for the coming grading in Sep. I don't think I'm putting it off this time. I feel more receptive about it this time round than the earlier months. He also mentioned some little things he's trying to cultivate in us. Eg, he's trying to make Roxanne train harder (too soft), Cryssabella a bit softer (too hard) and start all of us on how to take slams. Cool! He said though it may not be necessary for ukemi but it's good to know.  Sakai passed Richard a live blade today. Apparently the ship Sakai works on used to have a Japanese Captain. The latter probably left it in his bunk long ago. Sakai was worried that he might get into trouble for holding on to it so he decided to give it to Richard instead. He also had a little dagger (tanto size I assume) but he said that it was way too sharp and he had thrown it into the sea long ago. The sword on the other hand was blunt out. It looked simple enough and feels a little heavy.
