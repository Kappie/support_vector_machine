I guess I worked until so late last night around 0530hrs and had to force myself to wake up. Watched VCDs while aving lunch.  After lunch, I cleared a few cheques and sent out mails. What a joke for one of the mail I had to sent out as it was from NTUC Income. They sent me a refund cheque of SGD417. Free cash? But in the end I had to call them and tell them off why sent me a void cheque and I had to post it back... It was never about the 23 cents, its the extra time wasted...  Spent the rest of the afternoon and evening playing games  watching movies.  Completed Xbox game : Red Dead Revolver 1st Movie Viewed : The Bourne Identity 2nd Movie Viewed : Phone Booth 3rd Movie Viewed : Cube, Cube2   ORD countdown:   60 days    Why is there a timer for my ORD?     NS is a waste of time... And I serve 16mths with a rank of CPLÂ…
