I'm at home now, supposed to be working on stuff, but writing instead.  Oh well, I guess I am really addicted to this writing thing.  The other night I wrote a short story about my grandpa's workshop, what it felt like, smelled like, and how much Mom and I missed him after he died.  I ended up almost crying by the time I was done.  I did no proofreading, but I think it came out pretty good, maybe one of the best things I ever wrote.  I will look at it, then post it here for anyone to read.  I guess I should get one of those creative commons copyright thingees, in case I ever decide to try to get anything published.  I am supposed to be working on taxes!  Yeah, the thing most people do in April.  I got the extension and paid my bill in April, then did not touch anything tax related until today.  I suppose I can get another extension, and just make this a year-round hobby.   Fuck the IRS.  I think someone could rewrite the tax code into a pamphlet smaller than the contract for a home purchase.  It's real simple:  if corporations stop getting deductions over a certain gross income level, and if individuals stop getting deductions over a certain gross income level, and there are smaller tax brackets, I think there will be more than enough taxes for anything we need.  Eliminate about 10% of the government employees at the state and federal level by eliminating redundant agencies and by simplifying laws.  Fly one less shuttle mission per year, and build 9 jets instead of 10.  States do not get a single penny of local property tax, business taxes, fees, or sales taxes.  Finally, a sales tax on everything except fresh food, and people under a certain income level get $__ dollars of sales tax refunded at the end of each month.  Everyone has a smart card that keeps track of the taxes they have paid.  Thanks, send me your payment for $100,000, and I will be glad to fill in the details.
