Construction is a way of life around these parts for 8-9 months out of the year. For the most part I can live with the necessary annoyances to make our roads ultimately better. BUT, morons with drivers licenses really test my patience.   There's a 11 mile stretch of highway currently under construction that I travel every day to and from work. This highway is down to one lane in each direction with the north bound traffic shifting to the southbound side of the highway (and a cement divider to keep the two lanes separate). The speed limit through the zone is 60. Most days I'm happy if we just do 40.   Why do morons find it necessary to slow down (sometimes STOP COMPLETELY) to watch the construction? I can understand slowing for construction workers if they are working within 20 feet of where we are driving, but there are at least 150 feet between the workers and the traffic - separated by a big median of grass!! What, have you never seen construction before?   Also, the entering traffic has to yield for us. This does not mean slam on your brakes to let in a car who is already completely stopped on the on ramp. Cause then we play the "you" - "no you" game for about an hour. And if you are entering the highway DON'T STOP!!! I can't stand when people will get to the very beginning of the point where the on ramp touches the highway and stop. THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM TO MERGE (in the cases of this particular construction zone). Keep driving, someone will let you in, otherwise the idiot mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph will come toa screetching halt to let your no-driving dumbass in.
