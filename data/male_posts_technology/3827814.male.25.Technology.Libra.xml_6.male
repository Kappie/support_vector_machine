I remembered that I had gotten that same pamphlet from Bill and Eve during conference. I had already read some of it, but didn't get very far, as I wasn't in the right spirit at the time. I went home around 10pm last night and did some laundry. After which, I started reading that pamphlet. I enjoyed it so much that I read about 3/4 of it. Then, this morning I finished reading it at work.  Although it's historically interesting, it was the spiritual content that most interested me. It brought to my attention the meaning of a parable Christ once told about how a man who wasn't religious would help a widow to "get her off his back", so to speak. He makes the point that God would do the same for us, but that we must ask (pray) continually as the widow did.  The need to pray and the need to separate ourselves from the world and our earthy possessions, were the two primary themes that I got from this speech. The author tells us that we need to pray not only continuously, but also emotionally. We must cry when we pray. I hope to reread it, but this time with a highlighter.
