I don't want to go into too much detail here and now but basically I have had to rethink the way everything is done and completely re-structure the company from the top down. Over all this is probably a good thing and it has shaken so good things out..  Also seems to have been a change in luck.. Yesterday I talked to a customer who is just waiting to get out of his existing contract so he can sign with us (and it will be our biggest customer yet) and a company who I had been told had signed a deal with someone else called me this morning and asked me to send out the quote again because their funding was approved and they hadn't signed with anyone.. I think there is a fair chance of getting it, which would be really cool..  Hmm.. I think I may be rambling a bit. The problem is my head is running away with me thanks to all the different things that are floating through it at the moment.. I have so much to think and keep track of that it's all kinda overwhelming. Every time I try to focus on one thing seven others crowd in and push it aside..  Anywho, I plan on relaxing for the weekend and hopefully not working too much (dunno how much hope but we'll see) so hope you all have a good one too :)  Mike (Kinda)
