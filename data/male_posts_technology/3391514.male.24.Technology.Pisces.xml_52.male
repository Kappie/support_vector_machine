Thursday saw the acquisition of the 'new' RPG  A/State .  Its an interesting percentile based cyberpunk game, set in a decaying city containing a myriad of mixed technologies.  The poor use gas lamps and flintlocks, the rich have hovercars and gauss cannons.  Also got was the  Black Hawk Down  soundtrack and  Gone in Sixty Seconds  on DVD... which I found Â£2 cheaper an hour later.  Additionally, I saw a friend I rarely see, and did very little but talk.  He all but reinforced my dislike of everyone who likes to run "exclusive" games... which accounts for several people I know.  It's a great source of frustration for me.  Friday saw a new RPG begin - a friends diceless system.  I don't see why it needs a playtest when there are no rules and only the skeleton of character generation.  The game itself was alright, but slow and mired by annoying "roleplaying".  Saturday saw several hours of  Red Alert 2  being played... I haven't played it on "Normal" before, and its surprisingly easy.  I also  nearly  completed the second mission of Freespace 2 on Insane difficulty... not as easy as you'd think.  Those Loki's are damn fast.  Sunday included a rare visit to my Uncle's house and also many hours of  Fallout 2 .  After a recent article in PC Zone ("Games that changed the world") I thought I'd give the game another go.  So far I can kill Gecko's, but actual human enemies cause a problem, and despite having a gun, my character can't shoot for toffee.    Best stick with the spear then.  The operation looms ever closer... there is likely to be one more post before it happens, and then... who knows?
