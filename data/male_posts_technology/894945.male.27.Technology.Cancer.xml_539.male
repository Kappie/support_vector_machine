Is there any ladies out there that need a good seeing to for a small sum? I only charge by the inch, you get what you pay for. Seriously, Congratulations Ali and Emma, you probably wont ever read this but your wedding was great. Even if you did get me into top hat and tails when Jersey had the highest recorded temperature in history! The weekend was good apart from my car steering wheel melting on me. 38.5 Degrees centigrade on the M25 north of London! So many people have asked me has my car got air conditioning since this has happened, I just say YES!!! THEY ARE CALLED WINDOWS!!! What do you think I am? American? Oh and Toaster!!! Tell them all about the Dream you had of me!!! Umm… do I realize how that sounds? Life is crap. I need head.
