BUT (did I hear someone groan...), whenever I see such movies I get this weird sense of moral obligation to be a better person, to stand up for what I believe in, to make a difference in this world, to experience all the thrills of life (and all that hog wash).   Ok.....I admit, this does sound extremely corny......but sometimes I feel "what purpose am I fulfilling by this vicious cycle of life that I now live (get up -> eat-> work-> sleep -> getup..)". Should I not be tasting the delicacies of life? And then..... reality strikes (ouch)....whose going to pay my bills?
