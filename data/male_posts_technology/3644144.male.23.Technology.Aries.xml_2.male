I talked to him sometime in June and he had just gotten back from throwing at Wrigley for a bunch of MLB scouts.  Rebecca, as far as reading goes, I try to stay within the bounds of material that has glossy pages, magagzines, newspaper coupon sections, wall calenders and the like.  anyway. I need to go now and do something outside!!! It will be kinda hard. my boss doesn't like it when I go outside and play.  later, r knox
