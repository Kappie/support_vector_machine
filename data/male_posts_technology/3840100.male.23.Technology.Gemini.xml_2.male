I've allways had an interest in pop and dance music over the years. So it's about time I finally head down that road for real. I have the most fun in that genre out of any other I find.  I'm still working on the finishing touches with the release of 'Off the Deep End'. I can't wait until it's out because I've been working on it far too long. It'll be nice to start composing happier, more upbeat songs than I have been. It will be a change, but it will be a nice needed change. I have to get back to work, but stay tuned. I'm releasing a new single very soon!!!  -RK
