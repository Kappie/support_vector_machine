One of my favorite rides at  urlLink PKI  is Adventure Express.  It is a small theme roller coaster.   The theme you ask?  Just a Safari tour gone wrong.  Before the ride you discover that track 2 is closed, but are assured your trip down track 1 will be just fine.  Then as the ride starts the car passes a sign that reads track closed and you see that you are on track 2.  I don't want to ruin the rest of the ride, but I will warn you...watch out for the big hill at the end!  Monday night I watched the Astros play on  urlLink ESPN .  I wouldn't usually watch an Astros/Padres match up on ESPN Monday Night Baseball, but Chris had just been called up and I was hoping to see him get his first hit.  He started on Tuesday (not on TV), didn't start on Wednesday (again on TV) and was sent down on Thursday.  Nice cup o'coffee.  He started the Futures game yesterday for the USA team, but evidently ESPN doesn't think the futures game should be played during a regular person's viewing hours.   The rest of last week I spent hanging out and getting little chores done.  Friday, Ann took the day off and we went to  urlLink The Beach Water Park .  It was awesome.  Ann was brave and rode on many things I thought she wouldn't.  Some rides she screamed so loud that even the life guards would crack a smile.    Sunday my  urlLink baseball game  was rained out.  Was it raining a half hour before the game.  No.  Was the field playable.  Yes.  'Nuff said.  I have to find a more committed league...or take up golf.  Sunday afternoon I watched Spiderman II with Ann and Elizabeth.  Ann loved it.  She has proclaimed that she will only watch sequels from now on.    That is all I have for now.  I will be working on some things for the web page.  So keep checking in...who I am kidding, you can't help but check in.
