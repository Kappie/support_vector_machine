 In Software Engineering, as with all other things, you cannot know where you're going, which direction you need to go, or how long it is going to take to get there if you don't know your present location.  This is my pain for the week.  It took our combined teams (development, QA, technical writers, etc.) over three days to gather our summary status to put in a six slide powerpoint presentation for one of our executives.  Can you imagine?  The big boss says, "how's it goin'?" and it takes us four days to reply.
 
 Actually, this is what really happened.  The big boss said, "how's it goin'?"  It probably wasn't that nice, but I'll keep it clean for the kids.  He said, "how's it goin'?" and we said, "Oh crap!  How   is   it going?"  So we scramble around for a couple of days and then we realize that our teams are anywhere from two to eight weeks behind schedule.  Now mind you, these dates that we're going to miss are already four to eight weeks removed from the original target.  
 
 It's a comedy, really.  I guess we were going to wait until we had missed the deadlines before we told anybody.  Actually, we probably would have to miss the deadlines to realize that we're behind schedule.  Ridiculous.
 
 The way things should be: If someone says, "how's it going?," we should be able to say, "hold on, let me pull it up."  We need a web site that shows us the important stuff.  What's our deadline.  How much work is left for the dev team?  How many issues do we have?  What's the run rate on our issues?  How's our in-house implementation going?  How many beta clients do we have?  What issues do they have?  This is so obvious that it's painful to talk about.  I have to stop now.
