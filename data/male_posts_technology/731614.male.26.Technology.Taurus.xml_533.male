Everyone is encouraged to do an audiopost of their favorite  xmas in june carol , though I doubt anyone could top Jonnie in sheer chutzpah  So far belle, dvl, marci and lisa have received their presents, and as expected both belle and lisa have already opened theirs. Leave a comment if you have received yours.  Also, Nancy has suggested to rosa that being the two newest house members that they might exchange  xmas in early july  presents. I don't know how that is progressing.  That's all I've got.
