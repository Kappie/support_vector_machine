I still wasn't having any problems the majority of the users complain about regarding the Mouseware software, so I stand by my original comment. My mouse was just defective. I couldn't fully charge it without the mouse dying. The LED would blink and then after 5 mins the LED would go out and there was no turning it back on. I hit the connect button, swapped USB ports, etc. The thing that brought it back to life was leaving it in the base then unplugging the base from the powerbar and plugging it back in. At any rate, there was something seriously wrong with the one I had.  I opted for a refund rather than an exchange because I'd been spending too much money recently anyway.  Its a pity really because I loved that mouse. It's still an excellent mouse and I'd recommend it to anyone.
