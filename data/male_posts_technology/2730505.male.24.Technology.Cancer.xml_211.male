Let's say there's 4 people on a table.  by each player's area on the table there's a little hole where the ball would drop.  The object would be to drop it to their cup per say and it would eliminate them, then it would be 3 people playing against each other.  Imagine taking on 3 people who all teamed up against you and they are all trying to get the ball in your cup and you are able to deflect it to go to another player's cup.  Yeah.  Dude, leave it to me to make it an interesting game.  MAKE IT A DRINKING GAME!  It would have to be a bigger cup and more metal balls on that table.  I dunno, I guess I am just bored.  Anyways, off to setup another wireless home network I go.  Peace out!
