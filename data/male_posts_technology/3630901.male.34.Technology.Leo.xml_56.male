Sometimes I feel I should let it out, but then I think about my life and the difficulty I have had in expressing anger or sadness publicly.  I don't want anyone to be pitying me or trying to support me.  Like I feel I can do it on my own, and I don't need anybody.  But I think deep down, I really do need other people.  And I really do need to vent and to be supported.  I think one of the things that caused my marriage to stagnate was that I stopped expressing my feelings -- that I repressed a lot.  I never really blew up at L when I found out she had the affair.  Instead, I immediately went into a depressed feeling like 'why is this happening to me?'.  Even before that, with kids, as I'm sure you know, we would spend a vast majority of our energy on being with the kids, disciplining, feeding, cleaning, playing, teaching ... such that we didn't have a whole lot of energy for each other when they were finally put down to bed.  In the last couple of years (and maybe longer), there was less romance, less excitement in the marriage.  I figured this out after it was too late.  If she ever figured it out, she didn't make any effort to change either.  Regarding the truth, we each have our own perception of it of course.  My mother-in-law tells it like it is (or as she sees it), and it pretty much pisses everyone off.  I just bought a new car, and at first she said nice car, but then immediately followed up by saying, "you now the dark blue color is going to show dirt very easily - you're going to have to wash it a lot."  At that point, I had nothing nice to say, and I was trying to get the kids in the car without them running into the parking lot, so I didn't say anything.  I think it's part of my belief system that if you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say anything.  But in a way, not saying what I'm feeling, is withholding the truth.  And in a way, that's lying.  I have mixed feelings on it because L withheld information from me all the time -- she wasn't specifically lying about where she was, but she wasn't exactly forthcoming, either.  I think it's important to be forthcoming with the people that matter the most to you.  But actions speak louder than words as they say, and I believe I'm quite the hypocrite there!    My personal coach says that a white lie is still a lie.  My step father would agree.  He had lots of names for lying, and I remember one in particular - sugar-coating.    I went on a date last night with P.  We were originally just going to go for a walk, before I went to my yoga class, but yoga was cancelled, so we were able to do dinner, walk on the beach, sit at the beach, and then dessert.  It went about 5 hours.  I'm attracted to her, but I wonder if it's P I'm attracted to, or the idea of P.  She's a little older, 37, and has never been married.  But she asked me questions, and I couldn't tell a lie - I told her the truth about why we adopted kids (my infertility), that I wasn't truly divorced yet, that I was attracted to her, that I wanted to kiss her.    It's been a long time since I went on a date.  A very long time.  In fact I don't know if I've ever really 'dated' - it's more that I fall into a relationship.  So I was at times very nervous, and when I'm nervous, I tend to smile and laugh (what is that - nervous hysteria?).  I told her I wanted to kiss her and she asked, "really?"  But I didn't kiss her.  Then a bit later in the conversation, she said, "you can kiss me if you want."  But it didn't feel right or spontaneous any more, so I didn't.  Instead I waited until the end of the evening and leaned in for a quick kiss.  To which she responded, "you're cute".  I don't know exactly how to take that.  But, I stirred when I kissed her (if you know what I mean).  I told her I had a great time and that I'd like to see her again.  She responded that she'd like to see me again, too.  I felt a little surprised by that, because I know that she felt that I was too close to the divorce to be going into another relationship.  But I don't know, maybe her clock is ticking.  Or maybe, just maybe, she really likes me.
