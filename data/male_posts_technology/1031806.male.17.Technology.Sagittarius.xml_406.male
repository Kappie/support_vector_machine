Our average speed's been around 85-90 the  entire way  out of Portland. It seems the max we've had to slow down had been to 70 in heavy ish  traffic. A bit ago we stopped in Redding to change our windshield wipers (yes, it was actually raining earlier, though the windshield's been coated with an enzime that stops rain from sticking so you almost don't even need the wipers). I picked up a pair of sunglasses for 99 cents (hehe). If they last me the rest of the week, they'll have been worth it.  Btw, I've had my eyes closed for most of this post... (spl check works wonders)
