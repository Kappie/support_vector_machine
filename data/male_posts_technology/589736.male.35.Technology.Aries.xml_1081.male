     
      Back to my male pigginess.  Looking at the Entertainment Weekly picture, first let me say that the blonde on the right who looks to be about 6' 6" tall would be drop dead gorgeous if she lost some of the eye shadow.  Second, compared to the other two women in the group, Natalie Maines *is* the fat one.  She is not fat.  But, she is heavier than the other two.  When comparing a group of people, men are generally vague in their descriptions.  For example, if I were trying to describe something about that pipcture to another friend who was familiar with it but not their names, I would use the following descriptions - the brunette, the skinny blonde, and the fat or chubby blonde.  I will agree that she is not fat, but it is a comparitive tool.  I could just as easily use short and tall I suppose, but that is not a sure thing since one appears to be standing and the other is kneeling on an elevated platform (I think).  I could go with a description I heard from my boss today and describe where as one with the Porky Piggish face.  I'll stick with the general fat/skinny adjectives.
