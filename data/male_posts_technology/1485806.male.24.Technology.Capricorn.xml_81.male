When the company's data center and ISP which are Sprint and WorldCom finishes it work and restored the lines, i found out that there was a server down. But because my position at night was to observe the whole monitoring work ...because my US counterpart collegues was actually doing the actual monitoring job, I have missed out a server which is down for quite some time due to a malfunctioned router .  My boss discovered this out of the mail of the clients complaining to him because unable to access the SAP servers...and i was screwed for it and nearly  got sacked for not reporting the incident in time.  I was quite dazed and really i was so worked up ..over the connection that i did not give a heck to my monitoring work.  Now my probation have been extended and therefore my appraisal have been given a miss. So now i am even more determined to commit more hours than i should , showing more intiatives to win my employer's heart and prove to them that the decision to hire me is not wrong. I , however gave up  a lot of my responsibilties in church and even some in life in order to focus on the priorities. I want to glorify God in my work and if my work performance gives a wrong impression on how a christian should work and his attitudes, I would like to change that by even pushing myself even further by reading up on all procedures and doing my work harder than before.  SO pray with me and for me, that God will be with me to overcome all this and really to give the best that i have got to my employers and really show to them that Christian employees are the assets of the companies.
