I caught some nice hands early and made them pay.  Then I stuck around until I felt like the cards were turning and got out booking a nice positive session.  My play hadn't really changed but I seemed to get some better starting hands and it worked out.  I will continue moving around and see if I can't maximize the good sites when I catch them while trying to keep my losing sessions a little more under control.  On to the weekend, let's see what happens.
