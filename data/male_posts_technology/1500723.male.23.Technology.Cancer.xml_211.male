Hmm, Most of my frens say that I am suitable for research and I should have gone for research and Ph.D and even my Aim too was was to go for Ph.D during my college days But two years have passed after my collge life and I didn't take any solid step towards it, and Now I need to answer question for myself on why I didn't go for Research?  The Actual reasons why I didn't go for research  a. Some continous source of Income for my Parents I couldn't guarantee this.. b. I found industry interesting... c. July 14th Issue.. d. I didn't want to go far away from my family and frens for 5 years (Assumption Ph.D takes 5 years) e. Any way I would be coming back to India after Research I didn't find much of a value add of Ph.D except for it would full fill my dumb dream and apart from that it might give some exposure. f. My entrepreneurship ideas.  But Now I want to give strong reasons.  a. I now feel that It's good that I didn't go for research because till now I haven't decided on the subject of Interest, Networks interest which I had was an arbitrary one and doesnot have much of reasoning. And even if I would have gone for Research I would have ended up doing some arbit subject which I wouldn't have been able to reason.  b. Research are mostly theoretical, only very few research concepts come out to Industry and Among the few of the concepts that come to the Industry only few of them are useful to the common man. At any point of time My Aim was to do some thing that will help common man and If I would have gone for research I wouldn't have made sure that my research would have helped common man because i would have been doing something which My professor likes so that he would give some good grades.. But Now I will certainly want to work on the things that are needed by people in the technology I am working and I will certainly go for research if its needed. Now I don't worry about professors and grades because I now know what matters...  c. There is no end for research in my life I was always doing that and I will continue to do that But it has taken a different shape.    Why Not CAT?  Till I finished my college I considered my self as a tech guy and I also had opinion that tech guyzz shouldn't go for Management and hence I never considered CAT or Management courses for higher studies.  But after I came out of college, I realised that I am very poor in economics, finance and also Management (all the non tech aspects) I certainly want to learn them when I need them So Now my decision about the Management is I will learn these subjects either through P.G courses or part time courses or through some other mechanisms But only when I need them.  And One of the blindest of dreams that I still want to pursue is the theoretical physics. I donno why I wanted to do work on that, But I want to do work on that at any cost at any age. I will certainly start one day to work full time on theoretical physics..
