It's the same argument I've heard time and time again - that it's wrong to generalise re: The Left (odd, how so many of The Left feels so right at home generalising when it comes to The Right. Pot/Kettle black?). Sometimes generalisation can be accurate. He makes an anology about men being boorish misogynistic louts, and that that is incorrect. The irony is, in many circles, we are. Sure, maybe the entire male gender isn't comprised entirely of such specimens, but there are many cultures where such practice is quite standard. Sure, humanity in general isn't a pack of rabid conspiratorial terrorist-backing anti-war hippies. But The Left is. (ahah.)  As for the 'paying ransom=crime' argument, a)that's silly, nitpicking, low and completely out of context(surprise surprise, The Left using out of context arguments, whodathunkit), and b)it didn't help anyways, did it?  Fine. To clarify - those choosing violent crime as a way out = evil. Happy?
