As we were walking through we saw 3 people playing the violin and cello, so we stopped and watched because they were very good.  As we were watching two people walked right up in front of us blocking our view.  They did not say "excuse me" or "Can you see ok."  They just squeezed in around us.  So people please, remember to think about other people and have some etiquette at events.  Especially when Becca is in a grumpy mode and she is trying to listing to a string quartet.  I can't be held responsible for her actions.
