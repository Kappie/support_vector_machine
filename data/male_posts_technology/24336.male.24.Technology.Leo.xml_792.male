So far, I've only driven the car in the parking garage at work and a few blocks around my building.  I am still pretty horrible with the manual, but I'm getting better.  

Last night, Jeff and I took it out for a little spin.  Everything was going fine until I stopped at a stop sign and just couldn't seem to get the car going.  I kept stalling and stalling and stalling.  It felt very weird to me since I was giving it a ton of gas, it just didn't seem like enough.  After about 12 tries I finally got the car going!  It still seemed to be acting up because the revs were so low.  I stopped at the next stop sign and had the same issue!  Finally Jeff hopped in, played with the shifter and turns out, I was in third gear!  I'm just surprised that I actually got it to go that one time.  Oh well, Jeff said the shifter is fairly narrow and thus it's hard to tell which gear you are in.  I just think I am dumb and that is one more thing I will pay attention to when driving stick.
