For as long as I can remember people in this community have been putting out so called "Anonymous" flyers denouncing the actions of the City or this person running for office or that person. Stealing political signs in the middle of the night, making midnight lit drops the night before an election with unsigned flyers; for what?  Sometimes the flyers are outright lies why would someone put their name on that? Sometimes the flyers have twisted facts on them. But one thing was always missing.  Personal   Responsibility . No one would ever claim the flyers as theirs. I can't blame them. That would allow other people to call them out on their lies and hatred.  Now comes the information age and the ability to use the internet to get your message across. I use it regularly. I often get beat up for what I put on my websites cause I tell it like it is. People don't seem to like it when other people put them down. Then of course these are the same people who put out those nasty-grams.  Most of the time when I get attacked it comes from so called "Anonymous" posters who are just afraid to leave their name. Most of the time the attacks are personal instead of political in nature and that's ok. It's part of the  responsibility  I accepted and it goes with the  personal responsibility  associated with putting my name on something.  People don't mind going down to the Council Chamber and calling me a liar and a crook or any other name they can think of, but boy do they whine and cry when the tables are turned and I fight back! Seems people automatically think you give up your constitutional right to free speech when you become an elected official.    NEWS FLASH  ! I have the same right to call you a liar as you do to call me a liar. Deal with it.  Now it would have been real easy for me to create an anonymous blog and use it to bash all the people I disagree with but in my opinion, that is truly the lowest form of dishonor and despicably that one can stoop to. If I'm going to say something about an issue or a person you can darn well bet I'll sign my name to it.  Now you may disagree with what I have to say and that's fine, say so. But have the honor and accept the  personal   responsibility  of attaching your name to your disagreement. If you are going to hip shoot and make personal attacks under the vail of anonymity then expect the same treatment in return.  There has been no person who has posted a comment on this blog to which they have associated their name that has been personally attacked. I commend the two individuals that   have   posted a comment using their real name. While I may disagree with them, they have at least earned my respect.  Now, if you are going to tag and run like an internet terrorist, leaving personal attacks or disparaging remarks without leaving your name, you are fair game. If you are going to dish it out, you better be willing to take it. I am, but I demand that you accept the  personal   responsibility  that goes with posting your opinions on this blog just as I have.  If you refuse to accept the responsibility, I will take away your right to post comments on  my blog , your comments may be deleted or you may get shot back at.  I hope that through this blog we can have an outlet for people to voice their opinions and concerns, agreement and disagreements and even disparaging remarks as long as YOU are willing to accept the  personal   responsibility  that goes with it.  Peace.
