Good GOD are the older ones wordy--yes much wordier than this blog. The more recent ones aren't as bad. Seems to be that the section I wrote for switched to an  urlLink Onion  format half way through the year so I had to emulate journalistic prose rather than just spouting poppycock--which is fine in private, but has no place in our society.   So I'm still on the fence about posting my articles here . . .   Oh but I have been writing a sociologicaltreatise on why I'm such a horrible failure and why I'll never amount to anything.  Stay tuned.
