And hey, Today I met ganesh...he was in chennai today and came to my office...so glad to see him after a long time. We had a puf together after some months gap...but ironically i cud not spend more time with him...  And even more irony is that I forgot to wish him for his B'day and I totally forgot that today is his birth day... Sorry da ganesh.  And coming to scribbled scripts, Thanks rini for ur comments. But u dont have to compare VVS and Scribbled Scripts yaar. And rini do send ur inputs as u said.   Mahendran Jayavel
