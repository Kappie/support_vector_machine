According to Kolesnikov, the virus of atypical pneumonia is a synthesis of the viruses of measles and infectious parotiditis or mumps, the natural compound of which is impossible. This can be done only in a laboratory, he said.  Now, much before SARS became a global threat and when it was just a disturbing problem in South East Asia, I had this chat with a friend. And I, being a conspiracy theorist that I am, had hypothesized that SARS could be lab-created virus that was let loose as a smokescreen. Geez! my brain thinks up such weird stuff these days!!... and when it comes true, it just feels so smug!! ;-)
