I usually fix these bad hair days with my "Got Root" hat, but today I accidently left it home.  After doing some upgrades to my system, I nearly locked myself out of Linux. After several hours fixing a few things, I finally got things back to normal. Whew!  Although much of day has been a headache, there are a few things I've enjoyed.  I ate what I think was my first chili dog. I really liked it. It contained chili-beans, a hotdog (of course), chopped onions, and ketchup (I think).  I've decided my favorite song today is a duet between Peter Cetera and Ronna Reeve, titled SOS. I've listened to it several times now. My favorite part is the background vocals at the beginning and toward end. I think Peter's and Ronna's voices really work well together in this song. It's a very passionate song, full of life. I just realized that I have no idea what this song is talking about. I think I'll go study the lyrics.  It sounds like it's about a couple who fell out of love with each other and now miss the love they had.  After getting myself something to eat from the grill, I played poker online with Cheri and kept playing hours after she left.  Looks like Steven has his mentor over playing cards. I wanted to discuss relgion with them, but now I don't think I'll be able to. I'm feeling pretty depressed. I can't describe how lonely I feel.
