Of course the evening went much better :)  Today I drove back from Dallas I thought of Karissa and even called only to get VM.  I came home and started to take a nap as today was my first day back to work in 3 weeks!  Well who should call but   SFW  !  Did she call to let me talk to Karissa or clue me in on where she is going?  No!  She called to bitch at me!    I did get to talk to Karissa for about 3 minutes tops!    It seems that I forgot to pack Karissa's socks. The very same socks that Karissa never wore when she was here so the socks sat in a drawer unused for 3 weeks and I forgot them.  I also forgot to pack Karissa's leap pad book.  Karissa never even played with it from the time we left MI to the time   SFW   picked her up.  I went in Karissa's room and found it in the toy box.     SFW   hung up on me in the middle of our conversation when I told her Karissa never played with those toys while she was here and I was sorry I did not pack it.  She simply reponded with "Yeah you are super dad" and hung up.  I called the pay phone back and told her that one of these days she needs to understand that hanging up the phone does not solve her phone conversation problems and Karissa is very perceptive so I did not appreciate her doing it in front of Karissa as Karissa has that bad habit which I am sure she got from Lisa.    Like the french kiss thing because she wants to "kiss like mommy!"  So rather then blow it off or seem uncaring I sent it fed-ex for $62 to MI so it would be there Monday since   SFW   told me she has to leave on Tuesday to make it back to TX or WA.    Of course I am helping her decision to go back to WA by providing Jeremey's Stepmom and Dad with information from my case so they can file for temporary custody of him.  I can only imagine the lid   SFW   will flip when she finds that one out.    I also found out that   SFW   is telling her kids that their uncle does not love them anymore because of the blowout between   SFW   and her brother.  I find that absolutely horrifying not to mention if she can get her 14 and 12 year old to believe that about their uncle I am afraid to find out what   SFW   might tell them about me and/or the latest court ruling.    Needless to say I am a little tired.  I did not get my nap before work because of everything going on.    My mother sent extra money for my mortgage and a Kaleidiscope for Karissa 11 days ago and still no sign of it! That sucks more then I can even tell you.  I am sure at this rate I will be broke and homeless in no time!  I know the lord tests people and the tests make you stronger but I am wondering if he can quit making me stronger for awhile and offer me some tests that make me thinner or something?
