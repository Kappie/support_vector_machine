I was hopeful, but python got taken off of the list of languages, so I'd have to compete in C++ or Java, neither of which I'm very good at. But I want to know what Google corporate headquarters is like, and anybody could use the cash prizes they offer.  1st place ten grand 2nd place five grand 3rd place three thousand five hundred 4rth place one thousand two hundred fifty  dollars my friends.  now go, and may the slack be with you.
