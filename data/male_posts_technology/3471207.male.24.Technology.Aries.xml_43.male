It was supposed to be me, aggie and barbara but so sad!!! Only me came to clean...hai..so sad...barbara said she had to go back for her brother's birthday and aggie didn't come to church for cleaning at all. Meanwhile, i'm still looking for someone to replace me as chief librarian..hahaa..i'm looking towards Andrew, but then he wants to start as a junior position first...hehehe..maybe after a while, then i can promote him to be chief!!!muahahahahah. Okok, anyway we had a fun time cleaning the church because we all worked together. After i finished with the library, i went around with my digital camera to take some pictures...so at least there's evidence that such and such a person came to help out!!!hahhaa..then i can send the pictures to pastor..hahaa...wah piang today so cranky...okok..talk serious. Yup, after the pictures, i went to the sanctuary to check out what they were doing. I saw uncle TC polishing the pews with some sort of lemon fragrance spray for wood. So he asked me to help too, so i took a bottle and a new cloth and i went to polish the right section of the sanctuary. Then weixiang came along to help me too...and after that, we went around polishing anything that's made of wood..i polished the notice board and the doors and even the social hall's wood panels. Yup, so when you go in the social hall next week, you'll be able to smell this lemon fragrance still lingering in the air. After that we went to the soon-to-be youth room which is the former pastor's office. I actually found the room very small for the number of youths that we have but then no choice lah, got to make do with what we have. So we just cleaned and vacummed the room. Some of the youth had to bring the gigantic vacuum cleaner up the stairs to vacuum the room. So after that was done, i went down, took some snacks..i think pastor bought alot of snacks and after that went home with my mom in  a cab..what a day!
