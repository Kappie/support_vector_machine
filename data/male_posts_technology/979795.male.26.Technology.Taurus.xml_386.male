Weide needs to study and won't be training till end of year after his end of year papers (crucial year for him). Leon and Bridget MIA. Meng Lee wasn't around, most probably due to work again. The 2 beginners (couple) came a bit later than usual.  One Indian chap is starting to resume training with us again at Siglap. I did see him a few times here a long while ago but I think he probably moved on to train in another dojo. Recently he's been joining back with us again. Quite OK dude, but sometimes overly enthusiastic as an uke. Heh ... as Tang might put it ... sometimes we over-exaggerate our reaction/momentum of a grab, a pull, a punch, or an off-balanced motion as uke. I know I'm pretty guilty of that sometimes. A lot sounds coming from him when he partnered with Roxanne. Err, something like a partial ki-ai. But a lot of it seemed to me to be more of just making sounds on the mat. Dunnoz, ki-ai is something I'm still trying to understand.  A lady Yudansha popped by today. Spoke to her for awhile once before during last year's Aikicamp. Not sure if she still remembers me. Think she doesn't really train anywhere specific, but she's on good terms with Freddy Sensei. Heh ... I dunno why, it kinda reminds me of Ah Hee Sensei. Think her name's Jessie. Anyway, when we were doin warm-ups she came in. I was surprised as I thought she was taking the class for that evening. Later, Richard turned up. Than I realised class was as per normal. I pretty much partnered with Sakai the whole night. Jessie was teaching the couple rolls and some basic techniques while Richard went around guiding everyone in class. Was a good evening.  Was surprised that Richard called me up as uke that evening. Sure, it's not the first time I've uked for him in class. BUt the trend was usually that he would call the most senior student present to be his uke (meaning that if a more senior one came late, he will still be calling up the initial uke). That's why I was surprised because the twins were both 4th kyu and they weren't late that evening. But it was good practice, helped me to feel what a nage wanted me to do/how to move. A lot of leading in fact. Only bad thing is that as uke, sometimes I'm not able to 'see' how to do the technique.
