We each seem to have our own niche or specialty in which we are knowledgeable.   urlLink Annebrev  knows a lot about botany, biology, and chemistry.   urlLink Jessica  is very well read in philosophy.  I can discuss engineering or drafting or maps, among other things.  There are countless computer experts and writers and movie buffs and musicians blogging.  But the thing is, many of the things bloggers write about are not within their area of specialty, sometimes not even close.  I will never tell anyone I am well-informed about mental health or parenting or psychology, but most of what I have written seems to be focused on those topics.  Maybe the things we most need to get in writing are the things we know the least about.  Never stop learning, never give up on figuring out yourself and the world around you.
