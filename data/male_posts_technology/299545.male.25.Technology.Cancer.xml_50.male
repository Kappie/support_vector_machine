Mix the eggs and flour together, and then stir in milk until the batter is runnier than you think it should be. You want the consistency of very thin gravy, but without any lumps. Let sit for at least 2 hours at room temperature. Salmonella, shlalmonella. Drink the red wine. After two hours have passed, heat up a large heavy frying pan good and hot. Rub the pan with butter or oil at the outset, and after every other crepe. You want only enough batter to coat the pan surface; pour the batter in the center and spread it evenly by tilting the pan. The crepes should come out very thin and pliable. It's tempting to set the the heat too low -- if the crepe is sticking to the pan, takes a long time to cook, and the edges aren't curling up, the pan is too cold. If the crepe has black blisters on its belly, or goes up in a smoky fireball as soon as the batter hits the pan, then reduce the heat a little bit.  It's French week over at  urlLink Idle Words  and they have some great entries. The Top Ten Reasons to Love France, the Real History of WWII, some yummy crepe recipes, and a comparison of French and US school lunch menus are some of the highlights so far.
