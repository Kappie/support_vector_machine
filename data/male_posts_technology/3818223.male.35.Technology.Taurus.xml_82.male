Age 16:  you can operate a car, the thing responsible for more deaths in this country than firearms, alcohol, and cigarettes  Age 17:  pass  Age 18:  you can vote for the leader of the free world, and die for him in the military  Age 19:  you can buy cigarettes  Age 20:  pass  Age 21:  you can buy firearms and alcohol, both starting on the same day   That's six years and six privileges.  I think they should make it one privilege per year, and perhaps rethink the order, especially allowing people to legally get drunk and buy a shotgun on the same day.  Learn to use one responsibly before starting with the other, I say.  I thought that it might be a good idea to let people choose their own order (you just know voting and joining the military are going to the bottom of most lists), but then I realized a group of friends could circumvent the whole situation.  "Ok, guys, we're all turning sixteen this year.  Bob, you get your license, Jim, you're on beer duty, and I'll get the shotguns."  Smarmy, out
