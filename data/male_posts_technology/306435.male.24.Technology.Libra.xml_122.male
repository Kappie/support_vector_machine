White Tiles.  I got the win going the first 4 innings.  Mike Brooks, the manager of the CW Tiles and the head of the league, acknowledged General's leaving the team and has put me in charge for the time being.  he said General never paid himt he deposit or league fees for the team.  He said he would call me and help me work it out so the team can continue.  I hope we can. If we go into the tournament on a hot streak and 9 players (cross our fingers) then we may be Louisville bound.  There are eight teams in the league and the final two in the tournament go to the show.  We know we can beat three of them.  More importantly they know we can beat them.
