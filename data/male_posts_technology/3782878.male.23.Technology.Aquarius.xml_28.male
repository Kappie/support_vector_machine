Today has been pretty hectic here at work, the problem with the phones at our work continues so we keep getting calls flowing into our dept that should not be. but those things happen. Aside from that I've been keeping up with  urlLink The Newbie Zone , the Everquest forum of personal choice. making comments when I have time, and also keeping up my other blogs.    But I made a vow last night while my fiance was tucked into bed, that I needed to organize my life and priorities a little bit. Right now I'm on a pretty ferocious cycle of Sleep, Eat, Work, Eat, EQ, repeat. I have several projects I've been meaning to work on, and I'll explain them a little bit here.    Dungeons and Dragons Adventure Concept: Nefarnomicon - a detailed campaign world, I've worked on this for over a year now, and I've got the concept world all in my head, and many of the pieces written down in various places. But I need to write this, it's very important to me, but has always been pushed around to being nothing but something in my Outlook ToDo list with nothing to push it past hitting the snooze button for the thousanth time. I built this world, with my bare hands, from the original goddess, to the various races, when they came into being, what drove them to be how they are, etc. and no of it is organized or complete! grr, that angers me sometimes that I let it get away from me. It's going to be stupendous to play, and maybe, when I'm done I can submit it to WotC for publication and if that happens, well, money is always good :D    Shadowrun Covert Operations Suite: a package software much like the  urlLink RolePlaying Master  I typically use for the Dungeons and Dragons. I wanted to put my coding skills to decent use and make a tool I could use for designing and laying out things structured easily and offer online access at the same time. So I could run games even with people physically seperated from my game table. I began research into what I would need to do, but didn't move past that stage.  The Phoenix Perch Website: I've been meaning to do this for well over 2 years I just haven't spent the time with Flash and Dreamweaver to hammer out the particulars about this site. I figure it may generate more traffic to this page, and give me a place to show off all the screenshots of all the cool stuff I've done in EQ, and link my shirt shops I run non-profit.  Organize and catalog my Magic Cards using Magic Workstation: I have 3 binders and a pizzabox sized box of Magic cards, organization of these has always been a chore, however if I could put them into my database, I could sort them easily, and create virtual decks out of my available cards before I even have to touch the dreaded binders.   In an endevour to actually accomplish these fabled tasks obviously I'm going to have to cut back a little on my EQ time, which is suprisingly easy to do, in small increments. I have started to place things in my Outlook Tasklist a little more broken down, instead of "organize all magic cards into MTGW" I have "append and organize the black cards into the database" and I give myself 2 full weekends to accomplish even these broken down tasks, and I can extend that as necessary, but I'm going to try to force myself to accomplish at least 10% of any given task per weekend, so that I am making progress, even if it is slow and steady. We'll see how it goes next weekend.   more to come later,  Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix
