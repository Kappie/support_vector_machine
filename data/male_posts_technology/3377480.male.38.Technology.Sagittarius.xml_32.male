Twisted it bad.  Finally about 4pm, I gave up and told them to take me back to the dock and to the emergency room.  It took an hour to get to the dock and that was a long hour, unbleivable pain, foot swelling up, every little bounce hurt.      So my sister in law and son take me to the emergency room in Dennison Texas.  Sister in Law was the days designated driver so lucky her!        Now mind you the last emergency room I had tried to get into was 17 years ago, Parkland hospital in Dallas, the worse emergency room in Texas at the time for a Saturday  at 1am.  (was appendix's, and they never did see me, finally left and went to a Catholic hospital across the street and they "saved" me! huh and you thought only right wing religous nuts saved people!)      So I was expecting the worse.        We drive up and sis in law goes and gets a wheel chair sitting outside, and wheels me in, they have a triage set up right at the entrance, no one there, but someone at the reception checking someone in.  sis in law goes and ask if anyone is working triage, "yes let me buzz them" Soooo, female nurse comes out.   Now mind you I have always had the most respect for the nurses in a hospital over anyone. they have the "crap" jobs.  they in my opinion are the ones that do the hard work.  Like a construction worker, the bricklayer lays the brick, but the architect gets the credit. so this nurse comes out starts the 50 questions.  Now I dont have a problem with the 50 questions, I would want someone to know if I am alergic to something, so they dont kill me,  Although she did ask one silly one.     Nurse  "so do you have any medical history?"    Me     "No, I am 38 years old and this is the first time I have ever been to the Dr."         Here's your sign!  actually what i said was, "well I am 38 so yes, can you be more specific!" Nurse  "have you ever had a Heart attack, diabetes, aids, head cut off, that kind of thing!" Me     "well no, unless you count the first time I saw my wife and I sure thought I had a Heart attack!"  Ok I didnt actually say that, I just said "ohh no, nothing like that" the nurse was nice and laughed as did the male nurse that was taking my blood pressure.  The blood pressure, I was thinking with all the pain I was in and all, that it would be real bad.  NOPE,  125 over 72   Little high for me but I guess itll be ok!  so then we have to goto the receptionist.  What a bitch.  If she had been my waitress I would have asked for the manager.  Why is it that people that work in hospitals are so damn mean and rude?  I wish I had brought my 2 x 4!  Even my son thought she was rude. I thought about it along time on why she and others that are not nurses or Dr.'s are so mean and rude and can come up with no acceptable reason. Do we think that the waitress at chillies likes waiting on drunk a-holes all day?  no, but she keeps a smile on her face all day.  Is it because they get paid nothing?  if that is the case leave and become a waitress!  She was having a bad day?  Hello bitch, i just messed my foot up, hurts like hell and ruined a vacation, but I was polite to you!  hell me being polite to anyone wether I am hurt or not is something!  but i treated you and everyone I met that day with respect, unlike you!  hell that wench she dont desereve the 2x4 she deservers the 2x6 with dung dipped nails sticking out of it!    she sucked!   anyway, they get me back to emergency room area and take my wheel chair away.  sis in law and son go back to lake since she is the designated driver and everyone else would need ride back to house, plus I figured I would be along time getting fixed up. so, Dr. Franklin, comes in we chat, he sends the x-ray technicians (some more rude a-holes, I hope that wench that moved my foot onto the x-ray board got athletes hand, from my athletes infected foot! she was another beatch!  I guess she was having a bad day also.) so seemed like forever since I was in such pain, but they had to take more x-rays but finally dr. says several hairline fractures and bad sprain on foot. walking boot, crutchs, some nice drugs and take it easy on foot. Now one thing I have learned in the last 2 years is,  ask, many many questions, "ok, take it easy how?  can i still do the chandelier and leather with the monkey or is that out?"  "what is the name of that drug your prescribing?  let me write that down, and what does it do?  can i drive after taking it?  the nurses got a little tired of me asking 1000 questions but I kept at it, (one nurse said it will be on the prescription bottle, I said thats nice but I want to write it down myself,   she gave me a pen let me write it all down and I am glad since my med insurance had em change name brands to some off brand stuff)   so i take some good drugs, and they release me.  I crutch my way outside, and no one is there waiting on me,  I find a chair outside and sit, drugged up in the cool shade and reflect on.... hell i dont know what i reflected on,  kind of drugged up, no pain!  total time from talking to triage nurse to sitting outside, half stoned, under 2 hours! I was very impressed!   Nurses all nice, and Dr. was very informative.  shocked is a good way to put it.  Now mind you,I told myself I was going to start paying attention to the medical stuff next time I went.  since sister and sister and bro in laws are DR's and Nurses, and I always bad mouth them, I wanted to be specific on what they did wrong.  Maybe It has always been the receptionist and the technicians that are rude beatchs, and I just blame it on the dr.?  One key is ask the Dr. anything you dont understand.  I mean anything.  I had him get specific on alot of stuff, yes I could tell he was kinda tired or frustraded? with me but once I got it i let him know.  and I thanked him, not for treating me so much but for explaining all that I asked.    No more vacations this summer, I am just gonna finish my pool and go take one in it!  And Dr.'s are still not that smart!  (thats for you Suzz)
