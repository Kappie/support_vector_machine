This is most definitely a great achievement, given that the movie is the first documentary to win the price since Jacques Cousteau's "The Silent World" in 1956. This follows a great win last year in the Academy Award where his "Bowling for Columbine" earned his a win in the category of best documentary. It also earned him a special prize at Cannes in 2002.   Congratulations Michael Moore !!!!  How, you might as why my title says "Disney is fucked"? Well, for starters, this movie was produced by Miramax, which is owned by Disney. It is obvious that Miramax, trying to capitalize on Moore's oscar win, gave the filmmaker free reign to make this movie. What is it about? From what I hear, it's a scathing indictment of White House actions after the September 11 attacks. It accuses U.S. President George W. Bush and friends of stealing the 2000 election, overlooking terrorism warnings before September 11 and fanning fears of more attacks to secure Americans' support for the Iraq war (all of this which I also fully believe).  Now, this looks like a sure fire hit for Disney, right? Well, before Saturday, the word on the street was that not only didn't Disney want to release the movie, but they were even looking into selling the rights to another company so that they could take care of the distribution. WTF?!?!?!??!?!??!?!?  Yep, you heard right. Disney wants no part of the movie. Why? Here is where we introduce into our little story Mr. Jeb Bush, brother of U.S. President George W. Bush, A.K.A. the governor of Florida where Disney has it's biggest team parts. I think you already have an idea of where this is going.   Disney is afraid that if they go forward with the distribution of this movie, big bad Florida governor is going to do some nasty things to the parks. Sounds like Disney hasn't been paying as much in taxes as they should have been. Maybe some permits missing? How about some lawsuits or claims against Disney that have been kept quiet or stomped.? So many things... A movie like this can make enemies out of good political friends.  So, Disney decides to get rid of the movie, pissing off Miramax and straining their relationship (Miramax is the home of Tarantino, Roberts Rodriguez, Scary Movie, Scream and other franchise movies that have made big bucks for Disney). Guess Disney favors power over logic.  Anyway, now Disney is in a big pile of doggie doo doo (A.K.A. "shit").   This little documentary movie has just one the freaking Palme d'Or award at Cannes. This is the most prestigious film award in the whole freaking world. Which means this movie will be a sure fire hit around the world (Barton Fink being an exception).   Which, btw, Pulp Fiction (also a Miramax movie) won the Palme d'Or in the year it was released and look how well it did. *wink* *wink*  So, Disney has three choices:  1) Let Miramax release the movie (thereby salvaging the Miramax - Disney relationship) and bringing on the wrath of Jeb Bush, U.S. President George W. Bush (A.K.A. The big baby that wants to rule the world) and every other twisted republican that wants to take a crack at the company.  2) Sell the movie forward and have another studio claim it owns a Palme d'Or winning film from an already oscar winner who will probably be nominated this year again at the Oscars (not to mention with the amount of press this movie is getting, have a huge hit on it's hands). Plus, of course, see the relation between Miramax and Disney die a mangled, quick death.  3) Sit on the movie... forever !!! Never distribute it or, simply, give it a mild direct to video release, thereby limiting it's profits and destroying any shot at the oscars (even taught Disney can give it a limited run in a few theaters like Miramax did with Jet Li's "Hero", thereby securing an oscar nomination, but not necessarily an oscar win). And, the Miramax - Disney relationship is strained forever, but still lives on.   Note: They can also hold on to the movie and release it after the elections when both George and Jed will no longer be holding office (we can only cross our fingers and hope).   Which ever way you look at it, Disney is F U C K E D. I would say to Disney, go for choise # 1 cause money makes the word go round and an oscar nomination (that has a clear chance to turn into an oscar win) is a must for your crown. Plus keeping an ACE like Michael Moore happy and in your trenches is very important for busyness. You don't want to give away success to your rivals no matter how much they are willing to pay.  This is the best way to go, except Disney will probably go with choise # 3 which has them holding off the movie or taking it straight to video (with the limited run for the Oscar guys). Why? It's the best of both worlds. Also, limits it's impact power. Miramax and Michael Moore would be "happy" (in a "At least the fuckers at Disney released the blasted him" kinda way). Still, don't surprised if Michael Moore moves to a better playing field and Miramax's top names start leaving in protest like rats running away from a sinking shit...erm...ship.   Btw, Moore says he is looking to get this movie in theaters during the election so that the American people can "do the right thing"... =;-D     urlLink Sailor Ecchi (A.K.A.
