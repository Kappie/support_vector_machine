It's an archaeological dig site of some sort, with white tents and folding furniture everywhere.  You see Litheroy looking into a small pen.  You wander over and look into the pen yourself.  Inside is what looks like a tiny dinosaur.  Something like a cross between a tricerotops and a stegasaur.  "Now, I ask you," Litheroy asks, "does that look like a dragon to you?"
