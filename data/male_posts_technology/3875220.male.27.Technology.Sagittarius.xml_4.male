But anyways, without further adieu, onto the good stuff. Now I just need to figure out what the good stuff is.  So there I was, sitting at my desk at work (big man with my own desk...I feel so powerful) trying to look busy enough so that any wandering management types don't come down on me as to why I'm not doing anything. But in all honesty, they don't scare me and they wouldn't have any say in my productivity levels at this point in the game. The truth is that the beginning affects of short-timer's disease are starting to settle in. Let me explain, and briefly if I can (I have a tendency to write novels at times)...  Just over a year ago, my company made it known that they were relocating my department from Texas to Pennsylvania (head office). As such, they were laying off everyone in my department. I, myself, saw this coming a few months beforehand so my shock value had depleted considerably by that point. Well, low and behold, the CIO who was visiting from headquarters (love how that sounds so military to match the regime power trip of upper management) to announce the news calls me into his make-shift office. After a few minutes of kissing my ass, he tells me that he's ready to offer me a position and the company will pay for relocation costs and the like. Sweat deal and the cash bonuses (note the plural) he threw at me wet my appetite for my piece of the American capitalist dream to own lots of useless stuff with lots of features not available on any other model (until next week's version arrives) and complain that there's nothing on TV...ever. Also in the mix, he said in one voice or another that I would be quickly promoted. So. A few signed documents later, I found myself in the historic tri-state area. Within a month I realized that historic just means old and the tri-state part was just not my cup of tea. Add to this that whatever voice the CIO used when he pitched the promotion at me was obviously  not  the one who actually made the decisions.  So then I found myself a laughable victim of Corporate America and living in a part of the country that agreed with me less than the $2 taco plate from the shack down the street recently listed as an environmental hazard by the EPA. Soon after realizing that my career was going nowhere fast, I went off on the CIO. Since then, he doesn't make eye contact with me so it's not a big loss. And because of the relocation deal they threw at me, I had to stay with the company for a year after I got here or else pay back the bonuses (note the plural again) that I got for making the move. Oh woe is me. Don't worry, you can laugh. I don't mind. I've had many a chuckle over this myself.  Good news though, yes there's good news in the pit of this hell, is that I have just a hair and half over 2 weeks left before my year is up. July 21st to be exact. And I've been counting down the days...and hours...and minutes...and seconds since January or so. Just ask my family and friends and they'll grumble disgustedly about knowing  exactly  how much time I have left...down to the second. I'm such a neurotic basketcase at times.  So there you are. You've been caught up, more or less, with the last year. Don't you feel so...uhmm..so...something...to know this now? Maybe I'll keep posting here. Maybe I won't. Guess only time will tell.  Peace out and stuff...
