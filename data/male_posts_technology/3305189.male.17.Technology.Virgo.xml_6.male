  urlLink Anne's Weblog about Markup & Style  
  urlLink Ian Hixie  
  urlLink Jeffery Zeldman's Daily Report  
  urlLink Mezzoblue - Dave Shea  
  urlLink Research Kitchen - Minz Meyer  
  urlLink Mark Wubben  
  urlLink Dutchcelt - Egor Kloos  
 

 There are some other ones as well, but I'll make another post again later.
