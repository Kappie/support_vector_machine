A process, which involves all the operations in an organisation dealing with software projects starts from the time, a quotation or proposal is made for acquiring the project to the end/closure of the project.   A process is sequential, and is also augmented with parallel flows of operation across various process areas (popularly known as Key Process Areas or KPAs shortly) of an Organisation's process.   There are Five levels which are talked about in CMM. Each level indicative of the level of evolution of the process in terms of its maturity. Maturity here by means, the ability or capability (how well )of the process to handle the variations in the process. Hence forth CM stands for Capability Maturity in the Model.  The first level is " Initial " level, where in the organisation is not having any define process.  The second level is " Repeateable " level, where in there are some best practices followed or process is defined, but its not same for all the projects. These processes, since are found to be effective, are repeated for the forthcoming projects, but remember, still its not a standard ( means, a process which is used across the organisation).   If a company is in level three, then it means, they have a defined ODSP (Organisation Defined Software Process) which can be understood from the very expansion of it that, there will be only one process, with enough flexiblity to contain any kind of project the company wishes to undertake. Once this ODSP is defined, then PDSP (Project Defined Software Process) is tailored from this ODSP. Obviously level three is about " Defining "  Defining a process i mean here, is to write a set of procedures for handling the KPA's in a process and create the necessary templates like a Quotation template, Project plan template, Requirement Analysis Report template, Architectural Design document template, Detailed Design Document template, Design plan template, Code review report template, Test plan template, test report template, Acceptance report template etc. and so on.   Along with this, guidelines which help us in taking decisions regarding the design like different life cycle models, and others like different project estimation techniques, and guidelines for good coding, standard coding practices etc. are also evolved and they are bundled together to form a process. And traceablity of all these across the process is also maintained. Traceablity here by i mean the ablity to tell, what gave rise to what. Yes, for eg. Software Requirement Specification  will be derived from Customer Requirement Specification . similarly, Detailed design is made of Architectural and Requirement specs, etc. So a link across all the affected documents is also made explicitly known, for the sake of maitaining consistency and hence quality of the product deliverded.  Since we have a process defined now, its tailored or customised for a project. for eg. we might have a maintenance project where there is no development phase at all. so we will tailor the ODSP to contain parts which will contain maintenance related KPAs and ignore others.   This is about an organisation at level three.   Now in level 4 and 5 we try to do what?yes, we try to improvise on the process defined.  Yes, in Level 4 which says about " manageable " process, we try to enhance the process by using some statistical tools like control chart for measuring the deviations, Use CPM / PERT method for detecting the critical time required for completion of project , what guys if u were attentive in some OM classes, i think u can easily track what i am talking about, if not dont worry, u can always learn them once u start managing projects. In level 4, these tools are used to fine tune, what are called " Assigned causes of variation ". These are variations, which are explicit and whose causes can be assigned to one particular cause and is static.   Obviously in level 5, they try to attack " Random Causes of Variation "  (a clear pciture of which i can be able to give, when we get level 5 i believe) and hence " optimise " the process!   ........................................................................................................  wondering why i wrote this? yes, last week i was in CMM training, since we are aspiring to be in level three, few months from now. And since we dont have a ODSP, we (a team of just 8, with, to be honed skills) are trying to evolve a process. Surprising isn't it? And so, will be busy in writing procedures, creating templates, gathering guidelines and what not, which is going to be absolutely interesting as i can see. Thought would give u guys a flavor, how Level 5 companies work and  what they did to achieve this.

Bye for now
