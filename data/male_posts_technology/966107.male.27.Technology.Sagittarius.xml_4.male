How, otherwise can it justify the policy of declaring a war against terror, while supporting President Pervez Musharraf, funding Afghan war-lords who supposedly have links to the Taliban.  India has (once again) extended the hand of friendship and opportunity towards Pakistan. Commentators and analysts from various factions say that it is a right move and alos the timing of the move is impeccable. Pakistani Government has also replied to the offer with Enthusiasm and hope. The question is, will the enthusiasm last? Given the history of four wars between the countries and the deep resentment in the Pakistani people over India, one cannot help but be skeptical. It is now accepted that the road to SUSTAINABLE peace in the Indian sub-continent is through dialogue and peace talks, not-withstanding what some people on both the sides may believe. An attack on Pakistan and a war between the two nuclear weapons wielding countries will be catastrophic. Also history is witness that a peace gained by force is not sustainable. Unless the people have a deep feeling and want for peace, peace cannot be gained. Peace has to be accepted by all, not forced. People cannot live in peace and harmony if they have nay sort of resentment.  History now beckons India to be a peace maker in the region and the world without being a pacifist. Time has now come to stop toeing the US line and looking at the US for approval of our policies and actions. Every nation has its own set of priorities and it would be foolish to believe that any one would help another out of selfless service. Time now has come for India to assert her own belief in the world without any fear.  India is strong and self sufficient enough to sustain herself in the world and grow. What she needs to do is to inject some self belief into the population and divert the energy of the youth from the current pre-occupation of regional politicking towards the progress of India. We cannot depend on the politicians of India to do this. We, the people of India have to do this and I believe that we can do this. Let's wake up and work towards a common goal of progress and prosperity for India and the Indian populace. Let's wake up the sleeping giant. A giant called INDIAN.
