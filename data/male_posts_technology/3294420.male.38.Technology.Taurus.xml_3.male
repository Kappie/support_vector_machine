She was pretty sleepy the entire day and continued to be so for part of the day Sunday.    She was back to herself on Sunday night though.  We gave her a bath which she thouroughly enjoyed.  She likes to have her scalp massaged.  After her bath she ate her entire bottle for her daddy.  She is just over 6 pounds.
