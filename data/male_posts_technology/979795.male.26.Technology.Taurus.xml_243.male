We did a quick warmup / revision of the 2 8 directional cuts, followed by a new pattern she called hiji/higi-tai. Till now I still can't find anything on hiji/higi yet. Think I'll check with her again by email.  Anyway for starters, we're required to 'Zha Ma Bu' and start making shomen cuts. After that, we needed to shift our center / lean left and right while swinging the bokken to our side to deflect invisible blows coming down on us, immediately we had to shoft ourselves back to the middle and do a shomen cut again. With paired work, it actually became really nice and it was something like a I-cut-you-while-you-deflect and immediately followed by a You-cut-me-while-I-deflect motion. When you do it continously the exercise seems really really nice. Next stance had 1 guy in hiji-tai and another in our normal sword stance (right stance). Uke does a shomen cut with a step forward, and nage blocks (not parry/deflect). The block is just the shifting of hands to the side and up while raising your hands above your head, ultimately the tip of the sword faces your opponent and the edge is facing skywards. Anyway once you're in this position, the tip of uke's sword is kinda resting just before the tsuba. What we need to do now is bring our handle to our center. It gives a parrying motion which throws uke's sword off to the side. Again, doing this continuously make things look really cool. But please note that nage (whose sword gets parried aside), should remember to follow the parried movment other wise the sword may hit your knuckles, as I managed to find out the hard way. I'm just glad my fingers till work. 1 final exercise was a parry. Nage attacks with a shomen, uke in higi-tai shifts 1 side and glances the blow away before returning with his own shomen cut. At this point I can't remember clearly but I think nage basically twists the arm/wrist or something along that line and deflects the blow in a direction, uke having had a blow deflected follows his deflected sword and swings behind/above the head to return with another shomen cut. Repeat process and you got a slightly complicated exrecise.
