This week (the week after the reception) we took holidays and spent most of the time up at Bribie Island in an apartment with Jo's parents John and Denise. Very relaxing, days of reading, crosswords, or watching DVDs with the occasional outing to eat dinner at a restaurant or watch a movie (we saw  Spiderman 2  at the Bribie Island cinema - I think we were the only people in the cinema!). Now, unfortunately, I have to work in the IBM Office in Seattle. We're writing the Certification Exams for the  IBM Certified Sales Specialist - xSeries  certification, which is quite a hard job. The exam is used worldwide to qualify sales people to sell the IBM xSeries servers and ... oh you don't really care about this do you? Anyway .. I'm looking forward to getting back home already. We have our big Bun scan on the 27th. Fingers crossed.
