If I wake up too exhausted too many days in a row, Do I wake up as another person? Am I actually 2 people living my life? I feel as though my life could be pulling in 2 different directions. My reponsible side wants to get full-time employment with MS, while my playful side wants to say F*ck it all, I'm going to work at subway!  Anyway,I used to think I had a lot of posts on here "566"... but now I realize that all those months that I took off from blogging were months where other people were at least blogging once or twice a week :) Good thing this isn't a competition, otherwise I would have lost:P  Note to self: Must update blogger profile to include mulholland drive... also, must sleep, we wouldn't want to wake up tyler:)
