So I booked into one of the local hairdressers at lunch and got my hair cut by a sweet young lass who was 25 and had 4 kids.  How other peoples lives are different then hey?  I managed to get a couple of inches off all 'round.  The verdict is good apaprently.  I've even had a couple of the blokes at work give the thumbs up which I think is more positive than worrying.  I always get annoyed when you ask people if they like your hair and their reply is: "Of course, don't touch a thing, it looks beautiful!!", then when you get a new cut they come out with "Oh thank god you got rid of that trash, you look, like, sooooo much better."  Don't tell me that any of you HAVEN'T been there!!  But it's looking good.  The best compliment I've had so far is that I look 10 years younger.  Well.  i'll take it as a compliment and not as much like an insult.  now I just need to work on losing a touch of weight and I'll just about match my profile photo :- ).
