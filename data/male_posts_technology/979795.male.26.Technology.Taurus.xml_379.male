Don't know if anyone is able to view the chinese characters in this entry.       ,      ,      .     In this world, there is no good and evil, no right and wrong.         ,      .     What we know to be good and evil, exists only in one's state of mind.         ,      .     The reason that you feel troubled, is because you view others' opinions of you to be of great importance.         .    One will be able to be happy if one is able to face his own conscience.         ,      ,      .     Sadness within me, goodness within me, external factors has nothing to do with me.         ,      .     Act with frankness, but ask only for peace of mind.    Yes I know it sounds wee bit profound. Sorry, not meant to be. I can only blame my poor translation skills haha. It makes more sense in chinese.
