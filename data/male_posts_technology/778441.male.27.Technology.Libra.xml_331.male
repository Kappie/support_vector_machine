Two men in jeans accompanied by a woman and a child are the main suspects in yesterday twin blasts that killed 49 people, injured 161 and struck terror in the heart of an already jumpy city.  But Shivnarayan Pandey, driver of taxi, numbered MH-02-R-2007, that was used in the Gateway blast, had  urlLink apparently already sold his taxi seven months ago , according to his relatives. Pandey was supposed to be working in a private company as a driver. Why then was he driving that taxi??  And then... why was a taxi allowed to park in a MCGM (Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai) pay-and-park facility? Taxis aren't allowed to park in these pay-and-park area operated by the BMC.  The police seem to be a confused lot. While Police commissioner, R S Sharma, refused to divulge the names of organizations that may have been behind yesterday's blasts, Joint Commissioner, Dr. Satyapal Singh openly said, " urlLink These blasts are the work of Lashkar-e-Taiba and SIMI (Students Islamic Movement of India. "  The people of Mumbai have, as always, bounced right back, refusing to be cowed down. Whether this is resilience or apathy... one thing is certain. The spirit that keeps Mumbai ticking has not died down. An example of that resilience is the fact that the Sensex, which plumetted 120 points during the day yesterday, after the news of the blasts broke... has bounced back by regaining most of the lost ground. The sensex was 108 points up from yesterday's close at the time I posted this entry.  As a mark of condolence for those who've suffered in the blast, all of us at my workplace shall observe a minute of silence at 3 PM IST.
