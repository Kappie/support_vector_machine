I was speaking to a co-worker today, and they told me that they have been drinking too much as of late, so they didn't want to hang out this evening.  When I asked this person what social activities friends can do that didn't involve drinking or exercise, they could only come up with some gurlie activities (shopping, talking about boys, etc..)!    Think about it....when was the last time one of your buddies called you and asked you over for a tall glass of milk while you watch the game?  When was the last time someone asked you out for a fucken smoothie or an ice cream after a long day of work?  So bloga fuckas, I ask you this.....what the hell is a dood to do when he wants to be social, but not drink?  Where do you go?  What do you do?
