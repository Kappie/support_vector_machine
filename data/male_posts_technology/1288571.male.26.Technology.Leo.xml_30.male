Last night I fell asleep at 11pm and woke up WIDE AWAKE at 2:30am - of course, not without waking up 3 times in that short time span.  I wasn't even remotely tired until 5ish am, at which point I crashed from exhaustion I think.  I had to get up at 7:30am though for work.  If I'm not waking up completely during the night, I wake up many times - enough to not get a restful sleep.  Needless to say I'm irritable and have been in a foul mood for a week and a half.  I'm dead tired and all I want to do is sleep. Help me?
