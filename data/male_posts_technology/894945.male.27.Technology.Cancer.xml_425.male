That’s right people, today is the momentous day when the opposite sexes of the world, both woman and the repressed male, spend copious amounts of money on chocolates, flowers (£135 for a bunch of roses in England!), picture frames and other tokens of love, ahhhhhh! The typical symptoms of Valentines Day are here, the JT network is blocked up, traffic is mad with everyone trying to get home for some nookie (great Limp Bizkit song) before the kids get home from school, even the 11th years are sneaking out of the classroom for a quickie in the school loo (unless things have changed since I was at school which I doubt).  So in reflection, is it all worth the effort??? Today I have spoken to quite a few people on this matter and got the following comments:  a)	‘Yes it’s worth every effort, this is because when two people love each other, there is nothing better then being able to make your partner smile with a meaningful gift.’ b)	‘Yes, and if all goes well there will be a bunk-up for me at the end of the day.’ c)	‘No, it’s all a waste of time and money, I see no point in it, it’s just stupid!’ (I sense a bitter heart there Stu –ED) d)	‘It’s ok if you get a card’  Obviously everyone has a different opinion on this day and whether you enjoy it or not depends very much on if you receive anything or not, this in turn depends on many factors, such as:  a)	If you have the most sexy/handsome features in the office, b)	If you flirt your breasts in front of all the males in the workplace, c)	If all the girls know that you have a ‘King Cock’. Or alternatively, d)	If you have the best personality to be found, e)	If you make another person smile at the mere thought of you, f)	If someone knows you will be there for him or her no matter what. (Ok I’m getting deep now!)  I would have to say that in my opinion, Valentines Day is worth it because I would like to think that ‘LOVE’, and I use this term in the most sincere way, is worth your heart and soul. I cannot think of anything I would rather want then to be able to say, “I love you” to someone. Ok the fact that I’m single and have no one to say it to right now is besides the point, in fact I didn’t actually even get a card (but I am not going to sulk), the fact is that love is worth waiting for!! Last year I was fortunate enough to be in a relationship with someone who I loved, and for Valentines Day I had a patchwork quilt made for her, simply because I knew that’s what she loved. The smile I got back was enough to say it was a result!  Anyway, I am beginning to well up (ok not really), but I believe that the whole effort thing is great and well worth it.  On a quick separate note, a BIG thank you to Toaster, who phoned me up whilst at work just to let me listen to the Valentines Day CD that was being played today at his workplace…cheers mate BAAMMMMM!!  Now I need to put TOTALROCK.COM on and flush that crappy CD from my mind!  Baity signing off……
