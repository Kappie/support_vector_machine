For one, I just bought this book : urlLink HTML Utopia: Designing Without Tables Using CSS .  It looks great, I have been playing more and more with CSS, and I cant believe I didn't know about it (css) earlier.  I downloaded the  urlLink sample chapters , and they look like the best reference I've seen to a great resource.  I am all about layers these days, and presentation from content at that level just seems so clean.  If anyone has any sites that use CSS well, please post them here, so we can all reference them.       urlLink SitePoint  is one of the best examples, although not totally attractive.   urlLink Fedora  is a great example - they jumped in head first.   urlLink Apple  is another good one - although its only partially implemented    Another thing I got in a bit of a scuffle with this week was a debate on a module that is being proposed for PEAR for Internationalization.  Its a port of the  urlLink MakeText  perl CPAN module, which I didnt know existed, but I became totally interested in, perhaps due to my Linguistics background.  Whom amoung you have had to do I18N work in PHP?  Here is the  urlLink proposal , tell me what  you  think.  As an aside, here is my  urlLink post  to the PEAR-DEV mailing list.  As another aside, if you are sneering at the mention of PEAR,  urlLink here  is an interesting thread on why PEAR is not quite right, on the PEAR-DEV list itself.  The other thing I started looking at, stemming from some reading I did a while back on TDD book, I was wondering if anyone knows of anything like  urlLink this  for PHP.  Its a code coverage tool, this one is for Java, to see how much of your code is covered by automated tests.  I cant find anything for PHP, and was thinking of starting an exporatory project to make one.  I have been looking for something interesting to get me to make a PHP .so library, and this looks like it might be a cool project - what do you all think?  There is another tool I cant think of right now that changes each line in your code to see if it breaks a test.  It then tells you how much of your code can be arbitrarily changed without your automated tests letting you know.  If anyone can think of the name of that tool, please let me know.  Lastly, I am starting to use the web testing framework in SimpleTest, so I think I might post a short example howto deal here pretty soon.  I cannot more strongly encourage your use of SimpleTest.
