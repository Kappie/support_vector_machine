That was mostly on the non-elite BBSs I frequented.  By high school, I started to use Takashi000.  If you have ever seen the movie  urlLink Akira , then you might remember Takashi as a character.   If you really remember the movie,  you might realize that Takashi26 would have been a better handle.  Nah, I like zeros.  

I believe it was in my first year of college that I decided a new name was needed.  No longer a big fan of Akira, Takashi000 was retired.  The first couple years of college were some of my least stable.  During this time period, I was quite morbid, and was completely convinced that I would be dead at a young age.  There was little hope.  The only concept of hope that I had was mythical, the idea of being a  urlLink phoenix .  That is the reason behind  urlLink Phoenix26x , my current handle.

That would be the third handle I have grown out of, so maybe I should pick something a bit more permanent.  Here are the possibilities:

MikeBibik: this one shouldn't be hard to figure out.

BibikDotOrg:  why not advertise for the site at the same time?

ChaosTerminal:  ...or just advertise the weblog.

OpenBSoD:  OpenBSD is my favorite server OS, and BSoD is the Windows "Blue Screen of Death".   It's a geek pun, which is fitting for who I have become.

OpenSOB:  along the same lines as the previous.

AccordantDuality:  an artsy fartsy name.

Well, any  urlLink comments ?  Maybe I will slap a poll up later.
