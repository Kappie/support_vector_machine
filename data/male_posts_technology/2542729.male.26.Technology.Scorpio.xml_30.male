Politics exist in every unit...every situation, but the latest revelation has me stunned.  Popular word is, the reason why we don't have 4 day passes is because the battalion commander, his trusty sidekick CSM Norman  some other soldier went to get haircuts @ a civilian barbershop, left their kevlars in the vehicle (which happened to be military) and after this revelation reached mob commander general guy, we no longer have that impending luxury. This news startled, and further, shocked most of us...well...pretty much everybody. It wasn't even so much them takiNG away our two extra days, it was liek so many things in life, the principal! DON'T PUT IT OUT THERE IF YOU NOT SURE YOU CAN OWN UP TO IT!!!  Blessed God we are so different that typical units that get deployed. Plus, we STILL don't have a mission, which means that if we don't find one here, our next command would come from Kuwait. 10 men to a tent in 140 degree weather...  Well, i'm growing agitated again, think its best to sign off for now. Oh yeah I do have some good news... On the weekend of the 3rd, I have some plans for me  lil mama. Somn...seriously entertaining  a genuine display of my love  adoration for my boo. *sigh* i'm sooo in love... There's also the possibility that I could meet the parents. That would be...interesting...in itself. Arite, sign off time, u cats go watch some TV or something...
