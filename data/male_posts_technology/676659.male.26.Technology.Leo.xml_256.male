You guys should have voted for someone na you think deserves to be voted, not for someone who you're thinking would win, on which your vote would have mattered.  As my dad said, wasted vote na sya if you voted for someone who's expected to win.  Pero if you voted for someone na gusto mo gid, despite the fact na he or she's not winning, indi na wasted vote because you know na that person deserved your vote gid.  Goshness, seriousness! Haha! Argh, politics shmolitics! Kagamo gid sang Philippines.  Let's leave it na lang kay Lord.  But asked whom I'm rooting for by this time, it's GMA.  Anyway, ano man, naka random ni sya ang templates?  Coz the last time I visited, it was green, now it's blue/bluegreen.  Hehe.
