Two books in particular are standing out right now. 1)   Twilight Falling   by Paul S. Kemp and  2)   Spellfire   by the great Ed Greenwood  First Twilight:  This book is good and is addictive, man.  I loved it.  It follows the adventures of one Erevis Cale, a former assassin and a Cleric of Mask to boot, as he tries to avenge the murder and invasion of his former employer's estate (where he was a butler).  This is a very good book and will grab hold of you by the balls and never let you go!  I am waiting to get the second book now and I will let you know more about it then.  As for Spellfire I am still reading it.  Get the NEW REVISED EDITION!  You will thank me guys it fills in holes that were left open from the first printing of this book.  I'll  fill ya'll in more once I am finished!  Peace.
