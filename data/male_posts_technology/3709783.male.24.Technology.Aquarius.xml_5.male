Being friends with this person it really shoke me up to hear the news.  At the same time I was torn, for here was a person that was hired from the same consulting firm at the exact same time, he came in at a higher level, making a hefty amount more than me, and obviously there were reasons for firing him.  That all adds up to missing a friend and being excited about what the future holds.  Hopefully I will have the oppurtunity to rise or at least work with someone that is more qualified for the now open position.   We Might see  urlLink FAHRENHEIT 9/11  tomorrow.  Other than that no plans for this 4 day patriotic vacation called 4th of July Weekend.  There are always the fireworks and drunken millions at Navy pier.  Maybe CTA offers free rides the night of, similar to new years?  Showing love to Chicago Transit;  Last year we caught the fireworks from the old #6 whose route consisted of: Leaving Downtown, down Lake Shore, through Hyde Park, along South Shore, and finally meandering into the distant Southside.  No longer in service, parts of the route can still be found alive and well in the new #26 Express route we know and love today.    A  urlLink friend  is spinning house records at a house party, also tomorrow, always a posibiity.
