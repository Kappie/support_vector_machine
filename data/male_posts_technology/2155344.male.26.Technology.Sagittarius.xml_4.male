Then we had some good chinese food and slept like baby. I flew to SB on Thursday. My wonderful company 4YourSoul got a super jillako coconut cake for me ..really yummy. Mohammed was recording the whole thing, I was bit embrassed. Then, I flew back to SFO on Friday. Just relaxed. On saturday, we went and picked up my vehicle. It looks brand new. I was horrified and tensed driving it for the first time after the accident. It was very tough for me. I got over it soon though. Yesterday, we went for a small hike (look for the blue line in the map).     I got lot of gifts from Arvind. Umah.. thanks Arvind.
