Yesterday I took the time to weedeat the yard and clean the house up. I should be getting it in about 2-3 hours. I called my supervisor and informed her I amstill waiting on it and will plug in as soon as I receive it. They are going through a GW upgrade as I write this, so you know they would love me to get into the game. But I cannot yet.   I am in the process of creating a PTA website for our School. I have been selected to be treasurer and my wife is President. Cool eh? I know it will be a royal pain in the a@@ but it will be good for the school and kids. The last year pres-vice pres didnt do much of anything. In fact looking at the past record it hasn't been much of an impact in quite some time. So I am looking forward to making a difference in that regard. I will post the site later when I get it up and going.   The GOP primaries for Oklahoma will be voted on next Tuesday. I will be flying out to Corporate this Saturday so wont be here. I found out I cannot even provide an absentee ballot. I am registered independant. I did this because I do not find myself voting on a specific party, rather on the basis of the candidate. But with Oklahoma law, only registered republicans can vote for the primary republican vote. The same with Democratic primary. But I still can vote on the ballotfor Novembers election. I suspect I will be changing my registery this year to Republican. I am in contact with Tom Coburn's office to at least acquire some signs for his candidacy. Since I cannot vote nor will be here, I figured I can at least put up thesigns, ect in my area to support him that way. I do notsee any signs for him in my town. Tom Coburn's site is located  urlLink here . I been speaking with a Brian Treat out of Muskogee, number is 918-684-4308.   Ihave also started to listen to AMradio talk shows. I find themmore stimulating than the background music I usually listen too and there are some good information coming out of them.
