The problem is, they are all in black and white. What with Alex's wrist problems, he can't spend the time and effort to color the whole strip...let alone hundreds of them that we're planning to make.   We have some really funny ideas though. Some of them poke fun at us, me, or just Alex, but it's all in good taste. We have one where I'm telling Alex about a new game I got and how I think it's the "greatest game I've ever played!" and, of course, he has a tired look on his face. Switch to the next screen, I'm playing the game and have a huge smile on my face. Then it's switches to another screen where I'm showing Alex another game, and now I'm proclaiming that this game is the "greatest game I've ever played!" So it switches to another screen where I'm playing the game, but behind me are hundreds of boxes of games that, of course, I think are the greatest games I've ever played.   It's sort of exaggerated. I really don't think every game I buy is the best one I've played, but I've told Alex about enough games that he remembers which ones I think are really great and stuff. We have so many other comic strip ideas floating around that I have to write them down in an MS Word document in order to keep them fresh in my mind.   I'm thinking we should do tshirts based on the characters as well, but that comes later.
