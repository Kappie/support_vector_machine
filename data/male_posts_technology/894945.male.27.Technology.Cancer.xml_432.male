After watching Monkey on channel 4 at god knows o’clock in the morning, I reached to turn my computer off, proceeding to knock my pint glass full of water forward. Off the computer table, the glass tumbler lived up to its name and tumbled to the ground. Luckily my bare foot broke the fall of the lump of purified sand and it rolled casually off my bruised appendage to rest on the now soggy carpet. I thought to myself, Sod it. If I chuck a towel over it and go to bed, it’ll dry over night. I’m tired and I have a meeting early tomorrow…or later today. Cant think straight. Zzzzzz. The next morning, after rushing into work for the meeting went fine for a Friday, except that I spent the day chasing some payments for only 30 million quid, that were going wrong. By the end of the day, I was knackered. I went home to prepare for the meeting I had in the evening only to find that my keyboard had not survived the downpour the previous knight, and in fact, the ergonomically designed features actually retained sufficient water to re-hydrate the Aral sea! Needles to say that electronic equipment do not normally survive an encounter with that much water (my mobile being the only exception – I’m sure it has nine lives) this left me with the inability to type as only a quarter of my keys worked correctly. Some of them seem to be constantly on and most of them typed two letters for each key press. Exciting. Then came the fact that the Toaster lads were going out on the lash. Without inviting me. Bastards. Saturday was my works New Year Ball (I know its late.) So it had me in a Tux doing a James Bond. Drinks were free, well, Normal drinks. Beer, wine and spirits (in moderation – considering last time had people ordering pints of vodka on the work account) We managed to get four bottles of pink champagne thanks to one person getting a work Vice president to sign for the bill, whilst he was drunk. The rest of the evening was great but not for conversation here :-) Sunday went easy, Woke up in the hotel room to room service, nice. Today Im back in work and I don’t feel like I had a weekend. But not getting invited out was definitely the highlight. Nice that my mates think of me.
