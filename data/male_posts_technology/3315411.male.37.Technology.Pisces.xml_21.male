How'd ya like that?  As the groklaw site maintainer (Pamela Jones) states:  "How do you like them distinguishing themselves from Santa Cruz? Now, when the tax man is calling, they aren't Santa Cruz after all and aren't celebrating their 25th year in the UNIX business? They have that slogan on their web site: "1979 - 2004 Celebrating 25 years of UNIXÂ® Solutions". And SCOForum this year is supposedly about celebrating that anniversary. Whoops! I think they need to rewrite their complaint in the IBM law suit too. Here they've been telling the world they are Santa Cruz, and somebody in India is taking them up on it."  Hah! I just love this :)
