It is sad how this is taking all the current ladies on Raw off and either putting them on Heat or off the air all together, however, the idea for the dodge ball game is a GREAT idea. It will be: Trish Stratus, Molly Holly, Gail Kim, Jazz, Victoria, Nidia, and Stacey vs. The 7 Diva Finalist in Diva Dodgeball. My only hope here is this is some payoff for the fans to see the real Divas wipe the floor with these wannabes. If the WWE feeds their current ladies to these rejects from a wet t-shirt contest, they are out of their minds.  I love the stuff with Eugene / Triple H / William Regal. A lot of people didn't know about the history between Regal and Triple H and it helped to make this more heated. This story has brought the old, vile Triple H out and I LIKE IT. Triple H sends another message to Eugene by beating Regal for the 2nd week in a row. The match this Sunday should be something to see.  A lot of people have frowned on the Kane / Lita / Matt Hardy story arch, and I can see the reason why. We get the classic contract signing, with Matt beating down Kane after the deal is inked. Lita told Matt right before this that the baby is Kane's. This plays right into my idea, follow me here: This Sunday in the match, Matt has Kane beat. Lita comes down and is all excited; jumping up and down. Suddenly, she clutches her stomach and falls over in pain. Matt, concerned for Lita and the baby that isn't even his, starts to head to help her. As he is looking at Lita, Kane rises and defeats Matt. Lita "recovers" and looks on in shock. Kane starts up the ramp, laughing all the way. Lita gets in the ring and start to console Matt. Suddenly, low blow, twist of fate by Lita. She laughs and runs up to Kane and they leave together. It was all a game; the stalking, the deal, even the child, it's all been lies to get back at Matt for what he did to Lita when she came back (recall he dumped her). Comments?  Outstanding match from Edge and Jericho. Too bad they couldn't have this match at SummerSlam...The announcers tried to convince us if the match is this good now, what will it be like when you add Batista. Don't get me wrong, I am starting to like Batista more and more now, but getting a three way to have the pace this match did will be a big challenge.  Rhyno  Tajiri and La RÃ©sistance continued their dance towards each other. Could we see a title match Sunday? Maybe, if there is time on the card (which is pretty full now).  Nice main event with Benoit taking on both Triple H and Orton (Eugene was back at the hotel with Regal after his beating). Benoit would hold his own for a while, but 3/4 of Evolution got the best of him. Eugene came down to make the save and we are treated to Eugene beating the tar out of Ric Flair and Orton as we fade to black.  A solid show, built to promote SummerSlam. Fingers crossed for this Sunday. SS is usually what sets the tone for the fall. Hope for good things.  Later peeps (a little Christian there for ya...God I miss Christian)
