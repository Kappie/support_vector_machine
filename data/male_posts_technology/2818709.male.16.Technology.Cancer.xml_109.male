But that's not the reason of my rant of the moment, the reason for this rant, is because 11-14 year olds of today are all little fuckups. And it's no one's faults but their own damn ingrateful selves. I'm watching some show about 11-14 year old kids talking about sex/truancy/depression/alcochol. WTF?!?!?!?!?? NO. KIDS THAT AGE SHOULD NOT BE DOING THOSE THINGS. CHRIST. Some chick just said "yeah, i first drank when i was in 5th grade. it helps you cut loose." WHAT THE HELL. NO. Kids your age should be eating candy bars, and experiencing sugar highs. WTF. I've only gotten drunk a few times. I'm in 10th grade. I didnt even THINK about alchohol in 5th grade. In 5th grade, I fell out of my desk and slammed my head into the floor. It sucked. That's all i can remember from that year. And that my teacher, mrs. skaggs, was a fat weirdo. Yeah. Earlier in the show, there was an 8th grader that had lost her virginity. NO. just, NO. DO NOT HAVE SEX AT THAT AGE. Jezus. Fuck. Cock. Shit. Ass. Gook. I'm really pissed. And i feel REALLY sheltered. VERY MUCH SO. Why havn't  I  ever experienced this peer pressure? Is it because i've always been smart, and went to different schools? Probably not. *on the show "put words to your tears, what's makin ya sad?"* CHRIST!!! FUCKING SLAP THE LITTLE BITCH. HE'S OUT DRINKING AND HAVING SEX. FOR FUCK'S SAKE. HE'S 12 YEARS OLD. YOU'RE A PISS-POOR PARENT, AND YOU DESERVE TO BE CRUCIFYED FOR YOUR HORRIBLE MISTAKE.  (Btw, i'm very sorry about the lack of proper english/gramatical skills, but...anger.)  [anger]
