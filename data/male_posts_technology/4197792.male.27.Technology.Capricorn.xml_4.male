He explained how they would say the usual, "Too bad it's Monday" and "Thank goodness it's Friday!" lines.  You all know what I'm talking about.  Well, today was slightly different becasue now all those superstitious people out there keep saying "It's Friday the 13th!".  What an annoying line to hear 40 times in one day.  It's not like Jason Vorhees is going to break through the security at your office and start hacking away at people.  You probably didn't wake up with an extra limb or without an existing one.  Your day has probably been the same typical rat race as always only with the phrases involving Friday the 13th thrown in every 5 minutes reminding you that you should have woken up to nothing but bad luck.  Well, Happy Friday the 13th!!!
