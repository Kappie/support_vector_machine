The beach there was pretty cool too and we got to jump from one of the cliffs into the ocean and also do a little snorkeling.  The next day we walked about 20-30 minutes through a dried out lava field to this nice little spot commonly called the fishbowl and went snorkeling there.  Because of the lava, there was lots of cool coral life and fish and what not.  If it weren’t for the damn hangover I had it would have been a lot better.  In hostels it seems that there’s always a party because it’s always somebody’s last night, and the common toast is, “To people like us!”
