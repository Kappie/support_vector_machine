I'll give it a few days to see if the site comes back up, and if not i'll move all the images to another place. So please bare with me while you get lots of little red crosses where a picture should be.  Went out last night with Custard, Baity, Baity's lady and a few peeps from work.. all good fun. I ended up in Follies but I was pretty slaughtered. I even knocked somebody else's Southern Comfort over myself in a rather embarassing  Not-I-haven't-pissed-myself-it's-a-spilt-drink  kind of way, so I decided to make like a tree at about 12:30.  I don't mind though as I'm not headed out much these days. I'm teaching Reiki this weekend so no booze for me tomorrow night.  Maybe I should enter this  urlLink blog  competition...*ponder*...   Oh and a special mention to "Monkey Boy" Parker... who will be leaving my place of work. Remember folks, it's always the quiet ones you should watch out for.
