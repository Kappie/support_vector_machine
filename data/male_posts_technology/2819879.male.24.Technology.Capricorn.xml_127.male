He was right on one thing: sometimes I do argue for the sake of arguement, even I don't fully believe the thing i'm defending for, I'll make myself believe it while arguing it.  Even though, I know very well that whatever I said wouldn't prove or disprove anything at the end.  And honestly, he is wrong on one thing: He said I've changed (in a blaming way, at least that's what i felt). He is wrong because:  (I have to make my points clear, so i list them out)  1. There's no need to blame, of course I've changed, after living out a different life, everyone will change.  People adopt to the environment and it should be a good thing.  One can't blame another just because their value is different.  2. It's not "I've change", even it is, it should be "we've changed".  Because, simply, in his eye, I have changed, and in my eye, he has changed.  3. I really don't think we have changed.  I find Grown up people pretty resistant to change.  And you really can't change a person much just in a couple days or months.  The world around us is different now, but we are still the same.  Anyways, I have to admit that it was my fault today.  Maybe the weary of getting out of this office is really getting on my back.  And... if you are reading this, I am terriblly sorry for ruinning your happy mood.  I wasn't being defencive, it was worse, I was being negative. I know you worked very hard last couple month, and finally it's pay-off time.  I should be, no, I AM happy for you.  However, what I've said was 100% true.  I don't think the chance of getting it is high, but if I can find a job I love and live close to the ones I love... what else would I ever want?  Well, I won't find out until then.  Humans are known to be greedy.  But, until then, that's just what I want... for now.
