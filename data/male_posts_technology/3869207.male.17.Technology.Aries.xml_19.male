Thats probably the highlight of my day :P because other exciting activities of the day included feeding my dentist friend's cat, helping a fellow employee get caught on work the video store, and plinking at pepsi can with a .22.  Oh, but I did watch Hildalgo today, and that was a pretty darn good movie.  Not like the Matrix or anything, but I like horses and cowboys n' stuff and Vergo Mortesomething isn't too bad of an actor.  Now I think I'm gonna go watch Vanilla Sky though, cuz I've never watched it before and I here its kinda messed up good.  So that's all - till next time, live crazy, drive fast and enjoy your last days of freedom before school starts!
