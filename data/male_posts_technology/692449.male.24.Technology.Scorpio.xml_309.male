I've also picked up an extra two shifts at work so that I can get a nice sized paycheck this pay period. Susan's folks are coming into town on Thursday so she's stressed out cleaning and making everything ready for their visit. She also has a test on Thursday in her bio class which sucks because she's going to be working all day at O'neils on St. Patty's day wed so she'll be tired and stressed on Thursday when her test and parents arrive. I wish I could do more to help her. In other news we're going to go spend a weekend up in Colorado on April 10th and 11th( my birthday)  which is going to be very fun.
