Now I'm not talking about my life, I mean us as a society, as a race, as human beings! We need to get back to basics, back to the simple things in life. We are all so lost in making a living that none of us are actually living life. That sounds pretty cliche I know, but ain't it the truth? There are so many cliches which could describe the current state of the world... and one actually starts wondering why they are cliches? Has it become so obvious to us all that we now just ignore it becuase we've heard it all before? I hope not!  So I've heard in certain circles that the end of the world is coming pretty soon... about 8 years from now - 2012. Around the corner... and the best part of this cataclysmic event in the not too distant future is the fact that it will be the worst cleansing yet. Earthquakes, tornados, floods, etc, etc. Which means that only a handful of people will survive! Thank the gods for that!! I love being alive, I love living in this beautiful world... but there is just too much wrong with it to be ignored anymore.  I find peace and solice in the fact the world as we know it is going to end in 2012. It means we can live each day to its fullest and not worry about the consequences. K, so I know there's this movie "The Day after tomorrow" which kinda has all this in it. But being an american flick, they fall horribly short of describing the events which will come to pass. But hey, just so you know, this little post has nothing to do with the movie.   You see, as a society we have no common goal, its just each man / woman for him / herself! Which really bites, cause what are we working towards in the end then? Hmmm? We are headed down the path of destruction at the speed of light... and the darkness is coming up fast. (Thank you!!).  There is no sense of the greater good, only a greater greed, which seems to become worse and worse everyday!   Anyway, I think I'm rambling now, but I think we as a race need to be wiped off this planet... hopefully have a handful survive, to start again... and lets all hope they have the sense not to come down this road again...
