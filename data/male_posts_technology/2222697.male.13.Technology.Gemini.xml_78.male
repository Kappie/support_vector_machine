Fanfiction, fanart, people taking other peoples creations and altering them. Fanart is ok in some ways, but not when the characters are obviously acting different than they are in the real story, or cartoon that they are in.  "I am making this for a fan, by a fan, only to increase the popularity of (insert title here)"  You are, but that is probably considered disrespectful if you toy with the story or characters by the original author.  (eep i have to go, will update lat√òr)
