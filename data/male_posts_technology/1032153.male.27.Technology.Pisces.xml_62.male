Not the labours of my hands Can fulfil Thy law's demands; Could my zeal no respite know, Could my tears for ever flow, All for sin could not atone: Thou must save, and Thou alone.  Nothing in my hand I bring, Simply to Thy Cross I cling; Naked, come to Thee for dress; Helpless, look to Thee for grace; Foul, I to the fountain fly; Wash me, Saviour, or I die.  While I draw this fleeting breath, When mine eyelids close in death, When I saw through tracts unknown,  See Thee on Thy judgement throne, Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee.  Augustus Montague Toplady 1740-1778
