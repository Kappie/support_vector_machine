After that, he moved on, killed his maternal uncle, got married, did 'Gitopadesa' to Arjuna but did not come back to see Yashoda.  Upon asking, he told her that it was all she deserved in that lifetime. But in his subsequent avatar as 'Lord Venkateshwara', she is born as his mother, 'Vakula' and gets to see his marriage.  After that the Lord grants her 'moksha' and since then she has adorned him as a 'tulasi-mala'....  MOTD:  You ask him what you WANT, he grants you what you NEED  Cheers !!
