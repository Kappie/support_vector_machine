We did the olbigatory turkey and trimmings, plus lots of games, listening to the wife play her guitar (note, she's getting really good!).  We got to see my in-laws new dog Scooter, a stray female black lab.  Really friendly, and a ball of energy just waiting to rupture.    Got a new toy tonight, and all I can say is, let it snow!  My dad had a snowblower that he gave us. They made a spur of the moment visit out and brought it out with them.  It's an old John Deere.  If we have the snowfall that they claim we'll get this winter, it'll really be worth having.  The kids already want me to blow the whole yard into a big pile for them to build a huge snowfort out of lol  Friday after thanksgiving. Just mentioning that makes me think of the feeding frenze that goes on at the malls on this day.  I read that the average consumer will spend $672 on presents for Christmas.  I try to make it a point to do the opposite and sit at home.  Malls?  Treat 'em like the plague on this day. Traffic will be unreal, other shoppers will be mean, rude, nasty, and just out sub-human in general.  At least thats how it felt when I worked in retail.    I worked for about 3Â½yrs for a Software Etc.  The pay sucked, but the discount on software and books was well worth it.  At Christmas time, people tended, instead of becoming inbued with the holiday spirit, wanted to tear you a new one because you don't have the green Nintendo 64 controller that they wanted and its ALL YOUR FAULT.  Nothing like being in the spirit of the season and being nice to your fellow humans.  Anyway...     Picked up the Extended edition of The Two Towers on tuesday.  It has 43 minutes of extended/restored footage included directly into the movie. This makes it 243 minutes long.  Thank goodness for the pause feature. My bladders good but not that good.  They really are doing such an incredible job on these movies.  The restored  footage really adds to the movie, and makes you wonder why they were cut except to reduce the over-all length of the flick.  I watched the special feature on Gollum, and all I can say, is  wow , thats just the neatest shit on the face of the earth!  The guy who did Gollum is just incredible. He does the voice perfectly, he does almost all of the actual body movements for the CGI character to replicate, and just all the phsyical stuff he had to go through. His screentest is something else. They said he was hired almost from the get-go based on the screentest. He really got into character and had it nailed almost perfect right away.  This is a must to add to the collection if you like Tolkein.  All I know is I can't wait for the Return of the King to hit the theaters, just to see what happens next (and I've read the books) :)
