It had loads of epic, brilliantly executed and atmospheric action. A simple movie, like all simple, enjoyable movies, it left you wanting more.  Kill Bill 2 was supposed to sate our appetities. Frankly, I was a little dissapointed.  Vol 2 isn't bad - don't get me wrong - but it does't do the original justice. I'd summarise it as drawn out and flat-out boring at times, with some interesting bits and pieces of buttkickery sprawled in here and there to keep you from falling asleep. Good acting performances all-round (particularly Carradine) don't save this movie from turning a great blend of chop-socky kung-fu genius, into another oscar-wannabe overly dramatic bit of ho-hum fare. Even those few fights that take place are completely anti-climactic and compare drastically infavourably to the Crazy-88 Scene from Vol 1.  However, every tale need a finale. If you enjoyed Vol 1, you'll want to see how the story ends, but don't be surprised if you walk out feeling a tad unfulfilled.
