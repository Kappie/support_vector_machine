Or maby its just like putting your footprint on the web.  Some people are very careful about what they say on their blog but some are not, and those who are not may hurt some people but help more people in finding what their life is really about and finding out thet the emotions that they experience are not the only ones like them that there are people who like the same things they do that they feel the same way they do.  Well there is my philosophical moment fot the week
