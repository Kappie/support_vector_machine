And when I came into the server with the wrong tag on (the tag for my other clan) they got all pissed off and complained about how our team was so stacked, and wondering if I was on the roster or not, it was a great feeling know that just because of my 1337-ness, I can piss off an entire opposing team! And after they told us to suck their dicks, and how they were gonna kick our asses....we proceeded to wipe the filthy, blood soaked, spider infested desert floor of Operation Battleax, with their scrotums. After the match they complained about how we were a team of ringers, (damn fine ringers too) and how their starters weren't there. I believe that I was accused of hacking somewhere in the match too, thats always a good feeling, knowing that you're that much better than somebody....  After that, I did my usual routine of sitting on my ass, playing poker, and talking to people online. At around 10 or so, I was talking to one of my friends, Shannon, and she invited one of her friends to the conversation, then another one who I'm friends with also, I was completely overrun by estrogen. Although it wasn't that bad, since we discussed  urlLink eBaums World  for a good hour or so, and it turns out, that when a group of girls talk to each other, they talk a lot like guys do, cussing and yelling and threatening, it was great. And then, the massive pool of estrogen overflowed, and there was a half hour conversation about Neopets (which I, of course, wasn't in). After that, it was back to the normal, rowdy conversation from before, but was cut short because by then, it was past midnight.  After they left, I just sat back, watched some TV, and then listened to some music, that is, until this enormous, gargantuan devil of a moth flew in my window, and touched me...needless to say, he is now rotting in the 7th circle of Hell thanks to a well placed stomping/grinding motion with one of my shoes.  Oh my God, my Mom brought Baked Lays!! Do you people have any idea how much those kick ass?! I know you do Tyler....
