I'm just kind of having one of those bummer times in life when you literally feel angry that life is not what you want it to be at the moment.  I'd give almost anything to be working right now, doing what I love.  And getting paid for it.  But instead I'm dabbling in what I love and getting a degree in a fallback field in case the dabbling never pays off.    Bleh.  *sigh*  I'm fine.  Just had a poopy moment.  But it has passed.
