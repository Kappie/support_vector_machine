I wonder if you will be able to play XBOX Live games.  I don't think you can but that would be cool if you could.  In other news,  urlLink eHarmony  is making a splash with  urlLink this  article.  SO matchmaking is just boiled down to a few equations here and a database over there?  I don't know about that.  I filled out a questionare for eHarmony and it took like 40 minutes.  Shit, comprehensive might be the word but seriously folks, has anyone every tried this shit out and actually stayed in a long lasting and meaningful relationship?  So in more meaningful news, on the front page of  urlLink CNN.com  there's a story about how the US has cracked the secret code of Iran's intelligence agency.  Pretty crazy and I guess there were things leaked that shouldn't have been leaked.  Read on.  That's really all I got for now.  I'm actually looking forward to playing a little RS3 since I didn't play yesterday.  Not to sound like an addict,  SHIT I NEED MY FUCKING FIX!!!
