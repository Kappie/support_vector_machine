Jenny has a birthday on 7th August which I am not here for because of my summer trip. I get to go go-karting! Yippe! Proper helmets and all! Yes I agree Tom, they don't realise how lucky they are. Even if their birthday is in the summer most people are free to go to the cinema or something. Birthdays in Decemember just don't work well. But i am used to it now so I don't bother with my birthday anymore. Its pointless so no need to make a fuss. As much as I would like a surpise party or something it just wouldn't happen. What is everyones plans for the summer then? The induction days are on wed and thurs. Tomorrow I am going shopping in London with my sister. At some point father and I will be going to the war  peace show which I can't wait for. Tom and I have 2 trips planned which should be a blast. Jackie and I will be off to Thorpe Park next week with Ben and Si, yay! That is about it.
