Was there ever any active relationship? How does one get to the point where the TV and movies have replaced the "go out and do things together"-ness of america?  I recall at one point being the slave to the TV. I don't want to be there again. I want to live through my active relationships. I want to be known as the guy that didn't just sit down and watch life go by. He was the guy who was always out doing stuff.  Hello, future life, can I have you today? Peace- T
