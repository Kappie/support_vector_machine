That means that we drank lots, but I think this cold is fucking with me or something because I swear I can't get really drunk anymore. It's kinda sad for me really:( I mean if I get drunk it's for like 5 minutes.  Anyway, I have to drive cliff to issaquah in like 20 to get his car. We decided to car pool back to our house after cliff was drunk. It was cool, we went the speed limit the whole way and didn't have any problems.  I got an email from MS yesterday and they want me to play videogames for them again, to which I'm pretty sure that I'm going to say yes to. I mean it's videogames and room for promotion, whereas this job that I have now is like, no room for growth, but you can put down a kickass job title if you want:P  Well, after drinks, cards and xbox at Erics we came back here and talked with the Kelley, Justin, Amidy, Jebe and Kevin. Which was fun, but we stayed up till 4:30 and now it's 12:12 and I have to drive cliff to his car to get to work on time. He's all hung over:(  But I'm listening to Aqua, so everything is dum de da de da:)  Roses are red, violets are blue, honey is sweet, but not as sweet as you:) -Aqua
