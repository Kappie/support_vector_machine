But the songwriting eventually won me over and the realization that they really aren’t aping B today so much as aping early B, since B has moved on to new sounds its nice to have the old sound back.  “Teenager” and “Suspended from Class” are the immediate stand out tracks and “Books Written for Girls” is a great denunciation of sensitive hipster boys.  Also, is  Underachievers Please Try Harder  not one of the best album titles ever?  If this album keeps growing on me at the pace it has over the last few months, then it may end up at the top of my annual top ten!
