We were all in tears, while the ladies kept a firm upper lip:) Hmmm... role reversal?  Anyway, I'm moving to my new house next weekend. So I need to repack all the shit that I've unpacked, but at least it isn't as much as last time.  So, I'm still going to be lead for my group. I was working on something, but I was overshooting my experience. It was a GREAT experience and I've come away a stronger person. That being said, I'd like to get job offers for my 100 day break. I'll be accepting emails at my  urlLink email   If you're veisiting from malaysia, please have sarahkate email me cause I lost her link and stuff. Thanks  Peace- -T   PS- "hi"
