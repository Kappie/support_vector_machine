Saturday I vegged out for awhile until I went to the Reds.  They were playing the Rockies, but even cooler were the seats we had.  I went with my Uncle who got tickets with a corporate outing.  We had free food the whole game.  Weird was that my 10 year old cousin Adam decided that he needed popcorn, and left the free food area to track some down.  In the end the Reds won and we escaped the rain, so it was a good night.  Sunday I spent cleaning the apartment.  It is amazing how much you can get done when no one else is around.  About 10:00 Jeff invited me up for a rousing game of Great Delmute'.  Okay, okay, it wasn;t the rousing game I have talked it up to be, but I did weird Devon out with my hair.  Ah, I love my hair now.
