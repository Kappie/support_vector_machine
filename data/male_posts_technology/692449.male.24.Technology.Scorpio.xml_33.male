How old are they really, how did they get into porn, are long term relationships diffecult to mantain in the industry etc...  I wish someone would do a really killer documintry of the life of porn stars.  One of those no holds barred deals you know.  I also have a habit of people watching something I picked up from dear old dad who would sit on a bench in the mall for hours just watching.  Working in a restrant gives me plenty of people to watch today for instance: guy comes into the shop sits, girl comes into shop and sits. Guy spills salt shaker on girl. They talk he moves to sit down across from her.  they drink and talk salt still sits on floor because everytime someone tries to clean it up guy and girl say thats alright we'll get it.  They never clean up salt they do leave together and thus become the talk of Il Vicino staff for the better part of an hour. Speculation about the after lunch activities for the two ran the gambit. Point is you never know you might just be the most intresting thing going on.
