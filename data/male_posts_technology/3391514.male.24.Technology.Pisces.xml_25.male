My descriptions were somewhat dry, but the session itself was reasonable.   WoD  also ran yesterday, and a better session than the second as well.  The AWOL player returned, another disappeared, and another was childish as ever.  The core players did well as per usual.  Three problems with my GMing have been highlighted of late:  (1) My descriptions tend to suck, IMO.  I can picture events in my head, but getting them across to others is often tricky. (2) My campaign style is very similar from game to game - often involving the players in hopeless situations but usually winning through. (3) I usually critically underestimate how long it will take players to do things... something I envisage will last a single session can last four or more.  In other news,  The Forever War  is a very interesting book.  For anyone interested in "future war" style novels, I highly recommend it.
