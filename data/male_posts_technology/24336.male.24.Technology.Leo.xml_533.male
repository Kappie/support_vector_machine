Even with a cast of (current, past, future) All-Stars like Yzerman, Federov, Shanahan, Robitaille, Hull, Lidstrom, Chelios and Joseph, we got swept in the first round.  It doesn't matter how good you think the Ducks are, the fact is that we were swept.  None of the games were blowouts, but even that fact is inconsequential.    Since we can't rely on the Lions or the Tigers for championships, I guess it's up to the  urlLink Pistons  now!
