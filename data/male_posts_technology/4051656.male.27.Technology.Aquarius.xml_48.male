The software adds a new "security center" that is intended to provide a beefed-up firewall as well as easy ways to tell whether a PC is updated and protected against viruses.  I'm not sure if this is a necessary step. I currently have the XP firewall disabled, and use my own. I wonder what they mean by "easy ways to tell whether a PC is protected"? Isn't that what the automatic update feature is for? They say they're going to include a pop-up blocker for IE. A little late, don't you think? Those of us who aren't using  urlLink Googles toolbar  have stopped using IE in favor of  urlLink other browsers . Me thinks adding a pop-up blocker is too little too late.
