The money was recovered in a trash bin nearby.  This story raises so many troubling questions: -- Of course, there is a man who is very, very rich by anyone's standards, who feels like he needs to visit strip clubs. I would think girls would not be a problem for such a man. -- And if I had $545,000, I would not leave it in my car at 2:30am in a seedy part of town -- In fact, what the hell does anyone need to be walking around with that much cash? In case he wants to buy a house as an impulse purchase? -- What kind of thief breaks into a car, and then throws away $500,000 in cash that he finds there? So stereos are ok, but cash is too easy to trace?  Ugh.
