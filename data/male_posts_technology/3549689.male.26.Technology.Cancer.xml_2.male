A little exploration got me to  urlLink Haloscan , which provides a free Comment/Trackback service for blogs that don't support them.    Using Haloscan is pretty simple. You Login, and then following their  instructions  for which you'll need to select your blogging tool (in my case, this is Blogger). They give you a set of html tags which you paste into your template at the appropriate locations. You might need to hunt around a bit to find the right place for your template, though.    One thing that I didn't do the default way, was use Haloscan's Comment service. Blog*Spot comes with a comment service which works well enough, and I didn't want to have my comments logged by an external tool when an internal one was available. So I only selected the  Trackback  part of the html that Haloscan provides (the bit after the '|'), and pasted that into my template.    And Voila! I now have trackback.   The Haloscan website also allows you to send Trackback pings to other weblogs. (This is the same as the service I mentioned in  urlLink Trackbacks when your blog tool doesn't support them )    Don't forget to customize your Haloscan account. You can choose the template used for displaying the comments/trackbacks and other stuff. The only pain right now, is that the Time Zone list doesn't include India. There's GMT + 5, and GMT + 6. No GMT + 5:30.    Until I find another cooler Trackback service, or until Blogger starts supporting Trackbacks, I'll be using this one.    Let me know if anyone needs help with adding Trackback to their blog. Editing templates can get quite messy. I'd even recommend copying your template to your local disk before you make changes.
