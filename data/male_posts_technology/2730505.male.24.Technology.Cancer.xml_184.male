Definitely making progress in getting better but not at the same level as these nerds out there.     So I finally got a pic of Porkchop55.  She's cute I like very much.  She's got a cute little kid too!     Okay, so the last time I posted was thursday last week.  Hmm, okay, well Friday, what did I do...Shit I already forgot.  I know I was probably nerding it up on XBOX Live.  Yeah, that's right i was.  I was playing all night Friday and finished off the rest of the margarita mix and tequila from my parents party.  I was definitely feeling good.  Woke up around 2 or something and watched my beloved Cubs rally in the 9th to win against the A's!!!  Fuck yeah, Michael Barret's 2 RBI single to right field scored Walker for the win.  they also won Sunday.     Going on the Cubs tangent here.  Look at their week.  Roger Clemens, Wade Miller, Roy Oswalt, Mark Mulder, Barry Zito.  That was a tough week right there.  On top of that they didn't even have Grudzie and Sosa in the same game till Saturday!!!  Yeah, things are just about to heat up for these Northsiders.  This series against the Cards shouldn't be an exact barometer on how they are doing since Grudzie and Sosa just jumped back in the line up.  With them back, the bench looks even stronger!  Walker, hollandsworth, Goodwin, Macias just to name a few are RESERVES!!!.  That's right, RESERVES!!!  Wow, when everyone on this team gets on the same page it's hard to imagine anyone stopping them.  hopefully they run the table against these Cards and building a lot of momentum going into the Cubs-Sox series this weekend.     Speaking of this weekend, it's the opening Friday of the Taste of Chicago.  So if anyone out there wants to meet up and go visit the Taste let's do it.  Taste runs from the 25th of June till the 4th of July.  There are some great deals at the Taste.  For example, for a nice Lamb Chop dinner it's $15 at the regular restaurant but at the taste, it can be had for $5.  Strips of tickets of eleven are sold at the Taste for 7 dollare I think but it's only $5.50 at Dominicks.  Let me know if you want me to pick some up before the weekend.     New news, my Boss just got XBOX Live and his gamertag is WickedLester67.  He's going retty good according to his  urlLink ">stats .     Sam, purpotedly will be getting XBOX Live soon as well.  I dont know his gamertag.  My damn friends list is getting filled and, not to toot my own horn here, I got a pretty good server and everyone wants to play on my server so sometimes I have to be the bad guy and boot people off to make room for my buddies online.     Well that's about it, I sucks yesterday, fucking hate it!  275 Kills, 256 deaths.  It needs to be like 300:200 or better damn it!     More killing later
