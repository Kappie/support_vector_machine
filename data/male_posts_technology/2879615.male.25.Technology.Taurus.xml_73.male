I'm sooo tired of hearing all these lame excuses for not posting, get with it people, blog! it's gay, but you *know* it's fun.  Not that much going on these days, just the typical binge of something or other each night.  Shout out to our brother Luke down in the foreign land.  Hope you're Espanol is on point lately :-)  We've been planning your triumphant return to dirty Jerz, although we'll be spending most of our time in NY right when you return.  Holla @ 4th of July in NYCezy.  Holla at Uncle Mechi and his lame ass for reading the blog like it's his job and not having the balls to post *anything*.  Props go out to Uncle Mechi's Mom and Grandma for puttin out the other night, your Grandma is soo on point with the head (love it when those dentures come out) :-)  Ah, it's Friday, "you ain't got no job, you ain't got shit to do!"  Rumor has it that we're throwing down at Doug E. Fresh's cribb with the Montville kids.  We'll see if they bring their drinking shoes or not.  North Jerz meets *Central* Jerz, what you want?  On another note any of you bitches that want a Gmail account, holla at me and I'll hook you up.  Those of you not familiar with the gmail, it's Google's email and it's the hottest email account to date.  It's not open to the public yet, but if you want a good username, now's a good time to sign up.  Your tcnj.edu account doesn't last forever bitches.  Beat it, Craig  "Autumnleezy.blogspot.com, 4 in 10 bitches in Dirty Jerz have had their butthole violated at Autumn or one of their affiliates" :-)
