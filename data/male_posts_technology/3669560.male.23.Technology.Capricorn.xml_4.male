There was a very old woman in the yard whose back was at an osteoperotic 90 degree angle. She was on her hands and knees, picking at something. Her hair was in a bun, but most of it had fallen into her face. Her eyes were rheumy and her face was drawn. When she saw us she became really embarrassed. Ignoring the condition of the rest of the house, she said, "My goodness, these weeds."  urlLink
