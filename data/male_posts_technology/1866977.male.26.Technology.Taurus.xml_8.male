My first attempt was to read the message dump generated by WSE Diagonstic filter but could not do it that way as WSE acquires a lock on the files in which messages are dumped. So I was left with no option other than dumping them in the file which will be used by message-frame for its contents. Since I have to put my dump inside the parent tag of Xml document I was bit stingy writing a parser and while looking for a neat way to do it I came across nice tips from Dare Obasanjo  urlLink article on MSDN.  I used the Xml inclusion technique that he mentions and it works great. Basically you view your log (xml file) encapsulated by another which uses DTD to include fragements in log xml file. This was neat and best way to update logs.
