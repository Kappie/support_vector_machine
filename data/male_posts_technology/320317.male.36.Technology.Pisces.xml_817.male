 "Essentially, AirTunes is a method of creating remote speakers for a copy of iTunes, and sending data to those remote speakers via a wireless network." 

 Although this probably is a good idea for most, it's worthless for me as I no longer have a seperate "stereo system". My main desktop computer and it's attached speakers (dare I say digital hub) are now my main "stereo system".
