I will never know for certain how serious my condition is because I forbid myself from visiting any medical professional.  A great man once said that whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger; that may be the reason why I shy away from medicine.  It isn't that I don't respect the members of the medical community it is just that I wish to leave this world as soon as possible, for it is common knowledge that life isn't worth living anyways even if you grow in strength.  So why don't I take my own life? you may ask.  The only answer I could provide for that question is that I am a coward, and fear most every outcome to a decision, so I make a great effort not to make any decisions at all that produce an alternative to the status quo.  This may lead one to believe that I am quite content with the state of the world and that there is nothing to be done to improve the quality of collective life.  Not so!  I simply know that I, like most everyone else, am too feeble of mind to know what decisions would add to the benefit of mankind and which will be a detriment.  This is why I border upon non-existence, because I cherish these earthly things far too greatly to chance loosing them to a capricious whim.
