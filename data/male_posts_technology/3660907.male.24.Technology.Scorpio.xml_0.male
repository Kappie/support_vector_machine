Bush sticks to the beliefs he affirms and maintains   his values and faith in his policies. He actually   does what he says he will do - what a concept!  He knew as much as the Clinton administration and the   intelligence operative told him.  --- Oil! Oil! We are fighting for OIL!!! No - we are fighting to liberate Iraqis - it would be   far far easier, less expensive, and less politically   motivated to drill in ANWAR and build some more   refineries.  Better yet - why don't we kill and skin   all of the caribou or elk or whatever they are - feed   thehomeless and drill all of ANWAR.  We can buid   refineries all around it and save a fortune in   shipping it back and forth to refineries.  We'll    refine it there and ship pump ready to go gasoline   back to the states!  -- He hates the wilderness! He is for all the lumber   companies cutting down all the trees!!   Are you really that stupid? Level all trees and   effectively put themselves out of business?  HAHAHA  LOLOLOLOL - no - they replant trees.   -- He's sending thousands of children to die in war!  No - everyone who signs up for the military knows the   risks and they are very aware of all possibilities.   They are adults and they make that choice of their   own free volition.  Cut the umbilical chord already!
