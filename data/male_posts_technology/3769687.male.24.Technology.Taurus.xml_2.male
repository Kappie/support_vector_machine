If you are expected to set high goals and meet them you are almost guaranteed to achieve more then the person who doesn't have any expectations for themselves. At the same time setting expectations can greatly disappoint you when you don't meet them. Thinking about that I came up with a rule of thumb about the expectations: set expectations only when you can do something about them. If you set expectations that are dependant mostly on other people you are betting your happiness on a roll of dice.
