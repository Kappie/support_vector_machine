But not only am I a comic fan but I think that it might get my left-brained creative feminine side inspired and I'll be able to write some good stuff. I'm using it for lyrics of course - my journal will be here. I had this really messed up dream involving a jacuzzi last night that I will keep to myself but maybe write a song about.  So anyway this journal is a good addition to my plan to act like an arty fag to attract cute punk chicks.
