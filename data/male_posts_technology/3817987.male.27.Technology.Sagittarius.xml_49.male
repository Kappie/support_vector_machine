When I first heard about this I thought it was just a glorified pay-per-view but it turns out to be much more.    Its not just movies. There are TV shows as well and most of the TV shows are free!  And since I get HBO I have free access to all the HBO  On Demand   offerings.  Last night, Headstart and I watched two episodes of  urlLink  Da Ali G Show   and the best part was being able to pause the show in the middle to take a second to converse.   Its not as cool as TiVo but its still pretty nifty.
