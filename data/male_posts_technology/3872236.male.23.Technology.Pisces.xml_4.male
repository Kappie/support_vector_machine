This evening, I will help Erwann to buy a laptop and wifi accessories to make a LAN for his job. then I will running with Christophe and J.M. to prepare for a adventure raid in September.     Yesterday evening, I didn't see  My neighboor Totoro , I chose to see  Rush Hour 2 . I think it is not a good Jacky Chan movie, dialogues are worth and fights are not so beautiful but the spanish federal agent is very cute.
