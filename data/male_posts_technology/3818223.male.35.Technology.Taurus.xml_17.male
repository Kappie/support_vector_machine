After watching it intently the first time, it's a good one to put in when I'm distracted and can only give the TV my partial attention. This kinetic movie is best watched with the original German soundtrack with subtitles. The English dubbing is over-emoted.  - 4 out of 5 stars    urlLink Better Off Dead  - cute, funny, and lightly darkteen romantic comedy,sometimes venturing into the realm of fantasy. - 3 out of 5 stars   urlLink Mad Max  - classic sci-fi film, better than it was intended to be. The DVD version has the original track, complete with the Australian actors' original voices, toned-down music, and understated background effects. Rated R for mostly suggested blood and gore, it would probably garner a PG-13 rating today. - 3.5 out of 5 stars   urlLink The Road Warrior  - more action and less story with this freak-laden sequel, more fun than a realistic view of the future. The real star of the movies, the black V8 Interceptor, met its demise here so I don't know why they bothered with number  urlLink III  or why they're making number  urlLink IV . - 3 out of 5 stars
