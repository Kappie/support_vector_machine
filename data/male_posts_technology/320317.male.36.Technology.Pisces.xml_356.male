Users can connect a Media Center PC, available from Samsung and HP this year, to a television set and home stereo and use a remote to view home videos, music and photos, watch DVD movies, and program Digital Video Recorder (DVR) capabilities through a nice onscreen program guide. And the DVR allows you to watch, pause, and record live TV like you would with a TiVo or Ultimate TV device."

  urlLink   Here are some interesting screen shots and information about Windows XP Media Center Edition. Microsoft is doing everything it can to extend the use of the PC within your home. I think this would be great for the dorm room, especially if you have a ton of MP3s stored on your hard drive. Just sit back and use the remote from a distance to listen to your music as you study or whatever activities that require music when you are in college.
