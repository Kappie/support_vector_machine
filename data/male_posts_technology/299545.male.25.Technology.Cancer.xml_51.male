Barrel of Monkeys 2. Tracer Gun (I concur with seeing them in the grocery store and never being allowed to get it. Yay of having both my eyes!) 3. View-Master (I had the red one, and remember looking through it constantly) 4. Simon (Played with the Birch kids, and we broke it a few times by getting a little to liberal with our hits) 5. Care Bears (I never had one, but I am sad to say I watched the cartoon) 6. Magic 8 Ball (I still have one around somewhere) 7. Etch-a-sketch (never very good at drawing anything but strange geometric patterns on this) 8. Slinky (many many trips down the stairs of various houses) 9. Mr. Potato Head   ...and so on and so forth...
