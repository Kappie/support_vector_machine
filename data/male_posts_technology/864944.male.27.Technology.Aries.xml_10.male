I picked up some new unfinished furniture (small tables and such for the living room) and painted more on Sunady.   Oh.. and I saw the Patriots lose their all wins record :(     I also spent some time tonight organizing all the pictures I took of the Mt Washington hike, the painting of the living room, and some random shots I took of our cat :)  It turns out Photoshop has a sweet auto-gallery maker, and I took full advantage of it.
