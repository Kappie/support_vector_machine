We have discovered a huge   urlLink  Bald-faced Hornet    nest on our house. We will have to wait for the winter to deal with that one. The garden and the flowers have been transplanted and should do well. We have had a cool summer and that will help. We have met most of the neighbors and they are great. Quite the variety, lots ok kids. Katrine and Ziazan will have many new friends.     We get to see Grandma Nicole more often. The street is quiet and not many cars. I have a bit of a longer walk to get the bus, but I could lose some weight. I have started to fix up the mountain bike and will soon bike to work. I am looking forward to that. I have to get the rear wheel done tonight. Monday I hope to bike in.
