I have a little COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) that springs up in the winter time.  Basically, I have a little difficulty breathing sometimes.  Especially during the winter.  It makes me cough, and I just get worn down from coughing so much.    Anyways, I started working out again, and I'm really pumped.  This is my workout for right now.  I'll change it each week or so.  1. 35 minutes cardio on the elliptical.  My favorite routine is the random, which randomly changes the resistance each 3.5 minutes.   2. 3 sets of 15 dumbbell extensions from the bench. 3. 3 sets of 15 dumbbell fly's from the bench. 4. 50 situps from the lat bench with a 10 lb. Weight.    I need to loose a few pounds, but I hope to replace that with muscle.  I weigh 205 right now, and I wouldn't mind gaining a few pounds.  My body fat scale says I'm 20% body fat.  I would like to drop that down to 12%. I'm feeling most of the workouts in my upper arms and chest.
