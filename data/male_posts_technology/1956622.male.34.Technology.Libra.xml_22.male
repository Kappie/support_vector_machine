Even went so far as to run through the sprinklers (they live on a golf course) at 1 in the morning on the 14th hole of a local golf course.  I called Karissa this morning and apparently she "ate too much fruit" and is having a tummy ache this morning.  So much so that she did not say much to me at all but had enough time to hang up on me 2 times in less then 5 minutes.  I would not be suprised if the   X   taught her that one.  Of course she will deny it but how do I know anyway.  The   X   has proven she is not above being a   LIAR   too.  I know some would say that this statement could be classified as libel.  However, since I have proof of her being with other men after she said she was not. Since she has openly admitted going to Michigan after saying she was in AZ when she left here obviously that was a lie so if she should ever happen to see this then she can be comforted in knowing that everything that has been stated here is true and just to the best of my knowledge!  I will try Karissa later.  I am sure it will meet with the same results. I think I am just a voice on the phone anymore.
