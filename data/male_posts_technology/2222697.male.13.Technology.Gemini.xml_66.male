Really I will never like fanfiction more than the real thing, and I don't think anyone will.  I have been looking around and On fanfiction.net i found a thing that says some authors will not allow fanfiction based on their work allowed on the site, so yay them.  I still don't like the yaoi/yuri fics out there, practically ruining a story.  but there is non-gay fanfics out there, so Zell proposed to me that we make a fanfiction site in our fandom section. I haven't up loaded the new site yet because angelfire is broken...again.  I have a new staff page I want to put up, also to link to my writing and zell''s fandom fettish site (that I have to make...)  well, I'm out.
