Good thing is we have been able to come with the design of the initial requirements and now comes the approval and after that implementation. Since three days I am listening to EP - Rahguzar and its on constant repeat, at times I get bored of it and close down my winamp but after a while play it again. I think it is the combination of music, vocals and lyrics.  There are threats of terrorist attacks on Mosques and Imam Barghasduring jumma time, May Allah keep us all safe and protect us from such acts Ameen.  Adios
