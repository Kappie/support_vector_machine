Average annual income in the United States of America: US$34,280 Average annual income in Japan: US$35,610 Average annual income in the United Kingdom: US$25,120  Bastards.  I just watched a really good movie called 'Live From Baghdad' about the CNN news team in the first Gulf War; a really interesting and quite amazing movie, it's around on TV at the moment, look out for it, it's worth it. On the subject of Baghdad; Nicki, for my Christmas/birthday present got me The Baghdad Blog by Salam Pax, who wrote about the war from the city last year. I never read it online, but the book is great. Also I got a rather interesting book about the Matrix; my brain can't cope with too many books at one time, so I'll tell you more about it when I start reading it. So thanks Nicki!  I'm going to find some ice cream, and perhaps eat it.
