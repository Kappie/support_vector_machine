Basically I told her I would be there tomorrow and that was about all I had signal for.    But since that story is short let me tell you about the Bus Service in this country!  My problems with the bus service started with ordering the tickets.  I have come to the conclusion that it is no wonder why people choose to fly.  I have never been treated with the disrespect and lack of regard for me as a customer like i have been by the bus system.  In fact I plan on writing a letter to someone over there at the bus company and if you know me I don't write letters very often!  They sell tickets with no idea how many people are on the bus or will be on the bus.  They are rude, I had one driver actually cuss at me, overall if I was grading it I would give it an F as they lack any regard for the customer at all.  Basically I wrote this during a stop at a truck stop, on a bus I was never supposed to be on!  Thanks to the oversale of tickets I am headed to Louisville KY! A destination I was never intended to go to.  But I am hoping to catch the Detroit bus there so I can make Karissa's B-day party on time.  All I can say is I would like to thank Greyhound for crappy service and   SFW   for making this whole thing possible!
