The thing wasn't even a year old and is probably still in warranty but I don't want to have to mess with all that kinda stuff.  The one I had was a Toshiba and now I have a Motorola.  It seems to be working quite well so far.  I am still peeved, though, over my netgear router.  This one was given to me, but I will never by anything netgear ever.  It has been a long time with the problems and they could be fixed with the correct software on the router, but netgear is dragging their feet.    Anyway, it is kinda strange trying to adjust to Lubbock again.  I still have not heard anything from the tech job that I interviewed for.  I was hoping he would reply to the email that I sent today.  Anyway, I need to get on to some other computing things.  I finally fixed my primary linux computer and it was all user error related problems.  I had a cable in the wrong way.  Anyway, I would like to finish this website for the clinical department.  Have a goodn'.
