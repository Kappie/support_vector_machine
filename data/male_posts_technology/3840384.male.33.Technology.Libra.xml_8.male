Is Heather there?" and by the sound of his voice he was clearly drunk. But there has not been a Heather in my bed since Britney was a mouseketeer, so I am reasonably certain it was a wrong number (the original Heather, no one knew was with me at the time, anyway). So I said no....   I did not even get to finish my sentence by saying "there is no Heather here" before he got really pissed, so I decided to have a little fun with him (this is a routine I have done before, to deal with late night callers looking for 'Sheila' and 'Carolyn' in the past). I explained that she could not come to the phone as she was busy. He decided to get more abusive and threatened to hurt somebody if I did not put her on the phone. So I was forced to explain to him that Heather was busy dealing with some oral gratification issues with me and I was not willing to stop her until she reached a normal stopping point. At this point, he said "Well f*** you, mister!" and hung up.   I swear I was about to tell him the truth but he never gave me the chance. I was going to call him back since I had the number on my cell but I figure it was better to let sleeping dogs bury their own dead so I did not bother. He probably forgot all about it with the hangover he must have woken up with, anyway.   The big question is - does it make me evil if the thought of calling him up next week at 3:00am and asking if Heather is there makes me laugh uncontrollably? I hope not, as I am severely tempted to do it....
