Shortly after that, I came across Jivha's post on '  urlLink Does Arranged Marriage matter? '.  'Love Marriage' versus 'Arranged Marriage' is a topic that has been debated,  ad nauseam , in the blogging world. With fierce and eloquent proponents on either side, no side has had the last word in the debate and no one ever will!  I have my views and I shall reserve them for a rainy day! ;-)  And then... continuing with the theme of marriages, they're having  urlLink 12,000 marriages in Delhi  alone, today!!  Holy Matrimony!! ( I felt this was much more apt as compared to the usual cry of "Holy Cow!!" ) The mind boggles seeing this figure!!
