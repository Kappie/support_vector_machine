The weirdest for me is "Sweet Blindness" which all about getting so fucked up on moonshine you go blind.  What the fuck?  Anyway here are the lyrics.  But it really should be heard to be believed.  If you are interested in hearing it let me know and ill try to hook you up.   Sweet Blindness   (Music and lyrics by Laura Nyro)   Down by the grapevine Drink my daddy's wine, get happy  Down by the grapevine Drink my daddy's wine, get happy Happy, oh sweet blindness, a little magic A little kindness, oh sweet blindness All over me, four leaves on a clover I'm just a bit of a shade hungover Come on baby do a slow float You're a good lookin' riverboat And ain't that sweet eyed blindness good to me  Down by the grapevine Drink my daddy's wine, good mornin' Down by the grapevine  Drink my daddy's wine, good mornin Mornin', oh sweet blindness A little magic, a little kindness Oh sweet blindness all over me Please don't tell my mother  I'm a saloon and a moonshine lover Come on baby do a slow float You're a good lookin' riverboat And ain't that sweet eyed blindness good to me  (Don't ask me cause I) Ain't gonna tell you what I've been drinkin' Ain't gonna tell you what I've been drinkin' Ain't gonna tell you what I've been drinkin' Wine, of wonder, wonder (by the way) Sweet blindness, a little magic A little kindness oh sweet blindness all over m Don't let daddy hear it  He don't believe in the gin mill spirit Come on baby do a slow float You're a good lookin' riverboat  And ain't that sweet eyed blindness good to me, good to me And ain't that sweet eyed blindness good to me,
