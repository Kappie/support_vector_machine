But they run on a Wednesday and Thursday respectively. The Carriage in Jezzer is supposed to have one tonight, and an "Advanced" Quiz tomorrow. Does anyone know of any more quality Quiz action for a Tuesday...? And please don't say there's one in "The Raby"... I've been barred from there for fighting. Yaaaaar!    Pub reviews courtesy of  urlLink www.theburglarsdog.co.uk . All it needs is a Pub Quiz Review section and we'd be laughing!
