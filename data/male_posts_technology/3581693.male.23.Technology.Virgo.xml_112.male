Uncle Frank "Your Aunt has been viewing her e-mails with the oldest ones on top - so I suggested we change that so the new ones are on top and the ones from last October are on the bottom. She thought this was a great idea. Viewing the oldest ones on top is stupid really."  Aunty Annette "Yes - and now he's broken it. I don't know what he's done to my e-mails. They seem to be all over the place. Now I can't find ANY of them."  Dad (Brian) "I think I saw one of your e-mails in my car port."
