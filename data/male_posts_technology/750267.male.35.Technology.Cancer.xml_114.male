I'm the type of person who stays up until 4am if he doesn't have to wake up the next day, and there have been a few days lately (like today) where I have no early appointments and I can sleep in.  The only problem is, the phone rings at 9:00am. That, in and of itself would not be a problem, because I can answer the phone and usually fall back asleep. But then the phone rings again at 10:00am, and after that, I'm up for good. So 6 hours of sleep will have to do today.
