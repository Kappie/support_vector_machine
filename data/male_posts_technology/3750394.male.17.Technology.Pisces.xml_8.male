This is a good thing in the fact that I guess it gives me something to do for the day, on the down side, its gonna be a bitch of a computer to fix :@, but hey, I like a challenge every so often.  I have to work there at 4 this afternoon, so... 3-4 hrs to fix the computer, so I should be home by 7 or 8, which would be nice, then I have the rest of the night off to do whatever :P.
