For the first time in a long while I will be shopping for someone else besides myself.  I think a list is in order.  Kinda a list, I don't want to be too organized... half the fun of shopping for food is the suprise.  Maybe I should just do minimal shopping.  I mean rachel is coming in a little over two weeks; I should go with her to the store for the food she wants.  Sometimes... I get sooooo excited I want everything to be perfect.  As Domino would say.... Purrrrrrr-fect
