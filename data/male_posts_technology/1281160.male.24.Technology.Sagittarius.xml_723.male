So thought will inform, once i go in full swing, but then since u people have found it out, i now declare it to u all!  urlLink Flowers for you ! Thanx for ur comments. All of you do pay a visit and let me know ur opinion too. i will provide a contact link thru which u can communicate with me too. Its not yet fully developed and i need to add some more stuff to the blog.   Actually, i took this as an exercise to post about a flower, everyweek to a group of people and at the same time, i used to update this blog also. but then since i had some work, i just couldnot continue doing so, this month. And since u people find it interesting, i will notify u all when updated. It will b usually friday of every week.   Apart from this, i do am maintaining another blog, which contains some great works in English literature and some interesting articles regarding them. They are in the blog  urlLink Elite-essays  . I have talked about this blog before too. When time permits do pay a visit to this blog. There is an article about the poem The Wasteland in this blog, which is much relevant to what is being discussed these days in our blog. In the poem  The Waste Land , the poet  T.S.Eliot  has long time back talked about the complexities and problems of Modern world.    Here are few lines from the essay on wasteland    As there could be no vegetation in a wasteland there is no sense of fulfillment in the modern world. In this modern world man-woman relationship has degenerated to the level of animality. Spiritual grace should come like rains and revive the moral life on this earth. This religious theme has inspired Eliot to write  The waste land .   Interstingly he has also given solution to such problems and amazingly its taken from Brahadaranyaka Upanishad ! Isnt it interesting?  Modernisation backed by technology is not a problem which is identified today but then long time back and a vivid solution to all such things were also proposed by eminent writers to be followed by all! But are we aware of such things and are we following it if we are aware is what is to be paid attention now. Coz to learn from other's experience(if one is worthy) is wise than to wait for one's own experience.
