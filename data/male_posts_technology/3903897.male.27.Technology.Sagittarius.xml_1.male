I don't know if I'll get the job, but at least I have an interview!  That's progress at least.    In other news, I was too sick to hang out w/my friends the other day :-( , but I'm feeling better now.    *gasp*  I don't know what I'll do with myself if I actually get a job in the 30-43k range!  I might explode!  :-)   Parrrrty!
