So got up right then and there and pledged my allegiance to all the kittens of the world.  Later that night I found my self down at the local pub having no luck. Wishing my pledge had never been spoke into existence. I decided the best thing was to go hoggin'. So I found the biggest most fat lady at the bar and took her out to the country. I told her all the things I wanted to do to her in the pasture under the stars.  After all that I left her out there and headed home. Ahh, what a feeling. Not having to worry about my friends finding out what I had done, but wait...There was one of my friends walking on the side of the road. I stopped to ask what he was doing out here and told him to climb in.  His response was simply a hoggin' gone bad. Turns out his big girl new the scam and left him out in the middle of no where. Guess what comes around goes around. So the conversation turned to me and I decided I could tell him the truth. Well needless to say we had a good laugh and no little kittens got killed.  Thank God...
