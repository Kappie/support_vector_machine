I'm gonna:   Read 3 books  Drink 100 jack and cokes  run 50 miles  swim 10 miles  kickbox for 10 hours  hang out with jim at least 5 times  spend at least $300 at boswells  goto LA at least 1 time to see my lil brother  watch no less then 3 movies  hang out with pants so much that she wishes i worked more  take at least 1 dare  sustain at least 1 injury  forget at least 2 days   This is gonna be good. Let me know if you want any part in it. A good criminal is always looking for accomplices.
