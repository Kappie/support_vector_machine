My PL gave me his Laptop to load the ppts to take to the conferance room. I've never touched a laptop until today and here I was struggling to roll my finger over, to move the mouse-cursor. Though presentations are nothing new to any of us, this audience was different... In our class, I could bluff anything about technology and seem smart and get away with that. But here, people know a hell lot more than me... about all I talk...  But they acted within my limitations. And, of course, my PL was there to rescue me whenever I showed any slightest hint of doubt in answering something.   The presentation went on for about 1 hr and 40 mins including the Q time. At the end of it all, I got the same feedback that I got during my MS(IT) presentations - Talking too fast....!!!  Guess, I need to do more mending on my "express speaking" ways...   Overall, it was a very satisfying presentation for me. And furthermore, the white paper that I've prepared (and which, the presenatation was all about)... is gone for a review. Once it is done then my first white paper will be released across infy.
