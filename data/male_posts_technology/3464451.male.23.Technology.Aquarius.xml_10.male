I have been busy at work and hanging out with my father.  He and my mother got divorced a couple of years ago and I didn't want to talk to him because of that.. I was very upset with him but I moved on a couple of months ago and I have been going to see him about once every couple of weeks.  I ain't rich!! I can't drive an hour to see him all the time!!!  :)  But, I do miss him and his family as well!! I got a lot of sun and if my little webcam worked better, I would post pictures of my tan...  everyone told me my face has been all red and was like what did you do, go to the tanning bed? I was like me, I don't think so!!! I already have a natural tan, why would I go??? they were like...  we don't know....  what do you think? can I leave? do you want me to stay.... stay she says... stay.... why... You smash my heart, you break my pride you hurt my soul, you crush my body... my mind... over and over again...  why can't I see it....   Why can't I ...  let me comfort you baby.... she exclaims as she wraps her arms around me....  same thing...  over and over and over... and over again...  comfort me... hurt me...  crush me.. lift me... break my spirit...  life me higher then before and just...  just... leave me alone!!!  walk away...  stay gone... can't I go now?? let me be...  just... just.... stop hurting me... my heart.. can't... take... it... just... stop it... can't you see...  hurt... pain... torture...  just... let.me.go.
