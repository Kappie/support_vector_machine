This week for me has contained good and bad days, so overall it was a boreing week, lots of reminders to do things i should have done 5 weeks ago. Is it me or is every teacher in the school currently having a go at 6th form classes??? Grrrrrr makes me angry, and then this morning i walk into school and who is waiting for me at the door, that lovly lady, Miss SHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just waiting to pounce on me and have a go for missing her lesson, grrrr. Anyway a nice long weekend to follow. I want to propose a rule that no one does any school related work on bank holiday Monday? anyone with me? Well i am sorry this isnt very exciting today, talk to you all soon, have a briliant long weekend. Oh the life moto thing,  'Expect the best, but prepare for the worst' Dave
