I have been toying with clever ways to say something about usability or UCD.  But it finally hit me today.  "It's not about us-ability, it's about you-sability."  Clever!  Consice!  And it becomes trite the more you say it!  Perfect!  So when I finally create Designers Without Borders, and initiate the full power of my dot-org status, I will denounce the current tag line of "Usability does work.  Probably."  It's not about us-ability, it's about you-sability.  (Patent pending.  Patent pending.  Patent pending.)
