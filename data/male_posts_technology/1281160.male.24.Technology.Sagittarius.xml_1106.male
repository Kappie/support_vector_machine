I reached Bangalore at 9AM today morning... 2 hrs behind schedule.. and reached office just in time for lunch... the bus travel y'day was the best one could ever hope for... I felt I was travelling in a rocket... in fact, even better... even a rocket wouldn't have trembled that much... nor would it have been so noisy.. that bus provided a feel of both... Even though it was an AC Sleeper bus, in theory, it was a typical Govt bus in reality...   Sometimes, I wonder if handing over the entire roadways to private players would make more passenger-sense...
