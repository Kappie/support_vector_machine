I had pegged this site many years ago before it went commercial and Roger was way down the list but over time I learned that his reviews were very close to my own tastes.  He is appears to rate based on Film quality (in relation to the whole package like acting, sound, editing, etc) and originality of ideas so he will rate a whole range of genre on this basis rather than his preference of subject or audience.  I think my tastes are similarly classed - normally I will prefer a movie that makes me think and has some original ideas. I would also prefer that it is well filmed and produced although in some cases this is not mandatory e.g. Blair Witch is a good example where the amature nature of the productiton added to the effect realism. Blair Witch's appeal was it's originality and it broke established film making rules or invented new ones.
