 I was once told by a Taoist monk that to protect one's eyes from strain, it is helpful to look at green.  I'm thinking that this blog is not what he was talking about. 

 I haven't been posting in this blog often enough over the past two days, because for the first week in a long time, I haven't been sitting in front of my computer all day.  That isn't to say that I've been feeling better, I just have things to do.  Today I need to do a little shopping, but right now I'm waiting for my breakfast to settle. 

 This morning I had a whole cup of soy yogurt, and a few jelly beans.  The jelly beans were left over from watching a movie last night and I wanted to get rid of them so I would stop eating them.  I know, it's flawed logic.  The soy yogurt was peach and so far my least favorite flavor.  My stomach is clenched right now and I'm swallowing often because I cant get the feeling of food to leave my throat. The ever-present belching is, of course, ever-present and I could swear that I feel my intestines backing things up every so often; it makes me a little nauseous.  I was planning to leave in 15 minutes, but I think I'll wait a bit longer for my breakfast to settle. 

 Before I left my bed today, I had a bout with stomach pain that I tried to remedy by drinking a little water. Today my body is still sore from the exercise I did on Wednesday.  That isn't normal.  I could understand being sore for 3 days if I had really worked myself hard, but I hadn't.  My nutrition is definitely poor.
