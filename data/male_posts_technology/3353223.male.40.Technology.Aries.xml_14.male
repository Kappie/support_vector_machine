The front passenger-side mirror is covered in scratches,  presumablby from when the hide the car at night so they could ride in it the  next day. The number of scratches on the passenger-side door has increased  significantly. The steering wheel has been damaged; it now has a nick in it  which wasn't there before. This nick is an imperfection which makes the  whole thing feel  awful. Also, they have re-keyed the car. Now I have a  piece of bare metal as a key instead of a nice chunky Subaru key.  On the positive side ... the car sounds and performs ok; but, I have an  untrained ear so what do I know?  Seems to me that the negatives outweigh the positivies.  _________________________________________________________________ ThereÂ’s never been a better time to get Xtra JetStream @   http://xtra.co.nz/jetstream
