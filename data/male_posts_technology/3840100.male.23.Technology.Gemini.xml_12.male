Between going from party to party and a wedding there hasn't been much time to be in the studio much to complete work on the Off the Deep End release.  I'm hoping to get back to wrap up that album since its release is now overdue by a year about.  It would be nice to release that and prepare for the next album.  Off the Deep End has actually been a finished product since the beginning of September in 2003.   Due to business and other obligations the project has been patiently waiting for its release date.  The Third Rail songs are coming along now.  The lead vocals are done and now we are just waiting to complete the backing vocals.  I may also redo the bass on all the songs since I am extremely anal and I don't like the way it's sounding at the moment.  Since tomorrow is a practice day we should be able to complete most if not all of the backing vocals and start up the final mixing process.
