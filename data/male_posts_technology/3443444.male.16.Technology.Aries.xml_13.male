Well today, at roughly 10:58 PM, I discovered that it wasn't in my pocket like it always has been. And its nowhere in my room, or the living room where I was just sitting. My only guess is that is in the Dentist Office's chair I was in on Thursday. That little thing was like my life, I don't know how me, or James lived without it. I am so sad. that thing was like my pet. I would occasionally pet it for no reason....I've said too much. Oh my! Moving on Swiftly, there are somewhere around 4 days of school left. Yay. The down side? I have like 354562 tests to make up from classes I've missed. But hopefully, during the summmer I'll get an internship with HP, that would be the highlight of my life if that happened. That's all I have to say about that.
