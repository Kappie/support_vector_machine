Yeah, you're right, there's not much to imagine. Told you I didn't expect anyone to read this. So onto today's dribble (I like that word for some reason)  After much aggravation, some wheeling and dealing, and a shit load of patience and tolerance, I'm home. Well, home enough to make it official. I'm finally in the purty land of Austin. Right now I'm staying with friends who I used to live with back when I lived here, just over 3 years ago. In that time, they've managed to buy a house, get another dog (long story with the first one), another cat, and a kid. Now, if you know anything about my friend, you'd be shocked and amazed that he would be married...let alone have a kid. But here he is, doing his part to add to the immensely growing number of soccer-moms (or dads in this case) in this world. But don't get me wrong. I'm not doggin' him for it. It's his life and he's free to live it how he pleases. But it just makes me realize that I am sooooo not ready for that yet. Mind you, I don't live (or have ever live) the "typical" single guy life. I've never had the joy of trying to remember who it is that's lying next to me on any given morning. And other various "single guy" things. But as I said, I realize now that I'm not ready for the mamma and pappa bear lifestyle. That is to say, if I'd ever be ready for it again (yet an even longer story).  So here I sit, in their house, while they're asleep at 10pm on a Friday night. And since I don't feel right going out and partying or drinking or hanging out a bar/club while I'm living with them, I sit here...wide awake...and itchin' to do something. And plus, I don't have a key for the front door so I kinda have a curfew in a round about sense. I'm pretty sure they wouldn't be too appreciative of me, banging on their door at 2am wanting back in the house. As I said, they already have another dog.  But hopefully, I'll be outta their hair here (small tongue twister for 'ya) fairly soon. I'm scheduled for a third interview for what sounds like a great job next week and basically it comes down to the team I'd be working with liking me more than anyone else they've interviewed. Should hear something back on that fairly soon. Then I can get my own place, get my new car, and start pushing through life once again. And this time, I'll be taking this town down on my terms. That's the nice thing about being single. If I don't feel like grocery shopping cause I'm outta food, I can always run down to some random food place and grab a bite to eat. Or a million other things that I feel like/not feel like doing and don't have to check with anyone else to see if it's cool or whatnot. But like everything, being single has it's drawbacks. Just the way life is.  So I'll close with this. How do they cram all that graham? Small shout out to someone from my past that I still think about from time to time...even though I know I probably shouldn't. *sigh* Ok, enough reminiscing.  Onward to Valhalla!!!!!
