She's really cute, and awesome to be around. Unfortunately, she has to go away. She inspires me to be more than I am. When I think about her, it makes me want to be a better man. It makes me feel like I've been floating with the current and nothing has challenged me in a long time, nor have I challenged myself.  What do all people want? To fall in love with someone, and have that person fall in love with them. Unfortunately then the inevitable happens. Life doesn't end or stand still, it just gets annoying. You never see the "13 years later" in the movies. He's devoted himself to a job that he hates because they have a house they can't afford and she's banging the milk man, since he's at the house more often than her husband. I believe the reason that Romeo  Juliet is such a great love story is because they don't live long enough to fall out of love.  My ideal candidate for girlfriend: able to travel up for anything cute not hampered by prejudice not hampered by fear  Am I cynical, a realist, or a dreamer? I think a bit of all of these things rolled into a complex little mammal that wishes to procreate:)  Today I write to the blackhole of the internet, not knowing if anyone is reading...  If you're out there and you're reading this, please email me and tell me hi... peace-
