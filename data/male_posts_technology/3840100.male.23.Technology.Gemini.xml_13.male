I guess  urlLink Rooftop Suicide Club  may need a filler.  That would be very cool.  We'll see what happens with that.  I am continuing to work on the release of  Off the Deep End .  Also on the side I have been recording the next album which is mostly written and just waiting to be recorded.  I'm not going to talk about that much since OTDE isn't even out yet.     For your enjoyment here is a recent picture of me in the studio.  YES, I did shave my head!!  Other than that there isn't much happening.  I have been visited by old ghosts of old relationships lately, but that is as far as that part of the conversation is going.  Especially now that Off the Deep End is coming out there is no need for ultra dark music from me anymore.  So anything depressing isn't making it to my albums from here on out.  We'll see how long I stick to that one!!!
