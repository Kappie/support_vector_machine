The part that got my feathers ruffled was:    A New York Times report suggests that up to 50 people have died after police used tasers during arrests. Amnesty International is calling for an outright ban of the weapons.  Would they rather the police shoot the suspect? Just another example of our society heading the way of "The Demolition Man" where the police use "glow rods" and are really a bunch of pussies.   Kinda on this subject...why is it illegal for me to own a taser in Michigan? Or more specifically, why is it a FELONY? Police can have them, why can't I? They walk the same streets I do.   "Be well"
