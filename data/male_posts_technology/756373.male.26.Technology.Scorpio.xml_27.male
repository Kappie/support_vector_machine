"You whitebread/redneck" "Redksin!" "Bloody woman!" etcetera.  I can understand insults like "You dumb asshole" etcetera, but what's the point of calling someone something they clearly  are ? Like, should I take offense for someone calling me a fat white boy? I suppose I would, but WHY? I  am  a fat white boy. It would be like someone blikseming (beating up) someone else for saying "You damn human being you!". Following this train of thought - would a black man take offense for being called a 'nigger'? Damn straight. But why? 'Nigger' is derived from 'Nigerian',  Nigeria being where 90% of the slaves came from that make up todays US black population. So, in effect, calling an American black person a 'nigger' is akin to calling him a Nigerian. Or, for that matter, an African American. There is no difference. Saying "Hi there African American person" theoretically is no different to saying "Hey nigger."  Words, or names, can evolve and be twisted to mean something they aren't meant to. It's quite damned ridiculous. In fact, that so many of our African black compadres still get all pissy at any mention of the word 'kaffir' (derived from the latin Cafur, which means 'resident of Africa' or somesuch) indicates that they all very much suffer from massive inferiority complexes or something. People call me 'soutie' (Englishman) or 'rooinek' (Redneck) regularly, and you don't see me taking them to court about it. And yet, here in Southern Africa we've recently seen a number of cases where black people have taken white people to court for mistakenly uttering the K-word. I call this 'Mankind's great capacity to label absolutely anything' - it is our ability to make absolutely  anything seem bad by merely assosciating the name/label with a negative quality. We could really do without it.
