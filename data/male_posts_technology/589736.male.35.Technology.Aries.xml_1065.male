The name’s not hard to remember because Ginsberg has been wearing a name tag for more than 900 days with ‘‘Scott’’ scrawled boldly across a piece of adhesive paper in felt-tip marker. When people used to ask why, he’d explain in depth. ‘‘The Name Tag Dissertation,’’ his friends called it. So, now he keeps the response simple: Name tags make people friendlier.
