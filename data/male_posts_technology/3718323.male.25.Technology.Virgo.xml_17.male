A recruiter called me, and although he couldn't give me the name of the company, I was able to get enough information from him to figure out who it is.  And I went online and read up on the company, and it seems at least as good or better as the situation I'm currently in.  I'll see how that goes.  Last night I was reading the  urlLink Work To Live  site, and I followed the link to the  urlLink Meetup.com  site.  I ended up signing up on meetup.com, and it turns out there are only 4 others signed up in San Diego.  I've never used the site, but the premise sounds cool.  Essentially you meet groups of people who have the same interests as you at coffee shops or other places like that.  Who knows if I'll actually do it though.  I'm new to the Work To Live thing, but the concept sounds about right.  It's all about pushing for a balance between work and life, which is grossly out of whack for most Americans.  I've always been aware of the fact that the US is one of the most production obsessed countries, but until I read the site I had never known about that fact that  urlLink the United States is about the worst when it comes to vacation and work laws .  (In comparison to most of Europe, Australia, and even China and Japan).  Although more vacation really sounds nice, the thing that I'm for is more enjoyable work environments.  I don't think the fact that people have to work is what ruins them - in fact  urlLink the  right  kind of work makes people feel good  - but moreso the fact that they work in little tiny cubicles, stressed out, bosses breathing down their necks, and always seem to have more work than they can handle.  I'm wondering if it's worth my time to pursue.  Maybe if I get a fun new job I won't care so much about the balance crap, because maybe I'll enjoy work.
