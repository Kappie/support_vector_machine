I picked up Rainbow Six 3 on my way to DaftApeth's house Saturday - it was gaming day. We played some Operation Flashpoint, a little bit of Rainbow Six (I was expecting split-screen multiplayer co-op, didn't get it), and had Charon try out some of the Long Beach cars on the Test Track. Afterward, we had a wonderful time watching a really horrible movie:  urlLink Druids   Charon is a friend of ours - he usually plays PC games with DaftApeth on Saturdays. We have been pressuring him to get an XBox and XBL, and I think he may finally be caving in. We shall see.  I picked up Armed and Dangerous again last night, went through the first bit again. It is rather lackluster, but potentially fun - I will have to go a bit further.
