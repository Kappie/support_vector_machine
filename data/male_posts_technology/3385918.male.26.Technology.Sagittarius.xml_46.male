With just six days to go until the pay-per-view, tempers will be flaring, and anything can happen this Monday night on RAW!   Four matches have already been announced for Bad Blood: World Heavyweight Championship: Chris Benoit vs. Kane Hell in a Cell: Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels Intercontinental Championship: Randy Orton vs. Shelton Benjamin Women's Championship: Victoria vs. Gail Kim   There will undoubtedly be more Bad Blood matches announced on RAW.   And what will the participants in the matches already announced have in store for one another on Monday Night RAW? Will Shawn Michaels be barred from the building again?   How will Eugene follow up on his victory (by disqualification) over Kane?   All of this and more, as the road to Bad Blood continues on Monday Night RAW at 9/8 PM CT on Spike TV.
