Firefox was already awsome, and it keeps getting better.  It makes IE look like a model-T in comparison.  It blocks pop up adds and doesn't install horrible viruses or allow web pages to run malicious code.  As if these reasons weren't enough, it also supports a cool feature called tabed browsing which allows you to open multiple web pages in the same window with a simple middle click. Release notes can be found  urlLink here   You might need the  urlLink Macromedia Flash Player  as well as  urlLink Macromedia Shockwave  player.  Install these after installing Firefox.
