From home to Kuwait it’s a blur but there were so many interest and not so interesting things that happened.  I’d like the start off with my first rant. Probably the first of many before it’s all said and done. We were scheduled to leave El Paso at 0130 on 10 July. Not a problem, a little early and particularly after a long day of briefings and meetings which some seemed irrelevant (because they were focused to the military), but O.K. I’m game. Well it got down to preparing our baggage for loading to trucks, which would be eventually loaded on the plane. The Army isn’t like the commercial airlines where you check your baggage in to a counter and the next time you see it, it’s coming to you from a conveyor belt. Nope the check in counter is the passengers (that’s us) and the conveyor belt is, yep you guessed it, us. So pretty much you can see where this is going they volunteer you to be a part of the baggage detail. At the time I thought cool because sometimes they compensate you for your hard work by letting you board the plane first. Which means you could potentially get a first class seat (which doesn’t mean a whole lot except for the extra space, as everyone on the plane gets the same food and service). I went into this detail with a gung ho attitude thinking the end result would be a nice comfortable, spacious plane ride to Kuwait. First we loaded the truck with the numerous duffle bags that were sprawled out over the parking lot. At 2200, which was a half hour earlier than anyone else, we left to the deployment terminal to load baggage to the airplane. Again I put my efforts into the task probably tossing around about 300 pieces of baggage. After that we went back to the terminal for a few more briefings and pep talks and they started calling out names to board the aircraft. As I sat and they called out names one by one I started to get concerned that none of the baggage detailed was called out. They went through the whole list of people and left baggage detail for the very ended. Yours truly was the last person to board. I still was unsure about seating until I got to the plane thinking that maybe they had some special seating for us. Wrong! They basically threw us in with every one else that had boarded the plane ahead of us who already got all the good seats (i.e. their own row to spread out and sleep or a window seat). I got an isle seat next to some guy for the whole flight. I already mentioned that the day had been long which started at 0600 and we were staring at a 21-hour flight. So if not first class, comfort would have been nice but as I was looking around at the guys around me (who were not on the detail) spread out over three  four seats I couldn’t help to think which a CHICKEN SHIT deal I was handed. I was basically had to sleep vertically which sucks. I was so pissed the whole flight that it was difficult to sleep just for that reason. But you know me, I’m not the one to make a fuss and get emotional. The bad thing about this detail is once you’re on it, you’re on it from start to finish (no rotation of other people). So I’d be damned if I was going to unload anyone’s bag from any plane. And so just that, after we landed they called out for the baggage detail and I sat quietly and debarked the plane with every else. I guess no one had a list of who was suppose to be on the detail because nothing was said or done by my absence. To no avail, stepping off the plane into Kuwait was memorable be even more so was the 98 degree temperature at 0730 that was an eye opener. All I know is I didn’t feel bad as those guys hauled all those 300 plus bags out of the plane into the awaiting truck. I watched them do it from the comfort of a nice cool air-conditioned bus. Ha ha ha. I got your baggage detail for you.
