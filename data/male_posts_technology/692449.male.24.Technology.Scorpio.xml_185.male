Maybe I need more sanity in my life but I think it's a great topic for a philosophy paper. In other news I'm a little hung over from a night on the town with Adam and Susan. When will I learn that drinking to much will fuck me up the next day? Oh well at least I don't have anything other then standard classes today. By the way I invited Sam Brown of  urlLink Kikuchiyo  fame to post and comment so look for more bits form him.
