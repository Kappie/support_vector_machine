Ash's single mix so far is really hot. Lotta warmth to it. Remix kits are going out now. We've got the British , we've got the Russians, we have a few New Yorkers, and maybe even some midwesterner's remixing. And to top it off, we have a cover picture from Iceland. You can't get more international than that. Maybe it will come out this year. Maybe ;-)  F
