Took a couple of Panadols toalleviate the pain. It all started on Friday night. A very good friend of mine gave me the chance to get a free trial of a gym somewhere in KL. So I went with my best buddy. The place was seriously huge and full of equipments, and with lots of sweating bodies. Male and female. Went on the treadmill for 20 minutes, then went on to try the upper body workout. Must have exerted myself. That was the reason for the pain. But it was the good kind of pain. The kind where you feel you can't move, but after a while you develop some serious mucles. Hehehe... I wish!!  Am currently reading Haruki Murakami's  Dance Dance Dance  and Iain Banks'  Whit . I've read these two books before. A couple of times. But I still love to read these books, over and over again.And besides, I don't have anything else to read. Well, actually, I do, but I don't feel like reading non-fiction at the moment. I don't think I'll ever get bored with  Dance Dance Dance . Although I have to get Murakami's other books. Maybe I'll go to Kinokuniya this coming Saturday or Sunday to get it. I think I've written about Murakami's books, but I have to say something here as well. His books are surreal. Seriously. I really can't explain it any better than that. When I read his books, I can actually feel the atmosphere of the place he is describing. I mean, it's seriously fantastic. I know I sound like a bludee nerd, but that's the truth (not the nerd part, the surreal part).  Am planning to watch King Arthur this weekend. But I heard it isn't as good as I thought it would be. I heard they took the epic straight from the history books. So none of those magical folks or heroic deeds that blows the mind. Just your factual epic brought to life on the silver screen. Nothing much to look forward to. If I'm in the mood, I might want to see Spiderman2 again. Yup, I really enjoyed the movie the first time I saw it. Or, what else is playing? I'm not sure. Hmmm, have to check the local listing.
