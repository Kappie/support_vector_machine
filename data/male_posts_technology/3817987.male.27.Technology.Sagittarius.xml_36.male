And lately it has spilled over into other films with that theme.  Tonight it was  urlLink  A Little Princess   and   urlLink The Barbarian Invasions  .    Why does that theme get to me?  Maybe its the ups and downs of my family life in the past?  Maybe it was my family being there for my brother through a rough patch?  I really can't say,  but family really is a wonderful thing.  But from here on out please don't quote that line from  Lilo and Stitch  or I'll tear up.
