Current DVD technology is based on MPEG-2 compression technology (thing ZIP for movies).  While MPEG-2 was the shiz-nit in it's heyday, it's age is now showing.  With MPEG-4 (a-la DIVX and others) providing much better quality with much higher compression ratios (meaning we can now put more crap in that 10 pound bag), it's about time to move away from MPEG-2.
