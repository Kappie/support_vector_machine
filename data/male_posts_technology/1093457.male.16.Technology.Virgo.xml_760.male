I enjoyed the chat Jackie, Sally, Matt and I had fourth lesson. It was just plain cute I reckons. Today was ok. Lessons were good. Art was hilarious as we had to draw ourselves with a continuous line without looking which was incredibly amusing. It rained! Wahoo! My cous sent some pictures of him and his wife from this wedding then went to. It was in Montanna and the pics are so nice. I'm happy. I'm content with my life. Its fine.
