Four floors of luxury and plenty of space. I have already claimed a certain corner of the lounge as 'Baity's Corner'. This shall be my base of operations for the up and coming future. Kate was showing me a few photographs of her family as her mum and sister are coming over in February I believe, big HELLO to you all. Danger, Toaster and I have decided to take to the golf courses of the island and we went to the driving range on Saturday and had a crack (bloody annoying game though!). Ah yes! I went to the Splash for the first time this year last night. I went on my own because I was driving about and decided to go see who was there. It was a great night out and I met a lot of the 'Ye Olde' Splash people, plus all the usual raging hormone teenagers that congregate there!!! I am now a self proclaimed furniture builder thanks to Danger's huge amount that had to be constructed at the new house. I did something today that I haven't done in a long time....I slept in until like 1:25pm!! Well that just about sums up the recent events, hopefully someone else will put up a post and fill us all in......  Baity signing off.....
