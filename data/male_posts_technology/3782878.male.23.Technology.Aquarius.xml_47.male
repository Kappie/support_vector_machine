Course if I report it that'll just mean that I will have work to do, but sometimes that's a good thing.  Work on my projects has been nullified by the need to play more EQ,  I admit that my goals outside of EQ are not making much headway, and I need to dedicate at least some part of one day to doing this great work. I'm tempted to do a little tonight, just to appease my need to create. I still wish I could bring my laptop to work as I used to, and that the laptop even worked. Heck if the laptop even worked I could probably do my writing and play EQ, crazy isn't it? but there's sometimes enough down time to write a document or two in the greater scheme.  There are things that need doing, and with proper planning they can be done. I'm going to spend an hour on my projects tonight, dedicate a little time to them, before I touch that demonic thing that is EQ. Heck I've even been neglecting these blogs, but that's not EQ's fault, because I don't have EQ at work. It's work's fault for keeping me too busy to write.  Also today I have to pick a surname for my necromancer, I'm going to dig through some online stuff until I find something that fits.   Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix
