They cost almost nothing to put up and they allow anyone with an opinion the ability reach millions of people instantly and simultaneously. Blogs have become a kind of early warning system for me, alerting me about things like Trent Lott's political problems days before it appeared in the conventional press. Blogs are here to stay and their power will only grow. I think they are going to revolutionize politics and newsgathering permanently.
