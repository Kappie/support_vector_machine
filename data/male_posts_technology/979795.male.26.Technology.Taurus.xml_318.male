Maybe coz of the cough I've been having. Haven't seen my cousins for ages. 1 went to study in Canada, heard she's doing pretty well. Haha, apparently she had some moles removed. Haiz ... charbors ... Haha but it was nice seeing long-lost cousins again though. Another was finishing her final year in NUS. She brought her boyfriend along. Quiet guy and quite cham coz he was pratically in one corner and not many of us were talking to him. Heh... I was too busy sleeping to be bothered with the others. But her 14 yr old brother!! Good gawd! Haven't seen him for a few years and he's already 1.8+m tall!! Pengz ... I wanna kill myself liao. Now I know where did all the tall genes go in my dad's side of the family?! Oh, can't blame me for falling asleep there. They were playing one of their church service ... but it was in Hokkien and the pastor had a Cantonese translator   ... Hey, but at least I did manage to understand the gist of everything. Anyway, I also didn't mean to fall asleep there. It just ... sorta ... happened. Haha ... the cushions I was lying on felt soooo comfy ... zzzzz  My aunt's side of the family also invited some relatives. Their daughter is currently doing her degree in Manchester. Heh ... good lah, heard she was quite havoc in S'pore a few years back. Hopefully mellowed down a  bit by now. But one thing that struck me, they seem to have the mentality that overseas is much better than Singapore. I dunno, I think it's a real misconception lor. I've always encouraged people to broaden their horizons but ultimately I'd always say we have to come on back here. I dislike the notion of people going abroad and deciding not to come back. This excludes longterm overseas attachments of course. Just so long as you are aware of where your roots really lie. Of course some people will always argue that it's the local government's fault for not being able to retain local talants. No doubt a certain extent of this maybe true. But this brings to mind one thing I read from the newspaper recently. I can't remember what the topic was about but this Minister was saying something like Singaporeans have got to grow up. They should not expect too many handouts from the government. Absolutely true. I think we've had too comfy a life here soemtimes that we start to complain once things get a little tough. Sometimes I pity the government for what they have to put up with. I wonder,  rather than taking the easy way out why not make a difference by coming back here. Obviously most people will always say the local environment is not conducive for them to make the kinda of changes, be it in a legislative or a political stand. But if you decide to 'go along', what else is there to complain? Most just want the best of both world, no restictions to do what they want and an environment where they can make the easy changes they want.  Anyway, I was happily announcing to everyone of my ORD status hahaha... CPL (NS) Tan :P Almost everyone was asking me about what were my plans now. Think I only briefly mentioned Police Force to one uncle and aunt. Dunnoz ... dun wanna say too much until something more concrete appears. Haha will they get a shock if I really do enter the service.  I spent the whole day at home today. Finally digitised all footages of UK and Aikido into my computer. But I didn't burn them in CD yet. I've practically used up ALL my harddisk for this. 60Gb of space originally, now I have 3Gb left. But I'm not too worried lah, after I burn them into CD, I can free up the space.  OK I've decided to call the SPF tomorrow to find out if my application has been processed or rejected. Justin was right, have to bug them like siao to get a reply rather than let them drag my time. At least I'll know when I can send a second application in again. But seriously man, hope there's some form of good news soon.  Tomorrow evening I've been invited to my RSM's home for dinner with some of the regulars and Neo. Neo kept psychoing me to buy a gift and all that. So troublesome. I went to my dad's display case to pick an unopened red wine to just give to him. Afterall they don't really drink. I got no idea why my dad used to buy so much wine... duh. probably get it wrapped up later tonight. Nothing much on tele tonight either. If I'm like really bored, I'll probably start converting stuff to CDs.  I know X'mas is almost over but I just wanna wish everyone a Merry X'mas, season's greetings and  Happy New Year.
