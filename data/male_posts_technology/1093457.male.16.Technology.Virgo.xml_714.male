I can prove that by the large number of people who had forgotten that I had been away for that week. How..demoralising. Made me feel great. Ok Jackie, I will see you there then. I am wandering to the park today to see Ema, James was coming but he can't now as he is getting as level results and so has to go home to tell his Aunt and Uncle. I miss Ema, I was on the phone to her for ages last night! Twas rather amusing.
