Saw  urlLink Love Actually  and to be honest I thought it was just going to be one of those regualar, schmultzy American chick flick, but actually.... it wasn't too bad. It may have suffered a little from trying to tell too many stories at the one time and thus some of the stories lines may have been a little light. However the message that you get hurt the most by the one's closest to you, but you also get the most when yo stick your neck out and take a risk is very uplifting.  I would definitely recommend seeing this movie this christmas.
