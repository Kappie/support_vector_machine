Radiohead - OK Computer : (9 votes) 

Weezer - Pinkerton : (7 votes) 

Beach Boys - Pet Sounds : (4 votes) 

Minutemen - Double Nickels On The Dime : (3 votes) 

Pavement - Slanted and Enchanted : (3 votes) 

Beatles - Abbey Road : (3 votes) 

Sloan - Twice Removed : (3 votes) 

Sadly, I do not have two of these albums (Abbey Road and Double Nickels On The Dime).  I should fix that soon.
