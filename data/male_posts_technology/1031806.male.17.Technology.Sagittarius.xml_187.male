This Friday, Andrew and I are prolly staying over night at Cam's then we're all going back over to Andrew's ... not sure what we're gonna do to fill the time but it should be interesting.   I'm really sucking at school right now... Calc. and Spanish are still Fs and Sign's starting to head down that way too... I have had so many phreaking 1st period tardies that every time I'm tardy do, I get ISS (LOL). Thankfully it's only once a week, but still ... crazy. I keep missing key days in Chemistry so I'm behind in that right now too... not sure what I'm going to do... My uncle's thinking it might be best to drop Calc. do preCalc for another year, but that would seriously screw with my class lineup... not something I'm hoping for.   Anyway, I've got a paper that's worth 16 grades due in Senior English tomorrow, so I'd better get going... not sure if I'm gonna be on tonight, but whatever...  O, btw I'm going to a opera on Nov. 6th with a group that Rachael’s' (am I spelling your name correctly?) conveniently a part of (thankyouthankyou now I’m not going to be stuck with just 9 middle schoolers - nothing against them as a whole... just this particular bunch can be sometimes rather ... annoying). I've invited Cam and Ddee too, and I might even be able to get Josh to go along, but so far only Cam and Ddee are showing interest. (Andrew, wanna get some culture? WELL THEN STAY AT HOME WHILE THE REST OF US GO TO THE OPERA!!! ... jk jk, but I really doubt that would be your 'cup of tea')
