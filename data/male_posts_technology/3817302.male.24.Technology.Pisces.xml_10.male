As a young boy he seemed to have a good time being outside even more so then the normal Elven boy. He did not seem interested as much as other childen his age in the pursuit of the arcane. Instead he seemed to love nature so much more. When he turned 120 he befriened a wolf named Silverfang. He found this wolf one day while taking a walk in the woods and found it orphaned because some human trappers had kill his mother. At that point in time Silvanus decided that he was going to take care of his new found pet and raise it till adulthood. Although when Silverfang did reach adulthood he did not seem want to leave his good friend. So Silvanus decided to allow him to stay with him and be his companion.    One fateful day on his 125 birthday. Silvanus was out in the forest tending to his animal friends and playing with Silverfang he heard a great rumbling. Being intrested in what this great noise was he decided to invesigate it. What he found to his great horrow was a group of Orcs tearing apart his precious homeland and home to his animal friends. It was a giant machine that was being run by a small group of orcs. Being outraged Silvanus chaged after them disregarding the fact that he was outnumbered. He wanted to protect the forest at all costs. So he attacked the orcs and wound up getting captured and forced to help run this machine to tear down more of his precious forest. This was when Silvanus reliazed that he had a calling to protect the forest and stop creatures from destroying nature. While he was captured he met a halfing namedDungo Dagbar that tried to help him escape. They tried to escape but to no avail they where just caught again and forced to tear down more of the forest.  They both had to continue to tear down the forest until he was saved by a very large human and a short gnome. When he was finally freed he decided that he wanted to help out these newly meet compainons and go after the person responsible for this. He found out that is was a very powerful merchant named Galimar from the town of Calimport. So then he joined them in the journey to Calimport and take out this merchant. Little did all of them know that Galimar wasnt such an east target and they all found themselves being sold as slaves on a boat on the way to Luskan. But through the heroic efforts of the halfing, gnome and human they were able to overtake the boat and set themselves free and set all the other slaves on the boad free also.  While he was traveling with his compainons in search of greater knowledge of all things natural. They traveled to the Famed Mithril Hall and meet the famous Drow Drizzt Do'Urden. While he was there he talked to Drizzt and became fascinated with the way that he wielded two Scimtars at one time.So then Silvanus himself decided to undertake the path necessary to learn to dual wield and someday dispatch vermin as quickly as the famous Drow.  A new chapter has started in Silvanus life. He has helped his companions defeat the evil merchant Galimar. Now that he has avenged the destruction of his forest he faces a dilemma. He is now sure what he is to do now. Should he travel back home and resume life as normal, or should he stay with his new found friends. Silvanus decided on the day that he helped defeat Galimar that his work is not done yet. He feels he has made some good friends and feels that he could help protect nature and defeat evil. Silvanus is going to adventure and find out what the future holds for him.   BTW this is a work in progress so it is not done man.I would like any comments u guys have to add to my story.
