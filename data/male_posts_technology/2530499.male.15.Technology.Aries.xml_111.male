It's not uber-cozy, but it has some food and drink, some money, maybe some blankets in the future. I don't even have to know you were there. I don't care...but if my dad comes down and sees you, just tell him to call me. Don't leave.  ANYWAY...  Had fun fishing today, reading  urlLink Kelly's  LiveJournal.  -beej
