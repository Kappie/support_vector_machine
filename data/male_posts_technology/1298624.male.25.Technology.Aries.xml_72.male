I have to admit, it is hard to understand certain things (diphthongs). Oh well, time flies by when you're having fun.  Ninja Gaiden.  That's all I have to say.  I may quit playing console games for a little bit, get back into playing PC games since Battlefield Vietnam and UT2k4 just came out.   Oh my birthday is coming too...go me.
