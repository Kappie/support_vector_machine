Ok ok you got me thats a lie !! Its mainly for storage of my porn happy ! Geez you people are so judgemental !   Been listening to Pearl Jam's new CD ,  urlLink Riot Act . It's an amazing record definitely their best for a long while, previous album Binaural was a bit of a disappointment so I am really glad that this one turned out as great as it has. Now hope can say the same thing about Manson's new one when it comes out. But I am going nuts over my hi fi ...it keeps skipping like crazy. Maybe its time to get a new one perhaps...
