It is a great opportunity for him to travel, and get paid very well to do it. I thought about applying for a similar job, but realized I had a lot here in the SPGS. Things like getting involved in ministry, teaching college, a few things like that.  I would love to travel in the future, but now God has me here, so I will wait.  Ciao
