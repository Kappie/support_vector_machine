After a complete install of Mandrake 10, which took me about two hours, I had almost everything I needed.   (Two hours is configure time and install time total.)  And very seldom do I install anything on my Linux box, if I do it's usually the newest nVidia drivers or just an update to one of my favorite apps.  The last time I reloaded my laptop with WinXP it took almost two day to put back all the software that I use.  So check out the link, it's short and I think you'll enjoy it.  Until next time...
