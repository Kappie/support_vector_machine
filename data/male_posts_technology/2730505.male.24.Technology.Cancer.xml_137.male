HALEFUCKINLUJAH!!!  *Disclaimer - I know  -you-  still read this so don't take it personally.  It's too bad that you didn't see the relationship the same way I did.  Whatever, I live, learn and move on.  Thanks again for everything, thanks for nothing, and I suggest you don't read the rest of this shit.  So I was bored after playing some basketball and yes, I fared much better than last week's debacle.  I was able to hit some shots and find the open man for the shot.  It was fun and I wasn't as out of breathe as I was last week.  I feel alive again.  I feel great.  So after basketball, I looked up stages of grief and found some shit and here it is.  I really hate to sound like a little bitch discussing feelings and emotions because some might think it's a sign of weakness but whatever.  If you can't stand reading this crap then stop reading, no one is pointing a fucking gun to your head are they?  To begin, we're going to discuss the Stages of Grief and how people feel when they are at that particular stage after a break-up.  Sure what I was in was a short term relationship but it was still an important part of my life (not sure about the other party) and I learned a lot from it.  I'm sure people can relate to this on some level (I hope, unless you're some loser who has been living in the basement and have never actually talked to a girl that has a different set of chromosomes than you or any of your relatives, I feel sorry for you, get out there and fucking live).  With each stage, I have a particular song that I thought was fitting.  Again this is just all opinion, I may be wrong with a lot of this shit maybe I'm not.  If you are still reading, this is your last chance to stop and just skip this post.   First Stage of Grief:  In the beginning, you may feel in shock, denial, or numb. It may be hard for you to believe what has happened. It may be hard to make sense of it all. You may find yourself expecting to come home to your partner or for her/him to call at a regular time only to discover that's not the case any longer. It may take awhile for you to fully comprehend that the relationship is over.  At this stage, you may have trouble remembering things, focusing, and feeling a sense of purpose or direction in their lives - you may feel as though you are drifting through the day. This is a natural initial reaction to loss.    In this stage, the theme song was  urlLink Hoobastank - The Reason .  I couldn't get enough of that fucking song.   Second Stage of Grief:  The second stage involves feeling fear, anger and depression. This stage often lasts the longest and can be filled with feelings of insecurity, panic, worry, crying, anger, and feelings of depression. Some people don't allow themselves to feel, while others have trouble letting go of how they are feeling. Both are essential - feeling and eventually letting go.  In the beginning, you may think that you will always feel this way, but you won't. Your feelings will pass. You'll discover that the time between down periods increases. Too often with break-ups we don't feel that we have the right to feel upset much longer than a few weeks when the truth is it usually takes longer. I have found that grief tends to run a cycle of at least one year unless of course the relationship wasn't very important, was short-term, or you were grieving before you actually left her/him. But, if you spent a number of years together, and the person was important to you, even if you're the one doing the breaking up you can still be grieving for approximately one year. Of course with very long term relationships, it can take even longer to feel back on your feet but it is still possible to recover.   The theme song for this stage is  urlLink Usher - Burn .  It was a sad time with a lot of depressing thoughts but this song was just right.  It didn't exactly make me feel better but more in tune with my grief and was able to be honest with myself.   Third Stage of Grief:  This is the stage where you begin to accept that the relationship is over, and that you're going to be okay. You realize that you haven't thought about your ex-partner in awhile, and that without realizing it you are moving on. You've gained back some of your zest for life, and are beginning to see a future ahead of you.   In the acceptance stage, you've done a lot of thinking about the relationship and the break-up and you realize things that you hadn't before. You understand yourself better, and you aren't as angry or hurt. You find yourself laughing more, and feeling hopeful. You begin to notice that you're feeling better and that you are ready to trust again, or at least to try.  Sometimes letting go just happens after you've let yourself grieve and rage and whatever else you need to do. Other times, people have to deliberately and consciously focus on letting go. It is tempting to hold on, and scary to let go. Saying to yourself that you are letting go of your ex-partner can be helpful. Interrupting yourself when you get stuck thinking or talking about her/him and redirecting your focus onto something else is all part of letting go.   Filling your life with activities that you enjoy - creative, playful, sociable, soulful activities - are all ways to nurture yourself back to health   So right now I can't get enough of the song  urlLink Roses by Andre 3000 of Outkast .  This isn't anything personal.  Personally I like the beginning of the song with the upbeat piano playing.  Yeah this is the song that I am currently listening to.  I like it, no hard feelings.  I especially like the part in the song below:    I know you like too thank your s*** don't stank but lean a little bit closer and see that roses really smell like boo, boo, boo, roses really smell like boo, boo, boo.     So that's enough of me writing.  I told you it was going to be kinda long.  Well I'm sore (not as sore after playing basketball last week but still sore.  It's a good feeling to use your lame duck muscles again.  Yeah.  It's definitely good to get back into the groove again.  Thank's for suffering through that shit.  No promises on is this sort of bullshit will be making a return apperance but for now, hopefully this will be the last of the sort.
