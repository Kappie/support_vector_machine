I might end up moving a couple refrigerators around by myself this afternoon. Then there's a door I have to hang, but I have no hinges in stock. There is trash all over the place, I need to put away the parts order, and I'm expecting a glass delivery sometime too. The last 2 service requests I went on both need warranty work scheduled, so I need to make a couple phone calls. That's all for now. Maybe I'll blog again later to tell how things turned out.
