I couldn't spot any obvious jumps between live action and CGI.  The story was awesome, got a bit boring at times, and didn't screw with the ideas set with the comic book as badly as the 1st one did.  They have all the cast from the 1st movie back, with a short appearance of William DeFoe at the end.   The actor they picked to play Dr. Otto Octavious is perfect. The guy couldn't of been any better a choice if they tried, he was out and out perfect for the roll.    I must say that I'm very impressed with it, dont want to go into details and ruin it for anyone reading (there are people reading this site still I hope?). All I can say is that when this bad boy comes out on DVD, there will be a place on our shelf waiting for it.  On a side note, picked up a fun old movie that just came out on DVD last month. Wizards.  Who remembers that one?  Different type movie, but it's fun as well. Was interesting seeing Avatar the hero in action again. It's a movie that tells the tale of good vs evil (go figure) but this time, good is 3000+yrs old, is kinda horney, and gets the girl in the end (not literally, who knows might happen off screen tho).
