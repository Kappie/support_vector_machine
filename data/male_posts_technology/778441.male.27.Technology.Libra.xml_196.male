On the eve of a crucial Pool A match against Zimbabwe, the Pakistani players are at blows among themselves instead of sitting down to chalk out a strategy for the do-or-die match.  The  urlLink incident , which occurred during a football match, was witnessed by reporters and photographers.  Tempers flared when Younis Khan challenged Inzamam-ul-Haq for the ball. The pair squared up and when team mate Saeed Anwar tried to defuse the situation he was pushed to the ground by Inzamam.  Skipper Waqar Younis said: "It's nothing new. We always have this problem when we play soccer."  Take a hint mate!... Stick to cricket!! ;-)  It may be noted that the short-tempered Inzamam-ul-Haq is known to throw his weight around at the slightest provocation. In a India-Pak match, for the Sahara Cup, at Toronto, a few years back, he jumped over the advertising boards on the boundary and attacked a heckling spectator with a cricket bat.
