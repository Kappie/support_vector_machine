Let's set the limit at 25 miles per gallon. I don't know how realistic that is, but I think thats reasonable to start.  If you want to buy a car that does not meet that minimum requirement, there is an additional $10,000 tax imposed by the dealership. So baseball players can continue to drive their Ferraris. This money would not just be consumed by the government. The money would be directly transferred to offset the cost of hybrid/electric cars, and the more efficient models. So while every SUV loving city-dweller would pay an extra $10,000, Mr. and Mrs. Joe Average can afford a nice hybrid car for $40,000 off the sticker price. Not a bad deal I say.  And perhaps gasoline taxes should increase for the consumer. We have to find a way of doing this without hurting airlines and truck transport (let's say they're exempt). But Regular Unleaded gas is $1 per gallon more expensive. The money from this would go directly into public transit - so they can buy environmentally friendly buses, increase service, and build more train/subway stations.  Don't get me wrong. I don't hug trees, and  urlLink I am a city-dwelling SUV driver . But I would pay the $10,000 more up front, plus $1,000 a year for the privelege. And if I don't like it, I can switch to a  urlLink VW Golf  or something.  Scott
