This is not my opinion, but one of a professional.  My barber lady performs many services and one of them being eyebrow plucking.  She asks me if I want my eyebrows plucked.  Being a man of adventure and one who backs from no challenge, I tell her to have at it.  She gets in my face....Tweezers in hand....looks closely and plucks a single hair from my left eyebrow.  She then shifts focus to my right eyebrow...the frown quickly turns into a smile and she say..."that's all".  I say, what do you mean that's all?  You plucked 1 hair from my left eye, and left my right eye brow out in the cold!  She replies, "no I didn't....it's perfect!" "Perfect?" I reply.  "Perfect" she says.  "Fucken A" is all i could think of.  I gave her a hug and a $10 tip.  She made my friggen day.  So there you have it people...i'm in possession of 1 perfect eyebrow.
