Work was boring and I was really tired, possibly because I didn't get to sleep until about 2am last night as I was so bloody hot! I went to bed at about 12.30am so I was pretty pissed off.  I got a cool card from work, they give us weird cards and I was given one about marriage, it was quite funny especially some of the notes inside... I'm now getting married tomorrow to my good buddy susanna!  I got given a School of Rock DVD from my parents, along with some money for my holiday and the money its gonna cost to get a provisional liceanse. My sister got me some stuff about driving, so that was fun! Oh yea and I got given some L plates... The rest of my "presents" was in fact money and I think it added up to about £250 all together, so not bad really! Althought its already gone down cause I owed my mum £20 and my dad £10!  Cinema last night was good, meal was nice although I was kinda annoyed because there were some people there that I don't particulary like that much. Darren pissed me off because he did nothing but smoke all night. He had like 15 cigarrettes while we were out... About 7 after the film finished and before we got on the bus home. We were on the bus along with what seemed like the whole of the old year elevens, who were all drunk and probably high. They were also eating chicken and it was making me feel well hungry! When we got off the bus a few people got off after us and as we walked off home a fight broke out behind us, don't really know who was involved and didn't stick around long enough to find out. Stupid really because it probably ruined their night out!  Nicki, that's fine if you wanna come round Monday, just give me a more direct time as I have to check I'm not working! I don't think I am... But you never know!  I'm gonna shut up now.
