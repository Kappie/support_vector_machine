This is a bit of a historical link, as it's been talked about elsewhere all week, but seeing as I just got round to looking at it now, I thought I'd post it too. It's a new search engine from  urlLink Amazon , and it's called  urlLink A9.com >A9 .   If any one wants me, I'll be planting trees till lunchtime, then I'm off to write letters to the Grauniad all afternoon!
