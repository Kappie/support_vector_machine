Firstly, it has a lot of actors I like:  urlLink Ioan Gruffudd  (of Hornblower fame) as Lancelot,  urlLink Ray Winstone  (last seen by me in  urlLink Henry VIII , see  urlLink previous post ) as Bors,  urlLink Stellan Skarsgård  as Cerdic, the all around evil Saxon invader,  urlLink Hugh Dancy  as Galahad and finally the always lovely  urlLink Keira Knightley  as Guinevere.   Secondly, the story is well-constructed. My view of the Arthurian saga is forever coloured by Marion Zimmer Bradley's interpretation in her book  urlLink The Mists of Avalon  since I read it for the first time in 1994, but I like this one as well.  The main drawback of the movie is what's not in it: There is a lack of deeper characterisation of some of the main characters - they're not as fleshed out as they could be. Also Cerdic never becomes anything more than a regular bad guy, but it this case, it works anyway. The camaraderie between Arthur and his knights however, is well-developed, even if it's a bit clichéd. And I like how Lancelot and Bors are portrayed.    -->
