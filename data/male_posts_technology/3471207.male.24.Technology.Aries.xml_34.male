Roger Federer, who is my favourite, seems to be losing out to Andy Roddick. Indeed, Andy has a great and imposing serve of which even the defending champion has difficulty returning. Oh well, i hope federer wins...he's a really cool guy..doesn't show any emotion at all even if he's in a losing streak..amazing.  As for me, this morning i went for some tennis with my friend at NUS. Still haven't recovered from my aches from the badminton game i had last week and unfortunately that has affected my play i guess. First time i tried in a practice court too and i must say, it's pretty fun playing there. The practice court is just a wall where you hit the ball to and it bounces back and you hit again. It's much more fun as i don't have to waste time picking the ball up so many times if i play for singles. Still haven't got my technique quite there yet and i'm still figuring out on finding the most comfortable strokes.  Yeah, tennis day today for me..:)
