So, what's new???  Well I have recently passed my theory test for my 'Heavy/Large Goods' Driving License, YAY! I passed with a respectable score of 33/35, which still has to be toasted with rounds of alcohol.  Now last Saturday I took a friend who was over from Guernsey out on the lash, well I was driving but that don't matter, anyway I took Nick up to the Splash to show him exactly why I say it's the best of what we got in Jersey. He seemed to enjoy it and fun was had by all....... except ME!!! Yep that's right, once again I managed to sustain yet another injury in the name of metal (shrugs it off modestly). This event adds to the ongoing list.....  1) Split knuckle- due to a stray thrown bottle, 2) Near KO- due to head butting some unfortunate girl who was standing in the wrong place at the wrong time (once again I'm awfully sorry, we agreed it was 50/50), 3) Badly sprained ankle- due to a failed mosh jump in the middle of a 'Rage Against The Machine' track, 4) Hairline cracked rib- due to getting in the middle of the mosh pit, 5) A big ego- due to being pulled into a toilet and shagging a really fantastic girl (ok this isn't an injury but had to get it in somewhere), 6) Cracked tooth- due to an over zealous townie, who subsequently got an elbow in the face! FUCK YOU TOWNIES (apart from my mates who can't help it), 7) Dislocated jaw- due to landing on one of my mates as she jumped up, you get the picture, in fact it still ain't right!, 8) A blood clot heamatoma in my neck- also sustained this at the same time as the dislocated jaw, took three months of drugs to break the clot up!, 9) Numerous cigarette burns- due to careless fucks being...careless!, 10) Spasmed spinal disk- due to an over zealous mosh jump I performed last week!!  Anyway after spending most of the week off work due to my back I have been thinking about what the future holds for the Toaster Files. It seems of late that our site has been dying slowly as people haven't posted for ages, myself included. However, all is not as bad as thought, the new look is quite cool, and I intend to post more again. I believe that as usual we are all eagerly awaiting the summer sun to activate us all again. Beach parties, babes and booze will once again reign!!!  Oh and my opinion on the current war situation....Now the war machine is underway, there is no stopping it. Now is the time for the populous to get behind it's respective military force and back them all the way. What do all the 'Anti-war Supporters' really think they are going to achieve now?? It's already happening people, so chaining yourself to trees and screaming outside the Houses Of P, is going to have as much affect on the war crisis as a fly getting into a head-on with a juggernaut truck!!!   So......well I guess I have said most of what I wanted to get off my chest.....yep, right I'm fucking off now.....  'ROCK HARD' 'ROCK HEAVY' 'ROCK ANIMAL'  Baity signing off......
