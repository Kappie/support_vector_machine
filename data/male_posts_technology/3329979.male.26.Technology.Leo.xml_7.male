It was like yesterday when i packed my stuffs from HP and moved to MS. Honestly, i left HP with a heavy heart but now, looking back, i have no regrets. One of the better choices in life that i've made. Watched Spider-Man 2 on Wednesday. Overall, it was much better than the first; there was drama, action and lots of humour which integrated well into the storyline. Anybody who wants to know the ending of the story ? Hehehe .... Then, last nite MS had a nite's out at Thai Bar to celebrate the closing of their financial year. The company was good but the music wasn't quite happening. And there was no ventilation; they should have installed a ventillation system for the non-smokers out there.  Also, this is a special note to Ms Dippy .... Dippy roo, hang in there yah ! Though things might not go your way, but eventually, it will come full circle ....  Savvy ;)
