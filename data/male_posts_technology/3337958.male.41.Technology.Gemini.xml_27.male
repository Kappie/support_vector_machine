This will enable those with the available bandwidth to view and send, without causing this page to take too long to load.  If you'd like to contribute pictures, there is a  urlLink tutorial  that explains how to get the software that you can use to send your local pictures to the picture host, which costs nothing.  The main page will display thumbnails (200k at the smallest setting, which I recommend) with the ability to view a larger version by clicking them.  I've put a couple pictures from our cruise, and will add more as time goes on.  With luck, you'll all be looking at pictures from the race festivities within a day or so of the event itself.  Won't that be fun?
