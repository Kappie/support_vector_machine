And to tell you the truth, I rather have a friend for life the a girlfriend for a few months than loose both my heart and a friend. I was really depressed for a few weeks after this girl I really liked was asked out, at first I thought "naw, I would have never had a chance". But then I tought, well se is happy, and to tell you the truth, if you really love someone you have to let go. One day I will ask a girl out. Bue when I do I want it to be the perfect girl. I dont want to get stuck with a preppy, i want to get stuck with someone who I can spend the rest of my life with. Any way if you red this far than sorry for wastign your time. But I would just like to end this by saying that the saying "Nice guys finish last." can't be more true.
