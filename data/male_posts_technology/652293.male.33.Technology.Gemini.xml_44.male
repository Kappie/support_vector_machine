Now, I realize that I initially linked to a somewhat (okay  very ) liberal blog, which then led me to other liberal blogs.  Generally speaking I would say that liberals oppose war.  Generally speaking.  I would like to see some conservative blogs; see how they are "taking" the war.  Maybe the Pope has a blog.  I'd consider him a conservative.  Oh wait.  He opposes the war.  So what's up with all those Catholics?  There's a lot of them.  Why do many support the war?  I was reading  urlLink skimble  tonight.  He(?) has a link to a site that shows some graphic photos from the victims of the war.  Military and civilian.  One of the kids looks kinda like Sagan.  Not realy, but she has those little teeth with big gaps between each tooth.  I don't want to link directly to the photos, because they are disgusting.  And that's not the only thing that disgusts me.  Mr. Cheney, Mr. Rumsfeld...  your revenge-lust is not just.  Sadly, none of these warmongers will ever face any sort of punishment for their crimes.  The commercial news outlets do not want to cover news.  They regurgitate what the government lets them.  In a lot of ways this country is a constitutional monarchy.  The only difference is that the national leaders aren't (usually) related to previous leaders.  They just all went to the same schools.  Their families summer together.  Most Americans look the other way when it comes to our government.  That would be me, too.  I have mentioned before how difficult it was to get involved in  local  politics.  I think the system is set up so that only those with connections or a great amount of ambition to get connections can be "in" the system.  I feel out-of-control when it comes to my involvement in this country.  I think "they" want it that way.  Actually, I just looked through my archives.  I never posted how difficult it was to get into local politics.  I really thought I did.  So, the following is the back and forth I had with the editorial page editor:   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Apparently, not only do the requirements vary, but no office seems to know all of the open positions.  Whether it is by city, county, or state.  I think this is strange.  Your editorial said, "consider getting involved in this important public service," but the process is so cumbersome (and seemingly still set up in the "it's who you know" manner) that I am not surprised at the small amount of involvement.   I don't think I'll make the deadline on Tuesday, because I cannot find out what is available for me in which to participate.  Someone at the Bloomington library took my name and address (but not phone number or email address) to "pass along to the mayor and tell her of your interest."   Maybe it's a good thing.  Allowing the general populace to demonstrate civil responsibility might muck things up for those currently in charge.   Thanks, though, for your initial follow up.   -----Original Message----- From: bwills@pantagraph.com [mailto:bwills@pantagraph.com] Sent: Friday, 17 January, 2003 11:31 AM To: Matthew Oliphant Subject: Re: "Don't overlook chance to serve on special boards" Editorial   The requirements for the boards vary so much that the best thing to do is call the entity in which you are interested.  For example, if you are interested in the Normal Library Board, please call the library.  We didn't put petiton specifics in our editorial because the requirements vary so much throughout our Central Illinois reading area.  I hope this helps.

Thanks.   _________________________________  Matthew Oliphant  interface designer et al.                                      From the online editorial  :   "Pantagraph Editorial  Friday, January 17, 2003  Don't overlook chance to serve on special boards  In a democracy, the importance of voting is frequently emphasized -- as it should be. But, voters also need someone for whom to vote. There's still time to get on the ballot for the April 1 election.   The filing deadline has passed for the city councils in Normal and Bloomington. However, the deadline for many other boards in the April 1 consolidated election is Tuesday.   These include boards overseeing schools, community colleges, libraries, parks and fire protection districts.  Many of these boards do not have as high a profile as city councils, but they are no less important. Indeed, it could be argued that such board members play an even more crucial role because, with the public not watching as intently, board members must be particularly vigilant to protect constituents' interests.   The process is not difficult. For example, candidates for the Normal library board need only 50 signatures on a nominating petition. School board candidates also need only 50 signatures.   Consider getting involved in this important public service."   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
