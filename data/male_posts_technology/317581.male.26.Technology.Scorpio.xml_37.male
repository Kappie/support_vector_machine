That vampire one was especially cool.  Those blood-sucking-demon-red-eye-people-who-can-fly-only-after-a-brief-transformation-which-looks-really-painful-only-to-get-chopped-by-a-scary/cool-vampire-girl are awesome.  I wish I had seen the whole thing.  Anime women are the best.  Anyway...  So here is my deep thought of the day:  If you could own a cheese factory would you keep it all for yourself?  Hmmm...    And now the real deep thought of the day:  Seems to me that no matter what there are times when we are happy and times when we aren't.  No matter what is going on outside my head all emotions really seem to balance themselves out meaning I think I get a pretty good balance of "good" and "bad".  So if I was rich and had everything I wanted I don't think it'd be all that different.  When people are sad all the time we call it depression, an unhealthy state.  Would it be true to say that constant happiness is also an unhealthy state?  Besides, would we really know we were happy if we were never sad?  Ok, enough with the seriousness.  WHOO HOO YIPPEE AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH HAHAHA WHOO WHOO WHOO YE HA HA!!!!!!!!!!
