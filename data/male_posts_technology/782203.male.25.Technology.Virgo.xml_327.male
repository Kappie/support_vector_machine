But the Thailand trip is just happening at the right time, I really feel like I need to get away from everything for a while. Even if it's only a week.   Watching Buffy on TV now but the damm show freezes every 10 seconds. It is so incredibly annoying that I feel like taking a bat to the TV. Lucky thing I don't have a bat.
