Again, some discussion about crime and politics in India as i was reading into news websites..but suddenly, don't know why, but started missing my parents.. Right now, i am sitting in my office.. not much of work.. 5.30 in the evening..thinking of pushing ahead of time ..but don't know why i am feeling to go home..feeling that i should leave my job and go back to my home in chandigarh.  my bro' has also shifted to gurgaon as he joined a company there so, my mom  dad are alone back at home.. was this the time for which they educated us , gave us everything , that one day we'd leave them and go on our career path leaving them behind...that when it is the time for them to rest and enjoy the ripe fruits of their hardwork they'd put in for us.. they are alone..  even on the phone, my mom asked me"Beta, it has been 10 months since you have been here , why don't you come for a week? we wish to see you". my dad said to me, " don't worry beta, we are fine here, concentrate on your work. we are always here for you?"  my dad saw a lot of hardships to raise us, he killed his ambitions and dreams so that we can stand on our feet. my mom sacrificed her career so that she can take care of us. and what we gave them ? loneliness...  Mom, Dad ..I Love you ..I Miss you too much..Don't worry ...I'm coming home next month..
