And just hearing the Dr. Who theme song makes me uncomfortable.  Recently, I decided to kill the first bird and wing the second with the stone known as  urlLink Lord of the Rings Risk .  My friend Mary bought this for her husband Eugene and the three of us sat down last Friday for a little game of Middle Earth domination.  First off, it's been awhile since I've played a game where the object is to wreck the other people.  Although we started off good naturedly, there was some tension as the little elf battalions started dying by the handful .  This was probably exacerbated by playing with a married couple ... lots of idle "If you invade Rohan, I'll divorce you" threats.  Also, even though we were playing the 'quick' version, it still took over 4 hours.  That's longer than the movie, for crissakes.  In the end, I lost horribly, Mary almost fell asleep and I think we all learned an important lesson about the futility of war.  Except for Eugene, who won, and would do these little dances after successful rolls of the dice.
