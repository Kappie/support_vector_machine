In English, we are FINALLY done with NFW (Night Flying Woman). We are still planning for conferences in advisory (mine is tonight at 5:30). Obviously after that is lunch and recess. ;-) Then in study hall I have to make-up some stuff in science. In art, we are starting to make these "pots" that we make out of "slabs." And then after that is science class. After that, IT'S THE WEEKEND FOR FOUR WHOLE DAYS!!!! The weekend: Grandma (and maybe Papa) are coming I think on Saturday. Hopefully I'll be able to go downhill skiing with Amit or a sleep-over with another friend. There is a ceremony this weekend when I get my art reward at the collage of art and design. I know there is lots more (like homework), so I'll tell you how everything goes! Have a GREAT day!!! :-) :-D
