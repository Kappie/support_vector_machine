I love my life and wouldn't change a thing  2. Whats one thing you really regret?  I don't think there is anything I REALLY regret. I have made mistakes but they have made me the person I am today and as I said above, I wouldn't change a thing..  3. Who's someone that you don't express your general appreciation for enough?  Jonny.  4. Do you believe in a) God b) humanity c) yourself  Yes Yes Yes  5. Where's Waldo?  He's hiding from me because he owes me €50  6. What was your happiest moment ever?  The day my dad told me he was proud of me and that he loved me  7. How does a guy with such a great Hot Or Not photo end up lying alone in bed wishing for sex?  To be honest I don't.. If I want sex it isn't really that much of a problem. It's the emotional relationships that are a problem..  8. What one-hit wonder group from the 80s would you ressurect?  Wax  9. What's your favorite smell?  Eh.. hehe, I know this is rude but, well, pussy. I love the smell..  10. Where would you like to be right now?  In bed but who wouldn't :)  Sorry, I know those are all terribly optimistic answers but my life is really that good..
