I hope it doesn't fly by, because then there's another A, B, A, B, A week after that. ;-) I have a huge 80-point Band Playing Test. Just to give you an idea how much it is worth - 100 points is a concert, and we have TWO every year. This Playing Test is worth 80 points! I have to play Simple Gifts (2, 4) [Marimba], Into the Storm [Temple Blocks], and Bleak Midwinter [Bass Keyboard]. Well I GTG now. L8ER!!
