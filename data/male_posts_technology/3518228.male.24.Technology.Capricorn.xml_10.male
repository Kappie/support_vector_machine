I thought I was being clever earlier in the year, when I purchased  urlLink  SBC DSL . You'll notice that there is a one-year contract required for that plan.  Since I am on a one year lease, that seemed to be perfect.  I found out today that they count that one year from the day they connect you.  There was some silliness about connecting my DSL last year. Apparently didn't think, based on their credit reporting company, that I would pay them.  Because of this silliness, they didn't connect me until 19 September.  So, in short, they now want to charge me $200 in termination fees .
