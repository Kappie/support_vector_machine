So what if this was an integral part of Chandamama or if you were a hardcore fan of ambulimama (two books that your grandma if she was a tam or similar books if she was Indian would have purchased for 25 paise....with garish art...and some fantasy to boot... ) and those authors just died of penury and hunger last week. This one is fresh. People just love it , never had they thought that human imagination could stretch into realms like black magic or witchery with a school for it, cows that fly - could you have thought about that , a game while you flew on the broom.....  This book is really amazing i tell you.The author has been acclaimed as some one who has redefined reading and its bounds. It has loads of fans in people who swear by it, quizzes where you can make it or break it with one reading.  I also met this guy , who hates the book. I have no idea why or how somebody could despise a work of art such as this. He says the world is dumb, and its probably because there are comprehension levels which are so low that people appreciate anything they can understand. I told him to take a hike , why such negativity ...why cant people just appreciate soemthing......after all it sells so much and somthing that sells so much can't be bad. They also tell me that the lady who wrote it is making a large dollar- one with quite a few zero's after it.  They said that for her next book she has two with quite a few zeros after it.What a book and what a well deserved fortune......
