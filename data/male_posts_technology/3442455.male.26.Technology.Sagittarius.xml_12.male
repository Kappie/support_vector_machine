I'm still reeling and exhausted and dizzy from the insanity and focus and concentration and energy I've expended over the last few months trying to create a single memorable and fun night for a few hundred people. I'd say it was a great success but I didn't really get to hang out with anybody or watch much of the show myself because I was busy throughout. There is all sorts of follow up that needs to happen and then I might have a couple weeks off, but we will start to work on the 2005 ECNY Awards pretty much right away.  I don't feel much like thinking about it at this point.  I'm pretty damn burnt out.  But next year's show will be amazing.  Promise.  We learned so much and have so many awesome ideas for next year. But seriously right now I just want to work on music.  I want to do that other kind of production.  I want to just focus on getting together a new mixtape to give out to venues so I can get some DJ gigs.  I want to get my band back in gear and fucking record our sick demo so we can shop it around and get some decent shows.  I need to make my time here more self-centered.  More selfish.  I need to be a lot more forceful about what I want for myself. I'm ready to put my stuff out there.  I'm ready to unzip my pants and pull out some sexual soundscapes. I'm ready to rock and shock the nation.  I happen to be so serious.
