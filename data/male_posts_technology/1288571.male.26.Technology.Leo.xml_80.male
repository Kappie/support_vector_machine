For instance..  1) This is new development. Because of that, all our driveways are dirt. Our houses were built through the winter and in the last 2-3 weeks, the snow has melted and what happens to dirt driveway then? Soft mud right?  Ok, everyone seems to want to drive up their driveway and leave massively deep tread marks. If thats not bad enough, they don't take a few minutes to fill them in! I'm waiting until the a rather warm day when the mud hardens.. then they'll have a bitch of a time filling in those ruts.  2) The people across the street were thinking a bit more than a few of the others in #1 above. They decided they'd lay down something so that they can drive on it and wont make deep ruts. Smart right? You know what they layed down? FUCKING BLUE TARPS!! Seriously here folks. A Tarp. Took 2 of them the better part of 20 minutes too. I know because I was watching and laughing the whole time. So what happens when they finally finish and drive on it? They get deep ruts but the tarp is between the car and the dirt.  They seemed happy.  @_@  3) Just tonight, its snowing and miserable out..high winds, blah blah.  Anyways, I happen to look out a window out front of my house. Next door neighbors have left the trunk of their van WIDE OPEN! Who the hell knows how long but lights were off and they definately weren't coming back.  After about 5 minutes of laughing, Mel convinced me maybe we should tell them that their van interior was getting ruined. Yeah, maybe. :D
