Beej, I've tried to tell you this before, but the whole "I'm the admin., bow to me!" routine has  got  to stop. Fast. Beej, dear, I love you more than a fat kid loves his cheetos, in as nonsexual a way as I can get away with and still get free office supplies. But, like Martha Stewart, I digress. What I mean to say is, the fact that you're the admin. is no excuse for the behaviors that have been exhibited over the past week, the google post being the first of said incidents. We’re a part of something that you created all on your own, your baby, and in that sense, yes you  do  have the right to tell us when we’re doing something that’s bugging you. However, shouldn’t the fact that we’re your friends count for something too?   I guess that I’m sorry that Karine and I aren’t too fond of pea green, and that we’re not exactly regular updaters, but hell, you asked us to be apart of this and we were happy to do it.   The nub and jist of all this is, we want fair treatment. Not to take control, not to run you into the ground like a frightened rabbit, but fair treatment. Fair enough?   "Because nobody likes unhappy employees…"
