I was helping my old company move offices and on the Sat Morning I had to rip up a quarter of the main office floor to move some power and network points.. My poor back has never known such strain..  Anyway.. To top it all off I had a tooth out this morning (Again orla was kind enough to take care of me again today.. I don't know what I did right in a previous life but the Karma overflow has been great this time round.. :P)  Think that is all I really have to blog for the moment. Gonna go get into my Pyjamas and relax for the rest of the day :P
