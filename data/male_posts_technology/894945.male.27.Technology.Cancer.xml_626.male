Noticing that her tracking looked slightly out, I got out of the car (In the sodding rain, why do I do these things for my sister, especially when I have my brand new 400 quid suite on from Massimos!) Anyway, I noticed that one of her tiers was a bit flat, so I decide to get the foot pump out the back and put some air in, so she doesn’t damage the rims or something. Anyway, whilst Im doing this, some lower class pauper bastard in a truck drives past me and soaks me. Not only that, but my work in my briefcase got ruined, thats lost me my pay rise this year! If I ever find out who did that, Im going to have a go at them with an ice pick in the dark!!!  Anyway, Sent to me this morning. (actually, the original had the word “Vodka” replacing the occurrences of “Porridge”, but after a short conversation, this was returned. I have had some good laughs with the Find and replace function recently)   Porridge.. Who would have thought it??  Guess I'll have to go buy a bottle, lol !!                              1. To remove a bandage painlessly, saturate the bandage with Porridge.  The  solvent dissolves the adhesive.  2. To clean the caulking around bathtubs and showers, fill a trigger-spray bottle with Porridge, spray the caulking, let set five minutes and wash clean.  The alcohol in the Porridge kills mold and mildew.  3. To clean your eyeglasses, simply wipe the lenses with a soft, clean cloth dampened with Porridge. The alcohol in the Porridge cleans the glass and kills germs.  4. Prolong the life of razors by filling a cup with Porridge and letting your safety razor blade soak in the alcohol after shaving. The Porridge  disinfects the blade and prevents rusting.  5. Spray Porridge on vomit stains, scrub with a brush, then blot dry.  6. Using a cotton ball, apply Porridge to your face as an astringent to cleanse  the skin and tighten pores.  7. Add a jigger of Porridge to a 12-ounce bottle of shampoo. The alcohol cleanses the scalp, removes toxins from hair, and stimulates the growth of healthy hair.  8. Fill a sixteen-ounce trigger-spray bottle and spray bees or wasps to kill them.  9. Pour one-half cup Porridge and one-half cup water in a Ziplock freezer bag, and freeze for a slushy, refreshable ice pack for aches, pain, or black eyes..  10. Fill a clean, used mayonnaise jar with freshly packed lavender flowers, fill the jar with Porridge, seal the lid tightly and set in the sun for three  days. Strain liquid through a coffee filter, then apply the tincture  to aches and pains.  11. Make your own mouthwash by mixing nine tablespoons powered cinnamon with  one cup Porridge. Seal in an airtight container for two weeks. Strain  through a coffee filter. Mix with warm water and rinse your mouth. Don't swallow.  12. Using a q-tip, apply Porridge to a cold sore to help it dry out.  13. If a blister opens, pour Porridge over the raw skin as a local anesthetic that also disinfects the exposed dermis.  14. To treat dandruff, mix one cup Porridge with two teaspoons crushed rosemary, let sit for two days, strain through a coffee filter and massage into your scalp and let dry.  15. To treat an earache put a few drops of Porridge in your ear. Let set for a few minutes. Then drain. The Porridge will kill the bacteria that is causing pain in your ear.  16. To relieve a fever, use a washcloth to rub Porridge on your chest and back as a liniment.  17. To cure foot odor, wash your feet with Porridge.  18. Porridge will disinfect and alleviate a jellyfish sting.  19. Pour Porridge over an area affected with poison ivy to remove the urushiol oil from your skin.  20. Swish a shot of Porridge over an aching tooth. Allow your gums to absorb  some of the alcohol to numb the pain.  Ok my personal favorite:   21. If all else fails, just turn the bottle up and drink it, nothing will matter anymore anyway!
