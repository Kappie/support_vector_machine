Monday's show was pretty good. Better than what I expected. When I heard that Eugene was going to be GM for a night, I really expected the show to be silly and stupid, even thought the WWE writers have proven that they know very well how to handle the retarded gimmick (must be because they have a long history of having experience with retardation).   Anyway, show starts off with several wrestler walking up toward the ring and wondering why they were called there. It's musical chairs time !!!  Okay, I must admit that I rolled my eyes when I realized what was going to happen. Musical chairs, in a wrestling program? Have they gone nuts? Oddly enough, the segment proved to be gold, given that the participants really knew how to make in interesting and funny. Who was there? Coach, Tomko, Tajiri, Jerry "The King" Lawler, Ric Flair, Stacy Kebler and Jericho. Man, the crowd loves Jericho. It was incredible the chants he received! Ric Flair also got some cheers especially with the stuff he was doing. I swear, this guy is not only a solid wrestler, but a solid entertainer. Also, Coach, Jerry and Stacy managed to get a few solid laughs out of the musical chairs segment. Ironically, this was probably the highlight of the night (besides Eugene's office, of course).   After that we have a world Tag Team match where the champions, La Resistance, defeat the team of Rhyno and Val Venis. I feel sorry for Rhyno. I really do. I think he deserves better. The WWE is making this guy look like a jobber and I'm sure, eventually, after they ruin his credibility, they'll just turn him heel.  We then get a segment with Batista, Orton and Flair visiting Eugene's "office" to complain and bitch. Interesting who Randy Orton is starting to complain about HHH directions for Evolution. Could we be seeing the first signs of a mutiny?  So, this segment was pretty funny, plus it set up a match that I've recently been interested in seeing: Batista VS Kain. Also, we get another match for the Vengeance PPV this Sunday. It's the unlikely pairing of Eugene and Flair VS. La Resistance. Interesting.  Good segment!  Next we have the match between Kane and Batista which, disappointingly, ends in a no contest when Matt Hardy interferes. Now, I know that they had to promote their match at Vengeance, but I really would have liked to see more of these two monsters beat the crap out of each other. My mom, for one, was terribly disappointed cause this was the match she was looking forward to all night since learning that the it was gonna take place tonight. She hates Batista and Kain because she thinks they are clumsy and bullies in the ring. She's always wanted these guys to get in the ring and beat the shit out of each other, but has also often said that the WWE would never permit this to happen. Well, they didn't cause just as the match is getting interesting, out pops Matt Hardy. End of match. Crap!  Intercontinental Champion Randy Orton defeats Chris Jericho is a good match with great crowd response. I think the crowd made the match, but it's hard to tell given that Jericho was on fire tonight. I think a lot of it was due to certain honors he had received before the show (something about a key to the city; Not sure, I think I dozed off here). He genuinely was happy to be there and it the crowed new it. It's been a long while since I last heard such an ovation. Impressive. Jericho must be very happy. He should be, he deserves it.  Next we have an interesting women's match to determine who will go against Trish for the Women's Title. Okay, first off, we have Victoria, Molly and Nidia... cool, but what in the blue hell happened to Jazz and, more importantly, Gail Kim? What is this joke? Gail Kim is HOT !!! She was looking pretty good in the ring. Then in the last PPV, instead of having a Victoria VS Gail Kim match, we have a four way match to determine the Women's Champion. Trish wins and out goes Gail Kim. What the fuck? This is such bullshit. Gail Kim must have refused to fuck the wrong guy back stage to be receiving this shit. This must be it, cause I haven't heard any recent controversies or injury reports related to her. So what gives? Also, Victoria is not at fault for the failure of her face turn. She had no material except crappy new music and some awkward dancing (which was reported as being her idea).   Anyway, it's a "Contract on a Pole Match"... Which makes me think where the writers of the WWE could stick that pole after the match. Pretty good match, none the less. Surprisingly Nidia wins. I was actually pretty happy for her. I thought that it would be good to finally have Nidia wrestling in a PPV, especially one that has so few matches announced. But, alas, I forgot we are dealing with the WWE and down comes Trish and Tomko no announce that the Women's Match would be for tonight. So, Trish proceeds to hit Nidia with a cast she has on her wrist (oh, yeah, Trish is injured legit) and then asks for a ring to start the match and pins Nidia for the women. Yep, the injured Trish is still Women's champion and, if that isn't all, there no longer is an announced Women's Match for Sunday's PPV. I'm sure they are gonna have some sort of women's match, probably will announce it before the start of the PPV, thereby showing who much respect the WWE has for the Women's Title Championship.   I'm pretty sure the WWE will just pull another four-way battle royal for the women's title on the PPV or on next Monday's RAW program. Either way, if Gail Kim isn't involved in that angle, you can kiss that sweet Korean ass goodbye.   The main event tonight is Eugene, Ric Flair and Triple H VS. Chris Benoit and Edge in a Handicap Match. Good match, with some drama mixed in. The ending was pretty cool with Eugene hitting Benoit with a chair to protect HHH. The crowd was really against Eugene here. I don't know what exacly is the HHH planning here, but it can really turn into a disaster. The crowd was really ripping into Eugene, especially when he hit Benoit. Turning Eugene heel so early could be a bad, even thought this could be because the WWE feels that people are starting to lose interest in the character and decided to add another element to him before it was to late. The storyline is interesting with him being an honorary member of Evolution and HHH using him to get back the World Heavy Weight title (how Eugene will help HHH get this is still a mystery to me).   It looks like HHH might see Eugene as a good addition to the team of Evolution, given the fact that he saved HHH from Benoit. This could be interesting given that it could lead to an Evolution break up. Still,we shall have to see how this develops.   Again, the crowd is starting to turn on Eugene, so we'll have to see if this new experiment works.  Well, that's it for the program, good show. I'd give it a B+ because the matches where good. I have a feeling that this rating is very generous given that the build up for the PPV was ok, but not great. Sure, the build up for the current matches was very good, but there aren't that many matches announced. The PPV should have at least seven matches and it only has five officially announced, which means it will have to throw together at least two more at the very last minute. This is not the makings of a good PPV. That said, the fave matches announced are pretty good. Let's see...  LA RESISTANCE vs RIC FLAIR  EUGENE for the World Tag-Team Titles:  Interesting team up. I like Ric Flair a lot and being forced to team up with Eugene for the titles could lead to a fun match and a future tag team title reign. I expect to see a lot of comedy here with Eugene and Flair winning to make an odd couple team up and, maybe, give Evolution more respect for the Eugene character. This is intriguing to say the least.  Now, don't get me wrong, we've seen this shit before. Recently, we had the unlikely pairing of Rico and Haas on Smackdown. The WWE loves this type of thing. But Ric Flair being saddled up with a retarded character could be gold. We shall have to see.  Then again, the WWE might smell shit and decide to leave the titles on La Resistance so they can feud with S.H.I.T (and Hurricane) for a few more months. *Sigh*  KANE vs MATT HARDY in a No Disqualification Match:  Matt Hardy needs some time off for knee surgery, so you can more or less predict the outcome of this match.  BATISTA vs CHRIS JERICHO  Jericho will shine, but he can do that going against a mop in a bra and panties match. No, the key here is Batista. Batista must really shine given that after the fiasco that was the HBK VS Batista match, the WWE has been holding this guy back. Little by little they have feed this guy small wrestler and had him tagging up with different members of Evolution. It's due or die here. I really hope Batista follows through and pulls out a great match with Jericho. If not, watch him shrink into oblivion.   RANDY ORTON vs EDGE  Randy gets a little better every time I see the guy. Edge is slowly getting back his... erm... edge. This could be a great match. Both are young and talented. I would except nothing less from these two.   CHRIS BENOIT vs TRIPLE H for the World HeavyWeight Title:  Why can't HHH just let it rest. It's like every single main event must be headlined by HHH in one form or another. All I know is that SummerSlam I want to see Benoit VS Edge, even thought they have already planted the seeds for Edge VS HHH, so I guess we'll have The Game win the fucking title once again. If not, we'll probably see Benoit VS HHH VS Edge for the title at the SummerSlam PPV. Still, as upsetting as this will be, we have to remember that the two HBK - HHH - Benoit matches have been gold. So, a threeway match for the gold at SummerSlam might not be such a far fetched thing for the WWE. Only time will tell.  On Sunday we'll have the Vengeance PPV. I won't buy it. Like I've said many times, I usually buy the event on DVD when it is release, but only if it's good. I will, however, comment on Monday about my impressions on the winners and my overall feeling of how the PPV came out. I will also mention if I have plans on buying the DVD or not.  WWE Bad Blood 2004 DVD will be released soon and I fully expect to buy that one and, if that wasn't enough, later this month we'll be seeing a Benoit DVD. And, boy, that one will most definitely look good beside my Mick Foley, Rey Mysterio and Ric Flair DVDs. When I get those, I will be sure to tell you what I think of each.  Well, that's it for know. See ya next Monday !!!    urlLink Sailor Ecchi
