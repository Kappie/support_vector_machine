So, I'm going to talk mostly about what interests me, and what I feel is the most relevant to fantasy basketball and the NBA in general.     As my profile indicates, I'm from Chicago. I used to live in Portland, Oregon. So there will likely be more analysis of the Bulls and Blazers than other teams. But I'm completely obsessed with basketball and the fantasy aspect thereof, so I assure you there will be all kinds of news and opinion.     I will beat the Blog Maverick.     Ha.    I am the Money Ball. Count it.
