Also in my typically unimaginitive way, I can come up with nothing better to say after this than a painfully hackneyed cliche. Better late than never, most notably. *sigh* Sometimes I dislike being me.  A lot of things have happened in my life, most not too dramatic, but a few intensely radical changes. Well, really only two. I finished school (for now, at least) and I got a job. More on these later, when it's not so late at night.  Moving along, since it's so damn late.... =-P On a very upbeat note, I will (hopefully) be able to meet up with the ever delightful Cathy E. tomorrow. (as an aside, why would anyone name a town "cazenovia"???) I can't wait to hear tales of her semester in Britain. I've offered to take her out to dinner in exchange for her indulging me with her company. I hope CJ doesn't get *too* jealous. =-) More about this will come tomorrow.  And lastly, this post demonstrates why I should *never, ever, ever* be allowed to write a conclusion before I write the rest of anything. Well, it's not really a conclusion as much as it is an observation that in the interest of not wanting to forget about the situation described, I neglected to realize that it would comprise half my post since it's so damn late. oops. Realistically, I know I have lots to say, but I'm getting quite tired and can't think of anything other than  rambling  complaining about why I should never do this again. *sigh*  On a more thoughtful note, or rather, to attempt to end this first post in a manner more gracefully than just stopping, I made an emergency late-night run to Tops tonight and left with a feeling of contentment and gratitude that I would not expect. No, it wasn't a random observation somehow related to the borderline inconsequential bulbs of garlic that I was suddenly in desperate need of. Rather, it was the conversation of the cashier had with the guy in front of me -- another person in need of a couple random items at 10:30PM. They were talking about the cashier's future plans, just the sort of conversation rarely fated for the checkout line. It was the sort of conversation that was meant to be had not with a stranger (which I'm not sure was the case, but nevertheless...), much less at a checkout stand. The cashier was talking about how she was looking for another job, ideally one that paid even a little better than minimum wage, which she'd then pick up as a second job. She was talking (not complaining, but merely talking) about how it's hard not seeing her family very much and about how she was working her current job as two (she's just getting off about now....the end of a 13 hour day). And she did it with a just enough of a smile and a sparkle in the eye that made you know that there was something that made it all worth it. I was amazinged not only by how eloquently, yet concisely she could convey all the emotion and exhaustion surrounding her situation, but also by the love and dedication she expressed. It also made me eternally grateful for my family and especially my parents, without whom, I would probably be in a similar situation today.
