This icon was a bad icon, said my raid mirrored drives had failed   So all day I'm thinking that my PC is running on one drive and I've got to take my PC apart and get the drive out, send it off for repair, wait ages for a new one and re-install it. Nope, lucky me, I double clicked on the faulty drive in my raid status program and told it to rebuilt the mirror and it did.  Don't know why it failed in the first place, but I'm fairly happy it's now rebuilt. I haven't rebooted since it happened, so I'm not sure if it's going to fail again.    Didn't go to see I, Robot. My mate said he couldn't make it and I was knackered anyway from driving to the airport to drop off Ann  Alex at 3 am. So I watched some TV and now I'm on my PC. Oh and I found some smileys
