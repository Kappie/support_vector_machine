One minute I'm sighing a sigh of relief at the end of a work week, and the next I'm thinking about having to get up early tomorrow and get back to it. If only Monday to Friday could go that fast...  Considering that I did  NOTHING  over the past 2 days, you'd think that they would have dragged by. Sure, I watched some hockey, messed around on the ol' computer for a while, read a book (kind of like a computer monitor, but the words are actually  permanently  typed onto papers, and these papers are all bound together). So, not only is the weekend gone, but I have little, if anything, to show for it!  Well, I guess that makes for some pretty boring blogging then, doesn't it?
