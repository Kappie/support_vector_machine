If i'm right, Ganesh is getting closer to stuffs offered in polytechnic schools.  his idea of "Work while u learn" is something very very very important, that has to be inculcated in our system......When students stand independently, they get the confidence to fulfil their dreams.....I really had that feel of personal satisfaction, when a group of us, worked in the Samsung exhibition.....  wanted to share many more views with you.....but, i don't know...somehow it takes a long time for me to type ...Xavier do u know typing?.....  I have my Dental appointment this evening (just the regural check-up  cleaning stuffs. It's just one of those attractive offers, our insurance company gives us). My dentist is a soft lady, who does her work so sincerely, that she flosses so hard inbetween my teeth  end up in making my gums bleed!!!
