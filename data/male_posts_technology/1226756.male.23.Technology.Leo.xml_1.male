Since I have made this, it seems only natural to incorporate this into another project. I think I will make an alarm, or something like that. I will also be making a small robot (read this : RoBUG). It will be self-powered, and search out light and avoid obstacles. This is a project lying quite a bit into the future, but I will make it. The JAL language is the best thing that has happened to me since I discovered the TurboPascal language. Now I can write my own stuff for the PIC, instead of building projects already made by others. I believe I will be starting the alarm tonight, and working on it during the weekend. I will also document the project with schematics, code and pictures. I don't have a homepage for electronics yet, but this will be up and running at a later time. The address to my site will be posted here on my BLOG.
