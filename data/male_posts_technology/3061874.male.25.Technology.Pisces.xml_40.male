The Federal Communications Commission voted to certify digital protections on TiVoToGo, which is not yet available but would enable a user to record and send a digital broadcast television show to up to nine other registered people who have a key allowing them to see it.  The approval came despite concerns by the Motion Picture Association of America and the National Football League about the risks of unfettered distribution of copyrighted shows and illegally airing sports games outside of authorized markets. .........   I think this is an important step for closing the gap between rich digital media which is controlled by media companies with the content on internet which is mainly text based. Media companies need to find more ways to distribute content via internet, making it a rich channel and also earn money along the way. In the long run, they would themselves in trouble if they don't open up.
