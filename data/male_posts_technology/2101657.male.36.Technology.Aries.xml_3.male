I'll start off a little about myself.  I'm a 35yr old Computer Tech, living in Dubuque Iowa.  I'm married, to Zelda (in-case you want to read her blogg, she's here on Blogger), and have 2 awesome kids.  We're all very active with Cub Scouts.  I have a few hobbies, so I'll mention them... I'm very into computers, hence my occupation. I seem to have a strange and twisted knack with them.  I've built more pc's then I care to remember since I started working with PC's.  I got started with computers in 1980 when I got my computer, a Timex Sinclair 1000.  Through junior high and high school, I took everthing I could about computers. In 1987 I went to school for programming, and that was pretty much all she wrote. I've been working with IBM Compatabiles since then, and haven't looked back.  I was writing about hobbies though, so let me get back to that.  My other primary hobby, would be Star Trek.  What can I say?  I love it.  I collect the Playmate brand Star Ship's, and also have the 2 released by Art Asylum.  I have various items around the room that would make it obvious that I'm too much into star trek... like the Star Trek clock, the 2 pieces of art, the mouse pad on the wall, or the Klingon Action Figure sitting on the korner of the desk?   Oh, not to mention the Klingon ensignia thats attached to the front of my monitor, or my DS9 Uniform top with phaser and tricorder?  Hopeless aint I? LOL   Lets talk Cub Scouts now.  I've been an active leader now, going on my 4th year. I've a Pack Leader now, and have had my current den of boys since they started as Wolf scouts.   We have a pretty fun time too! Personally, I think the best pack meeting is when we do Pine Wood Derby!  That is such a fun event, and the boys love it! Wish we did it more often.    Well, thats my thoughts for the day.
