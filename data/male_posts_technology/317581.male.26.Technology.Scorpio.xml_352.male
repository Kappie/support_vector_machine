We went to Hooters and McCormicks and Paragon and Pesos. Needless to say I had a lot to drink. Basically, I told Corry to take off saturdays so we could go to bars on hopping nights, but that's not going to happen.  Also, Cahlen is a mother fucker. He gets FFX yesterday, then he takes it home with him today. Basically, I hate him:P  I'm tired and my teeth feel funny:) Check you latah- T
