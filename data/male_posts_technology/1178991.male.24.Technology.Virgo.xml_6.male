If you're using TDD for design, you'll quickly need to use mock objects. The  urlLink MockObjects Wiki  is a great starting point.  Martin Fowler's  urlLink Bliki  has a lot of good information and links to other valuable blogs. It's a great place to stop by once a week or so. Be sure to follow at least a few of the links to other ThoughtWorks bloggers. We've all had to deal with the  urlLink BigBallOfMud .   urlLink Joel Spolsky's blog  is one of the best. Spend some time reading through the archives, you'll find all kinds of goodies.  Shameless plug: I occassionally post my thoughts at  urlLink stupidsimple.com . You might or might not find it helpful.
