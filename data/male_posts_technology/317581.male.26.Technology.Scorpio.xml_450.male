Move away and become a hard worker that has a passion for life? Am I merely asleep at the wheel? Am I dead?  Sometimes I wish I had a revolution I could be taking part in. Maybe there is an evil tyrannical man oppressing people somewhere that I could be fighting against. Is there a way I can divert my energy to help people? Instead of sleeping my days away in tired America?  Am I too fearful to be passionate? Am I too drowned in debt to try?
