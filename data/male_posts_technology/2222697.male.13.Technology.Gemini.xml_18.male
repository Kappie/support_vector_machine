Well BIG NEWS I've practically hacked the dbznetwork.net server there server only allows 15 downloads per person but i found a way to get past that. I use the URL's, they should have been smarter, but you dont even have to login if you go directly to the site because they only block the INDEX with passwords. So if you want to download the naruto eps for free, type in your browser window www.dbznetwork.net/downloads/download.php?naruto01 to get any other eps besides the first one change the last two characters to the number of the episode. so to get episode 34 you would type www.dbznetwork.net/downloads/download.php?naruto34 ok I'll post later. bye
