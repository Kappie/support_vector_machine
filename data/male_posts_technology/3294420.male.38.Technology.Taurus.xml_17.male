By Wed. it is supposed to be 90'. Sorry to hear that Maya took a back burner for awhile with her feedings and know that you are a little disappointed.  But one must remember that she would still be incubating and you wouldn't have had all this time with her.  Babies have a tendency to do things their way and in their time frame. Isn't it amazing how quickly one can come to love someone?  Glad you had a nice weekend.  Love, Ct Mom
