Today is youth choir practice night, and a possible meeting before to get admin things out the way, its the day when Abbevile memorial finally called  showed inteerst in hiring me for some dp work, and the day that I call the car people to set up an appointment for service. But, can't call them yet 'cause I dont know when I may need the car for other things later this week...certainly next. And I didn't talk to the hospital people, my sister did...so I tried calling back but the line has been busy all day. I got to thinking and now realize, the Smallville season finale is tonight! Tonight at 8:00. Practice is at 7:00 I believe.  WOW!  When you get some creative adversity like that in your life, let me know! We may have somn in common lol.  In better news, I finally got my game working (city of heroes). Turns out I was using the wrong password all along....figures. I've successfully created a version of my superhuman alter ego, Onijah Rowen. At his peak strength, Rowen has more Jedi-like sword wielding, uber agility, super speed, enhanced strength  choice psionic powers than anybody in the game. An expert martial artist...and he looks fantastic too. I wish it were possible to make a screen capture so I could show u guys. Maybe i'll take one with that crappy dv cam I got. Still need to get it fixed, can't playback video at all. Some have expressed that it seems i've been cloaking myself around the fantasy of the unreal, around the whimsical world of heroism. Hiding from the real world  seeking peace in an alternate reality.  NAAH! Yal read too many comic books!
