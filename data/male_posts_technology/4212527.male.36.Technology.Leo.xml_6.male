The best part (since there's no chance of me winning) is dreaming of how I would spend the money once I sold that  urlLink $1.1 Million Dream Home  or driving around in that  urlLink restored '62 Corvette . But I haven't had one single daydream about DIY Network's "Do it with Duct Tape" Sweepstakes. Grand Prize - $5000 in Duct Tape products. And still I signed up every day and made sure the contest was over before posting this (lest you sign up and become competition to my entry).
