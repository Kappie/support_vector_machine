Damn, I'm not too sure about american X-Mas traditions... is it that you celebrate on the 24th and open the gifts on the 25th?  Well, the german tradition is to open the boxes on the 24th, so it's perfectly legitimate if I open mine today, right, right, RIGHT?!?! Damn, I'm so curious!  I mean, dvl got my name, so the gifts just have to be purrrfect.  And awww, Jonnie's singing got me in such a festive mood, I had to decorate my computer:     I'm excited.  Somebody pass the eggnog please?
