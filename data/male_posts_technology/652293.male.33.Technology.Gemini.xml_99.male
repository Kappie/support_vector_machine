I didn't know the URL for the HCII site at first so I typed carnegiemellon.com in the address field.  But what I got was this:     Domain Not Supported   We're sorry, this web server no longer supports the carnegiemellon.edu domain. We ask you to please use the preferred domain name, www.cmu.edu, instead.  We invite you to send any questions or concerns to  urlLink webmaster@andrew.cmu.edu .     Notice the Web Master's email addy is a link, but the "new and supported" URL for Carnegie-Mellon is not.  I just love it when a site adopts a new Domain Name and doesn't support the old one.
