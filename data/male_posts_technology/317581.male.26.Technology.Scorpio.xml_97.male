For some reason my hair has gotten to a length where it feels like it wants to sit up and say hello to everything... who am I to argue with my hair?  In other news- I am delighted with the new star trek series "enterprise". I feel it had a good opener and enjoyed it very much. (Especially the oiling part:))  Well, off to work...
