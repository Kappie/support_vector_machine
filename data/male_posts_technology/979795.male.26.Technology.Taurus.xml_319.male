Yesterday he went through a bit of how uke should fall from kotegaeshi. Personally, I 'm never really good with taking slams unless nage is able to guide me down properly (think Syed tried one on me about 2 yrs ago). Maybe that's one point Alvin had noted during grading, that once we were into the thick of things, slams and footwork seemed to go all haywire. He went through the motion of how iriminage works and footwork. Seriously man, he just turn turn turn with such ease. Came back to try but I still felt a bit cuckoo just turning 3 times, let alone more.  Alvin also emphasised a lot on on feeling and leading the uke, keeping your hands in your center during iriminage, something I've NEVER been able to do properly and still maintain posture.  Paired up with 2 beginners who had taken their 6th kyu at the Sun grading. After that managed to pair with 'Daniel' o_O" ... for nikkyo somemore. A bit stressed sia, didn't wanna cause him too much pain so I went ultra slow and I didn't really dare to 'experiment'  too much, hyuk hyuk hyuk. The experience wasn't as bad as I might've expected and he was quite grateful too, kept saying thank you. But he was constantly asking about how to do this and that. Told him I didn't know that much either so couldn't answer him too much and just have to try and 'see'. After that paired up with a sec sch kid I think? I'm just guessing coz he seemed too big/tall to be in Pri sch and he had highlighted his hair a wee bit too much to be accepted for a pri sch I think. Then again these days, kids seem to dunno eat what one, they just grow at such a fightening rate. We experimented a bit more on the techniques we did.  While waiting for the bus home, Alvin trotted along. His student, a Japanese lady, was with him. She came down to have a look at our training it seems. Found out that Alvin was NIE trained, went into the govt sector, 'couldn't stand it' (in his own words  ) so he left and entered the pte sector instead. Since 97 he's been teaching Eng with a pte school. Most students are foreign nationals here in Singapore, like the Japanese lady, trying to master the Eng language or preparing to take some proficiency test. (Alvin mentioned TOEFL/TOEFEL, forgot the spelling liao since poly. :P)  Oh yar, saw Tommy and Karen there too. Hwah, everyone seems to be running all over for training these days.  Shitz man ... all in all I had such a wonderful time there and the other dojos I seriously dunno how I can train under Sensei, Sunny, Syed, Alvin unless I do it like 4 days a week which is financially impossible. Haiz ... need to be really specific about my choice of dojo liao. But once I enter SPF I got no choice but to train BB East coz there's Weds nights off and book out on Sats ... BUT IT WON"T BE ALVIN TEACHING!!! .... argh   ... And coz of my appointment, I'll be missing the end of mth combined training at BVCC tonight too. ARGH...
