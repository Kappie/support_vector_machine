When I try and come back to hotmail, I usually hit a damn sidebar by accident, then the whole damn email disappears. It's like, "look, FUCKERS, if you're gonna have advertising all over my email at least you could have it open a new window, so I don't have to remember what I just typed"  BASTARDS  So I went and got a grill from the house last night. Ended up getting the charcoal grill as it was 50 bucks and I had just spent a load at costco on junk.   I've been playing Star Wars galaxies fairly often. So that's something. Now if my room weren't like 5 billion degrees I could actually spend some of my time at home developing my character.  OK, it's work time. Peace out- Tim
