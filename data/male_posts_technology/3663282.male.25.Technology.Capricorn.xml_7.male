Just that I am still in the office at the moment, and am about to leave.   Am feeling quite tired. I may be catching something. A fever, maybe. I've been surrounded by sick people all week, so maybe finally I'm being infected by them. Hmmm... Reminds me of the movie "28 Days Later". But those people were infected with  rage ... and it's a darn good movie. Go watch it!
