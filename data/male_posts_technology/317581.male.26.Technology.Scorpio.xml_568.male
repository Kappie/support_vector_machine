I dreamt that I emailed Cassie and they were like, Tim I'm sorry, but I've been dating someone for the past month or so. It was so weird cause the email was just like, hey how's it going?  Anyway, I went to bed at 11:45 last night and today I'm surprising refreshed. Although I did wake up several times last night from bad dreams. The one above and another one.  Anyway, I need to get to work. Peace- T
