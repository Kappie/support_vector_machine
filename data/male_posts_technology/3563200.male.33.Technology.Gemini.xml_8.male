I was at a point in my career where I worked on nothing but licensed end-user products and consulting projects. I was somewhat oblivious to the words "free" and/or "open-source" other than my occasional tinkering with Slackware. I thought I'd try to understand those notions better, so I spent a lot of time thinking. Then I wrote this  urlLink essay about my thoughts on the subject .  I really think there is some liberal-sharing-utopian part of me that really wants to be involved in those sorts of initiatives. Those feelings were very much compounded when I met Linus Torvalds at a trade-show in New York when he was still with Transmeta. (the transmeta-powered IBM notebook I saw, btw, was running way-to-hot to be as efficient as was claimed). But five years have passed since I wrote that and I still haven't found a job that will pay me to write software that's free or open-source.  It's not that I don't like free software. As a matter of fact I do, I use it all the time, rely on it even. Furthermore, I've contributed some free software to the world, namely  urlLink Undox  and  urlLink Anole . It's just I've never been involved with a business model where I could do that continually and pay my bills.  My point? You tell me. :)  -Bruce
