By episode's end, Lisa's example inspires many of the residents of Springfield to start their own newspapers. "Instead of one big-shot controlling all the media," Homer says, "now there's a thousand freaks Xeroxing their worthless opinions."    It just made me think about blogging.  A lot of blogs out there, like mine, are truly worthless.  It really doesn't deal with anything important or life changing.  Sometimes it will feature something regarding current events but mostly it's just a stupid blog about what is going on.  I guess that is all I have for now.
