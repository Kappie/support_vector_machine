I think of it as a way to see everything in slow motion (which is cool now these days what with the whole "Matrix" craze). But I'd like to think that slowdown in videogames could be a figurative definition for my life. Sure it's sometimes fast paced during work, but once work becomes to much to bare, I slow down to a point where I can regain calm again.  Oh well.   Things to buy!  1). IBM Extended USB Keyboard for my desktop computer WHY?! Because I LOVE IBM keyboards!  2). Pay the car WHY?! Hehehe, that's pretty obvious  Darn! I really thought there was more to buy, but I guess less is better.
