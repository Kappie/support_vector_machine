Between my Virtual Environment demo sucking a big one and the trouble with my thesis, I can honestly say that today sucked. Alas, I am almost done with my Masters thesis stuff, just need one more signature. I am completely done with the academic world once I get just one, little, tiny signature on my ETD form..... Cannot come soon enough.  I need more sleep. I need more fun. I need a life.
