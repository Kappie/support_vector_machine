It was a horizontal escalator which was around 50 meters, you know like the ones you see at the airport but much shorter. I can understand the use of those escalators at the airport, its probably for people with heavy luggage but I can't understand what purpose it can serve in this case.  Anyway such a escalator would be more useful at Outram in my opinion, it's a  5 minute walk to transfer to the NE line from the EW line.
