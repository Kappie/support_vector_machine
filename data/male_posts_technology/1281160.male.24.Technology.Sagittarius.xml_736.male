RIni, how are your dance and music classes going on? Planning on any arengetram soon. Send me your contact no's. Kicha and Ram, you too send your numbers.   Last night, Saw "Alaipayuthey" for the n th  time, where n>20. This time on DVD. Though Rahman has mixed and improved the tunes of Alaipayuthey in 'Saathiya', nothing beats the original. The background score has the best till date from Rahman. Nothing to say about Mani Ratnam's direction and the camera-work by PC Sreeram. A wonderful story.   Tonight, I'll be watching "Kannathil Muthmamittal". The two movies came packaged as a single DVD.   Meanwhile, here are a few  urlLink things to do  when your net connection goes down.
