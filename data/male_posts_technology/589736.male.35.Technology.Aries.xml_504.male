I'm half tempted to start killing people for the injustice of the No-Steve Dell commercials as well...although, if I were going to start a killing spree for something arbitrary and stupid, I'd rather it be the "People Will Continue To Die Until Britney Spears Is Sent Into Outer Space Without A Spacesuit" campaign.  So at least it would be something I truly feel...  I, too, have an image of the guy being some pissed off white vet (as in Nam, not as in Dr. I Take Care of Cats...although that would be pretty damned funny, too)...  *sigh*  Stupid ole stupid.
