You don't even know what the fuck is causing it but you find yourself thinking about all the bad shit that has happened, you find yourself thinking what bad shit is happening and what bad shit could happen.  It's not a very good feeling to be depressed.  You try to reach out but find out that in the end only you can help yourself out.  You truly can't depend on other people because they have their own things to worry about.  I wrote and wrote and wrote last night and I feel better this morning.  I guess I wasn't that depressed last night or I was just starting to get depressed.  Maybe it wasn't even depression.  I just felt out of whack, I felt out of balance.    So it's a brand new week.  March 8, 2003.  Hopefully I am out of my little funk here, we shall see.
