Acetomidopropyl trimonium chloride   propylene glycol , D red and blue all suggest dark thoughts of suicide as I start to drink the vile shampoo   Tetrasodium EDTA , water (purified)  2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol  I think I want to run and hide or maybe surrender and end it all.  When I'm no longer obsessed with shampoo perhaps I'll study cologne for now your ingredients remain unknown  methylchloroisothiazolinone .  (ouch, my head hurts)
