Regardless, I'm unable to resist temptation and not download the playable Half-Life 2 leaked demo that this person managed to scam as well. I'm downloading it now and hopefully it'll be done sooner than later so I can see a little of what I can expect when the game is released this holiday season. Oh man, I'm definately buying this one regardless.
