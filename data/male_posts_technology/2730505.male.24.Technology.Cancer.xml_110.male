I mean from the moment we got there all that I saw were big girls.  I mean there were cute girls there too don't get me wrong but shit!  Not enough of them!  Besides the big chicks, there were also a few MILFs in the crowd.  I mean WOW!!!  Hot ass moms!  But that's about as HOT as they got!  I could count the hotties and cuties at the bar on two hands.  Shit!  Good things we don't pay for beer there anymore nor have to pay for cover.  Shots still need to be purchased.  So after paying for the first pitcher to look like we are buying, we got a new pitcher everytime we were low.  It was cool.  So after a few pitchers, I got bored so I started dancing.  It was shitty.  No one on the dance floor could dance.  I could see that the people were having fun and that was cool.  The others who thought they were good but weren't were in need of a little shaming.  So there was this one guy with his shirt unbuttoned and a black wife beater on with big baggy pants.  Ghetto ass motherfucker.  Just one of those slimeball peices of shit.  Yeah you know what I'm talking about.  Yeah, he had an attitude that he was the best dancer there.  So being the jackass that I am, I went ahead and copied his moved right behind him.  He would do that fag twirl and eventually twirl his way to that he was facing me and I would just stop.  My buddies were cracking up as well as the other people around us.  The guy actually thought he was being watched because he was good.  He would crack his neck to the right and I would be right there with him, he would bounce his shoulders and I would bouncing them at the same time.  People were just pointing and laughing.  It was great!  He was oblivious to what the hell was going on.  Eventually, the bouncer crept to where I was and I just thought that was a signal that I should stop.  I mean this guy has it out for me.  That fucker last week told me to put my hat straight (it was straight, I don't know what he was talking about) or else he was going to throw us out.  The he went over to Jerry to tell him to put his hat straight.  It was!!!  We both had it straight!!!  Damn fucker.  Last night maybe I can understand since mocking people will uually irritate them.  Oh well, whatever, I was having fun.  If it's too hot on the dance floor go to the damn bathroom.  We then retreated to the bar and chilled out for a while and eventually went home.  It was an alright night out.  I wish there were more people who can actually dance and I can learn from.  Got home and really wanted to call you.  I'm sure you were busy so I didn't.  It's finals week and things are hectic.  I didn't want to take anymore of your time that you need to use for other things.
