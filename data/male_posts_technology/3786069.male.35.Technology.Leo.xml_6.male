Before we left we were told that 8 people were coming next week. Personally even though we were running around like ants on hot cement I’m glad we had a smaller group. It helped up to bond easier and quicker.  First there’s Rocio (that’s Rose-e-o). She the adventurous explorer of our group. She’s been everywhere from the Brazilian rain forest to dog sledding in Scandinavia. And she takes these trips on her own. We also call her the Spicy Latin lady as so is very independent and knows what she wants out of life. Single guys she’s a great catch if you can get her down in one spot for any length of time. I think she’ll do well on this project and in the Middle East, as she is a very personal and friendly person. I’ve actually known Rocio for over a year now as she sat a couple of rows over from desk at my last project I worked in San Diego. It’s very reassuring to take this assignment when you are with a friend. I hope we actually stay together when we get deployed into the theatre. We help each other out a lot for support, as it would be very stressfully otherwise. I say this now before I’m actually deployed but I hope I can continue to say it the duration of this assignment.  Next there’s Jim. He’s the experienced, calm military guy who reassures us that everything is fine. I like Jim because he’s a go with the flow kind of person, much like myself. He’s not opinionated or self absorbed which is perfect for our group dynamics. He’s from Panama City, Florida and has a very pretty daughter who is half Haitian. I’m still getting to know Jim but I’m sure if we stay together we’ll be good friends throughout our stay.  Then there’s me. Well you know me. I just look to meet learn about people and their lives (sometimes no matter how kooky they are, and trust me there are some real winners out there). I think if there is one thing if more than any other thing (of coarse besides the financial reward) is that I get to live in another country and truly deal with and work with different people. This was actually something I wanted to experience when I was in the service but I unfortunately ended up back where I grew up.  So this is our ITT crew. If I don’t stay with these guys I’ll never forget the time we had where it all started for us at CRC.
