Yeah - slaver was prevalent - in many   countries and civilizations - yeah it was wrong and   was a dark time in our history - but ITS OVER!!!   People pushing for equality are  more prevalent than   ever pushing that mind numbing shut you up philosophy   of race baiting conversations and censoring free   speech by pushing the PC views we have been inundated   with.   I have several black/hispanic/and a few asian   friends. I do not look down on them at all - I see   them as equals - and they are in every sense.   They are on my level intellectually, socially, and   in most cases economically.  The people I look down   on are the loud, brash, annoying people who play the   race card effectively ending all discussion.   "I'm right because I'm... 'insert racial minority   here.'"   "And you better shut up and let me talk because your   grandaddy owned my grandaddy"... and so it goes.    Let me restate this... MY ANCESTORS NEVER OWNED   SLAVES!!!  Ok - that behind me - we are truly in a sad state of   affairs. Why should anyone get a job/a college   acceptance/a step up in line - based on racial   preference and profiling? Thats stupid and just   completely backwards to the idea of promoting   equality.  Does anyone else see a problem here?  I   don't even think your race should be listed on any   federal documents - they shouldn't be able to see any   of that for any inclusion in any process. How does   allowing for open spots in universities for a certain   number of race accomplish anything?  They should get   your name, grades, essay, and list of activities and   accomplishments.  Thats it - that is all that   admissions should require - and be privy to in any   institution.   We need to promote healthy competition - not racial   infighting.  Would you rather meet racial quotas in   your business or hire people based on their   experience and capability of performing the job? My   dad went for an interview and the interviewer told   him he was next in line to be hired - but they had to   hire a racial minority and a woman to fill government   mandates and turned him away!!! WTF?
