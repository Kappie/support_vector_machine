While it's not exactly moblogging, I am mobile amd I am blogging. so, today in band we were all up on stage playing, and Edie and Thomas have a duet for Awards concert on Tuesday. Edie plays clarinet, like me, but is first chair.(Unlike me.) She's infuckingcredible at playing. When I get home, I'm going to let Maddie out and then go to make some bike jumps somewhere with Poncho. There's nothing like typing on your Treo keyboard to keep you occupied while you walk home. Anyway, soon to come, I will say some things I want to say before summer. Stay reloaded!  -beej
