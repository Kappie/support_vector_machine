Arrive at STOMP only to find out that apparently there's a time restriction on our tickets where you have to show up 1/2 hour early (not what I was told over the phone when I made the reservation) Decide to see Lord of the Rings:Two Towers instead. They're sold out for an hour. Wait in a bar until just before the movie only to find out OUR tickets are for the OTHER Loews theatre 2 blocks away (despite saying we didn't want that show) Rushing to that theatre. The movie was great, but by the time we get out, we rush to the Port Authority only to find out that their subway stop is closed late at night, causing us to miss the last train back to Jersey and wait in Penn Station for 3 hours... All in all, quite an odd night.
