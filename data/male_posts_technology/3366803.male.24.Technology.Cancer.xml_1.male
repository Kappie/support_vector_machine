Meanwhile, the New World has its own acronym starring those same four letters.  NBIC : Nanotechnology, Biotechnology, Information Technology, Cognitive Science. I wonder how many people will still be struggling for control of the bombs, bugs, and poisons when the world shifts under them? I wonder how long it'll then take for them to realise that it has?
