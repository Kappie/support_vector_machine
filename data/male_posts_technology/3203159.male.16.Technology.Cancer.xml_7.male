I love Soundgarden, so of course I jumped at the chance to get the first Audioslave album (Lead singer of Soundgarden, band of Rage Against the Machine).  Good band, but they need to come into their own.  I'm sure the next album will be  very  nice.  Also, I loved the song Slither from Velvet Revolver, which is a pretty recent band, they've been together for a while touring but they FINALLY released their CD yesterday, entitled Contraband, featuring Set Me Free (theme song from the movie The Hulk) and Slither.  The lead singer is that from Stone Temple Pilots, and the band of Guns n' Roses.  Let me say, after touring these guys really have found their own.  Great band, great CD, they just sound great and have a good style of music.  Give it a listen.
