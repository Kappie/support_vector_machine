But none worse than Haiti and the Dominican Republic, which as of this time, more than 500 people have died, not counting at least a hundred still missing. Most of the people who died were sleeping when the flood hit their town, making it virtually unescapable.  This weekend was a rainy one here in Puerto Rico, with a couple of flood warnings here and there. I never thought it could be enough to kill people. Just comes to show you how deadly nature can be, and how sudden life can change for anyone. My thoughts and prayers go out to everyone who lost someone over there. We're so close to them, yet I feel far away considering how much damage was made.  Life is very precious, treasure it forever...
