Nancy was throwing up in the lounge cos she is really ill, she has been up since 3am crying, she is so hot you could fry eggs on her, and she has been sick numerous times. Also she is being very "mummyfied" today, and won't be in a room without mum, so when we were eating lunch she was sprawled on the sofa. Which wasn't a good idea, seeings as she could see and smell the food.
