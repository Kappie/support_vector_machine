I also have to go straight to a meeting so I haven't got time to read it now before I post so you get the pure, Mike at 4AM Drunk after being in a strip club.. Usual Disclaimers apply before reading further..  So..  It's 4:35 AM and I'm more than a little bit drunk\disorientated..  I'm writing this on my home pc to save to disk and stick on my blog in the morning so ignore any\all spelling mistakes and weird comments.  Tonight I went to my first strip club, it was an interesting experience. Jonny decided he was determined to get me my first ever lap dance.. I know a lot of people will be surprised to know I have never been to a lap dancing club before but hey.. Looks can be deceiving..  Anyway, Jonny decided for me on a nice girl (and I have to say.. she was incredibly cute) and she came over and invited me to a back room for a "dance".. I said ok and wandered towards the back of the club when she mentioned it was 100 Euro for "15 minutes"..  WHAT?!?!? €100?!?! Oh god no... so politely turned her down and she goes on to tell me it is 75 Euro for 10 minutes.. "no Thank you" And so she drops the price to €50 for 3 minutes.. At that I just return to my table.. Then The J Master has other ideas.. he goes up to her and pays the €50 up front and she comes down and invites me to a "private area"  And this is where things got very dissapointing.. I have to say my "dancer" was incredibly cute but it just didn't really get me going really.. The whole dance was very "nice" but it didn't really turn me on more than the basic "wow.. nice breasts.."  Maybe I just wasn't in the right frame of mind but to be honest it was less than I would have expected from something that should have made me feel sexually frustrated for the next few weeks minimum..  K, I am going to bed now.. I may blog again at some stage if I actually get it together enough to actually post this blog in the first place ;)
