Carnival games, bonfire, wagon ride to the trail, lots of lights and effects in the woods.  I was scared.  Recommend thinking twice about entering the house at the end -- in the middle it is pitch black in an enclosed space with no reference point, and if you're prone to claustrophobia or are afraid of buried alive, etc., take the "Chicken Trail" that goes around it.  I would not recommend the attraction to anyone under 8 years old.  Includes graphic stuff, like an automated body, bag over its head, moaning and writhing from where it is suspended by its feet in the trees.
