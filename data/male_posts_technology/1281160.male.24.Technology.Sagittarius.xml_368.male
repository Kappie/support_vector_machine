Am chatting with valli on Y! msgr... am mailing kavi and having a mail-conversation with her... am doing a "middle-man" making kavi chat with valli... am checking my mails in all my IDs... am listening to "Paint my love" by Michael learns to Rock...and am answering some questions to my teammate...   Today was another very taxing day with the project... just one of those times... hmmmmmm.......
