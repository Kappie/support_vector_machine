Trying to understand the mechanics of e-commerce has been very interesting so far. It's amazing to see how you can break all the geo-political boundaries and start wondering about what's legal and what's not. For example, if I want to sell services (deliver gifts etc.) in India, it's quite easy to set-up a website any where in the world and start selling and accepting money via credit card. There are millions of Indians across the world, who shop on similar websites and send the gifts to friends and family in India. Not to mention, now-a-days, there are quite a few folks from India who have started to spends some bucks on the net. The funny part comes in where you start looking for ways to get that money into your Indian bank account. Usually, the cheapest gateways to accept credit cards online is though services like PayPal etc. But most of these service can't talk to your Indian bank account like they can to the US counter-part. So, unless you have a US bank acount, it get's difficult, not to mention possibly illegal, to get money from you PayPal account into India. It's almost scary when you start thinking about it, that you might unknowningly get into trouble. It all looks like you can do most parts of the process straight forward, but it's hard to find the resources on the net that tell you what part of it is not violating any laws of the land or for that matter international trade.
