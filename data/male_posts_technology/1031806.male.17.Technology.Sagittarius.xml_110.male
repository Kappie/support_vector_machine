Yesterday, we met at the high school campus at just before 8 o’clock. We left shortly there after, and I spent the bus ride (about 1½ hours) sitting beside Gwen, playing badgamen (spelling?), and several different types of card games for the majority of the time. We got to the camp, unloaded our stuff, and walked out onto the beach (not just the two of us, for that’s against school rules *lol*), and recorded random people doing random things (I brought my camcorder – *yay*). I had to go help serve lunch pretty much right away, so I headed back to the cafeteria in around 20 minutes while Gwen and Lisa (her best friend at school) walked all the way out a huge rock about ½ to ¾ a mile up the shoreline that everyone’s taken to congregating at. I attempted to help out but they already had enough sophomore volunteers (the sophomores were in charge of serving lunch), so I tried to get to the back of the line. For some reason, one of the staff members of the camp told me not to go all the way around, but to just get into line right there, so I was the third person out of 145 (approx.) to get food *lol*. After we were done eating, we all headed across the small field / play structure / basketball court to the chapel hall.   Ok, hands down, I was not prepared for that chapel. I am usually a fairly introverted person when it comes to things like raising my hands when singing, and for that matter, even singing with my full voice: but not so yesterday and today... I was totally into the worship, and wasn’t at all apprehensive about letting the whole room know it. (The awesome thing about it is that basically everyone in the room was acting the same way too, pretty out of character for my school.)  After a brief message from ...some people... (I don’t remember who), we headed out for what was supposed to be organized games outside, but the constant shifting every hour from a 60º torrential downpour, to 82º blazing (relatively) sun kinda put a damper on that idea. Instead, people broke off into a several big groups, two of which went out and played the traditional beach football and walked to the rock again, respectively. I was in the “rock” group. Everyone messed around for a while, while I recorded their antics (Butters trying to throw huge sticks... or small logs... at a rock ledge more that 80 feet away, Trevor getting pelted with huge dirt clods, and people juss generally having a good time.) Oh, Gwen got a really cool picture on her camera of Grace, Young Hee, Butters and me, positioned in such a was on the rock that it looked like Young Hee and I were standing in Grace’s hand, and Butters, in mine.  Close to 4:30, the juniors, of whom Gwen is one, went back to the cafeteria to set up the decorations for the traditional “mystery dinner”, which turned out to be, not a ‘70s theme, but an ‘80s prom theme... but I’ll get to that in a minute... ‘Ne way, I was trailing behind Danielle and Gwen, who had made off with my jacket, and run a considerable length down the beach, back toward camp. As I was attempting to get my cameras in order and run to catch up to them (something they were trying to prevent by looking back frequently and running forward a little when I got too close), and something suddenly distracted me. Completely forgetting about requiring my possession, I veered left, up onto a sand dune, and sat down and started praying and singing.  I was doing this for a while (prolly close to ten minutes), before Gwen noticed I wasn’t trailing them anymore, and came looking for me. (I found out later that she thought I was sad or distressed about something by the way I was sitting, from a distance... hehe :) far from it - God is amazing.) She gave me back the jacket, and I just stayed there for another several minutes before the next wave of my peers came walking back from the rock. I got up and joined them, and several of us (Trevor, Butters, another freshman and I) grabbed part of Butter’s stack of explosives and combustibles, and set some stuff on fire over by a little river’s outlet into the ocean.  Later, most of the guys in our little “rock group” went back to the massive sophomore / junior guy's cabin (actually a converted gathering hall), and watched my video up to that point, and listened to cds for quite a while. Then, we went to the senior cabins and watched the senior guys punch each other until they blacked out. ...umm... smart... yeah...  The dinner was fun. We all got into two lines outside of the cafeteria: girls on the right, boys on the left, with seniors in the front, sophomores in the middle, and freshmen in the back. When the juniors opened the doors, we realized that members of the opposite gender were going seat us individually. Secretly I was hoping that by some ironic Devine calculation, the lines would match up and Gwen would seat me, but no, when I walked into the door of the “banquette hall”, my arm was draped through Ali’s, not Gwen’s (whatever... it was for like, five seconds anyway *lol*).  The skit if you will was based on a prom, complete with the crowning of seniors for different things. Later when we were eating, Gwen came over to our table and danced a little to the ‘80s music filling the room. Hehe, I got a picture of her in the light blue green dress and that *cute* little pigtail or whatever that she was wearing off to the side of her hair.   Later, we had another chapel that was really my highlight of the trip. You could almost feel the Spirit of Christ flowing through the room as a tangible entity... I was completely broken down at one point, kneeling before the “alter”, with my face on the ground, weeping, crying out to God, begging Him to lift this burden of thoughts and deeds off my back. As I was singing again, I felt a sudden peace rush over me, and a wonderful feeling of ease and comfort and the knowledge that God was there to help me (Me, o wretched sinner that I am... to think that He’d love me... I cannot even begin to fathom it.). As soon as this happened, I couldn’t stop thanking God, it was like I literally couldn’t stop. I gave no heed to what was going on around me; singing or praying or both, I don’t remember, but I just kept praising God under my breathe for what seemed like seconds, but Gwen told me later that it was quite a while.   I can’t remember right now exactly when our Student-Body-President’s sermon was, in relation to the worship, but it was really cool. He was talking about how Jesus has called us individually to Him, and how His word should he like honey to our eyes. We should treat it as such – hungering and thirsting for it as we do for our physical food. He had a couple honey jars (jugs, pots, little plastic things that you squeeze?) passed around the room, and we were supposed to put a drop on our finger and lick it off when he said too. The illustration behind this was another illustration - apparently when young Jewish children would start to memorize the Torah (at age 5 or 6 or something...) the Rabbis would coat their slates in honey to represent physically, what we should think about what it teaches us spiritually.  Once he was done, we continued worshiping till around 11:30, and broke off the get some snacks and other things, the go to bed. I was still in a daze from the singing, and just got out the door, closed my eyes, and walked, thinking about the night. Next thing I know, I was at the base of the massive sand dune that borders the beach. I walked up it and just gazed at the water for a time, then headed back to my cabin, then to the cafeteria to grab some apples, then back into the fellowship room to grab all the stuff I left in there, then said goodnight to Gwen, and headed back to out mega cabin.   I finally got to sleep about on 1½ hours later, when we duct taped Alex’s mouth shut, and his hands and feet together.  I woke up at 6:30, got up, got dressed, and headed over the cafeteria for Chi Alpha (the school’s bible study that usually meets on Thursday mornings). Once that was over, I ate breakfast, went for a run on the beach, and made a trip back to our cabin. Once I got back to the cafeteria, I immediately noticed that Gwen was  finally  up (well, she has an excuse – she took a shower). We got over to the chapel, where we spent not 1½ as originally intended, but three hours, during which, we had even more worship, and this really tight bus drive named Roland played his harmonica with the band.  Then we made the speediest exit in Faith Bible history (after the longest chapel in Faith Bible history, on a retreat with the least amount of people not there in Faith Bible history), packing, taking pictures on the sand dune, cleaning the cabins, loading the U-Haul, and boarding the buses all in under 25 minutes.  Once we were clear of Wi-Ne-Ma soil, we headed north several miles to Tillamook, home of the Tillamook Cheese Factory. We at lunch in the Factory (which is actually a museum of cheese, and once again, I found it funny that we completely overran the place with Faith Kids. :)   Hehe, I got some good pictures of Gwen, with sunglasses on, sticking her tongue full of ice cream, out at the video camera.  On the bus ride home, I sat beside Gwen again, playing more card games and other random things. Oh, Butters and Josiah were on one of the other busses (there were four total), and we made use of my and Josiah’s FRS radios to talk to each other the entire way home.   ________________________________________________________    Something offhand that stood out to me was a comment that Gwen made on the bus on the way back home: Adam was really tired, and was sitting in the isle beside Gwen, resting his head on her leg. She had been bending down rubbing his hair and massaging his back for quite a while, and she randomly looked up at me and said something along the lines of: “Armaan, don’t get jealous, I’ve massaged your back too before.” She meant it in jest, I know, and, if I remember correctly, she was also wrong – she hasn’t given me a backrub before (...well, except at Young Hee’s party, but that was only enough time for her to ask me if I was ok, and me to lie in response that I was). But, no matter whether she was right or not, it got me thinking about us over the last day or so. I’d hugged her three times in less than an hour (and we never hug – we may have done it six times since we’ve known each other), and throughout the retreat, she had been acting affectionate toward other guys (mostly comforting them during worship), and now she was giving Adam a backrub. ...ok anyway... the point I’m trying to make is this: There was that retarded micro paranoia of mine about showing physical affection toward her that I think I might have suddenly gotten over, and then there was that stupid territorial mentality that had been keeping me distant whenever she was interacting a large amount with other guys, that God, I think, helped me through too.   Oh, one other slightly insightful random thing that I wanted to mention: When I got into the chapel this morning, I was looking around for a little while, and couldn’t find Gwen, so I sat down in the back row like we’d been doing before. Lisa noticed me sitting back there, by myself, and invited me to sit with her and Adam, so I switched spots to sit there. Then, looking around the room from my new vantage point, I spotted Gwen, but she already had Josh (a senior) and Young Hee sitting beside her. I juss assumed that she didn’t want to sit by me, like sometimes happens in the chapels at school, so didn’t do anything. Later though, after chapel she acting indignant - almost annoyed that I didn’t sit beside her. That was kinda the first direct indication I’d gotten in a while that she wasn’t just putting up with me sitting next to her all the time, but that she actually wanted me too, so that sorta made my day slightly happier (how it got happier from what it was, I do not know... maybe happy is relative - you can always have more... hmmm must ponder that.  On a similar note, I had a great time at Gwen’s youth group on Wednesday. I met Kevin and we seemed to hit it off without a problem (at least I like him...). *lol* I also met several other of Gwen’s friends, one of whom offered me a Krispy Kreme doughnut, and another, slightly quirkier one, who seemed to have a controversial opinion on... well, everything (lol). I prolly wasn’t helping much though, since I was so tired, and would say stupid things that would egg her on. Worship was sweet, and the teaching was tight. We watched two video clips: part of some REALLY random movie, and part of Braveheart. Her mom came to pick us up, and as we left, I waved to Kevin, and he waved back, smiling.  Funny, even I, in all my optimism, didn’t think the night would end that way. (Well actually, it didn’t end there – Gwen still had to ask her mom if I could come over and help her make brownies, her mom still had to say that she was too tired and take me home, and Gwen still had to come in for a couple minutes and say hi to my mom before she could leave, and the night would really be over) *lol*   Ok, I’m really dizzy for lack of sleep, and even though this says that I’m posting on Friday, I added a ton of stuff, and finished at 2:16 a.m. Saturday.
