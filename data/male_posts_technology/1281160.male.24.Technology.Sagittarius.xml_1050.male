(Branding etc... ) since I couldnt find in the current page, hence had a look in to the archives as usual... but noticed its upside down... Thatz the reason I bugged it today instead of the same during ur layout review......  Gud Man, that  urlLink blog  has grown a lot with large no. of posts... its around 3 weeks back I had a look when u categorized things over there.... yeah, there I noticed the archives are in normal way... r u using Javascript over there?  coming to "Thoughts", I have to think later!!!  Then info_logs shows the frequency of visitors is getting to average level this month, isn't it?  Cheers
