He also told me that my cholesterol level was "excellent", which was encouraging.  Nothing to be done about that damn cough, but its not as bad at the moment... I hope its getting better.  I also watched some of  Transformers  Season 2.  It seems I've been overtaken by nostalgia as its largely awful!  The scripts are appalling and the animation is often terrible.  Makes me wonder why I used to like it at all...  Didn't get round to starting  Armor .  Ah well.
