And always I dream of a home, one in the future, one where I'm me and I'm with my best friend all the time and I can just be and I don't have to explain or feel small or stupid.  I want to go home, too.    And you do matter, love, you matter to me a great deal.  More than anything.  You are the most important person in my life.  I couldn't do it without you, I really couldn't.  Thank you, thank you for being who you are.    I know how tired you are, tired in a way that sleep cannot touch.  Tired in your soul.  You aren't selfish, you aren't childish...you're just trying to be you, to be the real you, the you you've become.    Sorry, this is probably way more reply than you ever wanted, but I can feel the pain in what you've said, and I hate to see you hurting.  I just want to reach out to you, to ease that pain, to brush your hair with my hand and somehow make you happy again.    You are always in my thoughts, and in my heart.
