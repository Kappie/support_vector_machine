There were these comments by people who were offended by the phrase "us and them"(us= south indians  them=north indians...sidin is a southie). So I decided to pen  my thoughts on the thin line that divides us andthem.     I've always been a proud Indian and no matter what happens this isn't EVER gonna change. To me India is India and there was no division between the north and the south. Well, I saw a whole new world from the day I set my foot into the USA and until date I've been perplexed. What is wrong with us Indians???     My first few days in Lowell were for some reason spent exclusively with southies(not that minded it). It was in a way a blessing in disguise coz every other northie that I bumped into would patriotically whip out a few lines in hindi and all I would do was stare back at them with a blank face. I would have to put all my poor brain cells to work extra hard when they exceeded more than a line in hindi(the first line is usually a "kaise hai yaar" or a "kaise chalraha hai"). I could deal with that. I ran into serious problems when I was expected to understand more Hindi than that(I've improved now...can actually talk a few sentences...also taking lessons in punjabi and gujju...comon the gals r cute). All my replies to their enquirieswould be in English  I would get a frown in return. Well, many of them mistook my replies in "angrayzi" for arrogance. The truth was that poor me didn't understand a d*** of what was coming out of their mouth. You could talk to me for five whole minutes and all you would get in return was a blank look  an occasional nod of acknowledgement(not that i really understood a thing).     After those inital days I got to meet lots of northies. Soon, something became evident. I was the only indian kid who did not know hindi and that was no fun. All the other southies could atleast hold up a conversation in hindi...not me. I soon became the laughing stock. On Independence day two years ago, we were playing dumb charades and the movie was "Nache Mayuri". I put my brain to some extra work wondering what it meant. My only question was if "Nache was sing or dance". After a little self fought battle I ended up tossing a coin within  concluded it was "SING mayuri". I probably should have kept my mouth shut but ended up blurting it out to the guy next to me...it is sing mayuri rite?? What do you expect after that?? I would have done myself a big favour by rather digging a grave for myself. The differences in the languages was definitely not helping. In tamil or mallu, "chumma" means simply (or) for the heck of it. That is not the case in hindi. It is a regular usage in the south. For 22 years of my life I did not have issues using that word but it was beginning to drive away all my chances of hitting it off with the female species out here. It also became a major concern for the guys. The northie guys freaked out when I used the word. I don't blame them coz if I was a northie and was say playing tennis  some dude came up to me  told me " Do you wanna chumma play" (all he means is do u wanna casually play..no harm meant..lol) I would've vanished from the face of the planet to end up hiding under my bed in mars praying to the almighty to keep him as far away from me as possible(YESSS, I know it is legal in mass  I've had a zillion gal probs but then I'm STILL straight people).     The initial days were definitely fun-filled but things began to change. I noticed this clear distinction between northies and southies. What was even worse was that gujjus wud stick with gujjus  golts with golts. Not blaming them. I'm sure it wud've been the same with mallus or punjus or whoever(easy to pick on the two coz they form the majority). It didn't make too much sense to me at first coz I do have northie friends back in madras and all of us gelled in really well. The problem here was that each one would sit  *itch about the other. And I noticed that it was more the case with the northies than with the southies (damnn.. I hate myself for having to use the terms southies and northies). I am not making this claim coz I'm from the south. It is a fact. In fact over the last year or so I ended up making 5 north indian friends for every south indian (lots of gals included..so no complains..lol). If I am to count, I will end up with more northie friends.     Various incidents over the last two years have pushed me to the point where I get very defensive when it comes to people ridiculing the southies. It is fun to a certain extent but when things are blown out of proportion it begins to prick you a little too hard to sit quiet.    The first complain every northie has is that you don't know hindi. Yes, I agree it is the national language  and also it is wonderful to know a whole new language. But then, for heaven's sake it is not the end of the world. I at times get dirty looks from people, like as thought I had commited the cardinal sin. Comon, I'm almost 24 now and have lived with it all my life without losing a single hair coz of that. Do I ask you to speak tamil or mallu?? Hell no!!! If you speak it good otherwise its still good...lol. I don't look at you like you are this big sinner. And for all the northie-hindi faithful, there are places in the north where they don't talk hindi. Interior Maharashtra for example, not all speak hindi..rite????? That is just one example. I'm a mallu but born  brought up in Madras and hence speak mallu and tamil. Say I was born in Africa, I would've probably spoken swahili or zulu or yauma or God alone knows what...so just give me a break.      The next big hit are the movies. I do agree that Rajni has proven all laws of sciences wrong. But then, comon if James Bond from Hollywood and Mithun from Bollywood can do it, why not our good old "Superstar" Rajni?? Never am I going to rest in peace if people claim that South Indian films are under-par. You would probably lose count of the number of tamil films that have been dubbed or remade into hindi. The reverse...hmmm yet to begin me guessing. Almost every other year you have a mallu film(which i wouldn't recommend watchin' for pure entertainment sake..lol)winning a national award. Yeah that reminds me of a claim that Sandeep's roomie once made. According to him all films from the south are porn. And for all you know the dude has never watched a single film from the south. Yes, mallu land does boast of having the largest porn industry in the country and BIG pornstars like shakeela (u guys heart her.. don't you??). All those who have secretly watched Surya TV on sunday nights raise your hands!!! Well, if you have not burst out laughing in a long time, wait until you hear this. There was once this hot debate, the topic.. damnnnn "who is better Bappi Lahiri  Anu Malik or Rehman". Enough said.. I'm closing this movie thing for now.     I could go on  on, on this topic but its only going to send me sooner to my grave( I can already see all my friends ganging up on me).Why such divisions?? We claim to be a secular country and boast of "Unity in Diversity". So, let us live upto that and keep our flag flying high.NO southie..NO Northie.. jus INDIANS. Doesn't that sound better??   PS: I hated the usage of the terms northie  southie. It was easier than using North Indian or South Indian. Also it was solely for the purpose of the blog So, please don't send me hate-mails...lol. But please do comment.. Also, I might have been biased towards the south. So all my friends from the north, if you do have anythin' to say please go ahead..its gonna be funn but then heyy.. no war though huh :)..its all in good humour.
