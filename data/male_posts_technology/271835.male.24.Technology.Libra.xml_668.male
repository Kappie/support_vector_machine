Which might have been a good thing if it wasn't for the fact that it made George Lucas really rich and made him think he could interfere with the production of a film until he turned it shite. Jar Jar Binks anyone? Ewoks? They were GL's inventions.  Apparently the  urlLink new one  is in danger of being  urlLink spoilt too . Some people think  urlLink George Lucas must die  - I think that's a bit strong. I would say 'George! No!' and merely give him a slap. Probably.
