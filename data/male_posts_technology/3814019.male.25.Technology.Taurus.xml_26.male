Well I have never really suffered from all that, I mean lets face it, I could rant about anything and everything. I just suffer from being a lazy swine.       I have been badly afflicted with this curse since a child. I like to call it the sod it syndrome. I often come up with great schemes and masterplans, think them through to the smallest detail, then along comes the little voice in my head, takes one look at my schematics, gives a little knowing chuckle and shouts "sod it, read a book dude".      I have a cunning plan for capturing this little voice and getting him to stop squatting in my head. Sadly, I have a funny feeling he will tell me to sod it...      anyway!      today's rant...       Management       Now I have probably waffled on about this kind of thing before, but sod it its my chosen specialist subject and im in the big black chair so im in charge. I have a manager at work, he should probably remain nameless, but for the purposes of this rant ill call him Brian. I would give you his surname but sadly I cant spell Cadwallader. Anyway I digress. Brian oozes ineptitude like a geeks face oozes puss. This man seems to be under the ridiculous impression being hated is a good managerial trait. Well I don't know about you but I always thought traits a manager would want to have might consist of such things as organisation, man management skills, unflappability (might have made that word up) and above all else, common sense.       Who wants a manager that looks down on everybody and tries to make them feel small for the sole purpose of making themselves feel bigger? Who wants to be treated like a child and reprimanded for chatting to someone? Who wants to be managed by a short, balding, squealing, attention seeking moron? Please, who wants him? Because they can sodding well have him.
