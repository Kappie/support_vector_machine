Plus Jean was really tired which = snoring. So I slept in the guest bed for part of the night.  Workout: 5 min Stationary bike 10 bicep curls 10 triceps pull downs 10 Sit-ups 10 bicep curls 10 triceps pull downs 10 Sit-ups 8 bicep curls 8 triceps pull downs 1 'huge set' of 5 crunches 5 leg lifts 5 crunches 5 leg lifts 10 min stationary bike 10 min treadmill  Post Workout Notes: Kind of a light day which was good given I was tired. Amy told her vacation fill-in that you can tell when I'm tired and that I wasn't afraid to let her know.   I opted to do 10 of treadmill just to mix things up. It was good since at the point my feet started to bug it was time for me to stop. I also talked Kathleen Q's ear off while she tried to do her interval training next to me. It made the time go faster.  Need to take a big walk on Monday to get my work in. Sounds like I'll be pushing the boy around the 'hood.
