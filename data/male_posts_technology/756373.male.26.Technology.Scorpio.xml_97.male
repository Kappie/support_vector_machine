Test pilots will likely continue to shoulder the burden of undertaking the risky study of new prototypes but part of the equation of the rational consumer is that they'll also demand high safety standards relative to the price they're willing to pay out so there will be expectations.   That being said, there were higher rates of failure with early mass travel models and there will inevitably be accidents in space as well. When the first one happens, it will be front page news especially as a result of its novelty value compared to modern air crashes. But provided that their frequency reaches and then follows a similar level of failure as compared with everyday air travel, the public will be willing to accept it, as it hasn't stopped them on normal airlines and Columbia hasn't stopped NASA entirely either. The brave souls will also be more likely to shoulder the risks than the average person (who can initially afford such trips)."  Wayne makes a poignant point. Disasters didn't stop the air-travel industry from belly-flopping. Which is strange, considering how the crash of the Hindenburg basically single-handedly put an end to that specific mode of mass-transit.  Maybe it's just a case of how high-profile such disasters are, such as the Hindenburg and Columbia were. Had SpaceShipOne crashed and burned, I'm sure it would've set the industry back tens of years. That it succeeded instead, may make future failures irrevelant.  I am, however, concerned that this is not the quite the late 1800's or early 1900's, where no expense was spared by the pioneers of that time. Today's private sector is an entirely different creature, there's just so much more competition. If companies start jockeying for the space-tourist trade, to undercut each others prices they very well could quite easily and intentionally sacrifice passenger safety. This world of today is also a lot less tolerant of death, accidental or no. 60 years ago, a hundred thousand men dying to take one beachhead was shrugged off as necessary. There is no way in hell that would be accepted today. Instead, 500 Americans die in the space of a year in Iraq, and the media likens the 'quagmire' to Vietnam every chance it gets. We've come a long way - even the  slightest  failures are no longer tolerated.  But there's a lot of passion there, I'm pretty sure (as Wayne is) most of humanity would be willing to take the risks assosciated with space-travel. It's our generation's frontier - something we've never really had. I suppose we'll all be willing to embrace the danger for such a magnificent payoff. I'm not sure if I, personally, would, but I'm certain merely the existence of thrill-seekers with loads of spare cash -like Mark Shuttleworth- will keep the development of the private-sector space-travel industry going.
