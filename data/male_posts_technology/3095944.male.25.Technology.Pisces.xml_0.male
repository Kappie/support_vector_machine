Believe me, I maintain at least 7 email accounts from at least 5 providers. Even if you get all your email accounts from one provider, say Hotmail, logging in and logging out from one account to another could get annoyingly repetitive. And it's not like you can open multiple browsers and login to all your accounts at the same time (Yahoo and Hotmail get quirky when you try to log on to more than one account at a time).  This is where my cool discovery comes in: ePrompter! This nifty utility helps you check all your email accounts (webmail [most popular providers] or POP3). It sits silently (read: no nags, no ads, no spyware) on your system tray and simply signals you if you've got mail. You get an audio signal and the tray icon cycles thru the number of new email that you have in your accounts. Each account has it's own color so you know which account has new mail. You don't have much option for the audio signal, though--you only get 2 choices of sound or set it to silent.   ePrompter isn't just another email notification app. You can read your email from it (plain text only) and in some cases you can reply from it (I found the reply feature a little buggy).  I know most email providers have their own notification apps but those of us who use several providers might want to centralize everything. I know I do. Check this utility out and I'm sure it'll change your every morning routine! Oh, and did I mention it's absolutely free? Coolness!   urlLink http://www.eprompter.com/   Screenie of this extremely useful app:
