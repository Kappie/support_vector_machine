I was told they recruit JOs every month. Haiz, guess I'll just keep asking whenever fairs like these pop up. Went with Tang actually. After that we went over to the libray @ Esplanade. It was one of the 'noisiest' library I've been actually. Coz being some kinda cultural / music hub, they had a malay dance/performance that afternoon. We hung around discussing about some of the politics, rumours, and different styles of Aikido. Even discussed some of our own perception and understanding of Ki, etc. Tang knows a lot. But what I like most about his training is that he kinda learnt by feeling rather than what I'm going thru now. I feel like I need to be told what I should be feeling for.  Not having a really great start to the week actually. Had 1 class followed by 1 meeting with the Pri 4 teachers. I didn't hold this one very well as I'm not sure what to expect and how to go about doing this. But the teachers were really nice and I think they were one of the easiest to speak to.  Next were the Pri 6s' teachers. Tracey was around to help. Really depended on her a lot throughout the meeting. She was really able to push for the eLearning. At elast everything seems to be scheduled rather than get pushed back.  I had my first Pri 3 class just now and they were a difficult bunch. They've reached the age where they can understand you but simply don't just because they think that they know better. Naturally a lof of double work was done. Rule of thumb I learnt. Treat them like Pri 1s until they prove themselves otherwise. Hmm ... maybe I should apply this rule to all of them instead.  After that I had my meeting with the Pri 4 teachers. Only met 4 of them. 1st mistake, I had overlooked informing them this was a meeting with ALL teachers of that level. 2nd mistake, I caught most of them at really bad timings. 3rd mistake, I didn't get my stuff ready before the meeting. Basically this was one of the worst meeting I had. Can feel the teachers actually trying to shove work to me. As much as I'd really like to help them with their stuff. It most probably won't be possible because I'm dealing with every level. I really wished Tracey was around to ofer some help then. I'm sure some would give her some 'mian zi'. In the end, the meeting turned out to be a waste of everyone's time. Nothing concrete was arranged. It was more of 'Let's wait till 2 wks later after sch reopens and we'll see what and how we can do this.' Sigh, seriously lor. I can tell some of them quite resistant to the new system. At least if Tracey was around, she'd know what is considered reasonable and how to compromise. A lot of things I don't know about the teachers and education sys in the sch now, so I'm unable to 'insist' on certain things. I guess I just need to make more friends with them lah. Bo pianz.  Got a class now in fact. P1s, the adorable bunch. Haha...  Meeting cousins (Shouming and Shouwen) for dinner later. Basically just a meet before the latter goes into NS and give him a treat for his As.
