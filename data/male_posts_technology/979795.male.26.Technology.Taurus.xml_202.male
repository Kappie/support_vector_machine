Basically I typed a bit of stuff just now and they're all gone now. I'll try putting the stuff down below again but I won't bother to rethink my exact words.  Busy weekend. Tomorrow morning need to go down town to buy meat for the week's cooking. After that need to come home and go back to Uni to do some work. Been lagging behind lately and I'm panicking. Daniel, my housemate, was asking if I'm swimming also. Doubt it. I'd rather get a bit fatter if I can clear up more of my work. Anyway, I still go Aikido so I dun feel like I'm being really slack or anything. But I sure do wish I'm keeping up with my swimming though.  The girls (housemates) today were really noisy from dinner onwards right till just now. Dunno why they're so hyper. In fact, got a bit irritating for awhile. But sounds like things have settled down a bit now. Think worst thing is that with their high pitch voices they tend to be a bit noisier when they are slightly hyperactive. Guys (like David and I) can get loud, but not really noisy I think. Tried doing my essay just now and I only kinda got 1 paragraph done. Need more time and effort or I'll never finish my 1st essay this Sun and start on my 2nd one. ARGH!!!  Sigh, really dun feel like missing any Aikido coming week. We'll be doing nikkyo this Tues I think. And the Tues for the week after, there won't be any class. Think Sensei Pauline's going out of town for awhile. Just got my bokken from Sensei last Tues, really wanted to refresh some stuff that I'd learnt in Singapore but my living room isn't quite high enough for me. If weather was warmer I'd do it in the garden. O yea, and must remember to watch Donavan Waite's Advanced Ukemi this weekend. MUST REMEMBER!
