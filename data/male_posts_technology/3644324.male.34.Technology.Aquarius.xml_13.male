As you are all aware and delighted\dismayed by,our team of:      swill throwing,   clog happy,   insult dispensing,   lazy D-ing,   disk dropping,   crotchety old,   falling down for no apparent reason,     dudes and dudettes has been elevated to the status of "Kings of Ultimate" (okay King already had this status but that was a gift from his parents, this honor is a gift of the VUL). At least I'm interpreting the decision to put us in Div 1 as an acknowledgement of our most regal and hallowed standing.    I anticipate that our upcoming competition will have been forewarned of our unique offence "the Swarmation" and will be busily formulating a counter - possibly along the lines of trying desperately not to giggle as we run willy-nilly back and forth across the field whilst never making eye contact with the possesor of the disk. You can also rest assured that our much vaunted "cup yells indignantly at the mids - mids tell the cup to shut up" defence has been the subject of some consternation amongst the Thursday night elite.    I look forward to seeing you all at Slocan C on Thursday. I especially look forward to seeing you all at the drinking establishment of our choice afterward when we can re-live the halcion days of Div 2: remember when we had 3 Lisa's and 2 Geoffrey's on the field at once, remember when Roger made that throw and then he ran and then he stopped and then he ran some more, remember that red-headed girl with the smiley crotch, remember when Paul did that thing and we all laughed, remember the dog that poo'ed on the field?????.   Fair thee well until then,   Glenn   P.S. Go Swarm! No, no, go longer, ....., longer, ....., wait for it...., oops sorry, turnover.    P.P.S. Lindsay, I found that oil\grease remover, sorry I forgot to bring it to practice on the weekend like you asked, I'll have it there on Thursday.
