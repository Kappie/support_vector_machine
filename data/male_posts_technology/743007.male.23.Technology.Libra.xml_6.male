This cause error in all the records for 4 days.  As a result, i'm arrowed to do an extraction in the database on all data for those 4 days. the table is very huge, few hundred thousands of records. We don have any index key to aid the extractions. all we know is that whatever record added during that 4 days will have error.  So I wrote the sql statement which select the data that were added for those 4 days. If you know SQL, u would know that searching huge table without using index key could take several hours. but we are left with no choice.  But as I was writing the script, my colleauge notices that the database server is very slow. So i didn't run the script after i finish. I waited till around 7pm when the server is back to normal speed and i excute the script. knowing it will take several hours, i went home hoping to see the result the next day.  When i came back the next day, my script wasn't completed and was killed by dba. argh.......  then my friend frm other dept told me that yesterday's slow down of server is due to some pple doing huge query. can't be me, cause i did my query after the slowdown. until i saw the incident report that was being submitted to the director, did i know that my name is in the listof pple who did huge query that slowed down the server.  but the server slowdown was at 5:30pm, i ran my query at 7pm. it can't be me. and my query has the 'where' condition, unlike some other query which is without the 'where' condition, just selecting the hundred of thousands of records.  this is so unfair. the dba did the scan thru the database after the server slowdown and got my user id. surely it's not me tat cause the server slowdown. yet my name is in the report and i have no way of explaining myself.......  and if u look back to the top, i have to do this stupid extraction because of an error commited by the DBA, and now i'm being bitten by the DBA for doing correction mesures for THEIR error.  is the world still spinning in the right directions???
