Who knows, some day in the near future we may be taking vacation cruises into space just as we take cruises on the ocean. With talk of colonies on the moon and Mars, we may need ships like this just to get to work. =) How rad would that be?  Read more on this  urlLink here . They have a few more images, but here is one that gives you a view of the cockpit and the pilot. This was taken during their last test flight which took them up to around 40 miles. Their goal to reach is appx. 62.5 miles of altitude, which they plan on reaching on this next flight.        -intX    Some people call me the Space Cowboy...
