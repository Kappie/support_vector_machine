This month both me and my wife (in an effort to catch up bills) scheduled a HUGE payment from 2 different companies.  Both on the same day.  And neither of us told each other.   So now we have to play the dollar juggling game (not nearly as fun as the name may sound on its own).  I think we should be able to do it but im going to have to remove the money needed for gas in the car before anything else comes out of this check.  We cancelled our gym membership that was costing 55 a month.  It was just wasted money since neither of us ever went.  I think i have been a total of ... 5 times since we started it almost 2 yrs ago.  Lisa may have been there 8.   At least that will be out of the way.  And Gen Con is going to be paying me as a contractor soon for moderating their forums and being the "indy contact" with my friend Spicer.  So that should help a bit anyways.  I think my wife is going to try to do some massages (massage therapist) and make a little extra money. Hopefully she can get a few clients to help us out.  We are in the process of looking for a new car still.  Even though we dont exactly know whats going on with the ins. co.'s about the accident.  We cant wait forever! We have pretty much decided to go for the Buick Century.  It is a bigger sedan.  Considered "full size", which we need.  Especially since I dont anticipate that Rune will be our only child.    *more later*
