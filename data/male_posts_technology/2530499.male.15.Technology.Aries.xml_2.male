I have my banner ready to give to Mall Monkeys, I just need to wait for my Norlarco funds to transfer into my PayPal. Then I'll go buy ad space on MM and buy Christmas gifts. Anyway! Jacque dearest is still banned from the computer because of grades, and until she is re-allowed on she won't be able to post. I invited her.  Onto teh good stuff!  Seinfeld. Do you watch it? I do. Kramer ROCKS!  Also: Whaddya think of Put Title HERE? Email me at:  urlLink Mail me. Be honest. And I swear, if you sign me up for crazy mailing lists I'll have Tux, the Linux Penguin ban your IP to hell! TO HELL WITH YOUR IP! Thanks. Really, I just wanna know what you think of my blog. Criticize me. Don't flame me though. FKM'rs SUCK.
