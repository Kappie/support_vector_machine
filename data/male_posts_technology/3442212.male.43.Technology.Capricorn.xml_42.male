Most ignore him until he moves on, but some -- out of compulsive politeness, or because they have somehow mistaken this raving for a sincere query -- begin to reply "No, I'm waiting for my --" at which point the man icuts them short with an impassioned and spittle-intensive "GO TO THE LIBRARY!!!"    I dunno.  Call me cynical, but I just don't think Seattle's literacy program is all that effective.        - Matthew Baldwin,  urlLink Defective Yeti
