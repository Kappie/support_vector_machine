How about we accept the fact, and grow up. How about we start making our own rules? Why not give the illusion that I know what it is about and move on. These are the thoughts now what will they be when another tragedy happens. Can I stand fast? Well, I am starting with the addiction I am most convicted about and solving it. This is my start, what is yours? What will prove to you that you can succeed? As we grow these things get harder and this is what separates the kid in us from the adult. Were our parents taught this? We will never know, because we will not ask and they will not tell. The greatest generation lookson us as unguided with no purpose. Well, yeah!    Parents, drugs, work, the opposite sex, life are our topics that we speak around the bowl. How do we act? How do we have fun? Is there really another way? Regardless we move toward the end of the greatest, world wide empire that has ever existed. Math has been taken to a level that was never imagined by people even 10 years ago. Old news is the fact that I can talk face to face someone located twelve hours away. My car now gives me directions to the restaurant it made reservations for. Is this really needed?    This takes a lot out of us. Why aren’t I an accomplished millionaire at the age of twenty one? I guess one day maybe but that isn’t good enough. Our parents gave us what we wanted because it was easier, and now realize that they now have no retirement and wonder why. We are starting to realize that this is not how the world works no matter if we were brought up that way or not. Injustice is double sided. Where do we go from here?
