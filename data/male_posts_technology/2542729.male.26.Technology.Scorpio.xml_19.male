I've been so many things to many different people (speaking in reference to one who wears many hats, thus, carries different titles / associations). The latest transition has seen my development into a soldier capable of providing a difference in service to his country in Iraq. To those who are somewhat behind, I leave tomorrow. The irony of the whole situation is this whole thing still hasn't hit me yet. I still don't believe that this day has come, and to these terms, and at of all times in my life...now!  But such is what it is...so be it.  I'm convinced that God gives his people what they need at the times when they need it the most. I'm convinced I believe there is a God that works behind the shadows, doing work that no man has considered, and perhaps never will. In so saying, it has become apparent in my life that God has given me what I needed, carefully placing individuals that provide for my common welfare  self preservation  encouragement that may find themselves either permanent fixtures in the world of Ron or merely "war buddies", such as exist in the military consideration. I anticipate finding out a lot about myself in these coming days  weeks...praying that most of it will be good, but in all things, according to God's divine will.  To all who may read...keep me in your prayers.
