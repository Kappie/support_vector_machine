Well, I had gone to the Diocese trying to participate in the youth group program since I had such a great experience with it growing up in NJ. At the time, they didn;t need any help with that, but they did need CCD teachers. So... I agreed to teach 7th grade CCD for the Diocese of Pittsburgh, and found it unfulfilling - mostly because the children knew so little, I expected too much, and  many of the parents didn't teach their children anything at home. uugh.  So, I started looking for other, more effective ways to contribute myself and my mother suggested being a big brother.  I looked into it for a while and eventually found Holy Family Institute.   urlLink Holy Family Institute  (HFI) is more or less an orphanange.  They house children that have been moved around frequently and have no where to go... or children who have unstable homes.  I've had two children so far: For a while, at first I was with a child named Ray.  Ray later kicked another kid in the head without being provoked and had to go to jail more or less.  Then, after a few months I was presented with the opportunity to mentor Danny.    Danny and I "clicked." We would go out all the time and do things - go to the movies, play video games at my house, go to the museum or the science center, etc...  After a while, Danny was doing pretty well and got the opportunity to leave HFI and go to an assisted living program in Beaver County (almost 1 hour away) with a high budget.  So off he went and now shares a whole house with one other child. HFI asked me if I'd like to take on another child, but I decided to stick with Danny and focus my attention on him. In the new placement, he is constantly supervised - most of the time by 2 staff members, and pretty much gets all you can ask for (when he's good).  On the other hand, he seems really lonely and he is sad about his family sometimes (can't blame him).    urlLink      When he first moved to the new program I could still take him out and do things with him... until we found out I wasn't supposed to.  So... the only way that we could figure out for me to have the same relationship was to go through getting certified by Beaver County as a foster parent.  It took me about a year because of bottlenecks I experienced. Druing that year or so, we would talk on the phone and I would go see him sometimes, too.  When I would visit, we would play video games together and pretty much just hang out.  I took Danny out for the first time in a long while in April. It was great.  Now I wish I had more time to spend with him...  When I went to the Cake concert, I thought it would be something Danny would enjoy doing.  So, I decided to take him to see Hootie and the Blowfish since they were playing the next night.  I was hoping to pick him up at about 11:30, but ended up getting there at about 2:15.    On the way to Pittsburgh, I got a speeding ticket. blah. 81 MPH in a 65 MPH zone... how beat is that?!?  Anyway, we got down there pretty early, and there was a lot going on because the 3 Rivers Regatta is also going on and - so we had a pretty full time together. He are the highlights:  I brought along a blanket for us to chill out on in the grass there at the concert. So we picked a good spot to put it down and went walking around. It was a  hot  day. The first thing interesting that we see is a navy helicoptor show.  They demonstrated a rescue mission by dropping two people in the water and "rescuing" them.  It was pretty neat.  I caught a lot of it on video.      urlLink      urlLink        After walking around a little bit, Danny bought himself something to eat...    urlLink      After he ate we walked around some more and watched a Jet Ski race and freestyle show.       urlLink        urlLink      urlLink        In the meantime, Danny see one of his friends and goes over to chat and hangout.  He's standing in the wet zone and get's soaked from head to toe!  It was hilarious!      urlLink      urlLink        We walked around a bit to see if it would help dry Danny off. While were doing that, special operations troops came by to visit:      urlLink      urlLink        The Hootie and the Blowfish concert started at about 8:00 so we sat down and chilled out for a little.  My friend Heidi came down to visit with her friends Jenn and Jenna.  Jenn is the one in the light blue and Jenna is the tall skinny blonde:    urlLink     urlLink     urlLink       After the concert, Danny and I waited around for about an hour trying to get a picture with Hootie and then gave up. oh well.  I dropped Danny off and then went to meet Heidi and her friends out at DejaVu.  Heidi and her friends left the concert before me and went to the bar at the Hilton nearby.  They met an older couple that was visiting Pittsburgh from Ohio for vacation and I guess Jenn invited them to come out to DejaVu with them.  When I got there, Jen's husband Bill was there too.  He bought me a round and we went dancing.  The woman they met in the hotel was really drunk and was hitting on me and all these other guys on the dancefloor.   She was crazy!  She actually got annoying after a while, haha.  Heidi and the annoying drunk woman  urlLink     After DejaVu closed, Heidi and I went back to Bill and Jenn's apartment with them and chilled out.  We watched Scary Movie 2 and Bill cooked up some burgers and we drank some beer.  It was good to make some new friends.   -Ryan Riehle
