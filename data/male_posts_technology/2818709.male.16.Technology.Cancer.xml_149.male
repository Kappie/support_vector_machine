I'm starting the war now. Everyone has to go around impersonating everyone else. Here are the rules from the genova convention: (Yes, i know it's jeneva or something, but, genova is from FF7.)  1. No personal, hurtful remarks. 2. Nothing that will embarass the other person. 3. If someone makes a written request for their harassing to stop (The word "shalamanga" will have to be in the request for it to be counted), then, the harassing of that person will stop. 4. Havvvveeee funnnnnN!!!!!  Leave a comment if you wish to participate.
