It should not contain spelling errors and it should make you want to come back and read more...   ...then I realized that even in my introduction I made it very clear my thoughts were to be raw, uncensored, and straight from mind to keyboard... So I started to type.  I saw Troy the other night... good movie.. shitty ending.  I suppose they couldn't quite change the ending to suite my preferences and I wasn't surprised by the ending as I had read it long before seeing the movie... it's just.. you expect something more epic to end such a great story... It's great that the held on to the original story.. maybe they could have added something in the end though?  Tell us about what happens to the city... show the little boy grown up... give me some closure damnit!!!  Om  Anyone that knows me well.. knows this word, this sound. Ommmmmm.. it's the sound of the universe... It is also the name given to the Summer Solstices festival that happens every year.  Om is an electronic music event.. but it is so much more then that as well.  To quickly sum up what I can 3000 people collect in the wilderness.   Stages are built... the forest filled with hammocks.  tents are set up in the fields and through out the woods.  A vegan kitchen sprouts up and is run for 4 days by volunteers to feed their fellow dancers, campers, hippies and friends.  Everyone is camping, swimming - many nude... have you ever felt the freedom of being comfortable in your own body, swimming naked and unashamed in the day light with 3000 of your closest friends?  Me neither... not yet.  The Davinci Code...  If you've read it .. you know what I'm talking about.. otherwise my only advice.. READ IT.  I am not a reader.. infact this is the first book i've read in years.  (Except for the mounds of technical manuals I read for 'fun' haha).  I read the book in a weekend but I'd suggest you take your time if you can... if you want to read it I've got a copy to lend.  Iâ€™m Moving... again.. yes.. thats right.. I'm moving for the 2nd time this year... 9th time in 4 years... i hate moving but I'm excited about the prospect of having a condo-style apartment in Mississauga.  I'll be getting a kitten after I move in... I've been looking at...   urlLink Toronto Cat Rescue   and    urlLink Abbey Cats     ...to adopt a kitten rather then buy one from a pet store.. this way i get the satisfaction of saving a kitten from the shelter AND they have all of there shots, etc. for $150 :D ... I'm hoping to find a little grey girl, I'll call her Karma.  Well.. it's 11:18am and I should get some more work done before  I head out for lunch.    Cheers!
