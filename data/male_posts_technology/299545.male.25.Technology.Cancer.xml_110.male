And now, ladies and gentlemen, for your reading pleasure, an update on the past few weeks:  - I wrote a  urlLink while back  that Jen and I went to  urlLink Taranta  for dinner as part of Boston's Restaurant Week. While it was good, it certainly wasn't as amazing as reviews claimed, nor was it that great a value. However, our repeat engagement of Restaurant Week at  urlLink Icarus  was a different story. I can honestly say it was one of the best meals I have ever eaten. First of all, the place was beautiful...down in the basement of a South End building (sounds promising, right?!?!) it has beautiful dark wood, cozy tables, but also had high ceilings and a very sophisticated roomy air to it. The waitstaff was awesome -- attentive but also invisible. Here is what we had:   Cold Avocado Soup with Shrimp Salsa (G)  - tasted like guacamole with the consistency of whipped cream -- sounds weird, but amazing.  Heirloom Tomato Salad (J)  - these tomatoes were so perfect, I loved them -- and I hate tomatoes.  Leg of Lamb with White Beans and Balsamic Reduction (J)  - a great cut of meat that was very tasty.  Wild Alaskan Salmon with Sweet Corn and Fingerling Potatoes (G)  - simply the best piece of fish I have ever eaten. So fresh, I swear it was swimming 20 minutes before it was on my plate.  Toasted Almond Pound Cake with Blueberry Compote and Vanilla Bean Ice Cream  - simple and delicious.  Pots du Creme (J)  - an extremely rich chocolate mouse -- not my style, but tasty nonetheless  - Now that I have written about the uber-classy places Jen and I ate, it's time to move to the other end (and yet equally delicious) end of the spectrum:  urlLink The Hopkinton State Fair . This happens every Labor Day weekend in my home town, and is the home of all thing 4-H and fattening. While I do not like the smelly former, I do love the tasty latter. And for that reason, I certainly couldn't pass up the Fried Milky Way, or the fresh Jumbo Glazed Donut. I great way to get your weeks worth of fat calories in about 3 hours.  - To work off some of those calories, we went salsa dancing at  urlLink Johnny D's  on Sunday night -- a ton of fun. I am not a dancing type (except in the kitchen with Jen) -- but I picked it up relatively quickly (the basics at least) -- and am psyched to go again as soon as Jen's toes recover.  - We also had a little apartment warming party at our apartment a few days ago -- it was great to get a bunch of our friends together to show off our place, hang out, relax, and catch up on each other's lives. We are definitely planning on having more, but likely as dinner parties with fewer people.  Once again, I will make an effort to post more often, but we know how well I follow through on those promises.
