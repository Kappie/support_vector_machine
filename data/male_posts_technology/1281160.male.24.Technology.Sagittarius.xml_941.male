We are more interested in proving the others point wrong rather than proving why we are right? (including me)This gives me an excellent overview of a sales call.  Imagine a guy walks to a watch show room and asks for a Timex watch. Sad that the shop does hold Titan pieces alone. How do u think the discussion proceed?  The sales person would criticise his decision to buy a Timex.  He thinks that when u prove that his decision is wrong he might sell his Titan to him.  But when u put your legs on the customer shoes. He will have his legs burried to Timex. we must understand that before the customer has decided to buy a Timex  there would have been a process strating from   Should I buy? what to buy? Which to buy? How do I buy? Where do I buy? How much do I buy?  After having analysed he himself confines to Timex. When we try to prove him wrong it disturbs his ego and thus we end up losing a customer.   But understand he can be convinced at any point of time to have a deviation from what he has decided. This is where the role of the Sales Man comes in.  Imagine if the Sales person convinces the customer by putting "sir though Timex is good Titan would be a better option because...' Do u think we will not make a Sale here?????    Balachander
