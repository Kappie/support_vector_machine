Harper has been working really hard lately to keep his name out there because it appears that the conservatives have a fair chance of winning the election.  "Harper described Prime Minister Paul Martin's own company, Canada Steamship Lines which received $160 million in loans and grants as one of the 'worst offenders.'"   I don't know if that is as powerful a statement to everyone else as it is to me.  That type of information should be disclosed publicly as soon as a grant is awarded.  Here is an idea: How about we keep corporate taxes the same, and cut the corporate grants and subsidies.  If a corporation can't generate money on it's own, then it will fail and another one will take it's place.  I have a simple breakdown for the Conservative economic ideology compared to the Liberal economic ideology: Liberals = If there is a problem, throw more money at it.  Out of money?  Raise taxes. Conservative = Find out the cause of the problem and try to solve that problem.  Not to say that tax increases aren't possible with these guys either, they just try to spend money more efficiently.  Now if Harper would just do something with that terrible hairdo/rug (can't tell for sure).  Update:  BCTV reported this piece with the headline "Harper promises tax cuts to corporations".  While both the BCTV headline and CBC's are %100 factual, it is a good reminder that even straight facts can be presented with a spin to make you lean in the direction that the media wants you to.  It is important to look past the spin and see the stories for the facts.  Once you have the facts, you can form your own educated opinion.
