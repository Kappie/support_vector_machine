When I'm day laboring, I sweat like a bastard, so I have to at least rinse my hat at night so it doesn't reak the next day - 2nd sink makes a perfect rinse bin  I can hang the hat to dry overnight right there on the fawcett -     It's also nice that Sandra  I can have our own sinks during her visit.  Nobody will have to worry about the gritty hat since I don't plan on laboring during our vacation.
