You should have slipped her the tongue. :) I took the liberty of spell checking your post - you must have been off your face when you got back in.  We had a Wednesday night blow out as well.. went to watch the film in the park (with a few bottles of red) and then ended up in the Zebra.. it's getting better in there, not as many cheezy tunes and more fun than Follies... shame about the decor. I managed to scoop myself a Zebra square bandana after flirting with one of the bar staff. Rock on!  So Grist are you back down Libby Square this weekend, in your Slipknot hoodie and a bottle of Diamond White??
