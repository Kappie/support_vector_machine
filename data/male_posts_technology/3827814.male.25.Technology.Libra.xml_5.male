The path I've taken in the past is simply to follow Cass Avenue north until I hit Darien. It's very straightforward. This time, I decided to try a different path, as I dislike all the noise and commotion of walking a section of Cass which goes over the freeway. However, the longer I walked along this other road, the more I became convinced that it would never cross over or under the freeway and that I could end up walking it indefinitely and never get where I was trying to go. So I turned around.  I wasn't really frustrated, because I felt I'd learned a life lesson from this experience. Beforehand, I was contemplating how hard it would be to give up all my possessions, as it seems God would like us to do. You might recall, as I did, the man who asked Jesus what he needed to do to inherit eternal life. Jesus responded by saying that the man needed to sell everything and follow him. This was too much for the man to take as he was quite wealthy. Thus, even though he kept the 10 commandments, he couldn't attain to the kingdom of God.  The lesson for me was that no matter how far you walk away from the goal you can always return, but there is a price to pay. I had to rewalk that same road in reverse to get back on track and so must we retrace our steps to get back on track with God.  I finally got to Darien and headed straight for the haircutter. However, I found that they are closed not only on Sundays, but also on Mondays. No sweat I thought, I'll just go over to this other one I know of. But again, they too were closed on Mondays. I don't think it's a temporary thing for the holidays either, because the print at both locations seemed to be pretty permanent. Kind of wonder why they have Mondays off. So I'm thwarted from getting a haircut for the second time, but I am getting a little wiser each time. I think I shall call ahead next time.  When I returned the DVD, the rental place gladly took it back, but charged me $14 for the inconvenience I had caused them. With the rental price added to that, I probably could have bought the DVD. Oh well, live and learn. Next time I'll have to double check the cases to make sure I don't send them empty (or with the wrong DVD in them).  So I walked back to my office. By the time I got there, I was tired and sweaty, but surprisingly not as sun-burnt as I thought I'd be. Maybe it'll take a day to kick in.
