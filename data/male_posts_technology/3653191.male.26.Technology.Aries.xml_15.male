He said that two people in a relationship should be like two feet of a human being.. when one foot goes ahead, the other stays back and supports the first...    Found it to be very meaningful.... it goes out to all you guys/gals who think their relationship is going nowhere... stepback (literally), and give some time and space for your mate...    Cheers !!
