That suggestion is often greeted with apathy or angry accusations that the geek in question was indulging in Microsoft-bashing -- admittedly a not-uncommon activity in hacker circles.   But last Friday, in response to the latest security exploit involving Microsoft products, the usually staid U.S. government's Computer Emergency Readiness Team, or US-CERT, published a warning strongly suggesting that users of Microsoft's Internet Explorer should switch to another Web browser, due to "significant vulnerabilities" in technologies included in IE.   Gary Schare, director of the Windows Client Division at Microsoft, said that CERT's advice had been misrepresented in much of the press coverage.   "Microsoft certainly respects the work CERT does to help protect the Internet and users. Regarding the consideration that users switch browsers, it is unfortunate that the published articles have misrepresented CERT's suggestions, and we are working with CERT to clarify their advice," Schare said.   But many evidently took CERT's warning to heart and downloaded Mozilla or Mozilla's Firefox, free, open-source Web browsers developed and distributed by the Mozilla Organization, who resurrected the remnants of Netscape after it was purchased by AOL in 1999.   Downloads of Mozilla and Firefox -- an advanced version of Mozilla -- spiked the day CERT's warning was released, and demand has continued to grow. According to Chris Hofmann, engineering director at the Mozilla Foundation, formed last July to promote the development, distribution and adoption of Mozilla Web applications, downloads of the browsers hit an all-time high on Thursday, from the usual 100,000 or so downloads on a normal day to more than 200,000.   Hofmann said the Mozilla team wasn't surprised when CERT issued its warning.   "Mozilla and Firefox downloads have increased steadily since last fall, with the Firefox user base doubling every few months, as more people seem to have reached their threshold level of frustration dealing with problems with IE and Windows, and have found the Mozilla software a good solution to solving those problems," said Hofmann. "CERT's recommendation is just a reflection of the trend we have seen for quite some time." Security experts said Mozilla's lack of ActiveX support makes the browser more secure than IE. ActiveX was intended to allow websites to add multimedia and interactive features, but has lately been used to slide spyware onto PCs without the user's knowledge or explicit consent.   "ActiveX allows programs to run in the browser," said Patrick Hinojosa, chief technology officer at Panda Software, a security software vendor. "It is a big part of the security equation, as most IE users don't have this locked down by default."   "But there have also been some exploits of the IE browser that had nothing to do with ActiveX," Hinojosa added. "There have been numerous IE patches issued over the last year or so."   Mozilla's Hofmann agreed that ActiveX is only part of the story, pointing also to IE's tight integration into the Window's operating system, and differences in IE and Mozilla's default security settings and architecture as other reasons why Mozilla browsers are more secure.   "Tight integration of the browser with the operating system provides some convenience and power for Windows developers and users, but has also been a continuing source that allows malicious hackers to leverage that same convenience and power for their exploits," said Hofmann.   "Most of this convenience centers on the default protection mechanisms for downloading, installing and running executable programs without the knowledge of the user or any intervention by the user."   Mozilla requires users to acknowledge and grant explicit approval to any situation that involves downloading, installing or running executable code or any other potentially risky operation. A well-patched version of IE usually does the same, but Mozilla can also interrupt automated attacks and keep malicious code from being run, features that have saved Mozilla and Firefox from being vulnerable to many of the problems that have plagued IE users.   But some security experts believe that Mozilla's biggest security benefit is that the browser is not in wide use yet.   "It is not so much a question that one browser is inherently safer than another, but the fact that so many people use Explorer," said Carole Theriault, security consultant at Sophos, a security software vendor.   "Microsoft is targeted because they are so successful. And they have a hard job ahead of them. Something like 90 percent of the world's computers run Microsoft operating systems. This homogenous environment is attractive to those cyber criminals looking to make some kind of impact."   Hofmann also credits Mozilla's open-source development model with the browser's security successes.   Every change made to Mozilla applications is first peer reviewed by at least two engineers who are familiar with the code and overall architecture of the system before the new code is allowed into the product. Then the product goes though a series of automated tests and evaluations, after which Mozilla users and the development community are invited to review the impact of each change by downloading the test builds that are produced two or three times a day.   "All kinds of hackers, from junior high school whiz kids to graduate students to seasoned engineers that work for companies that use and deploy Mozilla technologies have the code available to study and improve," said Hofmann.   Microsoft's Schare said that Microsoft also continues to work to improve the security of Internet Explorer, and said focusing on security is a top priority for the company.   Schare said the Windows XP Service Pack 2 with Advanced Security Technologies, expected to be released later this summer, will deliver improved security infrastructure that will help reduce a PC's vulnerability to certain types of attacks. It will also include a new pop-up blocker and download monitoring tool that will help reduce unwanted or potentially malicious content and downloads.   "As for last week's IIS issues, Microsoft is aggressively working to provide a comprehensive fix for all supported versions of IE," Schare said. "This will be released once it has been thoroughly tested and found to be effective across the wide variety of supported versions and configurations of IE. In the meantime, we have provided customers with prescriptive guidance to help mitigate these issues."
