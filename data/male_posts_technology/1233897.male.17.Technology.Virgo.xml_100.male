My computer teacher and I are meticulously going over Steven's blog's coding, trying to figure out how to incorporate an [IF] statement into html.  (lol)  Since almost ¼ of the entire high school student body is gone to D.C. for the week, and our class was only six people strong to begin with... Well, we're juss mostly uploading streaming videos of the war, and debugging random pages off the web. :)  Tomorrow, two people from my class (including me) are bringing XBoxs and Andy is bringing one to Weber's Senior Bible class (same period) so we can have an XBox LAN party over the network.
