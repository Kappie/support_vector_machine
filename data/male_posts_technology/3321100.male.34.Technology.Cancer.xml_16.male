I had bought a gift for her, and she was furious about the shop where she bought my gift, because she placed an order, and finally they haven't the gift (I'm sure it was the Arsenal soccer team's T-shirt). On Evening, we went to a  Lebanon restaurant. It was very good, and we are alone in the restaurant. We spent a nice evening, and she decided to talked about... Child adoption. How she could talk about this only one week after she explain me that she doesn't love me like before ??? Is it a test ??? I haven't lie, I couldn't think to adopt when I'm not sure that we will spend all of our life together. So she said it's something she couldn't do alone. She thought I'm not someone who could have a baby because I'm too interesting by myself. Hostility was open, I don't play the game. Ok, Perhaps I am a selfish person, but it's not why I doesn't want a child now. One hours later she said it's ok for her because she doesn't want a baby, she prefer to live like this... Don't think she was mad, in each of this question, she tried to found what I really want and what she want for her. If I said I wand a baby, she probably think it was better for her to leave me alone to found another woman. I can imagine how is it hard for her to think it was is fault. She asked me If I am angry about her because we can't have baby. I explained that it's not is fault one thousand time, but I did it again. After the meal, we decided to go home because a great storm coming (I'm fascinate by the power of a storm) So it began raining when we left the restaurant and 30 Kilometers after we were at home and we was wet through (Did I explain we had took her motorcycle ???).  Saturday morning, she explain me she haven't slept. She thought about all of this (I don't know why, but when she think about something like this, I'm afraid) Saturday night, she said "Do you want to speak ?" (oh my atheistic god...) She explained she love me, she had thought about all of this and she wanted to do all it will be possible to continue to live together.  It's ok for me ! Stop thinking and live !  She explained me a last thing: She had the answer to my question (I don't know I had a question :s) The answer is "yes, it's possible"  "But what is the question ?" I asked  ?. Question was "Is it possible to lived with someone all the life with feeling like we have ?" In fact my real question was "Is it possible to stop thinking and live our life while we alway have (I really think we have)love feeling?" She had question and answers, she think for me, she planed our life, she do like she alway did. It's my wife, and I love her like this.  Happy birthday me amor !
