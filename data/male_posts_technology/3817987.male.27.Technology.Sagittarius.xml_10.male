I immediately proposed splitting the cost with my brother so for $10 each we bought a copy.  And the game is frankly awesome.  I may not even pick up  Madden  this year because as cool as the gameplay stuff on  Madden  is, the bells and whistles on 2K5 are hard to beat, especially the halftime and post game and highlights hosted by Chris Berman.  I should also add that in the games we played I defeated my brother by scores of 17-10 and 3-0.  Take that baby bro!
