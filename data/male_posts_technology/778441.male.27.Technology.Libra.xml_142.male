Roughly translated into English, it means " Have this  Tilgul  (a sweet made of Sesame seeds and jaggery) and talk sweetly ". It's a greeting that is exchanged on the day of  Makar Sankranti , an Indian festival that falls every year on January 14th.  According to  urlLink Hindunet ,  urlLink Makar Sankranti  marks the beginning of  Uttarayan , the Sun's northward journey.  Makar  is called Capricorn in the western astrological calendar.  Makar Sankranti  falls on 14th of January every year. The day and night on  Makar Sankrant  are of exactly of equal hours. This day is observed as the most auspicious day by the Hindus all over the country. In the south of India, this festival is popular as   Pongal  .  Though the festival is celebrated differently in the country, it is significant to note that  Til  seeds (sesame seeds) and jaggery are used everywhere. Obviously, to combat the chilly winter,  til  oil is used along with jaggery.  Til  contains oil and it is healthy. Being soft, exchanging  til  seeds or products made from  til  means an exchange of love and tender feelings.   Makar Sankranti  is a major festival in Maharashtra, especially in the rural areas where the harvest season begins on this day. Laddus made from  Til  and jaggery,  Tilgul s made from  til  and sugar are offered to each other as a wish for prosperity, health and happiness. These tokens symbolize one's wish for other people to say sweet words and have sweet and soft feelings to one and all. That's why the phrase " Tilgul ghya ani god god bola! ".  So... Happy  Makar Sankranti  and Happy  Pongal  to you all!!  And, belated  Lohri  wishes to all the Punjabi people  (a certain Sukhwinder included!) !! Hope you had fun yesterday! :-)
