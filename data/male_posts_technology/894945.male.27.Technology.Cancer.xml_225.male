No!!! Get a life you sad, sad monkey. There is more to life than complaining. If you don't like our site, don't read it. Of course, you would miss all the things that make the Toaster crew what we are, including Johns in Thongs and the T man himself! What else can a sad computer geek, who sits at his computer naked looking for porn on the net want?  You are just annoyed we featured your picture on the 15.10.02 after you started stalking poor Alex, wanting him as your love slave, wanting him to cover you in a thin coating of Vaseline. Wanting him to scoop the dried pizza crusts from out of the folds of flesh that make your abdomen.  God I'm bored.
