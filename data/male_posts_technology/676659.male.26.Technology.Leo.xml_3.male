And, I already invited Gigi, but she hasn't replied to the invitation yet. So how was the serminar with Dr. Harold Sala? Ok man? Cos I didn't go kay daw ka themed gid sa family eh. hehehe And I can't picture myself attending that kind of conference. Don't get me wrong, I love my family, pero you know ... basta, di ko guro ma marriage counselor mo ... but then again, we'll never know ... basi  Boksuniu  pa noh? hahahaha *KIDDING*  Man,  urlLink web1000  has been down for quite some time now ... Bon  Mel, at least you still have Random Ramblings to post your diasppointments, yeah? LOL :)  Mel, your  Achi  Melanie (accent ni Melanie Steenkamp! LOL) wasn't online either? _THAT_ is WEIRD! Hmm... I don't know ... maybe stalker mo ... who used your Y! ID :) hehehe   Random Thought: In some Arab countries you need a passport, and a "reason" to acccess Internet ... (quoting aFreLance from #php Undernet)   Anyway, I still have the whole story of DEAD STARS to read tonight and I have only read the first verse. Tsk tsk tsk I'm very happy Random Ramblings is getting bigger! WHEEE!!! Is there anybody else you guys want to invite? Just tell me, ok? :)
