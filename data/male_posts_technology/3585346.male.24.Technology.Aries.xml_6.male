Or perhaps other things, since i do not realise it myself how would I know? If I say probably because of busy work schedule and work responsibilities then somehow or rather I am not being true. To find my true self? How long can one self stay? People do change from time to time. I do as well.   Today, Les told me how come I no longer smile as often as before or as happy as before? I am physically tired of course hard to smile. Or again is there any other things else that keep within me? Seriously I have no clue about it, else I would have do something to it before it is too late to do anything.   After thinking for a while, the reason I can't smile because I got too much worries? Worries really make one person unable to smile I think. Just like now I worry about waking up at 5.15 am when now is coming to 3 am OMG and I have not iron my clothes yet. I gonna be in best form later!  Mean while Amelia how's thing going for you? ;) Hope it is not too bad. You know what I am trying to say don't you Amelia? It's definitely feel better just to see it. Most definitely, cos I come across before, as long as that person is happy you should feel great and relieved. But when is not around....time to time you went down and down...till you grown tired of it and before you realise you are kind of out of it. But what I worry is hard to grown tired of it when the positive memories is there. Regarding this can I borrow a laboratory to do some research on it and give you a detail report some how later.
