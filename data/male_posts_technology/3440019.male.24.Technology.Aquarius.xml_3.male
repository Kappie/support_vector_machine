But let us do an introspection on the elections.     How many of us have cast our vote? According to the statistics, around 50-60% of the total indian population have cast their votes (figures are not accurate). This is a extremely bad electoral percentage. We can accept if the uneducated people are the main cause (which itself is unpardonable) for this low turnout. But the cause is us so called 'Educated Mass'.     What is the reason? People cannot say they don't have the time as by law even the private establishments have to give them a day off to allow their employees to cast their vote. Some people take advantage of the fact that some of our names were missing from the voters list and say they did not vote due to this reason (which in many cases is false but stated as an excuse). Should we only be bothered of our names figuring in the list at the time of elections? Why don't we make it a point to update the change of addresses to the revenue offices (this is where I had to go to see if my name was there or not)? In the case where our names are genuinely missing from the list due to the carelessness of the officials take this matter seriously even after the elections. This issue which was very much prevalent in this just concluded elections has pretty much died down.    On top of all this we criticise everything which is bad going on now in the country. What gives us the moral right to talk about the government? We have failed to exercise our right to choose our government, hence we are not part of this democracy. When we are not how can we question the actions of the government?     We also criticise that there are criminals in politics. But mind you there were a lot of other good people who actually fought the elections but lost because the people who knew him to be good did not vote. Therefore, how do we expect that good people will come to politics. This leads to another topic of politics being the sewere and we should stay away from it. But that is different and I will write on this later.    My sincere request is please enroll yourselves in the electorals. Keep your change of addresses updated in the electorals. Fight the bad and enable the good with your strength to win. Let us help in building a new India and take it to the height of glory.   Thanks again for your patience.
