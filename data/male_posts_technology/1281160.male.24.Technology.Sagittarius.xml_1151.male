"Regarding your doubths in the blogs whether Valli lives in the East Coast. Well, I live on the East Coast. Valli lives in the east but not on the coast. She follows Eastern timings as well like me. She lives in Kentucky. You can check that out in the map. The four timings followed here are Eastern, Central, Mountain followed by Pacific. Srini will be following Pacific Timings.  It's actually split into four areas longitudinally. So, one full long side is East and then followed by the rest. That's about it."  hope ur doubts are clear now! And to all of u, Srini reached Sanjose safely and he is merrily spending his time, relaxing, cooking, visiting places and preparing himself to go to office tonight(it will be day for them)! I am also having great time with my inlaws, though they will be moving tonight to Madurai! but never mind, my cousins are with me (en uyirai edukka)! ok bye for now all of u!
