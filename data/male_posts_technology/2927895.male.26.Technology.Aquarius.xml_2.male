Biryani is my favourite dish and I am willing to travel across the globe if required to eat the best of biryanis.  Actually, I am just kidding...if I were that rich, I'd set up my own Biryani factory!  Anyways, this is me having biryani at the Devon Street in Chicago.  I dont seem to remember the name of the place but this is supposed to be the most famous place on Devon Street.    	 		 		  		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink My Car: Nissan Infinity G30 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink madhu .			 		 	   Mohit  I decided to drive down to Chicago over the weekend.  We rented the Nissan car at the Detroit Metro Airport Hertz for a throw-away price and drove all the way to Chicago in 150 minutes flat.  Lucky not to get a ticket ;-)    	 		 		  		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink In My Car 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink madhu .			 		 	     	 		 		  		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink At Lake Michigan 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink madhu .
