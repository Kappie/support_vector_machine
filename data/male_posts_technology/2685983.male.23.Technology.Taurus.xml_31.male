As soon as I got on the bus all the seats filled up. I was the only one standing up and the whole time I was dabbing my nose with a tissue that was already saturated with blood. It kept bleeding for the entire half hour bus ride and for another half an hour at work.  To make this worse I twisted funny somehow last night and stained my back again. I was in pain and some of the work I had to do included lifting. I just ended up looking like a lazy ass.  Then three PCs in a row that I was rebuilding had bad CD-ROMS. Frustrated, tired, and in pain. :[   Now that I cleaned my room I'm pretty bored. I can't go anywhere because I still have no car until the snow melts. I could read some books or work on my website but that kind of just seems like a waste of time too. I could work on my dad's website and my php/mySQL skills but I'm not motivated to do that either.  A couple things that do rule though include:  Action Packed  - The Best of Jonathan Richman and the new Teen Girl Squad cartoon at  urlLink homestarrunner.com
