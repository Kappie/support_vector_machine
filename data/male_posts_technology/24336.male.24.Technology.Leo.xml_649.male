I really shouldn't think about the SVT too much because I want to kick myself for getting the ZX3 instead.  The retail price on my ZX3 was MORE than a well-equipped SVT and the SVT is a better vehicle in almost all regards (other than noise and softness of ride).  170 HP, almost as fast as a 911 Carrera in the slalom, okay gotta stop thinking about it.  If only I was more comfortable with a manual, I would have bought it back in July...  

Anyway, back to the article.  The ST model that is mentioned is probably similar to the UK-spec ST170:  basically the same engine as the SVT (170 HP) but without the rest of the upgrades (suspension, tires, brakes, interior, transmission, etc).
