It changes daily, like the regular texture of life. But generally you'll fine the content seamless, the grammer bad, mispellings and an overuse of commas. But mostly a blog of unassuming characteristics that will prove I too have the same common challenges with life as my fellow humans: Misgivings and the Effete.  We all have something in life that may not have turned out right. And depending on how we look at it, the temperment may change. For me, its a lesson today, a misgiving tomorrow. So to be earnest, and honest. I cannot predict what I may write about. But generally they'll be about misgivings. Second to that I love sports, and athletics is my single-time consuming hobby. So Effete will be the nature of those misgivings. Although I could transgress--we all do.  Let's get started. I grew up in a small town north of Portland, OR where I spent most of my youth terrorizing small gerbels by speeding up the treadmill with a small wheeled contraption I developed from icle sticks and rubberbands. It was a scream to watch my mother run the gammit of emotions--teary eyed stitches to vocal consternation--as the gerbels would hit terminal velocity. Their dainty legs rolled beneath them and they became one with the treadmill, heading over and over until the rubberbands spent their entropy, and the gerbil would come to rest, often dazzed and confused, and sometimes upside down.  Then to Idaho, where I spent my formitive childhood years, chasing bigger kids on a Huffy cruiser, with Haro handlebars and a custom paint job adorned by my father and I with masking tape and a spray can. It was cool. During the spring and fall, the thunderstorsm would rise from across the Treasure Valley and refresh us with a warm cleansing. I can almost smell acrid scent of wet concrete on our street.  On those days, the jumps got higher, the wipeouts harder. The scab tally climbed, and we kept on, oblivious to the drenched clothing, the soaked Nike tennis shoes that Mom just bought. My brother would rise to the occassion as well, rolling his crusier along with us. And sometimes, a fight would breakout, and eventually we all went home, to a hot dinner, dry clothes. Comfort. The Waltons. Good night dear, we love you. Remember to bring your trumpet to school.  We spent 8 years in Boise, and the time went fast, but not so that we didn't make time to bring them all to the place that mattered. We held fast to the notion we'd probably move, but weren't sure. It was a transition on the way to manhood, and the town was a great place to raise a child in the 80s. With rampant homogenization transforming so many place across the US, Boise shed the allure and kept its old-time charm. The parks were spacious, lush. The grass kept perfectly green during summer. And the Boise River ran through it, with tubers and tree swings and train tressles. Sun burns and beer cans, and stories from Dad, with our cousins and friends.  Then we moved back to Washington, where the trees keep green, and the river still runs through it, but the water isn't quite as clean as it used to (for it runs through one the largest nuclear reservations in the world). But here is where I've lived the rest of my life, from 15 to 35, twenty years in reflection. The laughter and loss, the effete and lathargic, friends and enemies amassed. I went to college, played around the world, got a girlfriend, climbed some mountains, skied a few great days, and lived life fast and easy. Then I got married, had two wonderful girls with my lovely wife, and now I'm a Dad, living in suburbia, going to birthday parties and changing nappies.  Who knows what next twenty years or so will portend? I'm looking forward to it.
