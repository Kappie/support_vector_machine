First biggest marathon is in London, then NY, then Boston, and then Honolulu.  Gonna warm up for it with a short little 5k the weekend before.  Looking forward to it even though I may be in a wheel chair the week after.  Just when my feet heal from the Na Pali Coast hike, I go and try to mess them up again.  Triple Crown Surf competition started here last week, it's like the world championships of surfing.  Surf is down right now but we are supposed to get some big swells pretty soon.
