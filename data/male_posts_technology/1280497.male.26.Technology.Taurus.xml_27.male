Julie is in the bedroom, sitting on the chair. )  Me: Julie, I think you should come in here  Julie: Is the test done?  Me: Yeah.  Julie (comes in): I can't believe it.  Me: Yeah.  Julie: I can't believe it.  Me: Yeah. ( They hug ) The End  Moral of the story? Julie is pregnant.  Yeah, that's right, folks, we are having a baby, and there will be a little one gracing our little attic apartment. I'm not sure what to think of it, except that she's now throwing up every morning and I'm walking into the bathroom to hold her hair back as she does. She shakes with the force of the digestive rebellion, and I'm left standing, wishing there were actions more soothing than simply holding back her hair so she doesn't have to.  Life is never going to be the same, is it?
