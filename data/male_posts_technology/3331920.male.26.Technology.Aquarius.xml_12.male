If you don't know the story of the Iliad you have to see this movie.  Having recovered from the debacle that was Van Helsing, i was hoping to come out of this film feeling my money was well spent.  It was brilliant.  IMHO, the Iliad is an extremely difficult story to translate into film.  Troy did an admirable job and the casting was spot on.  While not "exactly" lifted from the pages of Homer's poem, it still presents a great story with a believable impression of the time period.  The gods are missing from this telling, but the characters are more than capable of moving the story forward on their own.    The famous Trojan Horse of course makes an appearance, and Troy is made to suffer for stealing away the beautiful Helen.  Although in my mind, Briseis, the girl who falls for Achilles, could have launched 1000 ships as easily as Helen.    A great film, an enjoyable adaptation of the Iliad, a well spent 3 hours.  I'm out.
