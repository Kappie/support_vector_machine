     
      This year I have been to Santa Clara, CA more than 10 times.  In addition to that I have been to Portland twice, Seattle twice, Toronto, Chicago and beautiful Sommerset, NJ.  I also have made a trip to the UK (which was quite nice) and 4 trips to Japan - which I always enjoy, but the flights kill me.  I did get to bring my family on one of the Japan trips, which was great.  Oh, and a trip to Arizona to visit family for my sister's birthday.  So, I just finished packing to go up to Santa Clara again tomorrow.  But, hey... that's where I go to pick up my paycheck, so I am NOT complaining.
