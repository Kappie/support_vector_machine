(ok, maybe that's a bad description)  The thing is I don't know what it is I want to write. I have this splurge waiting to come but no idea what's in it.. Dangerous eh?? Any day now I'm going to splurge all over one of you (in a non sexual way of course, unless it's gordy) and you won't know what hit you :)  I have to say, sometimes Josh can really get up my nose.. (No, I amn't going to give you any details)  Hmm, back to work I think.
