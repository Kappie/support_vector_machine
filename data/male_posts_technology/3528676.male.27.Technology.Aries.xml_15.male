Everyone else is in, along with  Peter Mayhew  who reprises his old role as   Chewbacca  . It doesn't seem, though, that we will be seeing a young   Han Solo  . Mace Windu (  Samuel L. Jackson  ) is set to die a hero's death in this movie.  The is also a rumored second duel between   Skywalker   and   Dooku  .  Well let's keep our fingers crossed.  May the   Force   be with you...
