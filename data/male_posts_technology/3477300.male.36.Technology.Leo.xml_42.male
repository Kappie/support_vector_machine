Section             What's New?                Boys Toys  urlLink gt;         This is updated. All the old stuff removed and new toys added! Well, not quite true, the iPod is still there, but that's still kewl. Ben's list is a little short at the moment.              Julia Sawalha  urlLink gt;         Yeah, I know, it's alittle pass√©, I wasn't going to bother, but there still appear to be a lot of people who want to find JS pictures, and I have a bit of an archive, so I'm putting it back online. Don't expect any updates!              c@new
