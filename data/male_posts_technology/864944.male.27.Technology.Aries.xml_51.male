This was a phenomenal show, and I watched it unfailingly with a group of friends, Angel too for that matter.  At any rate, my bud Scott Weller had a bachelor party thrown by his dad.  As befitting a bachelor party thrown by your dad, there was plenty of good clean fun.  I expected corny sex jokes, lots of golf, and decent beer, what I didn't expect was to meet a dead ringer for  urlLink Anthony Head  (he playes giles on Buffy).  How fun.  He graciously accomodated me taking a few pics of him from my sidekick.  Note however.. that he wouldnt hold still.  You be the judge.
