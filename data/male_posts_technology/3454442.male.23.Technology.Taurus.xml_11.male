That's nice rhetoric, but very little fact to back it up.  The real story is that the Bush Doctrine is termed "preemptive" by its detractors, but I see very little difference between it and the "containment" policy which today's liberals love (and hated back then--the 1940s, '50s, and '60s).  International terrorism struck the United States in 1993, 1998, 2000, and that fateful day in September 2001.  All our actions from here on out are defensive and "containing" the ever lurking threat of continued terror.  The Gipper would approve.
