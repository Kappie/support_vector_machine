Married one of the most popular female singers of that time, Whitney Houston. Not that her career is any better. She continued to have hits into the 90's though, which is better than Bobby Brown can say. Mind you, the last five years have not been kind to either of them.  Now they look and act just like an old trailer-park couple -- I imagine a lot of stuff gets thrown about that house. A lot of empty liquor bottles in the recycling bin too.  Would they have turned out this way if they hadn't met each other? Would his career still exist, and would she still be considered one of the best female performers?
