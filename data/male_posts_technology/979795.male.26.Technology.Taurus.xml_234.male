OK not so guilty liao. Basically worked on my report on and off the whole day until about 4pm. Went running with Justin, David, Juliana. Coz of the crying thingy the night before, I owe Juliana 15 rounds but only managed either 8-10 (coz I miscounted) rounds. Nmind, try again until I get there.  After that we had a fantastic game of frisbee. Woohoo!!! Played 4 on 4. I wasn't particularly good and I got tired really fast. Towards the end I got a cramp in my left calve/calf (watever lah) muscle. Basically that kinda meant the end of the game for me. Went back for dinner and pia my report again. Finished and went to bed before 2am.  This morning, I got up early and touched up some stuff. After that took a cab to Uni (wet weather and my left leg still quite tight from the cramp mah). Time now is 9am exactly. Library should have just opened. I'm gonna go submit my report and get it over with. Damn! It feels good now that it's over. Going for a quick swim at 12pm. Hope my leg holds up today. Going home after that and I plan to watch the Steven Seagal aikido documentary - Path Beyond Thought. Caught snips of it. It was daaaaaamn good.   urlLink Eileen , I've already transferred the clip to Gary. Thought you might be interested too. It's awe-inspiring.
