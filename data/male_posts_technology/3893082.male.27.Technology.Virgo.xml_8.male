(note the sarcasm)  At least I have people to keep me company today and it's the second to last day of my work week so I really can't complain all that much. :-)  I'm thinking of posting multiple times a day just to keep this thing updated, but we'll see how things turn out.  My days are not usually all that interesting so I may have nothing to talk about.  Blog at ya'll later...
