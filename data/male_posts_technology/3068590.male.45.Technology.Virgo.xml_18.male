This would fully exploit the 64 bit technology of long horn and be the typical Microsoft type of wonder.  Secondly the denial that Apple orchestrated towards its users in allowing the concept of a virus attacking their system did not muster the appropriately deemed result.  That this is a theoretical possibility, and it is important to think what could happen if, that no one was attacked, and indeed no virus has been written, does not accelerate the concept to the full blown risk that the PC people have as a result of turning on their machines.   Anyway, Jobs just keeps delivering products that are fast, powerful and safe, which is proof he just doesn't get it, when all you have to do is promote garbage 4 years before the time you expect to deliver to really earn the care and attention of the user community.
