This product has a very "dark" side and companies should be warned about the threat. Contact me for further discussion if you would like.   This issue is particularly of concern due to the fact that today, IBM announced the Workplace product and its intention to eliminate Microsoft Office.    urlLink Computerworld    urlLink Techworld    urlLink Financial Times    Technology has now stepped across the threshold of being either benign and inert, or positive. To that which is either positive or destructive to a corporation. My thesis documents how these technologies have the capability of causing significant damage to a corporations data integrity. That this threat is an unintended outcome as a result of IBM dealing with the eight-hundred pound Gorilla known as "Microsoft".   This toolset wants Microsoft out of the corporate marketplace, and I would think that the majority of the corporate world would agree. However the unintended consequences of technology today, whether IBM or otherwise, brings the context more in line with a game of snakes and ladders where the board game is played in the offices of technologies customers.
