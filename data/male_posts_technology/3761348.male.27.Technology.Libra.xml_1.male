Nothing of any importance of course, but I will ramble away anyways.  With that said, lets see if we can find something to post here.  My interests are as follows.  I dig techie things and work somewhat in the industry.  Into sports etc and a Cubs fan like most of the fun Chicagoans.  Into movies and software development.  What I will bring to the world in this forum is a little of all of those.
