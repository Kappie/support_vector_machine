I was able to get hers done as well as my front and sides. I still need to do the back,   but I was already sweating profusely by the end and it wasnt even 9 a.m.. Man, its already  hot.   The kids have T-ball game at noon and a birthday party to go to around 4:30 this evening, so the day is already shot. I did manage to get some corner shelves up for my wife, Bob Villa I am not, but they did remain level.   Yes, I am drying our last load of clothes, run a load of dishes and managed to vacuum the house. So all in all I did get some stuff done this morning.  I haven't had a chance to watch my Quantum Leap yet. I fell out last night after watching G4, a gamers review on tech tv. I did see one part, a behind the scenses of Quantum Leap yesterday while I was folding clothes.   My wife told me she seen Quantum Leap at Walmart for 50 bucks. So I did manage to find it pretty cheap at Target.
