Anyway, I was estimating how long it took for anyone to find the Aikido in Singapore website. Basically, it takes a while. I realised it actually goes to the other clubs first, such as Ki Aikido, Aikido Yuishinkai and Aikido Federation before they see my site. A real pity.  I also noticed that ShinJu-Kai pops up quite readily in a general search on Aikido. Though I've been to their websites countless times, I've never searched for the term ShinJu-Kai before today. I realised that among all the clubs in Singapore (so far), they are the only one which has been expanding. I noticed an Aikikai Shanghai branch which is affiliated to ShinJu-Kai. This is really cool. Now I'm getting kind of interested into the strategy that ShinJu-Kai adopts in spreading Aikido. Even Philip Sensei's original organisation Aikikai (Singapore) has remained kind of stagnant for a period. One might even argue that they've already downsized following Freddy Sensei's resignation from Aikikai (Singapore) to form Aikido Federation (Singapore).  Sigh, a sad thing in the Aikido world. I realised it's not entirely uncommon since the old days. Say, Koichi Tohei's split from Aikikai to form the Ki-Society, and also US Aikido Federation's leaving of the International Aikido Federation in 2002. All these are way out of my league and I just hope that I will be able to steer clear of all these in my Aikido learning.
