Not that I wanted to not ride my bike, but it turns out that my occupation has required that I do some traveling as of late.  My destination is/has been the township DeBary, Fl which touts it's self as "The River City."  I'm not so sure that it is city so much as state road 17-92, and a "Lil' Champ" food mart some twenty odd miles from any place I’d rather be.  The pace of life is slower in DeBary, reminding one of the simple things in life like summer days, palmetto bugs, and Chinese water torture.  In DeBary a dollar will still buy you enough rope to hang a man where ever fine ropes are sold.  In DeBary the tap water smells like farm equipment.  In DeBary 12 year old children can vote.  In DeBary, I’ll watch another 5 hours of my life creep by today waiting for corporate pamphlets roll off the printing press.
