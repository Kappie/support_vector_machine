Then last night I got a pretty nasty email from big boss asking me if the really urgent task that he assigned me 2 days earlier had "fallen into a black hole". But the thing is I did reply to him regarding that task but he said he didn't receive it. Anyway I called him up at like midnight today and found out what he wanted me to do, and then was doing it until 4 am today. Then when I was gonna send him what I did through email, I found that he emailed me telling me I had until Monday to do it. Sigh really wished he had called me to tell me that !! But a colleague of mine helped me do a huge part of the task last night until 3 am; I was pleasantly surprised and not to mention really grateful cos if she didn't help me I would probably be up the whole morning doing it. So babe dun know if u gonna read this but thanks a lot alright, you have no idea how much i appreciated it!  That's not the end. Today I went to Sun main office at Central Mall for training, and when I checked my Sun email there was this email for this guy asking me why i used the email alias that he had been using for the last 5 years and why I never did anything eventhough I was receiving mail that was obviously not addressed to me. I replied that I didnt notice cos I dun use my Sun mail for work purposes so dun check it often..and then spend the whole morning looking at close to 90 email messages that I got and forwarding to him those that belonged to him. But really the damm system should have stopped me from using a email address that was really taken rite!   And then I found out that all my colleagues had gotten their pay! But when I checked mine it wasnt there, I still had only 10 freaking dollars in my POSB account. Was really disappointed lor cos I been looking forward to getting my pay for like 2 months already, Ab called the HR department for me, my bank account number was correct so I really got no idea why I was the only one who didnt get paid. Hopefully they sort it out by Monday and give me my money !
