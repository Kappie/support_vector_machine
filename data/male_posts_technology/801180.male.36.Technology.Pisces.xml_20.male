Now working on a brand new imaging terminal at work, and quite an interesting toy it is - it is certainly an impressive unit, but do people really have such a great need for taking pictures of things - time will tell I guess.  It does scan barcodes as well of course and in any orientation, and almost as quick as the laser variant - not bad!
