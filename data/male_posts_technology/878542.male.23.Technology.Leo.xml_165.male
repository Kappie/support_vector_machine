I only visited the bistro three times, but was very impressed and hoped to visit more often. I constantly kick myself that I didn't monitor it more closely when I lived in such proximity. They often have deals and specials that bring it into very reasonable price ranges. As well as free wine courses I should have taken advantage of. Folk still in SLC, take note!
