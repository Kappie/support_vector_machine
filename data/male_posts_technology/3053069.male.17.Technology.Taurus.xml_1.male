On the way down thereit was kinder borin. I talk to Jamie and Amber and Rayna and the rest of the peeps on the bus. The we got there and did nothin for several hour except the show. Nothin else really happened that you would like to read, so i wont write that. But i did have fun hangin with jamie and then having been used as a human pillow.Sunday on the other hand was not fun. I went to aplay practice at church for around 4hours. Not Cool. thas it for the weekend.  Today at school we did nothin but stupid standardized tests. ok bye.
