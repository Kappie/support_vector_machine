I'm freshly home from a 7 night Carribean cruise with Big Al which was pretty damn cool.  Our planned family reunion in Lower Right Butt Cheeck, Arkansas was canceled by my dearest Grandmother so Ali and I got to plan a fun vacation instead.  We pretty much did a big ass lap around Cuba, embarking in Miami and heading to Cozumel, Grand Caymen, and Jamaica, in that order before circling back to Miami.  Despite feeling the urge to baa or moo occasionally as myself and 3000 other cruisers were herded on and off of boats and islands, it was areally great time.  Nothing wrong with sipping fru-fru drinks and napping on the blissfully top-optional deck (no cameras, please) of a floating resort.  I'd definitely cruise again if given the opportunity.  The only thing that freaked me out the whole time was the absolute absence of any American crew members.  All the help wore name tags and there seemed to be a preponderance of Easter Europeans and no Americans.  Didn't bother me, it was just weird.  And no, I didn't buy any reefer in Jamaica....though I had many opportunities.    Kudos to those who spotted the Lebowskiness of the title of this post.
