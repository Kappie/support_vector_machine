When we started at the Lollapalooza festival tour last year we had somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 Xbox kits and 30 top of the line Alienware machines.  Since then we have expanded.  Now there are more PCs and plasma screens in the area where we have our tournaments.  Our website has a rather apt description of our show:  GameRiot is the largest traveling video games event and competition in the world. It offers gamers a chance to be the first to play the hottest new and unreleased titles. The event features over 70 state-of-the-art Xbox and PC gaming stations with the newest PLASMA and LCD screen technologies, competitions every hour, a huge assortment of prizes, the Blockbuster Halo Championship, and the celebrated GameRiot Girls. In a raging party environment, GameRiot also features the hottest DJ tracks, surprise celebrity appearances, and lots of cool giveaways. It has hosted the premieres of some of the best selling video games. GameRiot has appeared in over 30 cities, with 90,000 attendees to date, and will have over 250,000 attendees this summer and fall.   However if I had to quantify what I want to bring to Gameriot it would be this, “We’ll bring E3 to Columbus Ohio”,”E3 in Lansing Michigan” or “E3 in McAllen Texas”.  If you are unfamiliar with E3 it’s one of the entertainment industry’s premier trade shows.  Literally every game in every stage of development is shown both in public and behind closed doors.  Along with all the deal making and hand shaking that goes on at E3 there is an excitement that goes along with all the pre-release games, parties, music, lights and booth babes.   At E3 you must be an industry insider to gain entrance.  At Gameriot you spend a few bucks on a ticket or a pass and you get in.  No industry insiders here.
