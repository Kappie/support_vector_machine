But now I don't really think you were saying that, but I just wanted to make the point that it's an unconcious thing.  Which is what you meant.  So I was being redundant.  Hey give me a break.  It was 4:30 in the freakin morning.  Dej, when you mentioned that moment at Friday Harbor that is what I think it is all about.  I had a similar moment last winter.  Everyone was asleep in the house and I went outside and the moon was out and it lit up the snow.  It was quiet and untouched and I thought I wish I was apart of that.  I would want nothing else just to be a part of it.  I thought, if there is a God, THIS is God.  And if this is God then everything is God.   It was just in this one moment that I was able to see that.  But that doesn't means that's the way all the time.  i just don't realize because I'm caught up in everything else which distracts me.  It's like we're in a dream all the time and when we look back we feel like we've missed something, and I think we have.  There is beauty in everything and we take it all for granted.  And that's just the way our brain works.  It gathers information and catalogues it away for quick reference to quicken the analyzing process.  For example, a tree.  You see a tree and you think tree.  Really not a whole lot else unless you need more info.  Yet everything we see is infinitly complicated and we miss it.  That rock and that harbor will be there when your off running around, it'll be there when you are dead.  It's beauty will remain no matter what happens in your life.  Whether you lead a "good" or "bad" life.  Do you think it really matters?  That beauty is always there in everything, and the only thing I want out of life is to be apart of that.  I want to wake up from this dream live in that moment all the time.  I believe that its possible.  Do you know what sin really means?  It means to miss the point, that's what it originally meant.  When Jesus says he's son of God, I think he means we all are.  I don;t think he was any different than us other than he saw the world the way it is.    Tim, I think that in society there is a point worrying.  It gets things done and it's a trait that just got us this high up in evolution.  If you have one person who sits back and gets only the necessities accomplished and someone who goes for the gusto all the time well he's gonna be the one who's gonna pass on his genes.  We find a point to something and are motivated to get there.  But I think that's just a tool and we can't really use it to answer the meaning of life.  Why does there need to be a meaning?  And what if it is someone's dream?  We can't and won't know any better, and even if we did what could we do about it?  Would it really changed how you live your life?    Dude, you forgot Blood the Last Vampire on the best movies of all time list...
