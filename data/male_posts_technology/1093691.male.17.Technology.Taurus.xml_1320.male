How when people organised the park just about everyone went. This year I have hardly seen Pennie. When I do she is with Stuart and they never part so I don't get any time to talk to her. I see Helen in textiles, when she turns up.  I would've gone down yesterday but I didn't finish work until 4.30ish and it was raining at the time. I also rang Pennie to check they were there and they had moved from the park into Helens shed. I had asked Pennie the day before to text me if they left the park so I knew where they were. That has annoyed me alot. She never remembers to tell me if they are somewhere else, or if she can't make it etc... I find it really rude.  But hopefully in the summer we can all down the park and if everyone mucks in in sending out the emails and stuff we'll all get there. Just I guess now we gotta work around when people are actually at work.  Talking of work. I'll be working today from 9 until 6 so if anyone feels like a walk come on up to woolies and buy yourselves some Cd's or sweets or toys or stationary or kitchenware. You know you want to. Actually you don't have to. Lol. In fact I want you all to stay home and have a lie in and have fun.  Have a nice day.
