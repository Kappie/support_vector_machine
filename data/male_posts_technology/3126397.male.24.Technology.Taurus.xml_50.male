Of course, they had some 9+ foot satellite dishes, so that probably played a big part in their success. In other news,  urlLink this server  is awesome.  Six hot-swappable scsi drive bays with hardware RAID 5, dual Opteron processors, a slim sexy 2U case, and up to 16gigs of ram.  Look at it shine in all of its 64bit splendor.  We might get one for our central server here at work, but three of them would look so nice running as a Linux cluster in my basement....  Anyone have an extra $10k? Today is another inventory day, the last one went fairly smoothly (all things considered).  A number of small things have been fixed, a few features have been added, and some things have been streamlined, so here's hoping that all goes well.  Needless to say, it could be a late night.
