She's happy with my progress made on divorce agreements (50/50 split of assets, no alimony, shared custody, $60k "gift" is advance on divorce settlement, half of my retirement will go to L for a portion of the settlement).  While none of this is actually signed, I do have email from L to the mediator with the email conversation.  S and I are in love.  We went to a reggae fest in RI over the past weekend.  I was sick on Saturday afternoon, but I think we still had a great time.  It was the best concert I'd ever been to -- 8 hours of music, good food and drink, and of course great company.  We had our palms read, and while normally I see psychics as a bunch of hooey, this one was right on about my personality and my earlier life experiences.  So when she made some forecasts for my future, I listened attentively.
