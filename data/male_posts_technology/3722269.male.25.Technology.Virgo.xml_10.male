It's effectively the record companies laughing at the consumer, proving that they can dictate what we listen to, and that they do indeed, for popular music, control the strings. What do I mean? well, on the surface you might think that out of a talent quest type show, a person sang well, that song became popular, so people bought the albums.. that is of course what you're supposed to think, it really goes something more like this: In NZ #1 hits are determined by record sales, that should be a pretty accurate gauge of how many people like the song - right? coz people have to fork out for the cd.. right? Wrong.. in NZ albums going 'platinum' etc, and therefor number 1 hits are determined from album pre-sales. Huh? well, the record company, says to a cd outlet, for example.. planet jack.. 'hey, we'll sell you 50,000 of this ben lame-as cd for $10 a pop, or if you buy 100,000 we'll sell them to you at $5 a pop' - (very simplified concept and figures) and its based on those pre-sales figures that the popularity is gauged. So if a record company wants to, they push the album hard, and it becomes 'number 1' because its number one it gets played on the radio lots, because its on the radio lots, people start humming it, singign it, or attaching signifigance to it because they fucked someone while it was playing, or had a picnic, or their dog got run over while they were listening to it, so they buy the cd. Sucker. The record company wins.. the cd's sell through.. and the snowball effect starts. AHAHA thats all very well and good, everyone thinks idol sucks anyway, so no harm done. Right? well no.. this is how normal bands etc work too.. but the fact that idol comes along and does its bit, seriously undermines any other band genuinely trying to cut the mustard -without- the support of a large corporation. The sollution? MP3s. More often than not, if cost is removed from the equation, it all comes back to music you appreciate for the right reasons. MP3's put new talent and new music freshly at the door of the people wanting to listen to it.. it's the closest thing to an emerging band being able to make their music as available as a legend like say metallica, that has ever happened. Fucken marvellous. Download a song, save musics soul. Watch 'School of Rock' (Jack Black)and when idol comes to your city or town, stone the bastards to the ground, especially ben. I hate him with a vengence, he's a girly white black man, with faggy hair. That's about all I've got to say, tho I am reminded of something else someone said on the subject.. or rather , i feel compelled to relay the story they relayed...  Jo Cotton, of 'True Bliss' *cough* fame (I use the term loosely) was on the Havoc show, where ex rocker Mikey Havoc was interviewing her about True Bliss.. Jo had obviously thought herself quite smart for having come up with this comment, that takes a dig at Mr Havocs' past , and his old band PushPush - who had a hit with 'trippin' in the late 90's.  "I dont want True Bliss to end up being a one-hit wonder like PushPush"  Bad move big lady. Mikey responded with...  "You wont be anything like PushPush till you've written your -own- song, produced your -own- record, directed your -own- music video, and made it onto the charts without any corporate help"  nicely put Mikey.  Mikey vs Jo Cotton, Mikey wins *fatality*  ttfn Sports Fans.
