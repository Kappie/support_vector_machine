One, it was very reminiscent of a relationship that I was once in.  Two, as an actor currently studying acting, I was fascinated by the performances and their varying techniques/approaches to their characters/styles, etc.  Their work was all so intimate that I almost felt voyueristic watching it at times, especially Bill Murray.  And I thought it was a beautiful story about a remarkable connection between two people.  That human quality is something I enjoy in movies...  3)  I thank God that taste changes over time, or I'd still be listening to my "Rainbow Brite" LP about 50 times a day.  I agree with Johnathan that the tastes in almost anything (food, music, activities, films, etc.) that I've "outgrown," so to speak, will always hold a nostalgic value for me, even if I don't engage in them with any frequency anymore.  4)  Comfort is my new favorite restaurant...FRIED OKRA!!!  5)  Today was my first day of classes, and while I'm excited about the resurgence of productivity in my daily schedule, it absolute whooped my fibro-ridden ass.  Much pain now.  Me go bed.  6)  Oh, and I love Johnathan!
