Although it sucked going out in such a bad position, that was probably the biggest dose of reality poker I've ever had.   I was up against some really good players.  The best I've ever seen online.  That game was more aggressive than any real money tournament I've been in.  That's what I should be playing all the time.  Now I know why so many PokerSchoolOnline.com people go onto the big tournaments like the WSOP.  It sucks paying $14.95 a month but I think I am going to really start taking advantage of my membership there.   If I can start winning there, Party Poker should be a walk in the park.
