Because she met someone online, they met offline, and he shot his load inside her.  He infected her with herpes.  When she confronted him through AOL Instant Messenger he just laughed about it.  Meanwhile she was forced to go from someone who was having sex with thirty different guys to having sex with none.  Some people say it doesn’t feel natural to wear a condom.  My response always is, “So does the burning itch of herpes feel natural?”  Other people say, “It can’t happen to me.” My response is usually, “Bullshit!”  I am not opposed to having hot steamy casual sex with everyone you can get your hands on, but by refusing to use protection you are saying you don’t give a fuck about yourself or your partner.  The worst kind of person is one who takes the risk, contracts the disease, and then spends the rest of their life bitching about it.  My wife’s friend does this constantly.  She won’t shut up about how she’s infected and how her life is ruined.  Take your chances if you want, but just remember, having an STD is not sexy, it doesn’t feel natural, and it can happen to you.  Care enough about yourselves to use protection.  If you do contract the disease due to your own stupidity, don’t bitch about it.
