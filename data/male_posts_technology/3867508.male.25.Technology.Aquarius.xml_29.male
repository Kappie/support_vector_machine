I wonder how this presidential race is going to shake out.  I really think the democrats have a chance, but Bush/Cheney are very fierce.  Ralph Nader is quoted as saying that he would like Kerry to pick Edwards as VP because he thinks Edwards would work for the underprivileged in the whitehouse.  Of course this is exactly what Nader's platform is.  So here is my suggestion:  Kerry should meet with Nader and tell him that he will make him the Surgeon General, or Health Minister in his Administration, should he win, if Nader agrees to throw his support behind the Kerry/Edwards ticket.  Now I think that would get most of the Greens and Independents who are currently in the Nader camp, and that just might make the difference.  ...Just a thought.....
