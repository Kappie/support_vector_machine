(Click the title to go to the econolog site.)  The facts are what is causing the Americans to believe there is a conspiracy in oil supplies.   Attempts to put across three important facts generates significant resistance, these facts are.   - There are no alternatives to the use of oil and natural gas.   - There are finite supplies.   - The American economy requires energy in its current form for the next 5 years to sustain its advanced economy.   These facts should also be augmented by the consideration that:  The world is a global economy where supply and demand are international on critical commodities.   The American has significant competitive weaknesses.    - Significant reliance on imported energy.    - High labor costs in comparison to China and India.  The use of imported oil by the Chinese is now second only to the U.S.    - The Chinese are building Aircraft carriers.    - India and China have communist governments.     - The Chinese economy is operated for the long term, the Americans need to meet the next quarter numbers.     - The Chinese economy is one tenth the size of the American economy, and the same size as the Canadian economy yet uses 3 times as much fuel to create the same GNP as the Canadians. (Values are approximate.)    - There is a new political alliance between the Russian, Chinese and Arab states on the supply and demand of oil.     - There are now beliefs that the new political alliance can develop their resource without American technology. The dependence on foreign technology hurts their economy.    - The Chinese strategic competitive advantage is their low labor costs and large population. (And a disproportionate number of men.)  The American mind set that Cheap oil fuels the ribbons of SUV's is the most ridiculous abuse of resources since their abuse of the Buffalo.  This tendency for short term thinking is coming home to roost in the new Global economy.  I would assert that the Chinese are purchasing five to ten times as much fuel as they need to "stock" their own strategic reserve to be used as a competitive weapon against the "west".   The United States needs to wake up and learn some really tough lessons. Its a competitive global marketplace.
