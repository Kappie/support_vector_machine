First off: We are starting the Heritage Project in American HIstory (which is REALLY big), second, in band we are starting with brand new pieces and I can't sight read or play them at all, third, I have a Playing Test in band (which is the last of the year, but I have to play a solo), fourth, I have to study two pages in our French book of the colors (boring) and other stuff, fifth, I have a HUGE math test on Thursday on Probability, which is really hard. All of this is for Thursday!!! How the heck do I get ALL this done by tomorrow??!!!! Well I'll have to find out a way!!!

Good news though: The weekend was great and this week the 5678 Caf√© is open to 5-8 grade to get Krispy Kremes, brownies, cookies, chocolate, and more! :-)
