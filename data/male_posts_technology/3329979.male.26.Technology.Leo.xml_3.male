Made me trip to Phuket, 4 days 3 nites of one heck of an "eye-opening" experience. Food was good, could have been better. The day trip to Phi Phi island was fab; managed to get a few good photos taken. Then, there was the nightlife. Party on people at Bangla Road.   The one and only thing that kinda spoilt the trip was the last nite "accident" whereby i managed to twist my ankle after falling off some stairs at a "bar". Sigh .... Ham Chee Kiok for almost a week. Worst part was went to see a so called expert in twisted ankles. He gave me bruises which i have photo evidence of, hehehe .... Anyway, that didn't work and i've only got Ms Sharon Y who was so kind to take me to see my good ole sinseh at Pudu Market. Generous portion of traditional massage oil, proper massage and a BIG bandage got me on the path to recovery.   Then, it was back to work ....
