Jazz took some really great pics of the girls and the sunset and some flowers. We are getting anxious about moving next weekend. We will be packing today and doing some prep work.    One thing we have to get done is change all the lights and get the fans down. I highly recommend changing to the compact flourecent bulbs. We have saved a ton of cash with them. I hope to bring all my old computer stuff to That Computer Guy. He does work for the economically disadvantaged who need a computer or need one serviced.    Katrine just woke up. She yelled out for Daddy to come get her. She is waking up now, I let her watch the movie she rented last night, Cinderella II. I think the rest of the house is waking up. Time to go.    Have a good day.
