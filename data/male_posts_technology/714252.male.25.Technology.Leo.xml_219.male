We've caught it twice in the early hours of the morning and it's fun.. Anyway, they all found out that one of the guys still sported a turtle neck and everyone went on about how ugly it was. Of course I proceeded to go on about Bubbles Ugly Cock.  (Just to let you know, if you still have your foreskin I think you have an ugly cock and nothing you say can convince me otherwise. I've seen mine before and after and I know what I'd prefer if I was a woooman.)  Anyway what do our lady viewers think?  With or without?
