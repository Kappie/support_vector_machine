I just paid five dollars to have the  urlLink following question  answered:  This is a question about time zones, and it's pretty dry stuff, but the significant thing about it is that somebody was able to answer me within a couple hours, and that was with a clarification!  And I guess that was cool because people actually are out there, waiting for me to ask that question.  And I had researched it for a couple hours, and it was worth five bucks.  I tell you, this is the future of the Internet.  Or something like that.  Here's the general link to  urlLink google answers .  I feel kinda bad mentioning this stuff, because Google bought Blogspot.  So there's a little corporate shame there, but still, Google is pretty much one of the coolest things ever to hit the Net.
