Not because I dun have a girlfriend, but because i haven't felt happy in a really long time. The last time i can remember feeling that way  was when I was with her. I really miss that feeling.  In the last week i broke down and cried twice, and the worst thing is I dun even know why i did. Am i losing my mind? Maybe its because of her, maybe its because im no closer to getting a job now then when i first started looking and i dun know why that is. I have no idea. But I've been feeling this sense of hopelessness that I just can't shake off. I just dun know whats my purpose in life anymore.
