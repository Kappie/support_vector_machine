No doubt everyone has watched at least one Hoollywood Family Drama(TM) type of movie, you know, the cliche'd ones where mum and dad split up and then dad comes back 20 years later to make amends, or mum and dad break up and fall in love again later, or x, or y... I never thought those scenarios were based in reality though. Reality is more like "mum and dad break up and that's the end of it". Recently though I've been witnessing a Hollywood-ism of my own life happening. My old man and mum went their seperate ways something like 18 years ago, and I saw very little of the guy, we was content in leading a life unfettered by a wife and kids, good for him. But recently, he's been becoming more and more intent on getting to know his son (that's me) again. The funny thing, is I'm not really angry at the guy either. If this was Hollywood, I'd be ranting at the bloke spouting some nonsense like, "You weren't there for my little league baseball game" or something. Oddly, I don't feel that, I'm just happy to have a Dad again. Not exultant or weepy though, there's no Kleenex moments, we just hang, talk guy stuff, beers, food, you know.  It's comforting. I never really knew what it was like to have an old man - I grew up with the cardboard cutout type stepfather, one who really never gave a rats ass about the snot nosed brats that came saddled with the hot bird. (Yes, my mum was a hot bird in her day. Real covergirl material.) I was pretty much left to my own devices throughout my whole life, no real fatherly influence - perhaps it's why I became so engrossed in games and books and shit instead of the usual guy stuff consisting of sports, guns, v8's and beer. Sometimes I wonder how different it would have been had I had on old man. Had I taken an interest in guy stuff. Had I developed some semblance of self-esteem. No growing up boy deserves to live a life of solitude. Much as I hate to say it, I'm a pretty effeminate dork thanks to that. I think I would've been happier as a skirt chasing, grunting neanderthal. This so-called "intellectual" life is for the birds.
