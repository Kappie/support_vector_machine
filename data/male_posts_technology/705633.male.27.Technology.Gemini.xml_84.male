Exclamation marks!!!  I would like you too, my dear audience, to make a promise to get crazy this summer. Go and talk to that girl you like. Shave your head. Erect a forty-foot statue of Mr Potato Head on your front lawn. Make sure you send in your photos to us.  Oh joy, I fixed the archives!!    Office hi-jinks with Scott. "You're a monster!"
