Volunteers in their classes typed their stories up, typeset them and bound them just like real books.  It was cool.  On the backpage, it had an About the Authors page. One of the families we have gotten to know this year live in our neighborhood and work full time for the Church of God.  They had pastored two churches previously and are now area directors for the denomination.  They have two kids in Kindergarten, and one of them wrote, On his Authors page: - S wants to be a pastor when he grows up. - Jesus is the most important person in his family. Wow.  Those are quite the statements.
