Not only am I sick of doing all these bullshit websites, I'm sick of having them picked to destruction by my boss.  But, what are boss's for, eh?  I'll be soooo happy when I get paid to be forced to change websites..  That'll be sweet.  So then enough rant.... My site is finally starting to come together.  It looks really nice, but sorry, there's no preview :P  So far I'm at 130 or so lines of AS, and there's still more to do.  Hopefully I'll be finished with it before school starts.   Ah.  School.  It starts in like 2 weeks.  As much as I want to see my friends, I really don't want to go back.  Just like every other summer, this one has whizzed by.  Fuck.  I hate work, I really do.  I love the money, but I hate the time it takes up.  grrrrr.  Maybe I could write the fucking government and they'd pay me for doing nothing.  But then again, maybe not.  Oohhhh.. it's nearly mac time!  This friday I'll have almost enough for the computer, and then after I sell some stuff I'll have enough for the mac, dual 17" LCDs that I found on eBay, and *hopefully* a desk and a light.   Bah.  I'm tired.  I'm cranky.  And, there's a big meeting on Friday that I haven't even thought about.  Grrrrrr.  Maybe I'll call in sick on Friday... yeees, that's the thing to do!  oh my, that was like one big entire bitch session.  Oh well...  sorry for not updating for so damn long.  peace out.
