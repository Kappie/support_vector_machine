As far as starting my thing goes, it's happening, just a bit slow. Lot's to learn.  I get to go back to Columbus next Sunday. At least I won't be sick. I forgot I had a ticket to the Cure sunday. That's gone now since I fly out then. But when I get to columbus I'm eating steaks EVERY night for the sacrifices I have made to go up there for work. I'm going to miss the El Nino we've been having down here.
