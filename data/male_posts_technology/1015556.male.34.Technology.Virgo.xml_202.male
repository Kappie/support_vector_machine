It's weird, I came home yesterday and my 6 year old was talking on the phone, like a teenager.  Chilling.  And to think that those years will be here before we know it. I'll be posting some notes from the book here and there.  "Can you name a more demanding career than being a godly mom or dad?  Air traffic controller?  That’s a nap in the park compared to a mom landing and dispatching four teenagers from an after-school holding pattern.  Brain surgeon?  Would you rather poke around in a sedated skull in a fully staffed operating room or try by yourself to soothe and heal the tangled feelings and thoughts of a teenage girl who wasn’t invited to the prom or who failed to make the drill team? On top of all the challenges of parenting, there’s something far more sinister taking place.  We’re in a spiritual war and are operating like guerrillas behind enemy lines.  The paths we walk, and the trails our children must walk, are dangerous – littered with traps set by a spiritual enemy that you can’t see, an enemy who wants to destroy the souls of children before they become adults." "Nothing can compare to the joy of seeing a child grow up to walk in the truth – “I have no greater joy than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth” 3 John 4.  Nothing is as exhilarating as watching our children bravely walk through traps and snares, advancing the banner of Jesus Christ in their generation."
