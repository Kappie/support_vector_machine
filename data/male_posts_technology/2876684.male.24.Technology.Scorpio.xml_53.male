Sempai John took out the Heavy Weight Division plus the overall tournament with some outstanding techniques.   We are also very proud of Michelle Albert who fought very well, showing  lots of guts and determination.   Do I wish I was there? Hell yes I do... but like I said before, there is always another tournament to compete in.
