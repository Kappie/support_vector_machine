It's a diary. Not a soapbox. It's for penning your own private thoughts, not preaching to the masses.  What can you look forward to here? Oh, simply yours truly's opinionated views on whatever's in the news lately. Word of warning. I am a centre-right conservative. Conspiracy theorists and leftist idiotarians might not feel too welcome.  sl0th, signing out.
