This is no small feat considering the shape I was in 6 months ago. My 5 am run felt real good and I think my new fueling scheme is working. During this morning's run I ran with much more energy than usual. I ran just under 6 miles and my split times support my theory.    12:00  12:05  12:40  9:57  9:07  9:51    BTW, the slower split times were taken when I was running with my training partner. He's just getting started and is doing great considering he's been at it for 2 weeks.
