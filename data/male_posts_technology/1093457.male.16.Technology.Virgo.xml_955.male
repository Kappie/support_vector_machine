I'm not sure entirely why, maybe to see how I am in lessons or how Seward reacts to me asking for help? I'm not sure. I just hope it will work. Actually thinking about it now I hope I haven't got Seward into trouble.  Shit. I've just messed everything up now haven't I? Omgomgomgomg. Why can't everything be simple??? Ok I better go now and sort my head out cos its just got incredibly full of random confused thoughts again like Friday.
