I love the hanging chime thing- Sarah thought it was part of the painting.      Thank you Jeanette for your sweet compliment. It really made my day! Hopefully next time I come to CA I will be able to meet you and the rest of the family.     Enjoy Maya. She will grow up so fast you won't believe it!  Our hearts to yours,   Debbie, Kadry, Sarah, Noelle,  Zach
