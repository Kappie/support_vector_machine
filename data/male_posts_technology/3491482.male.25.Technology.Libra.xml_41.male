I got all hot about Bush's proposal to add an amendment to the constitution defining marriage as existing solely between a man and a woman.  Then I realized just how  urlLink unlikely  it is that this could actually come to pass.  Since Bush choose to try to enshrine this in the constitution, and since he's certainly no stranger to the machinations that getting such an amendment passed would require, it is obvious that he meant to communicate the  appearance  of being vehemently opposed to gay marriage to those who don't realize that the mechanism he chose intentionally precludes it ever actually being abolished, while communicating with a wink and a nod to those who understand what he's done that he's just courting the votes of the, um, "unsophisticated".  Or maybe I'm not only naive, but cynical.
