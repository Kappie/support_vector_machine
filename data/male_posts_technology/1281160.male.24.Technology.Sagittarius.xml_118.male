I repeat it has to be a image that can be referenced as an url (i.e. www.somedomain.com/images/image.gif). If you find a image that you really like and want to share, right click on it to locate its location and insert that path as the source in the image tag. If you are accessing sites that require authentication, there are chances that the image might not get displayed in the blog. But you can check that out by copying the image's url and pasting it in the browser. If the image gets displayed, fine. If not, forget it.     Editing blogs :   All of you have been given admin rights by me. You can log in and check it. Please use this facility only when you have made some mistakes like wrong links or something like that. I am using it only to delete multiple blogs that you might have created by pressing post or publish twice. As I have made a facility to be updated by Mozilla every time the blog changes, I can immediately get the changes done. The blog gets checked by the browser every 15 minutes.   More news and info later,     Jax  .
