As far as excuses go, I was torn between 'I have a lot on my plate lately,' and 'I don't have anything interesting to say.' But, in the end, I decided I'd go with 'We have no real audience, so I don't see the need to perform like a dancing monkey in tights every six hours.' Ahh, bitterness and sarcasm just sounds so much better when it comes from me!  Kidding. I'm not quite  that  bitter/cold/bitchy/whatever. Especially not today! Happy Birthday to me in.....10 hours and fourteen minutes. Not that I'm counting down or anything...  Anywho, this was mainly just a post to tell you that I'm not dead, yet at least, and that if any of you actually  DO  listen, then it'd be nice to hear from you every once in awhile. I know that beej's pressing and prodding gets old, but c'mon folks. All we want to know is whether or not we're wasting our time spouting witty anecdotes for the pleasure of complete strangers. I mean, when you think about it, we're only a step or two above  How to Become a Cam-Whore in Five Easy Steps!  because of the fact that we  do  put ourselves out there for you to judge and critique, to laugh and to cry with. The least you could do is tell us whether or not you're listening.  Wow, I feel better now, and inane babble seems to be rising to the surface. That's always fun!  I plan on writing and posting another chapter for  Odd One Out  tomorrow, despite the fact that most of my viewers, and a good chunk of my friends, have really stopped caring about the trials and tribulations of Andrea "Squeak" Dean. However, I know what I can do to reel then back in: promise them sex, (whether in person or in the story has yet to be decided.) lots and lots of sex. I've already have a friend ask me when I was going to "get to the good stuff," as she so succintly put it. Ah, it's so great to know that the fact that I can write about sex without even once using a profane reference to a mixer has earned me such a high place among my peers. Really...  Wow, this feels like a long post. Was this a long post? Eh, whatever. At least 'KrYsTyNa!!1' likes 'wat we hav 2 say!' OmG! sTfU!!1 *Twitch* Thanks for listening dear. I really hope that you like what is to come. Thanks all, and have a nice evening.   Every Pippin Needs a Merry...
