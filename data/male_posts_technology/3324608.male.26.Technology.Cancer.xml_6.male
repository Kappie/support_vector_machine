It's only the 2nd day, but everyone says the first week is the worst.  After 3 days, all the nicotine should be out of my system.  I usually only smoked 4-6 cigarettes a day.  Not very much compared to most smokers I know.  Sometimes on the weekend I would smoke 5-10 cigarettes a day, just because I get bored and it seemed like a good way to enhance my weekend relaxing experience.  That's kind of stupid, isn't it?  Yes, smoking can be enjoyable, but do I smoke because I really enjoy it and it makes me happy or do I smoke because I am an addict?  I am an addict.  I am addicted to smoking.  It's a dirty, wasteful, stupid habit and I don't need it anymore.  In the meantime, on some suggestions from  urlLink About.com: Quit Smoking , I bought some sunflower seeds (in the shell) to keep in the car.  They are kind of messy to eat and the spitting part is kind of gross, but they are great to keep my hands and mouth busy while I'm driving.  It definately keeps my mind off of smoking but maybe now, I'll become addicted to sunflower seeds?  At the gas station, I grabbed a couple of coffee stirring straws, cut them in half, and I have tried chewing on those when I go outside and at times when I would usually be smoking.  Also, I have been trying to drink more water because all the info I have read on quitting suggest to do so.  I need to buy some hard candy like Jolly Ranchers or something.  That would be a good thing to have around ...  So far, so good : )
