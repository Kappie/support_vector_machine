Going by norms of life imprisonment in the Indian Penal Code, the convicted has already served a life imprisonment sentence. As if to prove a point or more of rubbing salt onto the wound, he is put to death. All credit to the judiciary of our country.  As they say, "Justice delayed is justice denied". It took 14 odd years for the judiciary to execute a death sentence of a criminal. Now, thats too much of a wait for anybody. Come to think of it. The poor criminal has already got his bit for commiting the crime.  The judiciary is setup to kill the crime, not the criminals. Yes, there are some criminals who deserve to be executed but how many? Do we give the criminal the oppurtunity to realize the crime he has commited and be remorseful of it or just finish him/her up?   Agreed, in some cases there doesn't seem to be any reason why the criminal should be allowed to live. But how many times does this happen especially when the criminal has already served 14 long years in jail...  Any judges, juries reading this... comment plzz  Thumbs Down...
