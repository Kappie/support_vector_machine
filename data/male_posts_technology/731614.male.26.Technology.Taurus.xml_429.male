You already have socks on your feet, and you now realize that you only have the following two choices for footwear: Tevas -or- Birkenstocks.  What do you do?    (As in weeks prior, a super silly amount of thanks, admiration and other such validation goes out to Andrew at  NineMileDetour  for writing two of the three questions this week... visit him and give him love (or call him on his shit, whichever you like).  Sharing is caring, people.  Also, thanks to BenBen for the other question -- who, if/when he sees this i suspect will exclaim “OMG! OMG!” and mutter something about a time machine and gorgonzola cheese.)
