Got an A, woooooohoooo 96% in total :-)  So thats an upside.... downside, im 27 this on Saturday :-( *sob* sooo old.  Not long left of my first year of student life. Only four more weeks to go and still have two programming projects to finish, a data communications report on WAN's to do and three project management assesments left, gonna be soooooooo BUSY!!!!
