I don't know if ppl missed me or the postings at the blog.  Anyhow, I have started missing the routine...So shall be there in office tommorow, coz it feels like hell sitting idle at home, and watching damn TV...  So folks !! Do tell me how was yr day, without me...  I missed few ppl today... :-(  Chalo folks signing off early with this small posting, coz have to take medicine and catch up some sleep...and Hey leave me alone in Sleep...do not bug me in my dreams ;-)
