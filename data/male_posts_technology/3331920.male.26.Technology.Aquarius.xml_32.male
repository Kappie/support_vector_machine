I was wishing him well today, i'm so jealous of the fact that he's doing this great work on cool effects films. He's living in San Francisco now, walking to work along the Bay, and working on Hellboy, Day After Tomorrow, and who knows what else. Ah, the life. :) Back to my life, MUST FINISH THANKYOU cards. They really are the last in the way of 'responsibilities' associated with the wedding, and i'm gonna love putting them behind me.  The feelings of gratitude are important, actually writing out all these cards at one time, is enough of a hell, that Angel and I put it off for 7 months. Whew,   I'm out.
