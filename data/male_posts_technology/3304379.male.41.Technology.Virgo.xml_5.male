I did, however just score some XXX coffee from a chic in accounting wearing all red, sporting high heals, and a look that would stop a clock. Hell, I think I am an hour younger already.   Once I finish this coffee, I will be able to work. I wonder if I can write a love poem to XXX coffee accounting chic and she would get it?  OH NO!  There is trouble with my functional spec!   Please lord don't make me re-do it again...No, for the love of coffee.  No!
