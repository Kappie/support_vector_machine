Lenin was a young person who showed great promise amist the difficult environment in guayaqil, where the local oligarchy controls politics with blood and fire, not allowing any space for the development of the left. The executions by the death squads and the police are continuous. Indymedia Ecuador shares the deep pain of Lenin's family and friends and will keep vigil over the investigation and punishment of those guilty for this cowardly and vile crime.  .... all the other stuff on the ecuador site at this time are comments, solidarity, grief, poetry, etc. so far there is no additional information has been made available.  i did notice that a reporters without borders person had asked for more information, wondering if he was killed because of his reporting or for his activism -- stating that if he was not killed for his reporting then they would not be able to help him out.
