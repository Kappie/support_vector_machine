Well, instead of going in half-sies on FF:CC, cause adam's a bitch, i bought Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. It's a pretty fun game. I AM the dark side. ph33r m4 wr4th. *Uses choke* Whaddyathinkofmenow, biatch! I just pwnzed an entire sith academy. Those biotches were annoying. There were like, 50 of them. Me with my puny-ass droids couldnt do anything against them...But then i used "drain life" and "Force Lightening", and everything was better. All was well. UNTIL THERE WERE 50 MORE. And i had no force left!!! I still pwnzed, cause i whipped out my double-sided lightsaber, and fscking pwnzed. After that, i went up into my ship, for a nice ride to tatooine to check and see if it was destroyed, and then darth malak's wench, mr. whatever, decided that he was going to use his tractor beam, and pull me into his ship. He's a tough mofo...He really is. He's got like 4 Dark Jedi guarding him...And he's got that BFG. I died, and i forgot to save, so i'm a ways back from there,  but i can get back...no problem.   [Tap that jedi izzass]
