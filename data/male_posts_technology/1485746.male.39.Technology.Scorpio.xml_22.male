Bizarre Creations has announced today that the second downloadable content pack for PGR2 will soon be available.  DLC1 was the Paris Booster Pack; DLC2 is the Long Beach Booster Pack.  It looks to have some sweet new cars and some hopefully great tracks.  I am definately looking forward to seeing this one.  Game on!
