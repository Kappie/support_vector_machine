I couldn't get into some things I needed and some missing programs I needed.   I was on the phone with PCLAN for nearly 2 hours and finally got up and running. I also was hit with a lab issue to work on right off the bat.   I was on the pc and phone for nearly 4 hours and will end up resuming tomorrow. Get this. After about an hour I asked the facility if they had a real pt issue and the answer was no. They were seeing the issue with a test pt.   Go figure. They didnt have a real patient example.   My father-in-law had came by and was still here after 6 when I was done. He seen a 'this land is your land' with Bush and Kerry on the news that was crazy. I found it online and we watched it together laughing our butts off. Its found  urlLink here  and you can click play to see it. I tell you it's hilarous if your a Democrat or Republican.   The guy called me back in regards to the  urlLink Tom Coburn for Senate  yard signs. I will be able to pick them up tomorrow before work. I told him I hadn't seen any in Pocola area at all. He was grateful and seem to be pleased. I am doing this primarily to be active and I found it interesting  urlLink AFA    and  urlLink James Dobson  is supporting him.   I still need to install some of my software on this buisiness pc. But I am glad to get it back. I noticed they installed Win2K rather than the original XP and it now has a 25 gig harddrive. woo hoo. But it does suck I lost everything though.
