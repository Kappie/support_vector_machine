Had a very tuff time in my practicals, trying to terminate a twisted pair cable, with a connector  then setting up a LAN......somehow, finally i succeeded.....phoooo, stupid networking, takes so much of physical energy. Next semmester i'm going to just opt programming langs like JAVA, perl  SQL. Guess I would continue my Cisco certification, next year. My summer break starts from this weekend,  extends for the next  20days. Me  my friend, we are planning to do something in our hols......yet to decide....         Last saturday,  i recieved  greeting  cards, one from my brother  one from my parents, for our anniversery(they posted it far ahead, giving allowance for postal delays). The cards were really fantastic, with so much of touching touching words, that i started crying. Ganesh had a really tuff time convincing me that day  finally he took me out, to stop my tears. That day we ended up in getting a brand new big wooden dining table(for which i had been pestering Ganesh for the past 6 or 7 months. All these days we just had a very small one, made out of steel, which Ganesh had got before marraige). Poor Ganesh, he wanted me to smile. But that can be done, only when he cries!!!!         Xavier, that background color does'nt suit. Try avoiding dark colors for backgrounds. The green colored text seems to be even worse in this background. I understand that, basically,  u need four colors for the blog. Maybe i can come out with a few suggestions, if u want.          Rini, nice that you enjoy cooking. It takes time to pick up speed. i used to spend three hrs to prepare lunch,  three hrs to prepare dinner earlier. I purchased four books for cooking recipies on the day we boarded. Uma Devarajan,  Malliga Bhadrinath are the miracle angels who guided me throughout  ofcourse, my mom thru the weekend calls. I wud suggest u to get some good recipie books. It would help u a lot in the beginning.One more important tip i can give u is, record all ur recipies. Bisibelabath, u said u got it from ur friend....have u written it down?.....u might have to refer it atleast for the first four or five times, u prepare it. Only after that u get familiar. Have some burns oinment like burnol or silverex handy always. U might need them often in the beginning.   will blog once my exam is over,  bye.
