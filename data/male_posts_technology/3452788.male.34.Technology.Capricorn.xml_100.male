I had been in a severe funk in the months preceeding the Vegas trip, so I had decided to drive there and back. Driving is always theraputic for me  (I will get into that another time) , the scenery is beautiful, and I had not been that way for 15 years. I was going to swing by to see my friend in Santa Barbara, but that didn't happen for multiple reasons  (also a future topic) .      It is apx. 1000 miles from Eureka to Vegas, depending on which route you drive. I, of course, chose scenic over direct. I went to Sacramento first, then up US 50 to Tahoe. It was lightly snowing that morning (in May!), and everything was beautiful. South from Tahoe to Monitor Pass (I climbed a small hill, about 150 feet of rocks), then south on 395 to Mono Lake and Mammoth Lakes area. The next day, I went through the Bristlecone Pine forest in the White Mountains (should be a Nat. Park), then through the desert to US 95, straight to Vegas. On the way home, I drove straight through from Vegas to home, about 21 hours. I went through Death Valley (almost 90Â° at 9am) and Yosemite National Parks (spring melt along the just-opened Tioga Pass road), then directly home. 2000 miles round trip.    I grew up in the Sierra Nevada, and it always brings back so many memories, mostly good ones about exploring the woods and the mountains, pine trees, camping, and granite. I am not so much a hard-core backpacking hiker (although I've done it a few times) as a low-stress, drive-and-day-hike hiker. I like places where I can drive to a trailhead and walk no more than 1-2 hours to get to. I may miss some spectacular scenery, but I have seen a lot of neat stuff in my explorations. I actually think some "Wilderness Areas" are somewhat overrated, although I love the concept of wilderness as much as actually visiting one. Anyway, digressing.    I think the trip was in general the most uplifting and healing time of my life. Right when I really needed it, I got the opportunity to be alone in the landscape I love so much, to take some beautiful pictures to look at later, but more than anything to just let the pressures and demands and negativity just slip away like peeling layers from an onion. When you get to my core, when I am exploring in nature, I am like a kid, seeing everything, feeling the beauty in the landscape and in the forest that honestly I think many people can never feel. I cannot describe how happy and content I felt just being part of the world, returning in a sense to "my" mountains but in another sense returning to the innocent wonder of childhood. Remember catching frogs or crawdads because it was fun, or taking a walk just to see what was there, or stopping to get out of the car because you saw something stunningly beautiful? At those times it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks or says, you are simply enjoying life in that moment.    I was like an early naturalist, exploring the landscape, learning about the ecology and geology and natural history and climate of everything and everywhere I found. I was exploring everything - forests, valleys, plants, small furry creatures, large outcrops of basalt and tuff and obsidian, volcanic craters and peaks, joshua trees, lizards surviving at 10,000 feet, 4,000-year-old trees, earthquake faults, tufa deposits, glacier-carved canyons, alluvial fans, rain shadows, playa lakes, microclimates, glacial erratics. I was so unafraid and content and free, I actually found it safe to let myself talk to people - me, the anti-socialite, having light conversations with people in restaurants or campgrounds and markets. I shot about an hour of video and took about 250 pictures during the trip.  (I LOVE my digital camera, I can snap away and delete later, without worring about "dumb" pictures of stuff I found neat at the time, but later cannot figure out what I saw.)     Then, I hit Las Vegas. I guess it is a real big city now, suburbs extending for miles. I almost had a little anxiety episode when reaching town. After the beauty and solitude of the natural world, being thrust back into the world (in The City of Evil, of all places) was quite a shock to me. That feeling passed soon, but it was interesting to me how shocking that was for me, letting me know that I was totally immersed in the escape mode of my trip. I walked the Strip, looked in a few places, but really returned to feeling alone, detatched, invisible while I was there. Vegas is a difficult town to be alone in, I think. I could have done stuff with other people attending the class, but I didn't feel comfortable, I just wanted to be alone, even though paradoxically I would have liked to be confident enough to be sociable without feeling nervous. But then I won $250 on a quarters machine, so I got happy again.
