Theocracy bad!"   mode off/  This quote from the 911 commission is worth reading all 600 blankety-blank pages:  "Bin Ladin and Islamist terrorists mean exactly what they say: to them America is the font of all evil, the 'head of the snake,' and it must be converted or destroyed.  "It is not a position with which Americans can bargain or negotiate. With it there is no common ground--not even respect for life--on which to begin a dialogue.  It can only be destroyed or utterly isolated."
