And then in CpR, I did a 15 minute talk on mission, blessed to bless others and feeling a pulse for the world.  I was really nervous, but it was totally worth it. The coolest thing from the morning was hearing the worship set the band picked out when the talk was over.  The words of the music fit the message so well.  Nothing supernaturally crazy, but I know that the morning was divine. My notes from this morning - very scattered... ============  intro priviledge space - service and missions this am - missions send off a few minutes to share  missions vs. mission  we don't think enough about us having a mission in the world God has a heart for mission He deisres to be worshipped, with peoples whole lives  Every story, every circumstance, every principle in Scripture illustrates God's heart on a mission That mission is so that people everywhere will seek to worship Him reading the Bible from that point of view might be a lot different  story - glenn food fight he was a man on a mission in the same way, God has hearts of people in target He desires worship from everyone  I want us to think about God's mission this morning in two terms:  slide  Genesis 12 /slide  1 - Gen 12 You are blessed to be a blessing to others Period It's not about you Your family Your time in history Your place in this world Spiritual leaders, mentors, CpR specifically If nothing else, I know that your place in this church has enabled you to do much for you have been given much I want you to see that its not neccessarily about you  It's easy to disengage when we believe that its all about us  you don't have to go somewhere to do this taking the time to listen showing up early to help out with something going on here taking an interst with someone at school deciding you are going to do somehting radical for God's kingdom   2 - the world is waiting heart for the nations, for the world there is much more at stake than just us - 6.2B people in the world - estimated 25% are unreached - never could hear about jesus if they wanted to - 25M infected with AIDS in subsaharan Africa - 1 missionary among 1M muslims - Sudan - i could go on and on about the world's stories it's hard to be a global jesus follower you have to care about the world, both around you and at large  story - katie - boot camp im not into torture 160 bug bites to see your child suffer is a very very difficult thing best thing - Zambia - Cindy - 500 AIDS orphans in a 5 mile radius if giving her that experience gives her a heart for the world but i would do it if she can learn to see the world through Jesus eyes if she or you could get a sense of how God longs for disciples, how discples win the world, not converts, how we need to be concerned for the world, i would put you or her through it again its not easy, its hard work NYC - be forewarned i wouldn't mind making you suffer like that too  this idea of full engagement we are in a passionate movement, scraming down the road not worried about how we are going to stop fully engaged towards God's mission
