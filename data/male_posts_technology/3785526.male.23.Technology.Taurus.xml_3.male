And it so happened I forgot to get my jacket and all I had on me was a skinny T-shirt. All I could do was stop the bike near a chaat shop and land in the shelters of a closed shop nearby. And I have this knack of landing up in dicey places without money. The gang that joined there started to have all those chaats. I was left to look at their plates. It just drove me mad. And after some I decided it was enough. So, I picked up the goddamn bike and started again in the goddamn rain. The tricky thing about the rain it, that it appears so light that sometimes it looks like a drizzle but once you start on the bike, then you know the intensity. It really stings you. My next stop was at a deserted xerox centre. And, the only thing that were to give me some company were some stray dogs who were continuing their sunday siesta. There was nothing in that whole place and the loneliness started to kill me. By the time, I had spent some 1.5 hrs in that rain. My next stop was at a petrol bunk. And believe me, it was worse. It turned out to be a gathering of couples. All kinds of couples. The old ones,the married ones, the stylish ones...and it looked everybody were actually on some goddamn picnic rather than sheltering for a mad rain. Plenty of laughs, wrapping arms...good enough to drive a loner like me mad. And this gust of wind blows. You are wet to the toes. And the wind makes it so bad that you can actually walk to the nearest hospital and admit yourself for pneumonia. Then, in a sudden fit of rage, I started and ended up in one of those shanti sagars. It was all and well there. I ordered a cup of coffee and feeling nice and warm. Then, after some time, this family comes up stand in my table. They have this pav bhaaji, thats giving out its buttery smell all around. My stomach by then has started pinching in hunger. And then this guy in my table goes and gets a plate full of naans and masala. I went mad. This is just the problem. When you struck up somewhere like this, you remember all those best things you had. Crispy vadas dipped in sambars...and you sort of feel you can never even get to see them in your entire life. Its all ok if you get caught somewhere near you house. You can just grit your teeth but getting caught somewhere in the middle of nowhere affects you psychologically. It makes you think about all those ugly things you did the day before. I din't offer this school kid a lift, I refused to give me sis a lift to the busstand, you imagine all the faces of drivers whom you'd have pissed off...And by the time you reach your house gritting and shivering for 7 kms in the rain, you take a vow that you'd never leave your house even if you see a hint of smoke in the sky.And yeah...I take back my statement that rains make things romantic and I'd switch off those rain songs where those heroines act as though they are having the time of their life.
