     
      I prefer to be whipped only by quadriplegic midgets who can play the Star Spangled Banner on a $5 Casio keyboard with their tongue.     Okay, opening the floor for comments: I need suggestions.  I recently got a gig with AOL, writing reviews of stores and boutiques for their  urlLink Digital City site . Think Citysearch, but I'm not supposed to say that. I need suggestions of places to write up and am open to all possibilities.   FYI: I just did One Eyed Jacques, so RPG geeks have been addressed already (this means you, Jimi!!) I don't think I know my editor quite well enough yet to Priscilla's and Taboo yet (damn!) Help!
