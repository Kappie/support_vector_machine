In the afternoon I prepared Bisibelebhath. a new dish, which I listened from one of my colleague and tried out. It came out good only. Ellam naanthaan sollikiren, sollikka vendiyathu thaan. My cousin Suganya was my test subject and she gave pass mark...... I dint trouble srini this time. Next time, probably tomorrow, I will make him also to undergo the test.   Full day I thought I would take rest, but then cleaning the house and arranging things ate up my entire day and so did the week end too go with work and work. Especially washing clothes and dish washing is the biggest time eater. Its becoz srini often gives me leave in cooking, I do get a bit of time to relax. As I am new to cooking, I do cook slowly and need to pace up.  I would like to learn cooking North Indian Dishes as Srini loves it, (girls/ guys if u know any good north indian recipe kindly intimate to me especially paneer items, let me give a try) but then he insists on not spending much time in cooking. But cooking is my new venture, and as I see, that I am not such a worse cook, my interest in it doubles and I long to cook too. But srini toh, ties my hands, and I dont know, from whom to learn all those north Indian dishes. Anyway soon I will give a try at those too and surprise him.  We bought a new Sony Music system yesterday. Its in Grey color chasis. we actually ordered for grinder too, but its yet to be delivered. So as such we have now started furnishing our home. Hope by this weekend all the most necessary amenities would have been taken care.  Saturday srini invited his friends and i cooked tomato rice. It was also good and i am becoming an expert in preparing that u know.   Sunday i cooked rice, sambar, meal maker fry, cabbage and carrot poriyal. Everything tasted good u know, especially mealmaker fry, srini loved it. Arey i cook so many new items and i have to drill this fellow to eat. but he never repents and abides. But still to learn so many.  We dint go to any concert as planned before. I would have loved to go to Sanjay Subramanyan's concert on thursday, but as srini went to donate blood to one of his colleague's acquaintance, he couldnt take me and so i couldnt go. Yesterday evening we planned to go to Sudha Raghunathan's concert but then as it was raining so heavily, we couldnt. Anyway we had a nice time chatting with his friends, who are so humourous to the core. My god, what a bunch they are!!!  Yesterday evening i went home late waiting for srini. But as he was busy, he couldnt pick me up and so i had to go by myself. How boring its to be alone at home. Thanx for the music system which we bought! Then i started cooking for three of us(Srini, myself and his friend). As i started cooking, i started receiving calls after calls and so i couldnt cook properly with full concentration. Illatti mattum romba olunga samikirennu nenappu. Finally with milk boiled over and onion and dal, fried a bit (all these happened as i was talking over phone) i presented a delicious dinner to the two. Poor them!! But the thing is, it was like, u can eat and the side dishes tasted really good inspite of some hiccups.   What every body's mouth is watering to taste my samaiyal?  Wait wait, avvalavu seekiram invite panna maaten. Still i need to learn some special varieties which i am planning to do once my mom comes for a vacation from 18th Aug! So after my coaching classes are over, Bangaloreans, keep ur tummies empty to fill up with my Sourashtra Cuisine!   Sindu, nalla oor suthriya! Sari sari snaps aavathu anuppu enna. Nangalum nee kandukittatha kandukurome.   Why so many people have gone for Hibernation? Wake up everybody. Otherwise i will come out with my tasty preparations to be tasted by u all soon!   Hei other than Bangaloreans, u all have to wait till u get ur chance.  With lots of hopes to cook for u all soon, its  bye for now from Ranjini
