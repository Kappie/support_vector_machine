A whisper has been growing in the west, an untold fear that Baity hath past into the land where he could no longer post to his fans (couldn't resist). Well life has continued to go on, much as it has the past few months. I think the last thing I posted was about my girlfriend and me breaking up......well we gave it another shot.....and we almost made it to a year, but not anymore. Some things just aren't meant to be at the moment and although it hurts I must reflect and become stronger.   Well there you go, thats it, thus ends the catch-up lesson, Baity's back, Baity's stronger and I am definitly..............................off to bed, I shagged!   Baity signing off...........
