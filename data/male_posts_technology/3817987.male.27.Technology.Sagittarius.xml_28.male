After so ho-hum stuff about Nate's grief and Claire's art, the episode embark on David's odyssey following pitching up a hitchhiker.  David ends up beaten, robbed, forced to smoke crack, and a myriad of other indignities.  My mother was right!  Never pick up hitchhikers, even ones that seem nice and appear to have just ran out of gas! The may force you smoke crack!
