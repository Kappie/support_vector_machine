All I can see is the blur of the shapes around me. Are they my family? The distant voices sometimes remind me of people I knew.  But I've stopped trying. There is no point anymore. Focus on the voice you believe to be your mother crying, and she will fade away. The harder I try, the further they slip away. No, I can't stop trying. They can't get away. I don't want to be here, alone and cold. Wake me up!  "Wake me up!" I cry. I wish I could cry. I have no tears left, or I never had any.  I have a memory of a cat - I think it's my cat - as it jumps around trying to catch the toy hanging from a string. I'm holding the string. No, it's not a cat. It's a kitten; curling itself on my lap and going to sleep. Sleep in the red pool. Throw in a coin and make a wish. I wish I had a coin.  Once again I hear a distant sobbing of the little girl. I whisper to her.  "I'm all right. I'll soon come back. Shhhh, I'm all right."
