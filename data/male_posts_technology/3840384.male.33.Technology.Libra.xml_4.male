I have read it many times and every time I read it I am reminded of how easy it is not to find the right person. Of course I only tend to read it after someone else has rubbed my nose in this fact, so the reminder is probably not needed. But the humor about it is.    I will quote the book's dedication:        This book is dedicated to every man who has ever  laid his heart on the line and has the skid marks to prove it. As for the women who read it, by all rights, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves. But, on the other hand, we realize it will probably leave you feelinga little superior in the end. All we can say is, the next time you wonder where all the warm, caring guys are, try looking under your heel. You'll probably find one there.
