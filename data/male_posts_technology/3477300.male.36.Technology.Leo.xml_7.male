(Nasdaq:YHOO - news), Microsoft Corp. and EarthLink Inc., urged all Internet providers to police their networks more aggressively and cut off machines suspected of being launching pads for spam."    Damn good idea if you ask me.  Having said that, it'd be good if someone could suggest a nice deamon I could run on my servers that does the job for me!
