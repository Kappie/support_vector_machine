I got my  urlLink MRI  of my wrist done yesterday. that went swimmingly. The doctor used a used a  urlLink Fluoroscope  to get a live xray view of my wrist while injecting the dye into the joint. It was pretty awesome watching the bones in my hand and wrist move around on the TV. the only shitty thing is that my body started reacting to the needle, and I got a little dizzy. I was pissed because I wanted to watch, but I was getting all cross-eyed.  the injecting of stuff into my wrist has made my wrist really sore, and it's all achey today. it kind of sucks....  tonight, George, James, and I will be going to see  urlLink Napoleon Dynamite . We'll see how that goes. I hope it lives up to my expectations (which are, admittingly, kind of high).   hmph. better get back to work.  tah tah!
