The first song has already made it through the mastering, but I am going to push it through the process one more time to make sure I actually like the sound I am hearing. I figure I should expect to use up about 4 hours per song in order to get the masters complete. I don't think that is too bad considering this whole recording process has gone pretty fast when I look back at how much we got done in the amount of time it took to record it.   Check back soon for more news on the mastering of the Third Rail songs.
