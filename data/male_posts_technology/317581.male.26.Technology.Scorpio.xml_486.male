You can fool anyone into believing whatever you want them to believe, because it's all not real. You are the only one who knows the real you, and you can hide that information forever. You can bluff anything. You can't know anything. We play videogames, but we do seem to be just our brains, and they're just playing who we are as people./  It's not a world I want to live in. I want to be who I am and present myself as me. I don't want to have to fake who I am. I don't want to appear to change me to better represent a compatible person. I do want to be the best me I can be and present that in the most honest person that I am.  Just some thoughts on me- Tim
