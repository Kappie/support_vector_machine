This is no paradise. I guess it depends on where you are at the moment that fully defines the phrase when used.   So my T40 has not arrived yet. It's been (I think) a full two weeks since I've written on here and still no T40. I am getting antsy, so to speak. I can't find a reason why I need the laptop right now. I know I can wait a month for it...so why do I want it now? I'm crazy.   I recently bought a game called Eternal Darkness (for $15 bucks at Gamestop.com). It's a pretty scary game...but it is more interesting than it is scary. You lead a character that finds out her grandfather has been murdered and she has to find out who did this and why. But the story gets more convoluted as you go, finding out that her grandfather was actually studying occult magics and information leading to the paranormal surfaces after investigating certain secret areas of the house. You then proceed to read pages lost from a book made of human skin and bone (disgusting). You then lead the girl's ancestors at different locales towards finding the same book (during that time period) and finding out what happens to them. It is a really interesting game that leads you through different time periods of human history (and the way they speak latin during the Roman era is completely awesome). Overall, an excellent game for an awesome purchase price.
