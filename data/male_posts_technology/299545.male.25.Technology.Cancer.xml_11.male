The  urlLink Advanced Studies Progarm  at  urlLink St. Paul's  was a great summer where I studied Biomedical Ethics, rowed crew, and had my first college-like experience. I have an interview in a few hours for a teaching internship in either Artificial Intelligence or Law and Finance.   Wish me luck!
