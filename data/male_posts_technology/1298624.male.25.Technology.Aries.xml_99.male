The idea of God or any supreme force in the universe is sketchy at best and arguments to refute the idea of God become dependent upon our own belief structure in the "unknown"  I think that just the fact we believe an "unknown" could exist brings in the possibility that God and/or a supreme force in the universe may exist as well. I have been thinking long and hard about this very same argument. My personal opinion comes down to two assumptions.   1). Many (and I mean billions) believe there is a supreme being of immense power that looks over us. How can one refute the belief of many? There has to be a reason why so many people take an idea of a all-knowing deity to heart.   2). There is no supreme force. There is no God. When we die, we cease to exist. The universe is finite in our reality because we are not enlightened enough to believe and/or prove that the universe is forever.  Now admitting to these assumptions would bring in more questions, such as if there is no God, then why do we lose 21 grams of our body weight the EXACT moment we die? (supposedly it's the soul leaving the body). Who made this bible and why do so many people model their lives after it?  Questions. It's all about questions. If you ever thought why do we have a purpose in life, well, I think it's to ask questions. We live to question the purpose of living. Maybe that's the answer after all. If it is, then believing in the idea of a God would be much easier.   The problem with this and nearly every answer to the question of God is thrown sideways by the ignorance of organized religion and idiot religious fanatics out there who kill others for their beliefs.  Watch Dogma. If there was any movie that explained better, it would be Dogma. The message is there. I believe it.
