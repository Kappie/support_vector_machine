I'm enjoying getting out of pure-codemonkey status, and getting into system design in addition to coding. 3) Oh ya - I'm divorced now - thus topic 1 :)  So ya, single FyL is back on the scene, mothers lock up your daughters.  Or don't, if they're old enough for me, they probably don't live there anymore anyways, and I'm not exactly the "grab the first 18 year old you see, cause she thinks your cool cause you can buy beer" type anyways :)  Why'd I get a divorce? If you want to know, I've probably already told you, if not - well sorry, ask me sometime.  When did I get a divorce ? we split up about 5 days after that last post (Jan 10) and were official divorced at some point in February (18th I believe).  So where am I at now?  Same geographical location.  New truck though! yay!  Explorer was about done for, so I traded it in and got myself a 2000 Ford F150, my first Full-Size truck ever.  Used to have an S10 in high school, but it had certainly been awhile, definitely liking a car I can actually fit in comfortably, gotta give thanks for that.  Well, it's late, I'm tired, and no one reads this thing but me, and maybe Brian or Kaleb.  Hi guys if you're there. If you're not, I hate you suck.  or something. I dunno  Anyways, I hope this message finds everyone happy, healthy, and a bit wiser from the days experiences.  If you know any hot chicks who would like to date a total dork like me, please feel free to send em my way. I'm both a scholar and a gentleman.  Phil.
