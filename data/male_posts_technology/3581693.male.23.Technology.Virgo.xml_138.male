Well - lazy Shaun is just about dead - and crazy Shaun is starting to come into his own.   Starting to get the feel for the kind of girls he's interested in. Certain likes and dislikes, etc., but here's the hard part...how to get the ball rolling.   Remember - Shaun has no "game" (this is of course the technical hip term).   In his last effort to hit on the cute girlsworkin' at West 49 - he cleverly said "Hey! So where's the big party at tonight?" - mmmmmmmm hmmmmmm - yeah not a good line!   His cousin was supposed to give him some pointers - but he got too involved watchin' the body massage G.I.JOE cartoon "Who wants a body massage? It's the body massage machine. Body massage!" ... so now he must turn to you...   Some of you are cute young girls - so you must know what you like...and how you like to be approached for the first time.   After that... it's a matter of finding some young ladies who aren't all about "clubbin' and gettin' high" - a true rarity in this day and age...   Anyways - your suggestions would be most appreciated - I can't get by with just a toit body and cute smile forever!
