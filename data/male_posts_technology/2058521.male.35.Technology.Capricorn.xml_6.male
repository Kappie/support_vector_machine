Hint: You can add custom dictionaries, e.g. "http://dict.leo.org/?search=$".   urlLink Diggler : Adds a button next to the location bar that can clear the location bar (much like the one in Konqueror) and also drop down a menu with more actions.   urlLink Download Manager Tweak : A modification of the Firefox download manager that changes its appearance and allows it to be opened in a separate window, a new tab, or the sidebar.   urlLink Googlebar :  An unofficial Google toolbar for Firefox.  Note: There is also  urlLink GooglebarL10N , which gives you localized version.   urlLink LiveHTTPHeaders : View HTTP headers of a page and while browsing.   urlLink Mouse Gestures : Allows you to execute common commands using mouse gestures.   urlLink ReloadEvery : Reloads webpages every so many seconds or minutes.   urlLink SuperScroll : Override the default keyscroll and mousewheel settings.   urlLink Tabbrowser Extensions : Improves tabbed browsing a lot. Note: This extensions seems to seriously slow-down Firefox.   urlLink Web Search Plus : Uses the current Search Bar engine for context-menu Web Searches.   These two come pre-installed with Firefox:    urlLink Web Developer : Adds a menu and a toolbar with various web developer tools.  Dom Inspector: You'll need to enable this when you install Firefox - choose the 'Custom install' and check the box for 'Developer tools'. The  DOM  inspector allows you to view the 'Document Object Model' for a web page. See  urlLink here  for more information. Also note that the extension manager of Firefox 0.9.2 seems to have a problem with it ( urlLink search Google ).   Note: This list of extensions is an update of myearlier posting  urlLink A look at Web Browsers and File Managers .
