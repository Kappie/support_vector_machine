Its definitely not the most exciting job in the world, I think once I get the swing of things, I will really start to enjoy it more. But it will be good for me to gain a little work experience and make a little money. I always thought that as soon as I start working I would just find the perfect job making 6 figures and love what I was doing. Well, maybe that will be the case in my second job!  Tomorrow I am looking forward to organizing my desk and the hundreds of emails that I automatically get from ASP Mail. This morning I had over two thousand emails! First time I had even turned on my computer and I have over 2000 emails! I read every single one, just joking. I did look at most of them tho, but it didn't take very long because approx. 90% of them were one liners containing between 40-50 characters a piece. I set up some filters so most email organizes itself when it comes in.  I also have some online training to do. I think I will do that in the morning and then organize my space in the afternoon. I can't forget to make my lunch in the morning.  We had Youth Leadership tonight and Levie gave me the new Pine Cove CD, I haven't really got a chance to do it yet, but thanks to Sydney Berry the case looks really cool! We also sign big huge cards to Courtney and Christian. Today is Christian's B-day, HAPPY BIRTHDAY C-Train!!!
