Play for about 10 minutes at a time. There's something about it that I just don't like. It's very samey and makes me jump a lot, but that doesn't really make a good game.     It's 8.20 am on a Saturday now. That's very early for me, but I was knackered last night, so I went to bed early. Today looks like it will be a busy day. Alex needs back to school shoes, off to look at cars and need to get into the loft to sort out old skiing stuff (may be going at Xmas).  Only 3 things to do today, but that will turn into loads more when it doesn't rain and I have to cut down the conifers (not a favorite job of mine).  Saw some of the Olympics for the first time this week. Not a big sports fan, specially when loads of them cheat. I'd like to see, 'who's got the wrong trousers on ?' competition, around the Olympic sized swimming pool, just like in Hi-De-Hi.
