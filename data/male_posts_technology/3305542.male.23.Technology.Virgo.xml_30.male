And if any of you are Pro-Bush, I would love to hear your take on it.  Most of my friends are liberal Bush haters (myself included).  I also saw Spider-Man 2.  I thought it was good.  I'd say it was better than the first.  On the 4th, my family had a gathering at my sister's house.  We played bocce ball and tennis.  It was a good time.  Last night, I hung out with Matt and Steve.  We walked down to this hidden little beach on the river.  We trespassed a couple times and had to jump over a fence, drank some brewdogs, built a fire, took a dip in the river in the nude, I fell in the fire, Matt broke both of his sandles, I think I bruised the bottom of my foot, I puked (not in that order)...  So it was a good time.  I spent all of today recovering.  Well, that is it for now.  - Jeff
