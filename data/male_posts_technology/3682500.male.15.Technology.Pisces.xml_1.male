Have you ever been bombarded with ads, alerts, or anything else from advertisers? They could have your IP and might be sending you those ads through their so called "knowledge"  Do you just want to be a secretive hermit with an IP address that isn't yours?  Well, you can be.  In a recent study I did on a message board, my methods shown proven to work as I had fooled all the moderators and admins by having a fake IP address (Yeah, I was DetMan). So how could I pull this kind of stunt off, be logged into two accounts at the same time in the same place, on the same message board, posting  stuff at the EXACT same time? Very easily, follow these steps below:  1. Get two TYPES of browsers, one will be for normal internet use, while the other will be manipulated to mask your IP address. You can get more if you want, I recommend IE from microsoft and  urlLink Mozilla/Firefox . There are others. 2. Once you get the browsers, go to  urlLink StayInvisible  and  click on the IP test. Go through it and record your IP address - it will be useful for the next step. 3. On that site, go to the list of proxies (view proxies). Go ahead and pick one out that either has anoniminity or high anoniminity. I personally wouldn't recommend the transparent ones because I have not tested them yet. Choose one that has an IP address very different from the one you have for better results. 4. Once you have chosen the proxy, record it's IP address and port number. Then head over to your manipulated browser's preferences/options. If IE, Tools, options, connections, and if running cable/LAN/DSL, choose LAN settings. Otherwise, choose the dialup connection you are going to use to set the proxy settings and click on settings. In the section that says "Proxy Settings," mark the checkbox and enter the IP address of the proxy. Then, enter the corresponding port number in the next box. Click Apply. 5. Exit the manipulated browser and start it up again. Then go to the StayInvisible website once more and click on the IP test. If you cannot get to some site for some reason or if the proxy is working too slowly for you, go ahead and uncheck the box in the proxy settings and choose another server IP from the list. Otherwise, complete the IP test and see if the IP results match your real IP. If they do, click on the link below the test similar to "I am using a proxy server, why is my real IP still shown" and follow the instructions there. 6. If needed, take the test over again and change settings until your real IP is not shown. If all is successful, well...you're done then. YAY!  Your other browser should have your real IP address still, so you can use it if you don't need to hide your real IP address. Yah...  Oh, and to you guys at the TCoA...you should have left me as a moderator.    Next Week: Interview with a bot - Part One  See ya! Reality Corp.
