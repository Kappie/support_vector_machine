Fri morning, I went for the interview at a small french-german company consisting of just 3 persons. The Dir was not available then because he was at the Dr's, I think. But the other two had given me the impression that the company held a lot of promise and there was a lot of space and possibilities to grow. The company provides several software packages in the form of inventory, revenue monitoring, reservation sys to the hospitality industry and more in the region. They are already providing support to several big hotels here and I was so impressed with what they had accomplished with just 3 person. It doesn't surprise me that they actually need to hire another person to help out either. The job sounds really challenging to me though somewhat less technical which was exactly how I had pictured it. I'm guessing that once I go into this, there'll be no room for me to jump back out into the IT/programming aspect of IT anymore. For starters there'll be a lot of answering of calls to answer users' queries and help solve their problems. But as time passes, they hope that more responsibility can be assigned to assist certain areas of their work for on-site installations, trainings, upgrades, maintenance, etc. This is why there may be some travelling involved overseas. What really struck me was the great working atmosphere the team had. The Dir is transparent with the revenue the co. is generating so everyone knows where the money is coming in from. The only down point was that they were only able to offer 1.6k for the first 3 mths during training, and then 1.8k. This is seriously low to what I'm hoping to get. I was really frank when I left and I said I needed to think things over because of the pay. They were really generous, cordial and open from beginning to end.  I asked a lot of opinions from my parents and friends. My parents agreed the the pay was a bit low and that the job entails some OT usually, being a customer service oriented job. I'm not surprised even if there may be a need to remain contactable during weekends and public holidays despite it not being the official office hour. Neo especially made me re-evaluate what was it I really wanted from a job/career. (YO! You happy now boh? Got mention your name leh! :P) I realised a lot of things about myself that I had tried to avoid asking myself for sometime too. Conclusions I had drawn, I wanted to be sure that I'm not just taking up any job to 'escape' the programming area of IT, that what I really wanted was job satisfaction instead of just monetary rewards. That I'm willing to take the job up to another level and push myself beyond what others may not want to do. All these are what I expect of myself when I've decided to place my foot down on the direction my career will be taking and I don't see any other way beyond this. I'm still willing to keep my options open at this point because I still feel really keen about the SPF. But everything I've heard about the job has seriously tempted me to try out something else on a long term basis. In fact, I've only just emailed them saying I'm willing to take up the job if I do get shortlisted. Let's hope everything works out.  Went back to work in the afternoon and didn't manage to talk to my boss about my decision to stop work till the end of the day. He was nice about it and he actually took up a chair to have a good long talk with me. I was aware he had delayed/cancelled a delivery/meeting that evening just to talk to me and we spoke till about 2 hrs after closing time. He's a honest, traditional man who is open to many things. After hearing things out from him I realise how much he had gone through. I even understood why he had requested that I be willing to try things out in the co for a week before he decided to pay me. No doubt I may have helped him out for free the past 5 days but I really hadn't done too much there either. Sounds a bit foolish but I do pity him more than I pity myself. I also respect what he has put himself through to have what he has now, and what he is going through now just to keep the company going too, but there's all the suffering and hiccups from yester-years that I didn't see which has made him a stronger person. He was actually quite keen to help me grow both as a person and in the company and it's a pity I wasn't the right person for the job.  The long talk with him made me almost all of us just want a comfortable job that we can work in because of the stability it provides - entering a big company where things are already stable and there's a system in place. But if you're in a small co. and you're able to make something out of it or turn things around, I think that's where we can impact the greatest difference and climb our way up too. I was kinda relating these thoughts - from the interview, the long chat session - to my asipirations to join the SPF. I realised that it meant more to me that I make a difference in Singapore in whatever small way I can than to get a great paying job. But on the downside, I also realised that I really wanted that comfortable level and stability much more. I wished what I felt was evened out on a 50-50 basis so that I can have the best attitude for things, especially so since it will affect my decision on selecting a job/career now. I dunnoz ... I just hope I've made the right decisions and reevaluations of my job-selection criteria and I'll be really happy about the decisions I'd have made when I re-read my blog 10 years down the road.  Almost failed to mention that I kinda strained my back lifting some stuff on Thurs/Fri. It doesn't feel particular bad but it sure feels damn weird. I'm not gonna make myself start training anytime soon until I'm sure it's nothing serious. I've seen too many bad back-related injuries in NS to take this too lightly. Anyway, it may not be bad to stop lessons for awhile, I can concentrate fully on finishing my ePrep course and job-hunting too. Oh noted one point about my CV during my interview. Apparently they kinda got the impression most of my experience were all very short-termed. I quickly explained the dates to them that all these were fixed due to sch vacation dates, contract, internship dates etc. Looks like I better include a new point "Reason for leaving" in my CV just in case most people aren't aware of how the local academic dates work. Just felt this might be a very important point in a CV.
