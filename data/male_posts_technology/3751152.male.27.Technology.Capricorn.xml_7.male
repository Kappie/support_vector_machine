In that space of 24 hours I have been shocked by two things 1) Londoners have legs, and 2) Londoners are generous. Let me explain....  A lot of people commute into London from the suburbs and beyond. We have quite an extensive public transport network consisting of underground and over-ground trains, buses, taxis etc. The rail union for underground staff decided to hold a strike which people feared would bring London to a standstill and would cost the economy a heck of a lot of money. So this morning I walked into work - which is only like 25 mins and I often walk in anyways. The buses were packed, the roads were chockablock with cars, buses and taxis. It was total gridlock. Buses were having to drop people off half-way along the route leaving disgruntled commuters stuck half-way to work, but as I was walking along I noticed something amazing. There were lots of other people walking and more cyclists than normal. I was quite surprised, I guess when the worst happens and you have to get into work you make the effort. It does makes me wonder why these people don't walk more often.   But anyways, I can't comment coz I do often get the bus, and I did for the journey home (mainly because I wasn't feeling well - summer cold or something coming on methinks). So I waited with the not-so-large queue of people and got on the first bus that came. Well one lady didn't have change for the ticket machine (in central london you now have to buy your ticket before getting on the bus) and looked quite dismayed as she trudged off the bus having been told by the bus driver he had no change so couldn't take her. But then, from out of nowhere her guardian angel appeared, a lady who had like a carnet of bus tickets and just gave her one. How's that for generosity! Well it certainly proved to me that out there there are nice people in the world, and thanks to one of them, that lady got home a little earlier than she would have done with her faith in the world restored :)
