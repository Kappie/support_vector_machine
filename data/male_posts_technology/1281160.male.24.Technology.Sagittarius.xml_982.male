But in this case the factors are not restricted to the access to communication medium alone... I can give quite a few names who do have unrestricted access to the medium but still are reluctant to participate...   Equal access to communication medium is a vital factor.. but not THE factor... a lot depends on the attitude of the person as well.. does he/she really want to get it going... if they do, they would try to eke out some time somewhere and participate even though they may not be as active as a few others.. but if they don't want to.. then give them months of unrestrcited access to hundreds of equivalent media and still u r not going to extract a word out of their mouth...
