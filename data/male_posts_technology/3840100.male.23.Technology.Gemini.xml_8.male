Now the mixing portion can begin then we'll move on to the mastering.  I have decided to get the mastering plug-in for my studio so I will officially have a complete setup.  Finally after 5 years of building the studio it will be complete.    I will keep you posted on the latest with the  urlLink Third Rail  songs.  Finally we have some news on my solo album,  Off the Deep End .  The cover art is complete and I promise the album will be coming out after the  urlLink Third Rail  songs are completed.  Check out the cover!!!      That's all the tasting I can allow for Off the Deep End at this point, but stay tuned.
