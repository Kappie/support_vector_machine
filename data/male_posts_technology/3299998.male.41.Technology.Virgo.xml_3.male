(they did but they didn't "hit" the sack together).  I think that the whole point of the movie is that they didn't, that thier relaltionship was at a different level i.e. they were two lost souls in this alien environment who connected. Gender and sex had little to do with it. I have great respect for Sofia Capolla as a director. So much goes unsaid in Her movies they always leave you with questions. The content is as much in what is not said or shown as in what is shown. The movie was about emotion and relationships - from that aspect the acting was supreme.  I have heard that some Japanese who have seen the movie have been offended about the aspects of the culture that were shown. I can appreciate that, but it was used for effect to highlight that they were in a culture alien to thier own - they were outside their own cultural safety zones with only each other for comfort and solice. Even the some of the Europeans they encountered were outside what they could relate to. So.. a top movie to be added to my list of Fav's
