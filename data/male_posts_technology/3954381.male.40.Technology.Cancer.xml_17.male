The percent "match" has ranged from 100% to 50%, yet when I look a little closer at their profiles the reality sees to be even lower, i.e. they are looking for "Athletic and Toned" matches (I'm working on it).  During the past year I have sent out "winks" or emails to guys whose pics and profiles I have been interested in....but for some strange reason I never hear back from them.  Now I have not been completely unsuccessful in my attempt at finding love through Match.com; last year, shortly after I registered and placed my ad I did hear from a local gentleman who said he was interested.  Rob and I met on the Friday night before Labor Day weekend, he was nice, decent looking, good job, stable and we shared some similar interests.  We went out a few times and I had him over to my place on more than one occasion for dinner and or a movie.  But he never seemed interested in sex.  That was ok with me; I mean sex is good....real good in fact, but I want intellectually to have a connection with my significant other as much as, perhaps more than a sexual connection.  Anyone can satisfy me sexually (well, within reason) but intellectually I need to be stimulated as well, and isn't that more important?  Things were going ok, I guess until sometime around the end of September he just stopped returning my calls.......  More recently I received an email from a gentleman in Maryland who found my picture and profile to be the answer to his dreams.   I replied in earnest, inquiring why he would be singling me out when I live about 3-4 hours from him.....but I told him I was game if he was.  A month later he replied.  We chatted one evening on AOL and I impulsively asked him if he'd like to go to dinner, near him; I thought hey it's time for me to have an adventure.  He agreed on a Wednesday night.  However on Thursday he indicated that the upcoming weekend wouldn't be good.   I sensed he had second thoughts.  We chatted a few more times but mostly after exchanging a few pleasantries he would say he was really busy and had to work.  Ok.....whatever.  I had wanted to say "Hey buddy, YOU initially contacted ME, if you aren't interested then FINE.....but just come out and say it."  But due to my amazingly well bred upbringing, I refused to allow myself to say that.  Instead I just deleted him from my buddy list and wouldn't you know.....it solved the problem.  I couldn't tell he was online because he never contacted me again.  About six months ago I signed up with Gay.com.  At first I thought, "Cool" - a lot more members than AOL and more chat rooms.  Upon closer inspection I came to realize that they were essentially the same guys from AOL I have been seeing online over and over again.  The one plus Gay.com has is a plethora of fake user ids; all who seemed to want to chat with me and have me visit their web cam site....for a price I am sure.  As of today I have dropped both Match.com and Gay.com from my personal payroll.  I don't need to be paying extra money to sites with gay members who will reject me when I can stay connected to AO-Hell and be rejected by some of NJ and NY's finest gay men.  I am not ceasing my quest for a lifemate, I think rather I am discontinuing my quest online....for now.
