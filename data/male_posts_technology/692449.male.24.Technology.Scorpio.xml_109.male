Susan is going out of town on tuesday for a couple of days and I have been enlisted in watering her plants and feeding her cats, or is that the other way around. I don't know things are a really odd right now. I keep getting the sense that something big is going to happen. By the way erica I'm sorry I haven't e-mailed you back recently.
