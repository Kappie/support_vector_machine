My circulation (not blood) is now up to three people and is poised to further increase to four.  I plan to continue this exponential growth until I completely cripple  urlLink Blogger  (run by  urlLink Google ) with my the overwhelming throngs of supporters, well-wishers, groupies, followers, disciples, fans, boosters, and enthusiasts who will crush these servers with their incessant thirst for more and more of my intelligent and thought provoking discussions.  Just you wait.
