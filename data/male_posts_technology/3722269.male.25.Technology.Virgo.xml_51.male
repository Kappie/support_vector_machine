What sort of an idiot am I? ahahah I guess I was caught up in the whole 'commitment and dedication' thing. Gah. Beat me with something solid, so I make these errors less frequently.  *bangs head on desk* Nevermind. It will be fine, I will be fine, -thinks postively- Business meeting on Tuesday, that I'm ill-prepared for, somehow Tuesday seemed further away on Thursday.. yeah, I'm sure that makes sense to someone other than me. Dad hoisted the tipper deck of the truck into the spouting on the house today, made me chuckle, but in his defence, it was close to not hitting. The Rotorua style fence that runs down the side of the driveway is getting steadily more toward the otara-side of its contruction attributes..  theres a very nice 4-5 metres, of dressed treated timber, then just the supports for that timber, then the last section is corrugated iron, the kiwi staple of construction, in various states of rusting/falling down... Saw a guy in town putting up some rustic sorta 'olde wooden' gates for the entrance to this Maoritanga gallery, and I had to chuckle to myself, he'd hinged the wrong side for the gates to open toward the street, leaving only the option of them opening inwards, which in itself isnt a problem, but the length of the gates was greater than the distance between the gates and the doors to the shop, so even opening them inwards wouldnt work terribly well, and as the construction of them, leaves them to be about 20cm thick, it will at best, make a very narrow entrance, ridiculously narrow.. especially considering the width of your average rotoruaian. Classic. Rotorua is a bit like that, lots of people with big-town ideas and small town follow-through... I remember after a year in auckland, coming back to have breads and dips at a rotorua cafe, now the people running the cafe had obviously -read- about or been told about breads and dips.. but hadnt grasped the concept, what we got was some white sliced normal kinda toast bread, and the same, in brown, and a few spoons of your chips and dip kinda dip. Fantastic. Nice one rotorua. hmm.. migrain.. I best be off. TTFN
