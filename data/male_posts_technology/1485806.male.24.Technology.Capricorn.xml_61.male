The new year have come again and it is time to start the year right with the Lord as it is a new year for new beginnings , a year to glorify the Lord.  For those people who are leaving soon , I pray that they will carry that passion to serve the Lord in their respective destination and they will carry that same spirit of champions to their places...to really bless the pastor and the Lord in every way possible.  For those who have feets still firmly planted on Malaysian soil, well we can do better...we pray that people will continue to flood the cell and we are able to rise up to impact the nations. ..This year start right by equipping yourself with the Word...so that you can stand strong with the words and not fall for the world. This year , allow your actions to speak louder than your words...to testify the goodness of the Lord... and if possible use words..  For the leadership of the Simply United, pray for them and support them in every way possible by even start asking your friends to come for cell...start by serving in the cell..if you have an idea for the cell to serve more effectively...bring it out with them. Learn to appreciate them with words and hugs.  I believe God have great plans for Simply United...and i believe God is preparing it already ..so don't be suprised when you heard God calling you to be there to serve..God is always in control  Fellow JesusFreaks
