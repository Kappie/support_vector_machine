In addition to adding 25 pounds to his 6 foot 2, 185 pounds frame, he suffered lots of other undesirable and harmful effects...   Within a few days of beginning his drive-through diet, Spurlock, 33, was vomiting out the window of his car, and doctors who examined him were shocked at how rapidly Spurlock's entire body deteriorated.   "It was really crazy - my body basically fell apart over the course of 30 days," Spurlock told The Post.   His liver became toxic, his cholesterol shot up from a low 165 to 230, his libido flagged and he suffered headaches and depression.   Spurlock has documented his month-long experience in a tongue-in-cheek documentary called, "Super Size Me", which he's taken to the Sundance Film Festival.  While one may argue that no one in their right mind would live only off McDonald's stuff, this experiment by Spurlock does indeed make a strong point against the junk food which is the source of the obesity epidemic that plagues America today.
