Our favorite wasa wine made from pineapple instead of grapes. We ended up bringing two bottles home with us.  I have been searching for this wine ever since. You can find places on the internet that have it available, and for a decent price too. The only issue is: some pompous assclown with a law degree has determined that wine cannot be shipped to Michigan residents.  Well at least we don't have lawyers telling us what drugsour doctors can and cannot prescribe...er..um..nevermind.
