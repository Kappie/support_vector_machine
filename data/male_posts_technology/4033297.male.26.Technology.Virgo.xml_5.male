I enjoy adventure and traveling; and i believe they should go hand-in-hand.    Having said that, I will tell you what you can expect from my journal entries.  Expect entries that depict my adventures, and yes, daily ramblings and the like.  But I will try to keep it interesting so people would actually return.    I will post my most unique pictures as well as the most memorable ones.  I work in the software industry, so most of my daily ramblingss will probably reflect that aspect of my life.    Well, I guess i'm ready to publish my first log.  Ya'll come back now you hear?!  Bye.
