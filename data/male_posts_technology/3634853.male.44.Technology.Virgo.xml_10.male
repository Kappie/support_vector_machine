Day 3 Recap   Sit N Goes    PokerStars    (1) $5 SnG no cash   -$5.50  18th place :(   PartyPoker    (1) $10 SnG  1st place  +$39.00    Limit Games    PokerStars    $1/$2 Game   -$22.75   UltimateBet    .25/.50 Game  +$1.25  Total  +$12.00   +$1.90  for days projection  -$25.90  for years projection  Summary  I had a rough start to the day when I played the SnG at PokerStars and ran into KK when I had QQ.  I raised coming into the pot about 5xBB and was just called by 2 people.  I didn't have any notes on anyone and no real reads so I probably jumped the gun, especially that early in the tourney, but when the flop brought rags but 2 of a suit I thought I wanted to make someone pay to draw to the flush.  Oh well, another lesson learned I hope.  After that I played about an hour of limit at UB and was up and down the entire time and when I had a small positive balance after that hour I decided to take a break.  I came back a bit later and played limit on Stars and never caught a break.  With AQ suited I had a flop of AAK, raised the pot and another guy capped.  Turned out he was on KK and never raised pre-flop and caught me off guard.  That was most of my losses there.  When I couldn't get anywhere after about another 1 1/2 hours I moved on again.  This is where I played the SnG at Party and early on I wasn't catching any starting cards at all.  I managed to steal a couple of blinds and just tried to stay patient.  Soon my cards changed.  I was getting great starting hands and any time I had a chance to put someone all in I did it and all but one of those hands held up.  I ended up knocking out 4 of the last 6 players and had such a large chip lead on the last 2 players that it was just a matter of me playing smart heads up and I won.  Overall, I didn't make a lot of money but was at least able to post another positive outcome and knocked my years deficit down a little bit. I think if I continue being patient, studying when I have time, and catch my share of cards that I should be able to have a realistic chance of maintaining my goals for year end.  Now if I can just do something good tonight in our home game.  If it's not too late and I'm not wiped out, I'll try to post a report later.  Until tomorrow.....
