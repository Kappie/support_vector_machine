Sloth  is a forthcoming graphic novel by Gilbert Hernandez and it sounds really strange:   The story features a teenager who wills himself into a coma, wakes up a year later, and is physically slower than everyone around him. Now he has to adapt to his world and relationships with the people around him.  That has to be one of the weirdest ideas for a work of fiction in any medium ever. Go Beto!
