Dinner time came and my parents were like arguing over who gets to make dinner. Duuuh ... me? I'm just contented to get some food at the end of it. Each was like criticising the other on the 'right' way to cook this or that. Goodness lor, who cares so long as the food at the end is decent enough and edible. Plus it's just fried rice!!! DUH!!!!  Again, arranged to meet Begh this evening. Once again, this stupid incident (over the silliest issue) made me delay dinner and had to cancel. @*^#$#...  Anyway, mood died down pretty fast while we were all eating. Think it's because of the Quan2 Xin1 Zhong3 Dong4 Yuan2 3 (Snap 3) on tv. The night was OK after that.  Sensei sms saying BB East had no training on Sat coz the hall was being used. I emailed Sensei about my back and videoing for the session when I pop down. Hopefully get a reply sometime this weekend. Otherwise may have to sms him liao by Mon.   urlLink Eileen  finally popped back onto the blog to 'show face'. Haha. Thought she MIA liao. And Gary sounds like he's enjoying his training too much to want to leave US. I dunno, I got the same feeling in UK as well. Just gets me thinking what was the difference I felt about here and UK exactly? Hmmmm .... class size, environment are the obvious ones. But what about with relation to training? I got no answer yet.  Realised I've downloaded too many articles of the past and not done enough reading for all of them. Was reviewing some when I came across something called 'Verbal Aikido'. Damn interesting article about handling verbal attacks. Just somehow got me thinking about how I can apply them when my parents make noise at me (or even vice versa). Dunnoz, maybe I'll post it after I finish it in detail and reflect a bit more over it.  Also realised my scope of job applications is slowly expanding from what I intended. Initially was non-IT/ programming intensive. Now it's starting to include things like VB, SQL etc. But then again I hope there's more willing to take in multimedia applications and stuff, especially those with 'willingness to explore and experiment' kind of criteria.  OK time to get back to my ePrep programme again. Time to get a job ...
