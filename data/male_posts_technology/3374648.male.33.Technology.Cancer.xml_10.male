So I was browsing the Blog of an  urlLink  old friend  I haven't seen for ages and she had a link to yet another Geek Quiz - the  urlLink  the Thudfactor Polygeek quiz .  Did it.  Here's the result.       You are   22%   geek     OK, so maybe you ain't a geek. You do, at least, show a bit of interest in the world around you. Either that, or you have enough of a sense of humor to pick some of the sillier answers on the test. Regardless, you're probably a pretty nifty, well-rounded person who gets along fine with people and can chat with just about anyone without fear of looking stupid or foolish or overly concerned with minutiae. God, I hate you.       urlLink Take the Polygeek Quiz at Thudfactor.com    Bugger.  Less time on Splinter Cell and talking to the wife required, more time playing UO and reading O'Reilly for me from now on.....
