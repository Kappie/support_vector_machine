I may one day just do this myself, but I wan't to make sure I either do it first, at the same time, or not at all.  Here's my plan:  Have my mouth physically stitched shut in the morning before sunrise. Stick a set of horse blinders on my head and put on some earmuffs. Position myself in front of one of the main buildings in D.C. and hold a sign that reads "I had a better sign, but it got censored." and on the back "I'de be more controversial, but then I wouln't make the news."  Spend a day out there, yes that means no water, no food and probably pissing yourself. It would be worth it though. I just need to go do it now. It only took a single man to stop a tank...      -intX    This phrase has been censored by the U.S. government.
