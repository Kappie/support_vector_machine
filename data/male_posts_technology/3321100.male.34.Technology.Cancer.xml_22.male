But I would like to talk about differents things now, like my way of life, the "French" point of view on other country, etc... Today, I would talk about.... Religion. I just want to express my point of view, so be cool, I judge no one, I just talk for me.  So I'm an atheistic catholic (funny no ?) It's a fact, If you want that a religion grow quickly, the simple things to do is to automatic convert baby, they never said "No ! I want to choose my religion later!"  So I'm catholic by obligation and I found that the way of life of catholic is a good things. I said "Way of life" because for me, people who had invented our religions are good people who just want to try to give a good way of life to our nation.  Catholic have tried to give some good advice like "don't hurt other people, love them" or "choose a wife and only one ;), for the better and the worse", and I'm ok so I try to do things like that.  But why they try to promise me the heaven ???  Is not enough to said "Do this and the life of everybody will be better ?" It seems that no. But how I could believe to heaven, a place that no one can talk, and where all is good. For me Heaven is here and now. After, there is nothing, and it's why things you do in your life was so important.  How I can believe that a man had walked on water an had rose from the dead (word is ressuscitate I think)??? If someone on TV news said that a man had rose from the dead, who could believe it ??? Not me it's sure ! In France, how many people pray on Sunday ? 2, 3 or 5 % ???? In a world where science could explain so many things, how do you want that I believe in a god who made the earth in 7 day ? Sorry, it will be possible 200 years ago, but now... Reincarnation is a better idea than heaven, I found it's a nice idea, I think it was in Buddhism religion, and a lot of people in France like this religion, another good advice is to protect all things on earth (insect, animal, plants, human, etc.). I had too many things to said about religion, but not enough time. My conclusion is that religion had helped us to build our society with good advice but there is limit to this concept that it seems we have reached. My own religion is very simple, I can do what I want to be happy if it hurt no one else.  I don't lie (if I can :s).  I help people who need me.  And the more important things is to protect all the other nature creation because it's the only real heaven that I could leave to my children (or children of my friends ;)).  Hope no one was insulted by my point of view, and in the other case, read again your religion advice, I'm sure there is something written that you need to be tolerant with people who doesn't think like you ;)
