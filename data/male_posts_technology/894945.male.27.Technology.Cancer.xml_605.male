Baity John and an elite band of pyromanics organised the purchase of a GRANDS worth of fireworks, the highest grade ones possible without a display license and a pair of rubber underpants. We went to a mates to let them off. We had a massive field to play with and people had organised a huge BBQ and some pumping tunes. We let off all sorts of rockets and .. er.. the other ground based ones, all very "ohh" and "ahhh". Also we didn't blow each other up, apart from a near miss with a quad rocket it all went swimmingly.  Tomorrow night is the Bobbie's official stag bash and it's going to rock, be great getting all the crew together.   Why don't you read the blog of a London call girl if you're  urlLink feeling a bit pervy .
