Some people might think  eating out in five or six star hotels could be exciting but I personally prefer going to small places. Hence, this time we went to the "Feast of Asia", a small Chinese restaurant along the Kormangla Inner Ring road. The food was spicy and tasty yet affordable. What more, I am planning to go there with Kalpana again. :)
