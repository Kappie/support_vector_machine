Last week, June 28th my wife and I joined weight watchers for the second time. We joined a few years ago when we lived in Washington State and we both lost quite a bit, myself a bit more than 60 pounds. However, life caught up with us, we moved to Boston, left "The Program" (Weight Watchers speak), had a baby and I managed to gain back all that I lost.  Now, we're back on the west coast, and we have a beautiful little 14 month old girl. I want this little girl to know her father when he's 60, 70, 80..... and I know that if I don't change my life a lot, she's not going to. I start this diet with 60 pounds to loose, going from 270 to 210. I haven't weight 210 since I was, hmmm, 25? Maybe less? I think 210 is a good weight for me. I'm 6'5" and I've got a fairly thick frame. Any less I think I'd be doing a Kate Moss impression.  I know the extra weight is killing me. I can feel it. I loose my breath climbing a flight of stairs. Running around the back yard with my daughter never lasts more than a minute or two before I'm too winded to go on. I had a blood test to get life insurance and my rates were higher due to my cholesterol. My knees hurt, I don't fit in a chair properly, my gut hits my desk, and I hate looking at my body in a mirror. I'm ready for a change, I'm doing it for me, my wife and my little girl.  I know Weight Watchers (I'll be lazy and type WW from here on in) works, and I know for me, it's the right way to loose weight. Some people may disagree or pooh-pooh it, but WW makes sense. You get tools to help you easily measure what you eat, keep track of it and get support and motivation. In some ways it's very basic. Eat less and exercise, the time honored and sensible way to cut the flab. Easy to say, but not easy to practice. WW gives me the structure I need, motivation (not the least of which is the weekly weigh in) and a sympathetic shoulder when I have a bad week. And no, they don't pay me :)  In fact, what I learned from the last time I did the program was how to cope with your desire to eat. One of the things they recommend is keeping busy. You can't eat if you're using your hands for something else. Hence the blog. Some rationale:  - A positive outlet for my emotions while I struggle with my weight and cravings. - Keep motivated via the prospect of extremely public humiliation. - Once I've lost the weight, having something to remind me of why I want to keep it off, for good this time. - Blogs are cool. - Maybe motivate someone like myself to loose some weight too.  Here's what you can expect if you read this blog on a regular basis. Please hold me to this! I tend to not follow through on things unless kept in check by some external force. Give me crap if I don't do these things!  - Post every time I weigh in, what my new weight is. - Post a picture of myself each week so I can see the change. - Post when I'm up or down, no matter what!  Thanks for reading.
