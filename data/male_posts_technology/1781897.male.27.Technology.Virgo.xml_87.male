In podunk Northern Cali, there is a small town called Kenwood which hosted the 39th annual pillow fighting championship this last weekend.  Picture this... 2 hicks, on a wet, metal pole...Straddling it like a horse...suspended 4 feet over a mud pit!  The fighters go at it until someone falls from the pole....best 2 of three.  Fucken amazing is all I can say...even better than the doods, is when it was the ladies turn.  Holy cat fight...so awesome.  It's like girls gone wild meets mud wrestling.  Wish you all could have seen it.   urlLink Here's the link  if you need to see it with your own eyes.  I know what i'm doing next year...that's all I can say!  Hope everyone had a fun, safe 4th!
