A warrant was pushing us to run under a certain timing each 3km run. I managed to get a better timing on the latter training but it was still pretty slow to me. My next guard is going to be next Fri. Yawwwwwnz...  This coming Sat is our Div's Enlistee Day. They've organised some stupid Dragon boat competition at the Singapore Dragoin boat Association at Kallang. Heard we'll be rowing a 1.2km race. Sounds interesting lah but considering it's a Sat, I'd rather have a simple run in camp instead. Anyway, no choice also.  Eileen has a nice saying from Tommy on her  urlLink blogpage . It's meaningful and it reminds me not to be too judgemental of others, a common tendency.
