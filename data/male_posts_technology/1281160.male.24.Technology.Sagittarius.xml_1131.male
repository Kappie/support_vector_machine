About a month back, on a friday evening we went to A R Rehman's concert at Symphony hall in Birmingham...it's one of the best halls in UK...it was jam packed with 70:30 ratio of Indians to English...he's quite popular in UK as his english stage play 'Bombay Dreams' was very successful which won him acclaims among British...and his next project 'Lord of the Rings' stage play to add to his credit...it was no 'singing dancing' show..but very professional with orchestra comprising of local english people belonging to Symphony hall group.  I wouldn't call the show a great one...according to Rehman it was first of its kind from him...so for a start it was good and made it one of my memorable evenings!  hey kishore...ticket varathu kulla sollitiya...but as he said, on may 3rd hopefully nan india manna thodauven....Right now im in a shopping spree...dont know if i'll be able to stuff all the things under the permissible weight limit. Coming weekend we are going to London...to pay a last visit before we leave! already Ram has promised me a red carpet welcome ;-) Ranjini sonna mathiri virundu pottudu yenakku...  Looking forward to seeing you guys in India...  Cheerio Sindu
