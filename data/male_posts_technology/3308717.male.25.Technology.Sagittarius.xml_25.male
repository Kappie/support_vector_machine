"June 21, 2004" the history books will read, "was the day Scaled Composites showed to the world that it was time for humanity to make its move into space." This will also signify that the governments around the world need to wake up and take things a little more seriously.   Some people would argue that we do not need to go into space, that we still have oceans to explore here. I would say they were correct; however, it is not the fact that we do not need to go into space, it is what we learn by attempting these things that gets us further. I would estimate a good 85% of what we use daily was developed durring or for missions into space.  Anyhoo, good luck Scaled Composites.    -intX    Warp Seven! ENGAGE!
