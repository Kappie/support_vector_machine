His tired eyes refocus to a wisp of dust that has been his companion for the last two hours. It has not moved. Neither has its relatives. Remnants of an empire lost. He rubs his tired eyes, but does not see. The white luminescent glow of a halogen lamp cast dark shadows. Fingers rested lazily upon his home. An instrument of efficiency and deft, but proved to no use upon the unknown error. It has occurred. He does not see. The air is still.  He stares at the glow from a lamp. A light so bright that brings severe contrast to his place of slumber. Black and white is the color of the room as the shadows stand at attention. Forever do they wait for him. There is no color in this world. He stares at the lamp but thinks nothing at all. He achieves what is unattainable for all.   He is on the outside looking in. The unknown error silently laughing at all who would choose to challenge it. The lamp flickers briefly to a power fluctuation. Everything changes for one second. One perfect second. He sees it now. Creased lines of recognition spread across his face. He knows.
