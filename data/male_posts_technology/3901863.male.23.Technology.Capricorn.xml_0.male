All the profs are of high quality and make an impact in the class. Here in tests, there are no questions on theory. Only problems. At most derivations maybe asked. Focus is on applying the theory to problems. Another common thing here is case studies - a case writeup is given and one has to give a solution for it - this can get pretty boring. The subjects for the 2.5 month first term are introductory - the fundamentals for the remainder of the course. The first year has 3 terms and all subjects are compulsory. The subjects are quantitative methods (I like this), microeconomics (I like this, it has a lot of problems, but the prof screws everybody with tough problems in the test:(( ), financial accounting (this one is good too), organizational behavior (this is taught at a practical level and we had MBTI personality tests), marketing (taught by tapan panda and he is one of the best profs), communication, IT (seems boring after studying computer science)  Grading system: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Grading system is CGPA. For each subject there are various grades (A+ is 4.33 , A is 4 and F is 0....). C+ is a pass (C+ is 2). The grading is done throughout the year. Every assignment given in class has a weightage. Class participation, projects, surprise quiz all have a weightage. The midterm and end term exams account for only 50% of the total marks. So one has to perform throughout the year.  Specializations in second year: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In the second year, one specializes. One can specialize in more than one stream. tHe streams are systems  IT, finance, marketing, HR and operations. To major in a field, one needs a minimum of 15 credits (5 subjects) and to minor one needs 9 credits (3 subjects) in second year. Most people major in finance and marketing, However I do not seem to be very inclined to marketing. I am likely to go for finance, operations and IT (yes, I plan to major in 3) - fin is interesting, Operations has supply chain, ERP, CRM in it and as a consultant in these areas one makes a lot of money (there was a talk by a person from accenture who is a partner/consultant there. He is a 1999 IIMA grad who started at PWC and gets a commission on all the multi million dollar projects he leads)  Life at IIMK: ~~~~~~~~~~~~ The environment is cool and good. The students are also very friendly.  The food is ok. Things are going on smooth. Have a quantitative methods test tomorrow and am studying for it. There are a few consulting projects with Dr Saji and there is a call for volunteers. I may take up one project - not sure though....with the mid term looming ....  Some funny things at K: The students are very good at bargaining. There were some 80+ people to take a loan. Educational loans given by banks have an interest rate of 11.5% generally. These people showed their bargaining skills and negotiated with SBI, SBT, PNB, Indian bank and finally Indian Bank is giving a loan at 8.5% - very good bargaining skills.... I have the cash and do not need to take a loan. But they say there is a lot of tax saving if one takes an educational loan and I am thinking about it...  Student Profile: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 			The student profile is very diverse. Most are engineers and have some IT experience. The experience could be 0 years to 5 years. Most have 2+ years experience. There are a lot of students from bangalore and I get to speak a lot in kannada - that is something I enjoy a lot......         There are atleast 6-7 students who are already married. Must be quite tough to study after marriage - not sure :)  Likes and Dislikes: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I seem to like subjects with numbers and problems with them. Some subjects like marketing management are a bit on the boring side..... The greatest thing that I miss is appa, amma, thangi and bangalore.   Life goes on....Am enjoying blogging. When I turn 50 I can look back and read all this - that would be fun indeed............
