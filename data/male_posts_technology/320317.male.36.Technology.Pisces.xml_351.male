  I am currently reading the book " urlLink The Second Coming of Steve Jobs ", an unauthorized biography. It was interesting to read about Susan Kare, a User Interface Designer who designed the original Macintosh user interface way back in 1984. She was also one of the few people who could stand up to Steve Jobs.
