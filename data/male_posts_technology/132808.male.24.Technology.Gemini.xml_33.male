I still haven't opened Tommy Boy or Double Impact, and yet I still bought THREE more DVDs!!  Married... With Children Season One (which is 34.99 everywhere except for the Empress Wal-Mart which had it for 19.99), Bedazzled and the Virgin Suicides  I just watched The Ladykillers.  Excellent flick, review should be up by end of tonight.  Only shitty part is now I have to go and buy a bunch of Coen Borthers movies.  As if I didn't already have enough reasons to go buy DVDs.
