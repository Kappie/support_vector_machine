Scurb Scurb Scurbtorious returns from work, carrying with her a foul odor, holla at the not showering before going to work!  The two from the den of sin are on their usual hunt to throw it in the butt of some lucky female.  Let's hope they are successful, so we can continue talking shit about them :-)  So there is word of a party at Cotton's cribb, we'll see how that turns out.  I wish that mofo would post on this thing, but it seems we have a few of lamers who are sccuured to post on the blog.  List of people who "don't have anything to say", or in reality are just to pussy to post:  Kimtothebo Lala Cotton  Craig wishes he had more mindless dribble to add to the blog, but his old mind can produce no more.  So beat it you bitches!  -Your brother Craig
