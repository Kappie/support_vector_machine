So, I can hear you all with baited breath wondering what was the 2000th song Idownloaded onto my machine.  Well, it's not too embarassing, pretty cool actually I have to say.  My 2000th song was "Can I kick it" - By a Tribe Called Quest.  So now, it's looking up and see what I can now get. Hmmmm. 3000 songs?  And still no Rolf Harris to be seen.  Phew.  So Can I kick it?  Yes You Can.
