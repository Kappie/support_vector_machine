She was crying, sobbing uncontrollably, trying to stay in control but obviously in extreme despair.  I obviously don't know what happened.  Did she just get a call that someone died?  Did she just break up with a boyfriend?  I was immediately touched and sad for her, wishing I could do something for her, talk, listen, give a hug, whatever.  I realized I was staring, and looked away, not wanting to invade on her private sadness.  I would have been very embarrassed if she suddenly looked back at me, even though I knew I was basically invisible to her at that moment.  But I couldnâ€™t help watching her try to cope with whatever had happened.  I feel like I remember her face from somewhere, maybe a photo on a desk here at the office, or maybe just seen around town.  So beautiful, but so sad at the same time.  I won't forget her for a long time.
