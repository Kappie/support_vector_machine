Cos I had headaches a lot when I was younger, practiaclly every day, and it turned out i needed to have glassses cos my eyes strain too much. And anyway, its probably that you're stressed!  To be honest, I cacn't remeber nething about fame Academy (i onl watchewd a few), but i know i wanted Sinead to win, and I don't even remember who Ainsley was! Was he the black dude, or am I getting confuzzled with Ainsley Harriot? Um, dunno! oh, and I have just noticed it is Ainslie. But never mind, can't be assed to chgen it all!  I have watched very  little tv recently, only on the day i was off ill when I watched MTV and saw TATU's viedo (quite disturbing, not that i have nehting against lesbians, just its a bit disturbing). Anyway, tooooooooodles!!
