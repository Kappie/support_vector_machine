I can't wait to make up for lost times, and make her life, light up like it used to be... I'm no longer empty anymore.....Thank you to everyone for their support and helping me legally get my daughter back, all i can say without wiping a tear is, paperwork speaks, and standing up for yourself before a judge does too... I love you Katie bugg (-your daa daa).
