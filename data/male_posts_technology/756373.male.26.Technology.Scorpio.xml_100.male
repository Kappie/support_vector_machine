Lesson Eighteen  PRISONS AND DETENTION CENTERS  IF AN INDICTMENT IS ISSUED AND THE TRIAL, BEGINS, THE BROTHER HAS TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE FOLLOWING:  1 . At the beginning of the trial, once more the brothers must insist on proving that torture was inflicted on them by State Security [investigators ]before the judge.  2. Complain [to the court] of mistreatment while in prison.  3. Make arrangements for the brother ‘s defense with the attorney, whether he was retained by the brother ‘s family or court-appointed.  4. The brother has to do his best to know the names of the state security officers, who participated in his torture and mention their names to the judge.[These names may be obtained from brothers who had to deal with those officers in previous cases.]    As for  urlLink this...  I wouldn't mind seeing these tapes leaked to the Internet. Maybe it would help remind people just exactly what was accomplished with Saddam's removal from power.
