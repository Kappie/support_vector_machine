His last Toronto concert is this Wednesday, July 21st at  urlLink Hugh's Room . Go ahead, make a reservation, and have a great time!  What's so special about Trevor? In a word,  passion . He has a passion for folk music. It's not just the music, it's the culture, it's the camaradarie, it's the lifestyle.  Are you passionate about software development? Are you ready to commit to developing great software? Do you think that a minute spent writing mediocre code is a minute of your life wasted irrevocably?  If you aren't, that's fine. I'm not going to tell you what to do. It's got to be something you feel for your own reasons. But I know how I feel, and I know I want to spend the rest of my life with people who feel the same way about their chosen careers.  People like Trevor.
