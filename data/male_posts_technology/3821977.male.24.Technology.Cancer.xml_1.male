On a positive note I can finally apply for financial aid w/o the gov't using my parent's income as a justification for not giving me any money. Stupid Gov't. You'd expect after 18 they would no longer base your life off of your parents. I'm coming to Waco today for a nice 4-day weekend. I took off Today and Friday using vacation time to celebrate this unforgettable time in my life.     Mom, Vanessa, and DJ are coming back from DC today. They spent a week siteseeing the east coast and i'm sure have many tales of their adventures to describe in amazing detail since the Kodak 5megapixel cam is now functional. It seems that Best Buy finally did something right for once. The fixed a camera that was able to take over 500 digital images upon return. Seeing as I was once a BB tech, I know what a rarity this is. It was not uncommon on a daily basis to see a customer's camera, computer, or television come back delayed and still not working.   later
