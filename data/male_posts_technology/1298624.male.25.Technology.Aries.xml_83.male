You start to think that it's spelled a different way than it currently is (which is correct) and start to seriously doubt if you knew how to spell that word at all!  I'm playing less of La Pucelle: Tactics. It's weird (post title). It seems as if I don't want to commit the time to play this game through. Don't get me wrong though, the game is great and I'm loving it. It just takes a LOT of time.
