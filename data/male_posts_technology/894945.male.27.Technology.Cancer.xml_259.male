Today the boss scores "loaded weapon"* for the brilliant comment of "Do you mind waiting for me to have a fag before you go to lunch at 12?" then leaving to smoke said cancer causing carcinogenic cylinder at 12:25. A what point did I realises that she didn't mean straight away? Could it be the one that relates to my single hour of peace and quiet called lunch?  Only 15 more working days till she leaves.  On a brighter note, Are the Toaster crew gonna hit the public on All Hallows Eve? I have a tub of latex and a bag of makeup and I can do wonders with the combination!  Seriously, I havent been out on the pizz in halloween costume since last weekend, sorry since University (went trick or treating and ended up sleeping in the same bed as Melissa and Karen. Great night.)   *Today's stupidity score is rated on the scale of one to what colour wire should I cut?
