When I was younger, I was very shy.  With my friends in my neighborhood, I was a normal kid.  In school, I was pretty damned quiet.  Every year in elementary school, I was in some sort of accelerated program.  Not with other kids, but they would make something up for me.  When I was in first grade, I had to go to one of the second grade classrooms for reading.  Stuff like that.  That definitely made me an outcast.  I had very few friends at school, and until I started playing sports during recess I rarely hung out with anyone.  I was still very quiet until 9th grade.  At that point, I more or less forced myself to be outgoing.  I started cracking jokes, being a loudmouth, being very opinionated, etc etc.  It still feels like a show, a farce, to this day.
