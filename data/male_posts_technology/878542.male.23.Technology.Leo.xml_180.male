I don't have any money to help the man out. If anyone out there has loose cash for bail money, you should probably talk to Justin Cram, who is organizing the bailout.   Cory isn't the richest guy in the world, nor the best with keeping on top of these legal realities, but I really wouldn't want to see him in jail for it. Nasty.   Msg me on IM or email, and I'll give you Cram's number if you'd like to help.   Good Luck, Cory.
