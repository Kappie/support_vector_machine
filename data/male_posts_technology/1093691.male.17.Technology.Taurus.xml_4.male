I ya want my opinion, the firefighters can strike for as long as they want, because the government are not going to increase their salaries by that much. Any twats that arnt careful and start fires when there are strikes can burn coz its their fault for doing it in the first place. The war I dont care about either. America are prepared to launch at minumum 400 missiles a day. Anyway, if the war starts when i'm out in America, wheyyyyy! We either: die. or stay out there until it ends :)  Toodles people, I hope you enjoyed my extremley motivational speech.
