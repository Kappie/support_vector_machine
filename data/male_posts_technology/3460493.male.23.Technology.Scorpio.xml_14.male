Granted, in Puerto Rico it isn't too rare for someone to graduate from any college, seeing that tuition is about 90% cheaper than in the states. To put into contrast, my university currently charges $135 per credit, and it's probably the most expensive school here. That's about $4000 per school year. Compare that to $20,000+ in really good universities in the U.S.! So I didn't mind studying in the 'expensive' university.  I didn't think I would be sad or emotional during the ceremony. But I saw some old friends, and it was actually a fun graduation, not a boring one where all the presidents and whoever is considered important talk on and on and on. I started thinking about all the cool times I spent, not thinking about the hellish days I had early on in my college years. I thought about not being a student again, and missing the social interaction only college can provide. I'll miss learning new things, although I usually learn on my own. I'll miss the little things more than anything else in the world.  Most of my fellow graduates will be entering a harsh reality soon, when they realize they won't be working soon for what they studied all these years for. Some, like myself, were extremely lucky to obtain a job in what they majored in. I really wish and pray that everyone who honestly busted their tail in class to earn a better living will get a decent job sooner rather than later. It sucks having a great education, even a Masters, and still not get a job outside of fast-food joints.  In any case, I posted some pics on my moblog from the graduation, which you can see by clicking the link on the sidebar. There you can see some of my family who rooted me on in my graduation. They were the ones who helped me out the most, so I'll be eternally grateful to them. Today my brother took me to the beach, and besides having a nice sunburn which I'll feel tomorrow morning, I had a rockin' time! I forgot to take the camera, so no pics to post :( I'll try to snap some pics soon and post them. It's better to see a picture than read a thousand words! Until next time, have a nice day (or night, wherever you are!)
