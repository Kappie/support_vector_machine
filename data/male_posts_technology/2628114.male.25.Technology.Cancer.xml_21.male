This post really isn't completely necessary for my training friends (since most endured the run today with me today).  This post is more for my friends and family who fit into one or more of the following categories: 1. Were not on the run with me today.  2. Are not training for the marathon.  3. Laugh at those who do.  We completed a 9-10 mile run today through the lovely, busy streets of Wyoming and the surrounding areas.  According to Natalie we covered those miles in 1hr45minutes.  In the harder parts of the run, it felt more like 6 weeks.  The 5 miler Friday with Brad really was a good warmup to this run today.  My legs warmed up much faster and except for the same shin and knee pain, my legs felt great.  Even my knee (IT band at least) felt great.  I did notice some dull aching near the end of the run right on the kneecap and the surrounding areas, but nothing that worried (I just ran 10 stupid miles!  What do you want?!  Sheesh!).  The run got really hard for me on the downhill (odd isn't it?) on Compton and right near the end where I decided to chase after Consuelo who had broken away from the pack.  I haven't felt any tremendously bad side effects from the run at all and except for being tremendously hungry, my body feels pretty good.
