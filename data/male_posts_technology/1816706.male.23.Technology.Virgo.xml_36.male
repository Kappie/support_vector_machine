The view going up was spectacular, and at the top you could see almost the circumfrance of the entire island, it was goregous.  We went in some tiny cesna planes this time so we couldn't all go together, so I went first, then Adam and Alyssum went.  When we got to jumping altitude, the instructor had me swing my legs out the plane and let them dangle there, and then we rolled out.  We did a couple flips when we rolled out and then we we flattened out and did a couple helicopter spins, it was really cool.  After we pulled the chute, the rest of the way down was spectacular views, even though my legs hurt from the pull on the parachute.  After skydiving we went to a beach on the north shore for a little and then back to the South side of the island for a dip at the beach and a little bit of swimming.  Only had to work half a day the next day at work which was nice, but ended up getting sick after that, but it was raining all weekend long, even today too!  Sucks.  See, weather isn't always perfect in paradise... just most of the time.
