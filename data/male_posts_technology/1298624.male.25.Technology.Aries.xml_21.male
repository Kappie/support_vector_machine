Leave it to M$ to leave huge gaping security holes where anybody can take control of your system and resources. Of course, patching it up is a snap.   I like the way the backyard is looking. Your parents are really working hard on making it presentable and beautiful again. That's a good thing. At least you won't be baking under the hot sun (or weird humid rain) tomorrow since you won't be going to Santa Barbara.
