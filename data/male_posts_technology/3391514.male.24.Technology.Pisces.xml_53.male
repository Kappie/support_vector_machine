I watched  Minority Report  yesterday... it was a decent film, with some interesting twists and plot developments.  The special effects were nicely done... the technology was also interesting... for someone who plays  GURPS  anyway.  This afternoon I watched  AI .  That was a far better film, at least in terms of emotional involvement.  It painted a very interesting picture of psychological development and sociological interaction, and was riveting from start to finish.  Although the end was more than a little far-fetched.  At last I got to watch an entire episode of  Without a Trace , as a new series has started on terrestrial.  I was most impressed, and am somewhat pleased to have found something new to watch.   Lexx  is getting a little... depressing, but  Angel  is as gripping as ever.  How could it have been cancelled?  The weekend RPG ran as usual, though it was, once again, a little lacking.  Plus it doesn't have many sessions left, and lots of new players are being introduced.    AAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.  Started reading  Forever Peace  by Joe Haldeman.  Although not a true sequel to  The Forever War , it "examines the same issues".  It's looking interesting at the moment.  The story is about a man who pilots remotely operated combat robots via some kind of neural link, and his interaction with others.  At the moment.  Today saw a climatic change, from warm and sunny to warm and raining.  There was even some thunder this morning, so it heralds in the Autumn.  Well, at least I won't have to put up with this damn heat.
