I mean, my temper is much better than it used to be, but some smug SOB goes off with an "I know more than you do" attitude, assuming he can just run over my objections with a shrug, it bugs me soooo much!  I mean, I'm NOT an idiot, bluntly.  I know what I'm talking about, or I know enough to know that I can't form a good argument on the subject.  If they could actually formulate a counter-argument and refute my position, that's one thing; but if all they say is "Well, if you knew anything about this, it'd be OBVIOUS to see...", it just really sets me off.  Today was a really dumb one.  Someone on a message board, talking about hatchets and other physical weapons in the game of BattleTech.  This guy's claim was that since they're an "edged" weapon (relative term on that scale), hatchets should do partial damage to armor and partial to structure, instead of full damage to armor.  I said that I couldn't see the argument, based on the fact that all the weapons in the game are theoretically armor-piercing; it's just a matter of whether or not the armor-defeating nature succeeds or fails.  He replied with "If you knew anything about the physics of it, it'd be obvious to see."  Which, of course, pissed me off, because I have a lot of training in physics; certainly more than most people, and probably more than him!  Argh.  Why people can't just shut their freaking traps when they don't know what they're talking about, instead of actually attacking a person who offers a serious counter-argument, I'll never understand.  My faith in people, though, continues to decline.
