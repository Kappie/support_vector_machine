You are just a picture And a thousand memories Is all I take with me 'Cuz your smile Is just too much to see You're just a thousand memories Fantasies, broken dreams Reveries, sordid histories Following my heart, Laden with reaction, Without calibration or design Committed to a trial, A life of understanding Can't somebody show a sign to you For me to see if you only knew That you were the one You were my everything Never apart, No one in-between Then one day, When you went your own way You felt justified, And I was mortified But today... You are just a picture And a thousand memories Is all I take with me 'Cuz a picture is worth one thousand memories  --- Bad Religion
