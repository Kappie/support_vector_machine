I just can't avoid it any longer  Whenever someone even remotely affiliated with authority walks into the office, my boss says really loudly, " Whoa [insert name] is here, every body make it look like you're working. "  This makes all the underlings laugh -- five times a day, every day.  The  urlLink irony  of the joke is not lost on me, and I'm not just poo-pooing middle-aged humor. An  urlLink ironic  joke is really only amusing once. Repetition in humor can be done to great effect, but recycling jokes based on a leige-lord masquerading as a serf is just annoying.  Other one-liners beaten to death:   "You're confusing me with someone who knows what is going on."   "I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid."   Hmmmm, those're all that come to mind right now . . . but there will be more.  Oh yeah, he's the only Jewish person I've ever known who spends most of his time whistling     ... Christmas tunes       ...in the  middle of summer   granted I don't know many jewish people.
