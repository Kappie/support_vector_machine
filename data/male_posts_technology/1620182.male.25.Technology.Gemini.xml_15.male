"I know you Americans like everything sweet," he said.  Yes.  Yes, that is true.  "We Americans"  love  sweet things.  And whatever is not sweet, we make sweet.   We are a society of excess and waste; Gluttony is our national pastime.   We build out, not up.  We have plenty of space for garbage dumps, so we don't bother recycling.  We have power bars.  We have oxygen bars.  We have Sams Club.  We have saccharin.  We even have pets too fat to play fetch.  We have too much of a good thing.  We have too much of everything, but I wouldn't trade it for anything.  Would you?
