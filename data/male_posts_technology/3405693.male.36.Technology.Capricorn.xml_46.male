Yesterday the headache, this morning I had to drive Sylvie to work after an interview she had, and then had to rush my own ass to work...sigh... oh well.  Tomorrow is Canada Day, and I have to work.  That sucks ass, cuz normally we do something groovy on Canada Day.  I do get off at 5:30, but for whatever lame reason there is exactly sweet fuck all going on in Vancouver for Canada day night.  We don't even get any fireworks this year, ffs... "Too many safety concerns..." Bah on that...the only safety concerns are the dumbass loogans from Surrey who come into town specifically to ruin people's evenings...real life griefers.  They are all a common profile too...they are 18-25, male, matching wanna be eminem haircuts, and they swagger like wanna be rap stars.  Their only strength is in numbers, cuz solo they're to the last a bunch of pansy assed wimps, but they swarm.  So thanks, Surrey Loogans, for destroying Canada day for the good people around.  Of course, I generalize...they aren't really all from Surrey, but it's fun to pick on Surrey.  If you don't live in this neck of the woods, you wouldn't have experienced the big cliche that is Surrey, but every city in the world has a suburb like it...in Toronto it's Scarborough, in Edmonton it's St. Albert, Calgary it's Airdrie...a suburb where everyone seems stuck at least one decade back, where the mullet is king and the hair sail is queen, and acid wash denim reigns supreme in the fashion magazines.  A suburb where it's considered fun to drive stupidly fast in your (stolen) pickup or rice-racer and hurl insults and worse at people you pass.  A suburb where racism is the norm, not the exception, and it's not just the white nazi's prevacating it.  Uh...I lost my train of thought completely...time to go to bed I guess.
