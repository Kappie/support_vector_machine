Cool color and they only pay $180 a month lease.  It's a nice economy car for around town.  My mom's office is only 10 minutes away and my sister works 10 minutes away.  I guess no one is really going to use it when both my sisters are out of to college.  That's it for now, more on the bachelor's party later.  Here's pics for the car.
