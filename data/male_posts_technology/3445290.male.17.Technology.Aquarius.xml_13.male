If you have read any of my last posts you will know thatI have began working out on a regular basis but nowI feel like I'm really getting into this whole workout thingso I have started experimenting with all different types of drugs to enhance performance and results in the gym (except anabolic steroids). Some of the supplements that I have been taking are extra strength multi-vitamins, glutamines, weight gainers with a lot of protein and a lot of carbs, creatine, flax oils, herring oil's for my omega 3-6-9's and at last but not really a supplement, 1-2 gallons of water daily because of the creatine. I do realize that some of the things I am taking are a bit risky since not too many study's have been conducted on these supplements and most of them do a number on the liver but I'll take my chances in order to gain some results quickly.It is very interesting to observe my body slowly change and the weird noises and contractions my body keepsmaking throughout theday.    **anyways my mother is making empty threats to meto go to sleep even thoughI have no reason to get up early in the morning tommorow but I don't want to be on her really bad side so I better get to sleep. Keep you up-to-date on next post so l8r**
