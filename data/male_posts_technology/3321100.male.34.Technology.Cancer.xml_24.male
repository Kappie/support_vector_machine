This night, at 1:00 am my wife ask me Do you want to speak ? It was quiet, we speak about our boring life (in fact she speak, cause I'm not very courageous :s) I listen her. She said that she love me, but not like before, we have spend 17 year together (the half of our live) and we know that nothing new could happened to us... I confirm that it was the same thing for me I really  love her but it's not enough...So she (it's always she) suggest two solutions : 1 - We try again to live together, in case of it was only a bad period 2 - We separate. The end of our perfect love story. She thinks I can build another life with another woman and have children, but she thinks it's impossible for her, cause she can't have children.  At this time, we cry together... I haven't said that we must separate for two things, the first it's I'm not sure it was really finished, the second it's I 'm like this, a bad guy who doesn't want to take his responsibility.  So we haven't took decision, we just know that we feel the same things and it's hard to think it's perhaps the beginning of the end.  Now, I'm waiting... I cry sometimes, and sometimes I dream about my future, I think the first thing I'll do is to take one month to visit England alone and to try to perfect my English...  It was an important moment of my life, and it's now...
