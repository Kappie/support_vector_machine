If you want to connect – protect yourself     OK, just a quick test.    Put your hands up if you use a computer for work or at home. Keep them there while I count. . . . .just a minute longer. . . OK, thanks.     Let’s face it. Nearly all of us use PC’s at some point or other during our work or home lives. And nearly all of us are ‘connected’ now. We surf the internet. Send email. Shop online.     Another quick test. Put your hands up if your computer is protected.    Not quite as many of you this time.    In our daily lives, we protect ourselves as best we can from the things we don’t want to happen. We wear seat belts. Lock our doors and windows when we leave home.     But as we saw over the Bank Holiday weekend, when a new computer virus hits, we don’t learn. Unpatched, unprotected networks slow the internet to a crawl. Computers without virus protection spew thousands of copies of the latest worm or virus out to thousands more unprotected users.    The Sasser worm and its variants, spreading across the internet, infected millions of machines across the world. HM Coastguard had problems with their computers. So did Deutsche Post. So did Railcorp in Australia, and banks in Hong Kong.    The cost to businesses – large and small – of a virus infection is vast. Think about it. Your staff can’t work because their computers are down. Your email systems are overloaded with incoming virus-laden mail, and warnings from other companies’ protection systems. Then there’s the cost of an IT consultant to come in, disinfect your systems, and patch them to make sure they don’t fall prey to that virus again.    Then the next worm or virus hits. And the next. And the next. See the pattern?    It’s quick and easy to take precautions that protect your computer and network. It can be cheap, too.     First things first. Patch your system. The likelihood is you’re running a version of Microsoft Windows. It’s easy to make sure you have the latest updates, and it won’t cost you anything to check and do it.    Simply go to http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/ and scan your system. The Microsoft update system will check your software and recommend the updates you need – then helps you download and install them.    If you’re running Microsoft Windows 2000 or XP, you can have the updates installed direct to your computer without having to go to the update site again.    Once you’re updated, you have a degree of protection against security flaws that some viruses – like the Sasser worm – exploit to do their damage.  So what next?    Well now you’ve made sure your system is up to date, you need to put locks on it. That means a firewall.    Put simply, a firewall sits between the data on your computer and the internet, and controls what can get in and out. Just like a doorman at a nightclub, the firewall holds the ‘guest list’ for your machine – and if the name’s not down, they’re not getting in!    A properly configured internet firewall can prevent you getting infected from malicious programs or websites, and keep ‘hackers’ out of your system and away from your personal data.    For home users, a software firewall is usually fine. These programs run in the background on your home PC, protecting it as you surf the Net. A wide range of software firewalls are available, but two of the best are Norton Internet Security 2004 and Zone Alarm Pro.     For the business user, a software firewall isn’t really enough. To keep your network safe from damage, and your data free from prying eyes, you should invest in a hardware firewall – a separate, dedicated machine that sits between your server (or main computer) and your internet connection.    Using a separate machine keeps even professional hackers at an increased distance from your important data. Also, hardware firewalls have a greater depth of security measures and more options, allowing you greater levels of control over what comes in and out of your office.    There are a bewildering array of options and products when it comes to hardware firewalls, from basic ‘SOHO’ units up to high-end products. For the smaller business, the best security and value can be obtained from companies like Watchguard and lower-end Cisco models. At the higher end, systems from Cisco and Microsoft’s Internet Security and Acceleration Server offer power, controllability and security – at a price.    Finally, once you’ve got your computer or network updated and secured, you need to ensure it stays healthy.    This means good, solid Virus protection from a reputable manufacturer – and it needs to be updated at least once a week, if not more often. Those on a broadband internet connection should consider setting their anti-virus to update daily.    For the home user, consider a product such as Norton Anti-Virus 2004 (this is included as a module within the Norton Internet Security package). Business Users can look at the Norton Anti-Virus network and corporate Editions, and products from McAfee, Network Associates and Sophos.    Finally, the last – and arguably most important – part of your new, secure computer environment. . . . .your own common sense.    Don’t trust to chance that everything will be OK. Make sure you update your patches and your virus protection. Don’t open email attachments unless it is from someone you know AND they’ve told you to expect it.    The bottom line is simple. GET SECURE.    After all, you wouldn’t leave your house unlocked when you went to work, would you?
