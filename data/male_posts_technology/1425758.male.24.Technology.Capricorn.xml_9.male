 Linked from Slashdot. I usually don't even bother to click on their humor links, but this one is funny. 
 It mentions  urlLink zombo.com . Now -- i remember this word "zombocom" from somewhere, a movie or a cartoon ... i remember some monster or something saying "ZOMBOCOM!!!" with a scary voice. And i can't even look at this site, as it is probably slashdotted.
