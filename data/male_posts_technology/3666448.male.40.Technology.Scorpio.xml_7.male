His senatorial career was briefly mentioned, which is strange because he's been a senator a lot longer than he was a soldier.  When Clinton was running for office Kerry said that what some one was doing during that period has no bearing on their fitness for presidential office.  Now it's his main point for running for the office.        The truth is that he's seen the mood and direction of the country and customized his presentation to fit it. Strong on military, tax cuts, defending the borders are the focal points of this election, he realizes that his senatorial voting record is the opposite of that.        No problem, just ignore that record and direct all attention to the military aspects of his career.  Ignore his anti-war position after getting out of the military, ignore the accusations against his fellow soldiers of atrocities, ignore the voting against increased spending for military and intelligence, ignore the record that other Democrats describe as reliably liberal.  Repeat the three Purple Hearts story ad nausem.       I really don't think this will work for him.
