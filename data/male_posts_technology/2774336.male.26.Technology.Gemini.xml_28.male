 Today I almost thought it was 2003.  I woke without the usual gurgling and the foul taste in my mouth was mostly absent.  I wonder if it has anything to do with how late I took last nights Zantac or that I had so many problems before falling asleep. 

 But, there has to be a balance, so I think that my broken tooth is finally becoming infected.  My gums at the very base of the tooth's root are a little tender. Terrific.
