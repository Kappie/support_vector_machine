There's the part of me that says if it were MY family member/spouse/lover/friend murdered so horribly, I would want swift, brutal, American-style justice.  But I don't really believe that.  I don't feel that I, as a human with such limited understanding of the nature of life and existence, have the power or right to decide who lives and who dies - nor do I WANT that responsibility.  A friend of mine related a story to me once.  One teenaged boy had been killed by another, intentionally and doubtlessly.  The state was attempting to get the death penalty, but the mother of the victim fought against it, saying, "Why should two mothers have to lose their sons?"    Food for thought.  Speaking of which, I'm REALLY hungry...
