A couple of interesting things to note that are not on the site:  Layton and Martin claim that Harper wants to make abortions and gay marriages illegal and let everyone have an unregistered gun.  They also say that it is impossible for his economic plan to work.  Martin is painted by Harper as fiscally inept and corrupt.  Harper recently claimed that Martin supports very lax laws on child pornography.  Not too long ago, Layton accused Martin's budgets of being responsible for the deaths of homeless people.  The Bloc and Green Party do not deserve any of my time since they have no impact on anything important.  I only mentioned Layton of the NDP here because he talks a lot, not because his party has a chance of winning the election.  I enjoy the dirty political campaigns and mud-slinging.  They are a very important part of Canadian politics.  Without them, we would be forced to base our votes on the credibility of the candidates and the facts presented by them.
