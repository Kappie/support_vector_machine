If you've been run over by a bus, sure, come on in, get it sorted. Been smoking for last 5 years and you can't breath? Money please. That seems fair to me. I have a jaw problem, it ain't my fault, it's just the way I was born - therefore I should be intitled to free health care. The only problem then is that people will start making things up and you'll get even more problems.  If you've got a problem, you've got a problem. I still don't understand how people can think they have a problem they don't, if anything it's usualy the other way round, there should be more people in hospital. Anyway, it does happen and I think people like that should be given little DIY hospital kits to take home and they can sit in their own bed and get their friends and family to play doctors and nurses.  I'm nuts.
