I'm in a petty chipper mood today, which could be expected I suppose, as I got most of a full night's sleep. I think tonight I'll be going to bed at 9, because I'm still really behind on da sleep for some reason.   I was so annoyed at my mom yesterday. I had been telling her like all week that I was getting payed on Tuesday and needed her home so I could go to the bank and put money in and use the check card to order computer parts. So what's the one day she plans stuff and doesn't get home until 11:30? Why Tuesday of course. I was really impatient and stuff, but I got over that when I really thought about it, because realy I can afford to get the stuff anytime, as I'll be broke  after  getting it so I won't be able to get more parts anyway.   "Best friend worst thing, she's been cheating, friend decieves she leaves"   I'm such a slacker, I still haven't gotten Sarah her anniversary present. I know what it is now, I just haven't gone to the store to buy it. I really hope she likes it though... she will of course but I'm required to think like that (hehe).   "Alone with you... alone with me... what can I do I cannot breathe"   I think I fell asleep at work yesterday... like, fell asleep without being asleep. My mind just went away for an hour. It was ok though, I (thankfully) didn't get any new work to do in that time, so I wasn't like messing up on things or what not. I really like this laptop a lot more than my normal work computer... it hurts my eyes less and I can use it (again) on the Max.   Now since I have nothing else to say, a random song or two:   The Ataris - The Saddest Song  Only two more days, until your birthday  Yesterday was mine  You値l be turning five  I know what it痴 like, growing up without your father in your life   So I pretend,  I知 doing all I can  And I hope someday you値l find it in your heart  To understand  Why I知 not around  And forgive me for not being in your life   I remember waiting  For you to come  Remember waiting  For you to call  Remember waiting there to find nothing at all  I remember waiting  For you to come  Remember waiting  For you to call  Waiting there to find nothing at all   Maybe someday  You really get to know me  Not just the letters read to you  I pray I get the chance  To make it up to you  We got a lot of catching up to do   So I pretend,  I知 doing all I can  And hope someday you値l find it in your heart  To understand  Why I知 not around  And forgive me for not being in your life   I remember waiting  For you to come  Remember waiting  For you to call  Remember waiting there to find nothing at all  I remember waiting  For you to come  Remember waiting  For you to call  Waiting there to find nothing at all   Forgive me!  I知 so sorry!  I will make it up to you....    Avril Lavigne - Things I'll Never Say   I'm tuggin' at my hair  I'm pullin' at my clothes  I'm tryin to keep my cool  I know it shows   I'm staring at my feet  My cheeks are turning red  I'm searching for the words inside my head   I'm feeling nervous  Tryin' to be so perfect  Cause I know you're worth it  You're worth it--yeah   If I could say what I want to say  I'd say I want to blow you--away  Be with you every night  Am I squeezing you too tight  If I could say what I want to see  I want to see you go down--on one knee  Marry me today  Guess I'm wishing my life away  With these things I'll never say   It don't do me any good it's just a waste of time  What use is it to you what's on my mind  It ain't comin out we're not going anywhere  So why can't I just tell you that I care   Cause I'm feeling nervous  Tryin' to be so perfect  Cause I know your worth it   If I could say what I want to say  I'd say I want to blow you--away  Be with you every night  Am I squeezing you too tight  If I could say what I want to see  I want to see you go down--on one knee  Marry me today  Guess I'm wishing my life away  With these things I'll never say   What's wrong with my tongue  These words keep slipping away  I stutter I stumble like I've got nothing to say   Cause I'm feeling nervous  Trying to be so perfect  Cause I know you're worth it  You're worth it--yeah   I guess i'm wishing my life away  With these things I'll never say   If I could say what I want to say  I'd say I want to blow you--away  Be with you every night  Am I squeezing you too tight  If I could say what I want to see  I want to see you go down--on one knee  Marry me today  Guess I'm wishing my life away  With these things I'll never say  These things I'll never say
