If you all find some of these appealing they may help make the game more dynamic in its chanlenges and let the more utilitarian characters shine brighter. Read more for the details.    1. We battlemat encounters. This would slow battle down but you would know exactly where you stand in battle. The disadvantage is you may discover your area of effect attacks hurt allies more, and I may remember that you can't flank this guy becuase his back it to the wall. The upside is you will always know if your withing 30 ft. And you will know exactly how far you need to run to get away from the enemy.  2. Allowing Races with level adjustments for new characters. The advantages here are pretty obvious. You could potentially switch to a race with exicing natural abilities. The disadvantage is that they generaly also have notable weaknesses. And while I will not go out of my way to put you up against enemies that can exploit your weaknesses, reoccuring enemies will probably learn about your nature and use that to thier advantage in the future. Basicy with level adjustment characters the fights may radically swing from easy to very hard. Yes a good DM could work around that, but I'm not sure I'm there yet.  3. More emphasis on skill point use. This would probably reduce the number of monster encounters you face but would put more skill bassed delimas in your way. Things like trying to find out how to get into a secret society. Finding the text they has the location of the archmages anchient laboratory. Finding a way to cross the chasm. Getting through the enemie lines to assasinate the orc chieftan. These offer some fun potential, but they would make each adventure more linear, at least at first as I learn, and take much of the focus off the biggest damage dealers. This would probably also encorage the use of the none combat spells more.  Discuss what you think of this idea below.
