I do ask that you visit this web site to stare in wonder at evolving process of eliminating faith from religion. Do not think that I am in any way a religious person, I just can't stand to watch the hypocritical "born-again" or "stupid dipshit's who can't make morale decisions for themselves" as I like to call them, proclaim godliness and never take the time to learn one thing about the faith they shove done everyone's throat.  What in the holy hell does the baby Jesus have to do with hacking. Now don't email me telling me how hacking is the intellectual prusuit of hidden knowledge 'cause I don't give a fuck. Jesus is to hacking as monkey poop is to Curling. For those who don't know Curling is a Winter Olympic sport involving LSD and not monkey poop. Sorry I went a little off topic there, back to the subject at hand. Now after the mind-fucking I got from Heaven's Hackers (much better name) I got the hankering to bone up on my Mormon doctrine.  Mormon's are a sad bunch of psuedo-Christians who are led by a modern day profit (intentional misspelling).  Mormons believe that God was once a man like all of us, and we can therefore become "God(s)" in our own right, unless you're a woman or black then you just get to hang out with new "Gods" and diddle yourself.  I wonder if becoming a God gives you a "Wang of Eternal Erection".  They also believe in the "laying of hands" that's code for being a bunch cheap fucks. Number 8 on their list of core beliefs is "We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly" now this one threw me for a bit of loop, because most intelligent people recognize that the Bible has been horribly mistranslated throughout history. I was getting kind of impressed that Mormons took this into account, but then I learned that they include this so that whenever the Bible contradicts one of their beliefs they just "Mistranslated" and the administer each other bare-butt paddlings. Number 12 makes you double-take and utter what the fuck. Oh yeah number twelve reads "We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates..." come little children learn that being subjugated is Gods way.  Let's just thanks Allah that Mormons don't actually believe this crap, they do it for the money and Bitches.   Man, oh Man they hae some fine ass ladies in the LDS flock, I think they have some kind of selective breeding program to whelp seriously fine poon to lure in the men-folk.   I really love the answer you get if you ask Mormon why they have a racist Church and they do.  The reply that you'll usually get is that they used to be racist, but only becasue that was the cluture of the country then, nothing better than a church that teaches people to follow the crowd when comes to making morale choice.  Since then (way back in 1978) the almighty has come down from the heavens and proclaim "Let the motherfuckers in before they steal all our women" (it is a well know fact that Mormon women love black wang).   In conclusion fuck the Christian Right and ass rape the Mormons.
