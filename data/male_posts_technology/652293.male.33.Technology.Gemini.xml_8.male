She said (something to the effect of), "If you had to list off the reasons, off-the-cuff, as to why you want to do the MBA and why you want to do the MS, I think you would easily be able to come up with good reasons for the MS, but you might have trouble coming up with concrete and believeable reasons for the MBA."  It's not that she thinks I can't do both, or wouldn't like both.  It's that she doesn't want to see me invest all the effort and half-way through realize I don't like it.  I am not sure.  I feel like she has more to say, but then again she is usually straight-forward with her thoughts.  I am not so much questioning the idea of doing both, but I am thinking about what she said.
