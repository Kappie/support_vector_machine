Well just arrived in Sydney after having salmon with some Japanese dressing I couldn't pronounce...   My Gawd... I've nevers seen so much jewlery in my life on just one person! There was a rather orange lady sitting in front of me wearing quite exquisite and obviously expensive clothes. When she got up, I saw the largest watch I've ever seen. The face was about the size of a matchbox but then there were numerous diamonds around the edge of a at least a centimetre wide. Not only that, she was wearing the largest ice-cube I've ever seen and if that wasn't enough, the rock was surrounded by many more small diamonds just in case the ice-block wasn't enough... :)  Well, I'm going to head downstairs and see if I can find a little dig camera... you may see some photos soon!
