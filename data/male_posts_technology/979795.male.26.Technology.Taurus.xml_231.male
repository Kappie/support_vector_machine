On my birthday, they made cookies and I took them. 1 of them made me a bowl of 'Mian Xian' (mandarin) / 'Mee Sua' (hokkien dialect). 1 baked a chocolate cake (Mississippi Mud cake/pie, if I remember the term correctly). Had a well spread dinner which was ultra filling. Basically too much food for even the likes of me to finish them all. But it was good.  Got 2 birthday cards. 1 stuffed monkey, and a Bible (graphic novel / comic). Everyone knows I get tired of reading the conventional Bible, so ... heh :P The monkey thing was coz I mentioned before that it'd be really kewl to wear a gorilla suit and just act as a monkey. But they said suit rental for just 1 night was just so expensive. The monkey's cute.  It was a different experience this birthday. Very much so from my 1st year here as well. Definitely more fun then the ones I've ever had in Singapore. Love the people here.  Quarter of a century old ... think I'm in a quarter-life crisis already.  This will probably be my last post on anything even remotely related to my birthday. Cheers.
