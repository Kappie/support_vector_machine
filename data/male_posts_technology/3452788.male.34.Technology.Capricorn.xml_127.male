(She's just a kid, for god's sake, and she's a better writer than me ... oops, excuse the thirty-something jealousy).   Her name is Abby and she has multiple blogs running at the moment.  One site is  urlLink http://wirewings.blogspot.com/ , another is  urlLink http://www.livejournal.com/~greyshaderose/ .  Check her out.  Her poetry is incredible.  I don't know how she gets the ideas for some of her stuff, but she is pretty damn good.  I wish I could be half as witty and insightful.   (...me, fawning with adoration...)   I give her props here because I wanted to steal something on her site.  I will credit her when it is posted.
