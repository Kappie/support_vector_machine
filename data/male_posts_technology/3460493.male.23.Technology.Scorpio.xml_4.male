Let me see, could it be I had a full 8 hours of sleep for the first time in weeks? Or could it be I had a non-rushed breakfast ever since I've been living solo? Hmmm... oh yeah, there's something like the weekend coming up soon... IT'S FRIDAY!!! WHOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!  Ok, enough of the pathetic screams and dances, I swear anyone who would've seen me would be laughing their butts off for the next day or so. Anyway, there's a couple of interesting news, so I like to share my opinion.  - Yesterday I mentioned hot the so-called "Pirate Act" would allow anyone to be prosecuted for sharing copyrighted files. Well, seems like Italy wants to one-up the United States, and  urlLink approved a law  in which anyone caught downloading illegal files will be thrown in jail for  up to three years . Ouch, better start deleting all these P2P programs and "research" MP3s you people have collected throught the years...  -  urlLink Spam is bad , at least for some poor guy in Buffalo, New York. A couple of weeks ago, he was sued by Earthlink and was ordered to pay up $16,000,000 (that's 16 million dollars to you common folks). After the civil suit, he was again sued for 14 criminal charges including stealing identities and using the stolen IDs to send more than  800 millon  (800,000,000 for us common folk) spam messages. Besides losing all that money, he'll have to serve a 3.5 - 7 year jail sentence. I hope this starts taking away the Junk E-Mail from my inbox. I receive like 20 spam messages a day, which is little, but that's about 75% of the E-Mails I receive daily. I can only imagine people who receive thousands of E-Mails a day. It must be tough being a celebrity!  - I really find it so amusing the tech headlines that are posted daily in some sites. For example, some people follow so closely  urlLink how much Microsoft spends on security , or the  urlLink dates Microsoft is going to release their products , when most of the times they miss by months. Some people may find this interesting, but I really don't care! Most people I know don't care either. The funniest newsbyte of all time I found was that someone posted online a scan of the Windows XP 64-Bit Edition CDs, just to show he had them... Do we care? I hope you have fun play around with the software, but I don't give a damn if you really have the CDs or not. Will seeing the CD covers make my life better? Will I be able to sleep comfortably at night? Is this really newsworthy? Guess those sites have to update the content every day, no matter how much crap they post.  Well, as I'm finishing part of what the boss wanted me to do today, it'll be a two-hour drive home for the weekend. The drive is too long, down a risky road (miles of hairpin curves for about an hour), but it's worth it to see the ones you love and miss so much when you're alone in the opposite part of the country. So even if you wish you could live alone with no one to bother you, think about it again, because it sucks not knowing anyone where you have to live and being alone most of the time. I never knew how to love the weekends so much before I moved here.  Anyway, thanks to my blog, I know that eventually someone will read this and it'll be better, because it feels like I'm talking to these people. So thanks for reading, and I hope you have a great day, I will too after 4:00 PM!
