It seems that there truly is something backwards (literally) with my sister's elliptical.  Apparently, after some discussion with her last night, we both have experienced the machine cranking up to the hardest possible setting for no distinct reason.  The difficulty setting is somehow backwards so 1 is hardest and 10 is easiest.  This certainly made my workout last night much easier than expected.  I did 4 sets of 5and2s on the elliptical increasing (or so I thought!) the difficulty throughout.  When finished with that I moved on to a 12 minute session on the stair climber (real tough, that's why it was only 12 minutes).  I topped off the workout with a 10 minute workout on the rowing machine. Now, according to Runner's World, the rowing machine works every major muscle group.  This may be true, but the muscles I noticed the most were on my arse.  That's right, that machine kicked my butt, literally!  In reality, it worked the entire backside of my legs, it's just that those muscles stood out most of all while I was rowing.  Everything felt great though, I'm still very anxious about getting back out and running.  For the time, though, I don't mind the incredibly aerobic workout inside and the muscle definition that comes as a result.
