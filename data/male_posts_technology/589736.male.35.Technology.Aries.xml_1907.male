Three possibilities:  (1) this is an illustrative image by the filmmakers, to show that the previous anomalies were variations of a single effect, though of course they could not be the same physical body -- which means the monitors are there for either the audience's benefit or Neo's:  ours, in that we need to have this concept presented graphically, or Neo's, in that the Architect is artificially recreating Neo's face to show what the previous anomalies have done, though they would have to have been historically different, unique physical individuals; (2) all anomalies, for some reason, assume within the matrix the physical appearance of what would be the 6th anomaly, i.e., simplisticly, the appearance of Keanu Reeves; or (3) the body of the single individual who represents the anomaly -- to simplify again, Keanu Reeves -- continues to be liberated from and reinserted into the matrix; thus, what we witness at the end could be what has happened five times before:  the physical body returns to the Source, possibly to be placed once again into a stasis pod.  Which means that Neo -- again, the physical body of Keanu Reeves -- has now experienced *six* violent liberations from his physical stasis pod.  In this way, the cycle repeats not only within the Matrix, but in the physical world, as well.
