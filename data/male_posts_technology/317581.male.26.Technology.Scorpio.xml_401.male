It's a shorter commute and I've been working for the last month. When I say I've been working for the last month, I mean, 30 days straight no breaks. 2 weekends I worked 24 out of the 48 hours. It was hard, but the paychecks are nice.    N-E-way, I'll be taking november off to go and visit peeps, like steve and my pops. So, I hope to be inspired a little more often now that I have some free time.   Catch you latah- T
