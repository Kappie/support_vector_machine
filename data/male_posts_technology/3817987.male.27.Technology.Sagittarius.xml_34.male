It was a pretty solid film but there was one really interesting quote in the film from British critic Andy Savage to the effect that Oasis became more popular than Blur because they had more heart.  My initial reaction was no way that dude is crazy but upon further reflection Savage may be right.  Oasis's songs definitely have a hopeful you-and-me-against-the-world quality that Blur tends to lack.  Blur's songs tend to be more analytical and reflective especially in their earlier work.  Later Blur albums are considerably more emotional. Blur is still a better band in my book but Oasis is a more positive band.
