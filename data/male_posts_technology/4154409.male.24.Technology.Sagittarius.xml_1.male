Whoever thought i'd feel this way?                            For I never thought i'd care.                            But there's something in that smile of her,                            That makes me stop and stare.             I saw her pass by me today.                          Yet, she hadn't acknowledged my existence. And all I did, Was pray our eyes would meet again. Every smile of her, Shines like a mirror, And is reflected into my heart. Tonight, As I gently close my eyes, And flip through the pages of my mind. I recall only her face, Only that familiar smile that Kills me, For if I had to take stock, Of all my wordly treasures,                            Just that few smiles from her,                            Would be my most cherished possessions!
