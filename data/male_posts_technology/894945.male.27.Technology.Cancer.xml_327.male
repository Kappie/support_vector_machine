Might as well make the most of it before new years resolutions and all that horrible treadmill business. I hate this void between Christmas and new year. It's like when you wake up with morning amnesia, but for a whole five days.   Grist, are you still alive? We are getting slightly worried that you have been sold to Albanian sheep herders as a sex slave.
