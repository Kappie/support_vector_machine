Being an avid history follower, I always believed that the academic history that we know, learnt in academics is authentic yet incomplete, scientific yet untrue. Startling revelations are yet to be made in what we know as HISTORY. Mark my words.  The exsistance of the pyramids indeed reign as the greatest enigma of modern man. The question is who built them, when, and for what purpose ? The facts are many , yet conclusions remain elusive. My opinion is as follows.   In millenia past - say 5000- 10,500 BCE there exsisted on Earth an advenced ciziliztion of man. A civilization highly advanced in astronomy, mathematics, agriculture, and other high skills. These people were keenly aware of the astronomy of their day and knew that a catastrophe was impending on their very survival. Cometary impact destroyed this civilization, but not before they where able to create the edifices that prove their exsistance to us now, yet continue to be shrouded in mystery.   In a global catastrophe, the magnitude of which has not been even remotely witnessed since, the advancement of these peoples was brought to an end. Survivors there where, but few in number and lost in a world of climactic upheaval. As time passed, these survivors repopulated , first along coastal waterways, then further , across the expanses of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans.   The Pyramids of old still stood. Shaken yes, but intact, and served as a reminder to the surviving hoardes that greatness had been achieved in time past, and the future of mankind, at least in the primative sacle was preserved. THe enigma of the pyramids spread throughout the world, where on each continent they where revered , and though of as places of worship and or burial / sacrifice. The tomb theory of Zahi Hawass and the Egyptian governemnet is true to the extent that the purpose of the pramids to these later survivor races was indeed as stated.   The current theory on the data regarding the dating of the sphinx helps to illustrae this point. Being not omnly built in laborious stages, but also showing signs of water, not wind, erosion do much for the case of erection from antiquity. To me it seems rather obvious that the buliders of the oldest pyramids where well in advacne of the current theory as far as civilization is concerned. THe argument for ancient civilizations will not be settled any time soon I fear.   I look forward to any comments
