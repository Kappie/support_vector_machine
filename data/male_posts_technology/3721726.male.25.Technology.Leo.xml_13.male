My favorite part is about Mogul Emperor Akbar, who considered his royal elephant to be able to discern by instinct who was guilty or not.  If the elephant crushed you, you were guilty, if it didn't, you were instantly released -- as clear proof of your innocence was just demonstrated.  I want a trained assassin elephant.

How will the open source chess engine  urlLink Crafty  do against the proprietary closed engines? Will the computers play more interesting chess than their human counterparts?"  Also, I need to get some sort of portable implant head-jack thingy capable of checking my email every nanosecond, with logic filters for actions based on what it finds, and lets me know.
