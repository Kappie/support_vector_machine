It has done that in the past and i checked the fluids and all that, and it hasn't acted up in a while and has been pretty dormant. well yesterday it decided to wake up. it overheated quite fast, sending the "check engine" light on. i was almost home so i decided to just make it home, then I would check it out and let it cool down. i was right up the street when I heard a big "pop" sound come from under the hood. looked like something exploded, steam and white smoke coming out of the hood like it was on fire. Have you ever seen Back to the Future part III? At the end when the train is overheating and bolts are flying off, and smoke is coming out everywhere? Yeah just like that. minus the hoverboard. well i made it home, but it was already getting dark,so i had to let it cool before I tried to open it. water and coolant were all over the hood and the bumper, so something exploded. when I finally got to open it, i saw that the upper hose connecting the radiator and the engine itself had completely exploded. it was just too hot for it handle. so ok, not too bad just a hose. well not really. what made it heat up so much that the hose broke? i narrowed it down to either the fan not turning on to cool it, or the thermostat is sticking and not regulating the temperature correctly. hopefully it's one of those. well i used kevin's car to get to the auto parts store before they closed. they said they had a hose there. they looked, they didnt have it. ok. its 10 at night. no other stores are open. got to wait until the morning. this morning, went to a few auto part stores, they to said they had it, but when they looked, they couldn't find it. so after the third store,finally found it. put it on and put some more coolant in the radiator. I had to be into work by 12 today so i made sure I left early just in case. Best Idea of the Day. I didn't make it to work. It started doing the same thing, overheating, the check engine light came on, all that good stuff! So i was almost at work, I could see my building! but I had to pull off and let it cool down. Well it didn't start up again. So I just locked it up, left it and walked the rest to work. And it is hot here. Not fun to walk to work in jeansat noon in South Texas. I don't recommend it. So now, I had it towed to a mechanic that my sister uses, just so he can see what it might be. But you know it's just funny. It never ceases to amaze me how life is. It's like I never catch a break. I don't want to feel sorry for myself, because I'm sure I've contributed to some of my own problems. But it's just amazing, how things can be so crazy. My car breaks down and I lose myjob, in the same week! Maybe if I was married my wife would have left me too. A guy here at work said I sound like a bad country song. Murphy's Law? Maybe a bit of that yeah. At this point, I just laugh. What else can there be? What else can life throw my way? Like I've always said, if I ever marry and have children (which might not be a good idea the way my life's been going)I will have plenty of stories to tell. Hey kids want to hear a story about your dumb dad when he was young? Most people have the saying "if it's not one thing it's another." I always say "if it's not one thing, it's 3 things." That seems to be more fitting. I just hope one day i can sit down and not have to worry about too many things. That I will have a little bit of money in the bank, a car that actually works in the driveway, and the woman i love in the kitchen. hahah...ok, ok, in my arms, that's better anyways. I think if my mom were here she would laugh, then she would hit me upside the head for being so menso. I think I'll get it right eventually, it will all work out someday. But until then stay tuned for more stories of the ridiculous and absurd life of me. I'm sure life isn't done with me yet, I think it's just getting warmed up. Adios.
