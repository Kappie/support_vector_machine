We took a trip to downtown Cincinnati to celebrate near my parents who were kind enough to provide two nights of babysitting for all three boys. We stayed at the Westin overlooking Fountain Square-- it was very nice, but I must wonder if granite countertops and down pillows are worth the extra money. Oh, wait, it was free, complements of the Internet. Thank you, Internet. We spent our first night just relaxing with some Mediterranean food, trying to get the crying-baby-panic-reflex out of our systems, and then slept like royalty on our Heavenly  TM   beds.  Kate's funeral was Saturday morning-- a 9am layout followed by a Catholic mass at 11am. We drove up in the morning for the service. It was very cool to see so many old friends. Kate did not look like Kate, of course. She had no facial expression, and I have never seen Kate with no expression. The hardest part of the funeral was the casket being brought in followed by Kate's sister and two brothers. I didn't understand the minister at all; his sentence structure was so convoluted and meaningless that he might as well not have spoken. However, her father shared a very nice remembrance afterward, and then I went out to Perkins with friends. There was supposed to be about seven of us, but over forty showed up. Many memories were refreshed and two legends confirmed-- the ghost and the cult (see below). I was told that Kate talked of me a lot and really loved me. I had a nice time, and afterwards got to introduce my kids to some of my old friends.  That night El Fid and I went gambling for something different; she has already written  urlLink a good account of that . Then on our way back to the hotel we stumbled upon my brother-in-law standing on the corner drinking a cup of coffee. So we stopped and chased him down. He had been riding his motorcycle around and saw his wife's (my sister's) car, so he stopped to find her. I looked up and there she was photographing some rich people's wedding in front of the fountain downtown. So we hung out for a while, then she had to run off to photograph the reception. Oh, and earlier that afternoon, we had some of  urlLink the most deadly ice-cream known to man .   THE GHOST:  In my high school there was an urban legend about two star-crossed lovers who were sneaking off to elope. They were to meet at an old tree on a country road and begin their new life together, but as these stories go, there was a motorcycle accident and they both died. On every anniversary at midnight, the motorcycle lights were said to be seen coming down the road and a woman running out to meet it.  So, we decided to drive out to the location on the appropriate night and investigate. Mostly everyone hung out at the car talking, but Kate and I went walking off alone. We often walked deserted roads at night, talking, and sometimes just listening to the night noises. Tonight was like many others, except as we were walking we began to hear a whimpering noise. We were not scared at first, just curious. "What is that?" As we progressed however, it grew louder into a ragged whine. Was it an animal? We glanced all about but didn't see anything. There were some woods nearby, but it wasn't coming from there. It seemed to be right on top of us. It became a snarling noise in our ears. "Do you see that?" Kate asked. In the distance, coming out of the woods a woman could be faintly seen. She cast a blue tint on the otherwise deserted road. We stopped, turned, looked each other in the eyes, and took off running back to the car screaming. Everyone caught on, and we were driving off in short order.   THE CULT:  Kate and I were always looking for interesting things to do. Well, we noticed that every Thursday night at a grave yard near our houses, a large crowd gathered. There was a small chapel on the grounds, which was reminiscent of classic scary graveyards with iron fences and odd little gargoyles. The thing that captured our imagination was the huge number of cars which totally clogged the driveway compared to the smallness of the chapel that they crammed themselves into. We began referring to them as The Cult.  One night after a few cups of coffee we decided to invite ourselves in. We would pose as newlyweds interested in attending services. So we pulled in as they were starting, walked up to the door and knocked. No answer. We knocked louder. In answer came the silhouettes of the hunched over occupants at the two windows. They were peaking out at us. So we knocked again. We were never greeted, but they yelled at us, so we left disappointed leaving them with a classy remark, like: "What are you? Some kind of cult?!"  Well, that was high school.
