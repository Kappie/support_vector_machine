 First off, let me say that there is no debate that Windows security is a disaster.  Buy why is it a disaster?  Is it because the guys working up at  urlLink Microsoft  are idiots?   NO!!   The engineers who work at Microsoft are some of the most intelligent people in the business.  I'm tired of people acting as if Microsoft is stupid for creating all these problems in their software.  I'll tell you why they're there:
 
 1.) Microsoft is in the business of making money.  This fact alone should give you a good idea how the Microsoft culture is different from that of the Linux community.  Linux is free.  Linux is built as a gift to the world.  Windows is built to make Bill Gates a ton of money.
 
 2.) Microsoft is market driven.  Granneman stated this himself.  Microsoft makes decisions based on what marketing thinks will sell.  See point 1.
 
 3.) One major marketing goal is to make the Windows operating system easy to use.  This always adds complexity that will, without a doubt, introduce bugs.  Some of those bugs will be security vulnerabilities.  Linux is not easy to use, which therefore costs its users more money to install and run, which therefore causes customers to purchase Windows, which therefore gives Microsoft a monopoly in the market.
 
 Microsoft does not need to stop interconnecting its components.  Microsoft does not need to stop selling so many copies of their software.  Microsoft does need to inforce some security principles such as not executing files unless the user explicitly requests it...Such as fixing key common components such as Internet Explorer...or encouraging users to run with ordinary privledges.
