Being careful not to drop below 330Ohm, which would increase the use of voltage. Didn't get any testing done yesterday, because I spent two hours in the kitchen making dinner, and after that I went to the driving range of our golfcourt to hit a few buckets. It good to get some frustration out by hitting a golfball and see it fly 250++ meters. Another soulution to my SimpleBUG problem would be to use gearing, but that's alot of fitting problems, so servo motors would be a good idea. I just checked the lead supplier of model parts around, and one servo costs 114NOK. (That's over $17 USD.) Might have to see if I can find a source for used parts. That's not very easy here in Norway. Hopefully the SimpleBUG will run like crazy tonight.
