Upon hearing rumors that Spears was interested in Bond-girl status, however, Brosnan added, 'Bless her cotton socks and good luck to her,' reports the AP."  OK, while I like Keira a lot, she's a bit too young unless it's a reto Bond set in the 60's (an idea I really, really like). Brittany would also work in a very small roll, with no lines..  Monica Bellucci would be a PERFECT choice to be the first Woman Bond villain. Not henchwoman or mistress but the full fledge Bad Woman Bond would have to take on. Give her a cigarette holder and some curve flattering dresses and it would be incredible!
