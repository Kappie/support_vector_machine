Foreign Office spokesman Aziz Ahmad Khan said Kashmiris would be delighted to see the back of Blackwill, who recently announced that he would go back to teaching at the Harvard University.   Ok, if Blackwill is Indian MEA spokesman, then who is Aziz Ahmad Khan?... spokesman for the Kashmiri people??  Moreover this "spokesman" haughtily announces that Pakistan would not accept Farooq Abdullah in an Indian delegation that wishes to travel to Pakistan.  "... It was during the tenure of Farooq Abdullah that maximum atrocities were committed against the Kashmiri people," he said.  "He has blood of Kashmiri people on his hands and he should first apologise to Kashmiri people and apologise to the [All Parties] Hurriyat Conference.  "If they forgive him, perhaps a delegation led by APHC leaders, in which others can be included, would be welcomed to Pakistan."  God!! if Farooq Abdullah has Kashmiri blood on his hands, then you Mr. Aziz Ahmad Khan, and your country, has Indian blood on your hands, legs, body and face. You're splattered with it!!  You know what this is called?? ... It's a classic case of pot calling the kettle black!!
