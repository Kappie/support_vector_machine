Why oh why does Hollywood insist on taking a perfectly good book and creating a visual monstrosity out of it devoid of all soul and emotion. The Harry Potter series of books is a pleasure to read and it pains me to think that children are going to walk away with a stunted intellectually challenged version of what is actually a truly beautiful story.  I realize that it is a near impossible task to compress a 300 page book into a 150 minute motion picture but that is precisely the reason why one must refrain from hackneyed attempts to accomplish it. Peter Jackson took 3 very long movies and came rather close to accomplishing the near impossible in the Lord of the Rings and still critics raged about how he had distorted the books vision. By the same measure Alfonso Cuar√≥n aught to be keel hauled.
