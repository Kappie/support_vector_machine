It  really  grates me when entertainers start using their celebrity status to blather on about their political views. Sure, go ahead, whine about the Bushitler and those filthy, filthy neocons - just don't do it when  I've  paid good money to hear you sing. I certainly didn't pay my hard-earned dosh to hear your lizardoid, hateful opinions.  Kudos to the manager tossing her fat bloated ass off stage.
