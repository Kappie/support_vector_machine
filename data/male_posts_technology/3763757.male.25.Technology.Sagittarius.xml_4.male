    
       ..to become a member of the blogging online community. I am naturally very curious about a lot of things in life (just inquisitive, not a jack-of-all-trades), so hopefully I will be able to blog away and have fun doing it. Some of the topics that I plan to regularly blog on (not necessarily in that order of preference) are the internet and online community, computers and tech stuff, philosophy, current events, movies, and psychology.
