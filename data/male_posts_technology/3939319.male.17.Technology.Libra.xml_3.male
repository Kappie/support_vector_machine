(again, have burned but i'll probably buy it at creation)  the wolf (dunno if it's as good as the first, but i'd like to give it a shot)  kutless (probably a creation buy... i love that cd tent)  beautiful letdown (creation)  yeah, any switchfoot cd pretty much  some cd's that haven't been released but will be hopefully this year: brand new, finch (uhh... i thought there were more.... oh well)   yep, there we go... i think i'll also shop around for a bigger cd holder... i have some cd's laying around my car unprotected, which isn't good cuz they could be exposed to the sun or those annoying people who like to sit down without looking... cheers  (an english guy came in my work today and said cheers when he left... i thought he was cool... more people should say cheers...)
