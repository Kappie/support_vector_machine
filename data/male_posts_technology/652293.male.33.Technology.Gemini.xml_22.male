A little more than we needed to buy Sagan's bed.  Which, according to the warraty, should last until she is 14.  Let's just hope the company doesn't go out of business.  I just realized after looking back over a number of posts that I have a lot of typos.  My apologies.  But I won't fix them.  Two days until the 6th wedding anniversary.  We have Auntie Dawn babysitting so Cliare and I can go on a date to a movie. LOTR, since we haven't seen it.  Oh, and  urlLink Ron Zeno  has similar views on usability.  Seems like a nice guy, too.  And finally, I haven't been so busy at work as I am now in ages.  Good thing I still get paid for OT.  The amount of OT I get on the next pay check should take care of our mortgage payment.  Crazy busy.  Baby.  Oh, and I love Sagan.  When her bed is delivered tomorrow, her room will be complete!  Anybody need any writing done?  Creative or otherwise?
