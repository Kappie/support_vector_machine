I really cant commit the time it takes, and it wouldn't be fair or feel right for me to keep hanging on.   I have enjoyed my time spent here, reading about your lives and getting to know you. I will continue to read your individual blogs and visit here often to keep up with your crazy shenanigans.   Meanwhile, I plan to keep Gooseneck up and running and would love to have you guys stop by once in awhile.   Thanks for everything and for putting up with me all this time. I wish you all the best .   Goose
