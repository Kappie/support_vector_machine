The far-left activist group MoveOn.org has been really pulling out all the stops this year to develop anti-Bush ads. Now I don't have a problem with this per se, but when they compare the sitting President to Adolf Hitler, someone has crossed the line. No reasonable human being could back up this kind of assertion, it's just meant to shock the voters who aren't paying close attention to what's really going on into hating Bush.        Thankfully, that despicable advertisement is in the past and the public uproar prevented the ad from making it to the air waves, but now these MoveOn.org people are at it again. In their latest anti-Bush ad, they reference the Abu Ghraib prison scandal to get their message across. Truly these prisoners were abused, tortured, and stripped of their dignity with no sense of human compassion, but to place blame for these individual acts committed by sick and twisted country bumpkins (the 372nd Military Police Company is from Maryland, at the foot of the Appalachians) squarely on Bush's shoulders is irresponsible. Where's the proof? Nowhere. They can't even prove that General Ricardo Sanchez knew that the abuse was going on, let alone that he was actually in the prison while these acts were committed.  If the commanding general didn't know about it, how could Bush and Rumsfeld have?  What they've done instead is to create an incredibly inflammatory image, one that will be burned onto the retinas of the public, one that crosses all boundaries of decency, to try to fan the flames of anti-Bush hatred.   Now let me clarify.  I am by no means a die-hard conservative trying to 'score one for the team,' nor am I a Bush-can-do-no-wrong GOP supporter.  I am, however, pro-common-sense.  I am a moderate independent, and I just feel that it's important to call people's attention to a hate campaign this blatant, insensitive, and morally void.    Let's give Lady Liberty   her   dignity back.
