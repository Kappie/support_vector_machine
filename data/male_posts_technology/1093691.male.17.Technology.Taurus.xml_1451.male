I think I will get my guitar in a few weeks.....yeah!  The rest of my holid......sorry, "study leave" will be spent playing CounterStrike, as I have nothing to do. My final exam is Thursday in about 10 days time. Business finance - whoop-de-doo.  ICT was okay - Paper 1 being easier than Paper 2. Some questions were a bitch. Combined with the coursework, I reckon I got a C, maybe a B. Just have to wait til August!  Ciao.
