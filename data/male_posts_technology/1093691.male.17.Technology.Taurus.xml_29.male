Been making green sites with Tom, eating pot noodles as soon as I get up, putting myself to sleep with chocolate, flicking water at Jackie and proving to Mr Gallagher that chewing helps me to think. I have also seen a few incredible things like Nicki drinking from a David Brent mug, Andy and Jackie breaking a safety screen and people climbing D-block with hockey sticks (and me falling off and nearly breaking my back). I have just given my parents £20 to go and buy me the DVD Ratrace when they go shopping. So no prizes for guesssing what i'll be watching when I go to bed. I have a few pieces of homework, English, Science, Tech and um, somthing else. I'm not gonna write a long blog, as they get boring. Byedibye.
