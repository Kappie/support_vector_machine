We were initially going to another spot further south, and were counting on the little store in Pelsor to have gasoline. Well, when we got to Pelsor, the store (which was actually the only building in Pelsor) was abandoned. If we had continued on to the original campsite, we would have risked running out of gas, so we backtracked a couple of miles to the Haw Creek Falls site. We were dissappointed that we didn't get to our original site, but Haw Creek Falls was beautiful, and we had an excellent time, so we're going back this year.
