Felt really good but realised that I started getting a little bit too excited because I began rushing into things once I was uke and got thrown all over. No idea is it because of the adrenaline rush or the disorientation. Sensei's comment was 'slightly better than fair', which seemed to mean average I think. But nevermind, I've noted some points I should improve on. Free practice for one should be smoother and I should try to keep my ukes in front  of me (like ALL THE TIME ... heeeello, duh). I used really limited techniques during free practice so I need to practice using a broader range. My nikkyo and shihonage still need some work. There was once, as uke, I used shomenuchi instead of yokomenuchi. Somehow I kinda heard wrongly. I was a little puzzled how come my partner used techniques which seemed more suited for yokomenuchi instead. I'm not sure if I managed to change back to the correct strike in between though. My footwork during free practice wasn't as sure or precise as it should have been. For one thing my kaitennages didn't feel like it used to be during usual classes. Free practice, I forgot most of the kokyunages that I usually did in class. Got no idea why. Even the way of just tenkan and turning to throw was lost on me... duh.  It was a really small crowd compared to any previous gradings I've seen. Which was good, I thought. There were a lot of things I noted. There was this malay guy who maintained a continuity during his free practice. He made sure his ukes were always in view most of the time and he never stopped. My partner had strong and better techniques, I thought. At least I could feel like he was actually doing something to me. I also noted one small point about myself from pairing up with him. I didn't maintain as much close contact as I would have hoped in order to execute the technique or taking ukemi. Those would be the times when I felt like I was doing something weird or falling wrongly.  Hmm ... after this, there's a lot I would like to work on. For one thing it'd be intent during atemi. Sensei was saying we're too relaxed sometimes. Footwork and posture not just during pair work but especially so during free practice. And taking slams :P All in all, I'm glad it's over. I'm satisfied with the day's training.  I just remembered, should I be submitting my grading card for Sensei's signature?
