 I already can't live without the  urlLink Google toolbar , but a new toolbar just came out from CNET which is another resource I visit on an hourly basis. Not sure if I can handle this much on my toolbar, but I am going to give it try. I have many " urlLink BookMarklets " on  the "My Links" toolbar as well, so it's getting a little crowded.
