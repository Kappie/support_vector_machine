He told that the cable connection was blocked bcz the dues had not been given. Dad was furious. He said that damn ur cable, i dont want it, come and take away ur stuff and get lost! The cable was still bot working at that time... as always.  Neways, I worked on the site for some time. Had Lunch. Worked some more. Then i got a dialup account and came online. But, MSN refused to sign in. After repeated attempts, I decided to let it go. Then, I listened to some songs, posted at the forum, and just sat bored. At bout 6 i went for jogging. When i got back after an hour, i was flushed. After cooling down, I had some snacks and sat at my pc. Tried to get the cable to work, but couldnt. Then, I had dinner and watched the Ladies Semifinal between Williams and Mauresmo. It was a great match! Neways, then I came back online, chatted for some time and again posted at the forum. Had some ice cream. Then, Ahsan called. I had sent him that chat thing yesterday. He was laughing so hard. Lol. He was also shocked on reading it. Neways, now here I am, posting.  Today I looked at some other blogs and how they had customized their pages. So, i decided to use some of my HTML and CSS knowledge and give it a try myself. Now, im planning to edit the template of this blog and get some custom links in. They'll be done by night. I'll meet u in tommorow's edtion of my blog. Till then, Buhbye!
