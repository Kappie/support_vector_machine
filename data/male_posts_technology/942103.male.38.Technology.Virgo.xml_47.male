My mind is a painting right now:  "Polar Bear in a Blizzard".  It's just that blank.  Blanker than normal.  Sometimes at least it has pretty colors and random pictures.  Not today.  Just pure white.    Bleah.  The muse who was upon me to write has kicked me in the ass, laughing, while she goes off to the bar for Mai Tais and Yahtzee.   Maybe later, then.
