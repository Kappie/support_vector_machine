Gay computer.  On sunday, as you already know from the previous post, I woke up late and went to a local school where some friends of mine were hainging out. After everyone dispersed, Pat and I went over to Adri's to bug her and kill time before he had to be at college group at Pr. Drew's house. I decided to be adventurous and see if Drew would let me come too (though I'm still a senior) and after many inventive ways of finding his phone number, I finally was able to ask, and he yes, it was fine to visit it that night. I followed Pat over, driving my dad's über spiffy car (hehe).   Yeah, that was a great night... been a long time since I played Mau with Sara  Beth(LOL) There were a ton of people there that I know but had no idea went there.  At the end of the night, Greg Anderson and I were talking ... mostly about my family and stuff, and I mentioned that it's like they're divorced, but still living together, infact if it weren't for us, they would be divorced. He had trouble hearing me and asked "but they're not actually divorced right?" ... Little did I know.  ... Which brings me to my next news flash... My parents are getting a divorce. I was informed that night when I got home ironically.  Man, I really wish I could join that college group... I need some people like them in my life right now.
