That way I'll be able to connect my work laptop and home computer at the same time.  It was very easy to setup.  I'll have to admit I was apprehensive.  I then went to play golf with Phil from across the street.  I met him at 5:30 at orchard hills gc.  He paid.  I wasn't expecting him to pay, so I bought him some beer.  After we teed off on the second hole it started raining and thundering.  We had to go back to the club house to wait 30 minutes.  We then resumed our round and were the last to leave the course.  Saturday, I went to see Spiderman.  It was an awesome movie.  It was significantly better than the first one.  Good plot, essentially a love story this time.  I also mowed the lawn with the new grass catcher on the mower.  That seemed to work well and I got it in before it rained.  Sunday, I went to church, took a nap and then worked on C's garden.  As soon as I got setup to start again, it started thundering over my head.  So...I put everything away and took a shower.  By time my shower was done it was sunny again.  So I waited an hour and went back to the garden to clear some weeds and put down the mulch.  I didn't get much done because it was so wet and getting late.  I took another shower and went to bed.  Monday, I played golf with Lee at Cotton Fields.  It was a real nice course.  It was fun and good to see my old work friend.  Monday afternoon, I took a small nap and helped Paige fix her computer internet connections after a recent lightning storm struck her house.  I installed a new NIC card in her computer and configured her wireless router.  We then spent some time talking.  For lunch I had a grilled salmon and vegatable salad with balsamic vinegar dressing.  I need to pay attention to the diet more seriously again.  Anyway, that's my weekend.    Kevin
