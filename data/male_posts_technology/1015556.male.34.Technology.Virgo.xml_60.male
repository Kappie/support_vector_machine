Of course, did I really need a new printer?  No, not really.  It's a luxury.  Anyway, K and I were joking about phrases to use on Christmas cards in our very well to do American society, keeping in mind the global condition of the rest of the world...  - hoping jesus is preached in your life this season - so wow, 30 million don't have food today. when was your last week long fast? - at least you have access to clean water - be glad jesus doesn't care that you don't - 1.2 billion lived on $1 today. i think it's time for a frappachino  (this was my personal favorite) - how do you feel drinking bottled water because your tap doesn't taste good? At least you don't get intestional problems from it.  Very pious huh?  Well, it was funny at the time....
