I worked so much I didn't get to finish my homework over the weekend which really suckd i was trying to finish it sunday night after I got off of work but I fell asleep at my books which means that I didn't finish my physics homework that was due today and because I didn't  fall asleep near my alarm I didn't make it to my physics class this morning. In other news happy birthday to adam whose birthday was yesterday.
