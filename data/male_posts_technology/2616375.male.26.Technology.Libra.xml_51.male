Apart from the great blogs from Indian MVPs, I really like reading the Cnet blog (always first with tech news) and Microsoft Watch from Mary Jo (insider details)  I use SharpReader as my aggregator and have exported the blog list using "Export" functionality and the file has been created as an OPML file.  Find the OPML file  urlLink here .  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.
