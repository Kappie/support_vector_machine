I know this is a blog, and the details r supposed to be posted liberally, but got darnit!! i'd be here thru next Christmas. One of the only true bright spots is my newly acquired friendship with Mellanie. She's my equal in every social aspect, well...no, she's way sharper than I am. If I didn't know any better, I would think her to be a fellow Scorpio. Real peoples know, a Scorpio is not to be messed with. We run the game  expect nothing less than perfection. She would be perfect if she were closer to SC, and I wasn't about to train for overseas duty, and if we didn't clash so much.   Last nite was also the big Christmas program at my church...the annual star-studded gala where friends both young  old gather on one special night to join in harmonius celebration of the birth of our Lord  savior Jesus Christ. *sigh* What fun...colors r still the same, message is still clear, but its just nto as good as it used to be. I don't feel the true nostalgia anymore when I walk through the doors...I don't feel compelled to generate tears as I remember the days of old, when i was a young 4 year old torn untimely from his native land of Norfolk, VA to a lil country town in the middle of nowhere...I don't feel the rush of excitement  anticipation as i remember my friends  classmates as we dreamed of becoming positive influences in the community  the world. These were dreams I hoped to pass down to the next generation, but their ears as closed to much reason. Minds fixated on pipe dreams, many of them. But one thing about kids...no matter how bad most of them turn up, there is always one. In my generation, there are two...me  my recently wed boy J.R. I look at the new faces of the Sunshine band, and of the current condition of the administration of Churches of God Holiness...and I see a people that are gonna have to fight with everything they are and have in order to be truly productive Christians. They will perhaps not find it here, lest there is one to resurrect the praise. Save a soul that is more than willing to pull some MLK Jr./ Malcom X type social uprising...because to black people, sometiems thats all we listen to. One great mind, surrounded by a bunch of Jesse Jacksons...   Well, time to play war games. By the way, Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising on the Gameboy Advance is a fantastic game of strategy that I recommend for kids of all ages :-) Its even better when you have an emulator on your PC that lets you play any rom u can find on the net or wherever! hehehehehehe...*ahem* That's the end of my creative rope for tonite...
