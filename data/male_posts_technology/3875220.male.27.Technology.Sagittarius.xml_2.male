But I gots to go shopping after work and that's never fun in the rain. Especially when you don't  want  to get wet. Suppose I'll live.  My boss has been eyeing me all day long. Think he's gonna send me to New York later this week for work. Think he's just being mean to me since I'm on my final 2 weeks here. I can remember talking to people back in TX who were like "Wow! You're going to NY for work! Lucky guy!" and all that jazz. And admittedly, I had the whole wow-factor going my first trip. But by the time I was on the train back home later that day, I had a different perspective. And add to that that it'll probably still be raining buckets and buckets when I would be going definetly does not make it a funner trip. Guess maybe I should stop complaining and buy a damn umbrella finally, huh?  Now this is where you all say "Ohhhh, poor baby." or you start throwing shit at me and tell me to stop being a whiny bitch.  /me takes cover
