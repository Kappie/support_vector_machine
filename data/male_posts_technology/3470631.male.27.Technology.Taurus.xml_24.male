Anyway - the idea was for a company like Tampax (Playtex?) to develop and market a line of tampons SPECIFICALLY directed towards males who are buying them for their spouse/girlfriend etc. I figured there are probably a ton of guys who are asked by their sig other to pick up some tampons at the store -- only to shamefully avoid the request like red tide. (no pun intended) It could be called the Manpon or something lame like that - basically just so a guy feels somewhat cool and normal when he goes into the store. Maybe it's just as simple as an ad campaign - which could be pretty funny.   Maybe it's a horrible idea.   Which led my roommate and myself to get on the subject that no guy should ever have to go buy a girl a tampon. THEY SHOULD NEVER EVER RUN OUT -- it's not like it's a surprising occurrence! It happens every month for a few days - for most of their lives! Plus there are bodily signs that tell them it's coming! Yet it seems like we both know women who are always in a tough spot and always running out. C'MON. HORRIBLE. Take care of yourselves for the love of christ! GO to BJ's and get a case of a thousand. Don't tell me you don't have any more tampons! Tell me you don't like my tie! Hell, tell me you don't like me -- JUST DON"T WASTE MY FUCKING TIME!
