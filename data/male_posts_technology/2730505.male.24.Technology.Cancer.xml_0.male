Went to my doctor's office and discussed with the office manager what steps could be taken to set themselves up for potential growth in the future.  I didn't really get a feel of where they wanted to be 5-10 years from now and I also didn't know what their "limit" would be (i.e. how big they want their practice to be).  I did notice different things that could be improved to streamline the operation and make everyone working their and their processes more efficient.  This is really an exciting opportunity to start my own business.  If I do a good job on this on molding their IT infrastructure and they like it, my name would be spread amongst their peers and more opportunities would present themselves.  I mean think about it, one clinic, I could charge them $10K a year for support and maintenance and pretty much be their IT manager.  That's one practice.  If things are setup correctly, I wouldn't even have to visit their office more than once a month!  That's $10K for doing support and maintenance.  Now imagine if I had five practices to take care of?!?!?  That's $50K a year right for visiting clinics five times a month.  Now think about ten practices, $100K!!!.  If I really wanted to be absurd and ridiculous and want more than ten, let's say fifteen or twenty offices.  I would have to hire someone to help me out and be the main point of contact, kinda like the help desk (or tech support line), I could just pay that person $25-30K a year and their going to be set.  This is still really a dream, I still have to set that doctor's office up and that depends if they want things done right.  The computer people that they have taking care of their IT needs seems like a lame shop.  They really don't care about the business and the growth of the business and positioning the clinic properly for potential of growth.  Anyways that's a lot of rambling over an opportunity that hasn't even fully materialized yet but it's good to dream right?  Well going out tonight to North Beach again, free party deal, it could be fun.  I will have to stop being a little bitch and just go out and have some fun and stop comparing everyone to her.  It's proving to be somewhat difficult but I guess the setting is not really a place to find a person like that.  Thursday was lame  I really tried to talk to girls and see if they had anything intelligent to say or talk about things that I don't have an idea about but I couldn't really do it.  I feel like I should go to a fucking library to find a smart, intelligent, classy, not overbearingly opinionated, good looking, funny, appreciative girl that knows how to just let loose and have fun.  Yeah...Library? Not my style.  Man, I should stop doing this I gotta do laundry.  Peace out.  I really don't know why I am typing this at all.  Maybe it's just a journal that people can see but I guess it's more for myself as a therapeutic release of writing things down and looking back next year and checking out what I was doing, how I was feeling, I really don't know.  As much as I hate to say it, WHATEVER.  I'm outtie
