We went about an hour and a half out of are way almost going all the way to the Cleveland.    We finally got there and met up with Susie.  She was working at  urlLink College Lanes  (Oberlin's eight lane bowling alley).   We played a few games and then headed over to  urlLink Finney Chapel  for the Oragan Pump.  One midnight a month organists play the huge pipe organs in a casual atmosphere.  We got to go up and lay on the stage and feel the vibrations.    Saturday we watched Susies improv group perform and then headed over to downtown Oberlin.  later that night we saw  urlLink Rufus Wainwright  perform.  It was a cool performance.    urlLink Teddy Thompson  opened and the atmosphere was very laid back becasue Rufus' sister goes to Oberlin.    Susie's house had a party that night.  It was odd and I think I will leave it at that...  Okay back to the regular week...
