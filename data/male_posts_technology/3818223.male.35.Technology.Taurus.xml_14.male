       
      I admit it. I'm wimping out tonight. I'm running late and my brain is stuck in neutral, so I'm taking the night off from writing. I'll try to trade my Friday night off for my Thursday night of production (anyone who's been reading knows that probably won't work).   I don't know how the pioneers did it. If I go to work, the gym, and the post office all in the same day, I need a nap. Something has been lost over the generations. If it keeps up, our children will probably beat this obesity craze because they'll be too lazy to chew.
