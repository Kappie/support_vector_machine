These 4 are at about 95% done so I'm getting there. Today my new studio monitors showed up. It's nice to work with great reference equipment again. Now I'll be able to hear anything that sounds a little messy and be able to fix it.  In other news, I am getting ready to master my album  "Off the Deep End"  finally.  After the  urlLink Third Rail  songs are done I'm going into overdrive to get that album out finally.  Past the release of  "Off the Deep End"  is another album and new songs.  A more poppy album is coming.  Also it may not be just me producing my next album.   Oh my god!!!  Why wont you tell us more????!!!!  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!   Now that I've got you all excited go download the latest releases on my site:  urlLink rickkrenmayer.com
