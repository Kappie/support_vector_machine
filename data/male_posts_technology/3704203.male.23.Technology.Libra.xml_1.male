Fair enough.  So the loan all gets set up with a direct withdrawl from my checking account on the 20th of every month, I check today- the automatic withdrawl from my checking account never went through, so now my loan is late.  Then I get a note in the mail from my bank wanting insurance information for my boat.  I called my insurance man and set up all the insurance, etc.  I found out today that they never bothered to send proof of insurance to my bank, so now my loan is in default.  What a pain in the arse-  I dont know why this has to be this hard...
