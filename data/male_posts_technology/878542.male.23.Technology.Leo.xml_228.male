It was never really given much of a chance though.  Maybe if the Simpson's voice actors keep striking for more money Futurama will be commercially viable. It was very expensive to produce, according to Groening.   The Family Guy was quite amusing, and a bit lower brow, obviously. And it did phenomenally well in DVD sales. It's reportedly in production again for next season, which is encouraging.   I think that entertainment is a good barometer for certain kinds of interactions between business and social winds. Better entertainment means a better climate of communication.  More amusing bits is good. Let's hope someone notices the rabid fanbase things like Family Guy, Futurama, Invader Zim, etc produce, and gives a new show a stable timeslot and a steady funding level.
