Without further ado, let us dive into the murky depths of the Indian Blogosphere ( hah! kidding!! ) and uncover some pearls to hold aloft and admire!   urlLink Rohini  kicks off this week's Blog Mela with a post on something that everyone of us has experienced sometime or the other. She wonders... even though Indian call centres are supposed to be  urlLink The Good Ones  amongst them all, why, then, do we have to face the music?!  In  urlLink Rick Nightmares ,  urlLink Anita  relives some of the nightmares that she has experienced in various Indian cities when it comes to riding the ubiquitous autorickshaws.  On his travels in Kerala,  urlLink Jayakrishnan Nair  notices posters alerting people to the  urlLink Evils of Globalization , which according to him is contradictory to the facts.   urlLink Niraj  picks up the thread and tries to expose the  urlLink Globalization Hypocrites .  In another insightful post,  urlLink Jayakrishnan Nair  tries to explain  urlLink What Causes Globalization .   urlLink Sampada  tries to analyse the causes that have led to the  urlLink decline of the once flourishing Marathi film industry  and hopes that it will see better days.   urlLink Dina  presents the first draft for a  urlLink Youth Program  that she wants to initiate.  In  urlLink Of Cards - Credit and Debit types  [scroll down to the bottom of the page for the post. Dated 16 June 2003],  urlLink Lazy Lump  talks about how we take credit and debit cards for granted nowadays.   urlLink Nilesh  is perplexed about why the  urlLink Women of the species  are not active in hacking (hacking, not cracking).  A Bharateeya Blog Mela would be incomplete without an entry from  urlLink Dancing with the dogs !! Shanti talks about the  urlLink Muslim Personal Law  and the reluctance of Muslims to reconcile to the idea of having an Uniform Civil Code in India.   urlLink Ind  posts an informative post on the  urlLink Flag Code of India . In another one of her posts, Ind shares a recipe for a  Dates and Walnut Cake  (yummmmm!)  That brings us to the end of this week's Blog Mela. I hope you enjoyed going through all those interesting posts. The next Bharateeya Blog Mela will be hosted by Yazad on his brand new website at  urlLink www.yazadjal.com !!   Ciao!
