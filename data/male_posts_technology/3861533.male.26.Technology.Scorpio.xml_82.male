It starts off in Cyprus, where many Jews where interned in camps, under armed guard, after WWII. They had been stopped trying to get into Palestine by the British (it's current ruler) and instead placed in the camps (Cyprus was also a British protectorate at that time).  It tells how it's characters (most of them jewish) ended up in Palestine: * During all of the 20th century: Fleeing the ghettos in Russia, Poland and Germany etc to escape from pogroms. Some walking almost the entire distance. * After WWII: Survivors of the concentrations camps. * After WWII: Others who had fled to neutral countries or hidden from deportation. * Others where born in Palestine by parents who came there by one of the above means.  It tells of their struggle to reclaim their lost homeland, the hard work of reclaiming the desert, making it habitable and prosperous.  It tells of their struggle in the UN for the right to establish a Jewish state and once proclaimed, their prevailing against several armies, outgunned and outnumbered.  The book is very, very pro-israeli. Few arabs are depicted in a good light. In it's defense it should be pointed out that it was written in 1958, long before both the Six Day War (1967) and the Yom Kippur War (1973). The Jewish state at that time was still a novelty and was far from being the strong entity it is today when it too often abuses it's strength against it's arab population. Something I also reacted to was it's use of the dated term Mohammedans to describe moslems (but that again can be explained by when it was written).   I was planning on starting on Herman Wouk's  urlLink Winds of War  and  urlLink War and Rememberance , but I think I'll stick with a mini-Israeli theme and re-read his books  urlLink The Hope  and  urlLink The Glory . This also goes well with my planned viewing of The War of Lebanon documentary.     -->
