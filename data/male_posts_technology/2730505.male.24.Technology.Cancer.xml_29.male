She got in around 9:30 Saturday night.  Went to the store to pick up girly drinks and proceeded to go to Jerry's new apartment.  It was definitely a bachelor's pad.  Old furniture and a big TV.  Yeah, it was great.  Interesting neighborhood too!  Lisle isn't really known for the being ghetto but there was a bunch of ghettoness standing outside in the apartment complex entrance and about 9 Lisle Police Department squad cars.  Yeah it was scary.  Brought along the XBOX but didn't play that till after the Bulls squandered a 15 point lead to the Trail Blazers.  That was a pathetic display of basketball teamwork.  It was really sad.  So while that was going on we played ASSHOLE (the drinking game).  It's always interesting to see that the rules to the game change depending on where you are.  For example when I played at Kappa Sigma, President would always get the Asshole's 2 best cards (including the 2).  Here in Illinois, they never do that.  They just keep playing.  They also don't play with two decks if there are more than 5 people playing.  It was still fun.  Got Meghan some food.  Man that girl can eat.  Double quarter pounder w/ cheese from McDonalds and she put it away like it was nothing.  I was impressed.  Finally got tired and decided to go home.  She told me something at home that I will not forget.  Next day, Superbowl Sunday.  Got up around 2 or something I don't even know.  Ate breakfast cereal, rice, eggs and ham.  It was nice to wake up next to her in the morning.  With the messy hair and the sleepy look.  It was great!  I definitely think I can get used to that.    Went and shoveled some snow as she did her ECON homework and then she practiced her Kanji.  She talked to my dad about golf.  I had no idea.  Took our showers and went to this Japanese supermarket thing right where my old work used to be.  It was fun.  I think that's an understatement for her though.  ;-)  We then went to Derek's house for his Superbowl party.  That was cool.  The guacamole was insanely good and then they put some chopped jalapeno's with it and a little bit of lime.  OOOOO it was real good.  I made some burgers, they were man burgers.  It was just too good.  A lot of black pepper powder, good amount of garlic salt and a little more regular salt topped off with an egg to make it stick together.  Juicy meaty.  mmm, could be better but it was good enough for making it in 3 minutes.  Game was tight, very close, exciting.  Scary because of the bet.  Glad you changed your mind.  Told her not to leave.  Snow coming, she stayed, snow didn't come.  Monday, stomach not feeling well.  Want to purge myself before going to work.  Had cereal, rice, eggs and ham again.  Showered and took her to the gas station to gas up for the trip.  I was sad.  went to work and there was a heap of stuff to do.  Got a little break and type this out.  Hope everyone is having a great day.  Peace out!   Game - Panthers Vs. Patriots Line - Pats by 7 Score - 32-29 Pats
