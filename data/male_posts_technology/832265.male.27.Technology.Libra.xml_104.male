cars on the 25mph frontage road had been passing us easily, putting the lie to our express train status.
  
An hour later, when we finally arrived in downtown SF, a concerned crowd was gathered to meet us.  They were concerned as we had delayed their southbound departure on the same suspect train by half an hour.  As such, the unstated sentiment between the arriving crowd and that departing was both one of well-wishing and misplaced resentment.
