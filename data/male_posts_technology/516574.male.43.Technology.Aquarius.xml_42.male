In this case, the middle ground is good. You know how and when to cut loose, forget your daily pressures and simply relax. Nonetheless, you realize that taking on challenges and being competitive is necessary to reach your goals...but you don't want to take it to any extreme. Generally, you are easy to be around, and people tend to feel relaxed and comfortable in your presence - with the exception of the occasional stress attack or highly charged day. The equilibrium you have achieved is healthy; so don't let your hostile, aggressive, and competitive alter ego take over too often...or things could get ugly.
