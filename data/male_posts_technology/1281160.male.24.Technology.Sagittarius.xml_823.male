But individual has to decide on  what they really want .     I am in chennai . My mother and grandma has come down to chennai..so I am here @ my home.I may go home for pongal..That too if I have some work at that time then need to be reconsidered.     I applied for Visa this week. No immediate onsite chances since I have only 6 months experience..But just like that few of us in our account applied as per our IBU HRC's mail. Then it' s been so nice to hear from sindu after a long time..Valli I will try to meet you. Till jan 30th -There is a build for next release on that day.-I can't take leave. But try to take permission. Meet you all in the next blog..      Happy Hol's. Have Nice Time....  Cheers... Kavi
