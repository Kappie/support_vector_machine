If you didn't know, I'm very anti-Bush, and I support our troops, not the war, not the cause. No reason to be in Iraq. Vote Bush in '04! We need four more wars!! Don't you think? You can't can Bush, he's a "WAR Prezident!" God. I hate that man. Anyways, if the government don't kill me for speaking out against our  dictator  wonderful and glorious leader then I'll post more later. Until then...
