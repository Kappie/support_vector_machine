As best a man I can be.  I just got done reading "Speaker of the dead", Orson Scott Card's second Ender Wiggin novel. I say just, but it's been 5 hours since I went to bed at 5 and it is now 10.  I think that maybe I should have more discretion on this little blogger thing. Be more secretive. Not tell you anything. But you're my journal, at least of my thoughts and ideas. A way to quickly go back and remember the days gone by and see where my friends were and to find new friends. I think I partly publiish these knowing that no one will ever see them, but knowing someone will.   This is myself laid bare and I hope you enjoy reading it. If you can understand everything I say in these few pages you'll probably understand me as close as anyone has ever tried. Peace out-
