We are quite close to each other, each of us moving at a fairly rapid pace for a parking lot, but I do have just enough distance to stop and clear them if I slam on the brakes. Now, my brakes are of an odd sort - to begin with they're in a '92 Corolla, so anti-lock is not a possibility (or at least, not much of one). Second, even though they are quite powerful (I have come to a dead stop, decelerating from 55 mph in under 3 seconds on at least one occasion), the position of the petal is rather obscure. The accelerator, in perspective to the brake, is recessed almost two (maybe more, not quite sure now actually) inches. Furthermore, the width of clearance between the brake and the ‘wall’ or sorts to the right of the gas is almost identical to that of my shoes. Ok, now back to the story: Bearing all of this is mind, it’s easier to understand how, when I try to rapidly transition from gas to brake, my foot becomes stuck underneath the brake petal and when I floor what I think is the brake, I’m actually swiftly accelerating. Now, I’m sure the outcome of this petal orientation issue is readily apparent, so it goes almost without saying that I strike the Camry, even while attempting to swerve out of the way. What is not readily apparent though is that the damage that occurs to my left, front wheel upon impact jams it into a hard-right turn and sends me careening straight at a parked month-old Lancer. Thankfully, there is a small curb and sidewalk between my still accelerating car (foot stuck behind brake petal, remember?) and the shiny new, well-into-the-five-digit costing vehicle in front of me, that manages to catch my right wheel (the only one at this point free to steer) and allows me to narrowly miss totaling the Lancer, and instead simply remove the right rear tail light. By the time I am nearly passing the object which turned this into a three car accident, I have managed to disentangle my foot and sharply apply my brake… little good that it did with my left wheel banking sharply against the other three though.   All in all, the entire left side of my car is heavily marred, the driver door is bent, the left front wheel's hydraulics are destroyed (estimated $400 repair), and the right front bumper is imploded. The Camry got most of the body in front of the engine removed, and the top of the right wheel well is pretty much gone too. The Lancer had the most minimal damage, but possibly the most costly, seeing as it's less than a frigin' month old.
