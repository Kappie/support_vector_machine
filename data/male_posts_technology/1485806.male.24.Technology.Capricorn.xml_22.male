But of course nowhere except Oz can have the same quality of drinking water and air as it is in here ipoh....  Of course food alway taste better in Ipoh ...at home or at the town of Ipoh. Awaiting my dentures and my glasses have extended my stay in Ipoh plus the enjoyment of time talking to my folks in a relaxed manner is nothing to be bargained for. God have been truly good to me ....He have provided approval for the PSMB thingy as well as job interviews...but i have to reject them for the first time because i have to go through the PSMB scheme....  Yeah advertisement time....if anyone knew anyone looking for roomates and knew someone have a room to let in SS2 please let me know cause i have to shift to a more conducive environment to study..yes to study .. My preference is a single room with a budget of RM250 - 300 . negotiable.   Yeah boringness and continue desire to blog is unbelievable....ohh...welll that is anotehr blog
