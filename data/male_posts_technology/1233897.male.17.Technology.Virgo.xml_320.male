I've been suspended until further notice (which will hopefully be deliberated tonight) for having 100 demerits. My school uses a system of demerits where you get five for a minor offence (every time you get a detention you get a minimum of five demerits). I accumulated a massive amount of detentions to the first semester simply for being tardy because it takes so long to drop off my sister before school. Tardies reset every quarter, and when they do you get two free ones and 4 possibilities to be excused by parents. Every tardy after that is a detention of increasing length and finally at the sixth tardy you get ISS (In-School-Suspension). At the third one you're automatically up for expulsion from the school. Btw, there are two different running tallies of tardies, one for first period and one for all the rest of the periods, so it's different being late for school than being late in between classes.  First semester we (the faculty and I) realized there was a problem when I'd accumulated 16 first-period tardies... that's on top of the ... 10 or so that had been excused. LOL  In any event, I came into this quarter with a ton of demerits and only made that worse by being tardy many times again and by forgetting to serve detentions (an extra detention and 20 demerits). So, yeah... In any event, The school board's holding a special meeting tonight to discuss what to do about me since by our school's bylaws the principle has to recommend to the board, dismissal of anyone that gets 100 demerits. I'm not sure what's going to happen but I do know that the only one who seems outright against me is the principle... everyone one else has an attitude of 'how can the school help you?'  Whatever... that's what's going on in my life right now.  Oh, I maintain that today was good :) pretty carefree, everyone was gone so I had the entire day to be lazy, sleep in and do some work around the house. ... The first non-stressful day in a good while.
