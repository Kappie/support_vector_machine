The idea that a professor and his students would solve such a huge mystery is a very enchanting idea, and one that has me hoping that they're right.  It's not every day that people with little experience in something like investigative reporting manage to make such an impact.  Granted, Bill Gaines has been a reporter for the  urlLink Chicago Tribune  for a long, long time, but the students weren't, and a lot of other experienced folks have tried, and failed, to guess the identity of Deep Throat.  I don't really know where I'm going with this, but I guess it's sort of a feel good movie waiting to happen, and despite my penchant for feeling bad during those kinds of movies, I am rolling the credits already for this one, wiping a solitary tear from my left eye as Jules and I walk out of the theater (sniff).  I read an  urlLink article  while I was stuck on the Chicago Tribune website, which I pulled up so that I could make sure the web address was right for the link above. Upon further review, it's actually from the  Los Angeles Times , but regardless, it's about " urlLink The Real Cancun ", the latest, greatest reality-show offering.  I am not exactly entranced by the idea of yet another display of drunkeness and sex down in Cancun, and I for sure won't be seeing the movie, but Patrick Goldstein, the author of the article, offers a few interesting insights.  First, that the youth culture (of which I consider myself a member, in some sense) has become conditioned to accept even the worst reality display as better than "polished storytelling."  Second, that "The Real Cancun" is the ultimate post-modern teen movie, because it relies on reality to express what has previously been located only in fiction.  In other words, we've learned how to be unreal.  Regarding the last two points, isn't it interesting the way the youth culture (for that matter, every culture here in the U.S.) has been conditioned to believe that people will almost always act an honest way when behind a camera with no "script"  But just what is a script?  As far as I understand, it's a set of lines and instructions that allows the players of the parts to properly act the part that the producers would have them act.  And so, MTV and every other outlet puts to use what I think is the result of our culture's understanding of "what a movie person would do": the ability to have a script without actually having one.  It's sort of like the way that Improv actors are able to amazingly (but with suspicious regularity) read each other's mind as they perform a skit.  What passes as intuition between two people is often a memory of things that have been said over and over again.  With the ubiquity of television, the nation finds itself more and more like an improv group, or a close family--we're able to finish each other's sentences and anticipate each other's thoughts precisely because the words we are speaking and the thoughts we are having are the same ones we seem to remember from a Family Ties episode that comes on every three months on TBS.  The famine, of which these movies are a symptom, is a famine of original thought; after all, you may be offended by what you see in "The Real Cancun", but you won't be surprised.
