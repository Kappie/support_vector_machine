Then again, doesn't bringing in underpaid (unpaid?) foreign workers mean that a US professional campaign canvasser has lost his or her job?  Btw, I do realize that there's a big difference between a 'worker' and a 'volunteer'.  One of the commenters on David's post raises another interesting hypothetical question...    Suppose a foreign government truly wanted a particular candidate to win...  What is to prevent them from recruiting an army of 'volunteers' and sending them here to work for that candidate's campaign? They could mask their financing as some sort of sweepstakes for which there would be many prizes of an all expenses paid six-month stay in the U.S.. Conveniently that six months could start in June or July, ideal for college age "volunteers".  Now  that  is interesting! A perfectly shaped loophole to sneak through if you're a sneaky country with an agenda to swing voters' opinions armed with a swarm of fresh-faced young people with good 'persuasive' powers! Stuff that conspiracy theories are made of!! ;-)
