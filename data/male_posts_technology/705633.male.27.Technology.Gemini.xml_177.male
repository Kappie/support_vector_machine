The place filled up about midnight and it was a fantastic atmosphere. I think my slot went pretty well, I wasn't planning on using the mic. much as my experiences of Karoke in the past leave my filled with a kind of, cold dred.   Also playing were Don P, Andy, Wayne (The Dapper Crew) and DJ Ryan. I took a camera and got photos of the luverly ladies and us DJ'ing lads, which I will post soon..  Funniest moment of the night - when it was just filling up I noticed Alice was in. Alice is something of a nightclubbing legend in Jersey, a dancing and bopping granny in a flashing headband, armed with a ninja tambourine. She was sitting by herself looking rather lonely so I went to say hi.  Me: "Hi Alice.. nice to see you out again" Alice: "Hello there" Me: "Can I get you a drink?" Alice: "Oh, no thanks. I'm on cranberry juice at the moment as I am having bladder control problems." Me: "Ahhh. right. Er, catch you later.."
