March 4th is the when the Cubbies have their first game of spring training but spring training actually starts Feb 14th (or sometime around there) with the Regular Season Home Opener at Wrigley on April 12th (Monday).  High heat was fun.  We started out with Boston vs. Giants, as Derek kicked my ass with the final score of 9-3 Giants.  I was having problems telling my runners to go for extra bases and I kept throwing the ball when I caught it to home plate.  It was not a pretty sight.  The second game was a totally different story.  Well, the end result was the same but how we got there was something else.  It was The Cubs (Derek) vs. Marlins (Me, yeah we wanted to recreate and then change what happened.)  The players were mostly the same but it was evident that the roster that they based the game on was from the beginning of 2003 season.  It was alright.  So started out good, a couple of base hits here and there but ultimately I left runners stranded as Zambrano was mowing my guys down.  Josh Beckket was my pitcher.  He was doing pretty good against Sammy and Moises.  So in the second inning Derek made the mistake of throwing me a nice hanging curve ball and I just sat on it and hit it out of the park, 1-0 Marlins.  Round the bases and now it's the Cubs turn to hit.  I get through the first two batters with ease but I was just being lazy with a fast ball and Derek hit it out of the park, brand new game 1-1.  The pitchers then started to dominate the game throwing knee buckling curve balls as well as freezing cutters and just jam you up and force you to pop out.   Zambrano was pulled in the 3rd replaced by Wood and then in the 6th Prior was called up to pitch.  Remember Steve Bartman?  Yeah it was kinda like that.  Pitch by Prior jammed the batter but the ball didn't travel too deep into the seats for it to be uncatchable so Alou was able to make the catch.  Just looked all too familiar as the camera panned right down the left field line focusing on the left fielder as he got underneath the ball to catch it.  Reminded me of the NLCS.  So after that was caught went to the 7th and I hit a homer to lead 2-1.  Derek then shows up with Sammy to hit one as well tying the game at 2-2.  That's when things just got ugly.  We played a total of 15 innings.  No one wanted to lose.  We started the game at 8:45 PM and it was a long game!  15 innings.  Pitching was strong for both teams, strikeouts were starting to pile up for each pitcher.  10 pm came around we were still tied. 10:15, still tied 13th inning.  10:30 pm top of the 15th, had a chance to steal home I took it because I knew my pitching was going to come through for me, hesitated for a second and they got me at home.  Bottom of the 15th, got the first batter to pop up. 1 out.  Moises Alou was then walking up to the place.  He was having a bad game 1-6 or something like that so I knew that I could mess with him a little.  Fast ball upstairs.  Strike 1!  Curve ball high.  Strike 2!  Slider low and away.  Ball 1!  Low and inside 92 mph fast ball.  GAME WINNING HOME RUN!!!  Yeah, I was crushed.  It was a great game but I just got lazy and should've thrown a pitch outside to see if he would chase it.  Oh well.  It was a pretty enjoyable game.  Good graphics, smooth animation and transition and the game wasn't too hard to pick up on.  Great variety of pitches, around 30 overall.  Stealing bases is great but the pickoff moves are just as good.  Batting was a little hard to get used to but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy to direct where you want the ball to go.  The game definitely took longer than expected leaving little time to do ther stuff.  Sorry I was really going to call.  Graphics A- although the players didn't really look like themselves here, animation was still smooth and you could see their jersey numbers Game Play A - controls were okay, took a little while getting used to but that's just me Sound/Commentary C+ - the announcers didn't have anything to say, same repetitive crap with Mr. Obvious sitting with them  Overall - I would say that it's a must rent.  I haven't played it enough to really get into the franchise mode, 2 on 2 baseball etc. and to decide if it's a must buy.  Sounds like it if you can download updated rosters from XBOX Live.  Maybe I can give a better review if I do rent it myself.
