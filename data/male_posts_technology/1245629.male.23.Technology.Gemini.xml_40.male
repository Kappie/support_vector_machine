They have come up with urlLink  iCampus  Where all the MIT Work and Study can be done through Internet. Like taking courses and giving an exam.   urlLink iLab  is the intiative to bring the Lab to the Desktop Enviroment so that students can do their experiments from their desktop. Few have even desgined a  urlLink Shuttle Track  at MIT where from the computers end, the students can know where their bus is and when should they go to the bus stop , instead of waiting.   Cool Indeed
