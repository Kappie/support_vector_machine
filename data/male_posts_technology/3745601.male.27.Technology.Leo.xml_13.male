My main source of references have been found by using meta-search engines online. In my anti-Kerry entry, a vast majority of my references were from respected institutions like the washington post and the new york times. I have been searching for anti-Bush articles without much luck. The only entries I find are from people who have a definate chip on thier shoulder about Bush. I don't know if this isa lack of media coverage for Bush or a lack of credible information. With Kerry, I did not need more than several hours to find the information that I linked. But fear not my friend, I have not given up the search. I am determined to find what information I can about the President and compile it here. I am hoping to have it within the next week. Though, if I continue to have the same luck, I have no idea when it will be done. My goal is to have two sections dedicated to the two candidates so that I may compare and contrast them at my leisure. I am trying to find information on what Bush did prior to Sept. 11th in his first year compared to what he did after. I do not agree with the way Bush has handled the issues put before him, but I would like to give both him and Kerry a non-biased chance to get my vote. Eventually, I would also like a section detailing the positive traits of each candidate. I feel the media gives us enough biased negative information.   My sisters wedding was perfect. I swear she looked like one of the models that you see in the wedding magazines. I did not avoid the "When are you going to settle down?" question. My great-grandmother (bless her heart) posed the question to meas soon as she could at the reception. She then followed it up by a quick "Don't worry, you have plenty of time." pity statement that all people tend to give singles. I agree with  urlLink Maisy Day  in this entry of her's that being single is not a disease. It is not something that can be 'cured'.   Tank stayed with me again this past Monday. I am really glad that I am getting the chance to hang with him before he goes to the  urlLink Art Institute of Pittsburg . The guy is so talented it hurts, but so humble he doesn't know it. Penguin did not come by this past week. I did see him on one day, but I think I picked on him a little too much. I was agrivated at a percieved slight and took it out on him. I had a really great lunch with Popeye this past Tuesday at Applebee's. It was short, but helped me see the bigger picture with what is going on in my life. The service  and  the food were great. Popeye said his steak was not as good as he has had in the past.   I am currently doing a little light reading of some works of  urlLink C. S. Lewis . I have come to the conclusion that he  is  a great thinker. I know it is not news for many of you, but I am not one to take someone at thier word. I have to research it and see it for myself.
