Really weak waves with miserable rides, but you'd find the odd one that peaks up and gives you a nice drop. Good practice I suppose.   There was about 10 or 11 people on the inside, swimming, surfing and body boarding. There was a fairly fun shore break, but it was mostly closing out.    If you weren't there you didn't miss much.
