I will be starting to update my web site removing table layout starting today.   Update of my MAZDA B2200 Back Glass Broken - My boss ask me how much is the cost. I returned my memo with the quoatation which is 2,500.00. My contact was Vangie and told me that they are located near cor. Katipunan, M. Bacalso St. I'm hoping my company can help....      Update 07/17/2004 for my Mazda Back Glass:      I'm glad that my boss pay the glass and I just pay the new glass tinting for my car which cost 3,700.00. See my new back glass below.
