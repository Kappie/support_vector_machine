I had noticed her sleepy eyes when I first met her and wondered if she was working herself to death only to find her true passion was to have her very own creative haven and working a second job was worth the sleepless nights.   I pulled up to her building in the heart of Monterey, grabbing my jacket I flipped the button releasing the trunk with the familiar pop I headed to retrieve part of my surprise for the evening. I glanced at my wine choice for the night and wiped away some of the sweat that had beaded over the name "Sutter Home." This was a sweet wine, occasionally found at Safeway on sale for $3.50 a bottle it suited my budget and my tastes for a relaxing drink I could have anytime. I had left her completely alone for a week, she still worked both jobs and now I knew she was giving up the little sleep she was getting to begin some of the projects she was so excited to start. She hadn't called nor come over; I could only imagine she slept here or at her apartment a few blocks down the road. I understood she didn't have the time for me right now and I was glad that I was ok with that as it felt right to not try to take time away from her dreams. I lay awake some nights dreaming that I could feel the warmth of her body next to me. Within the first few days I think I inhaled all the smell from her pillow mixed with the scent of her hair and the light perfume that she wore, the scent that I swore made me pounce and seduce her before she had a chance to shower.   I checked the building index next to the main entrance, I noticed her attempt to cover the previous tenant's name with a piece of paper, scrawled with her favorite blood red ink, her name and the fact that it was a Art Studio. I had to smile at the Caligerfy styled writing, even in the smallest details she was art minded. Into the elevator and with a press of the button for the 3rd floor I was on my way. The building it's self seemed in good order, I noticed that the elevator was due for an inspection but I honestly had never seen a permit that was not expired. I shifted my weight as I was not a big fan of enclosed spaces or elevators that I was not used to and wondered if taking the steps might have been a better idea. To my relief the doors opened with a small chime I stepped into the hall and glanced down both hallways. It was after hours and the main lights had been turned off but secondary smaller lights within the fixtures gave off an orange glow that allow for movement. Seeing the number decreasing to the left I heading right and looked for 305. I could tell that the offices made a "C" shape not counting the space used by the elevator shaft. Coming around a bend I found my destination a heavy looking wooden door with a "Handicap Friendly" door knob that was found more in these buildings. I enjoyed opening these types of doors myself as I could rub my rear and push the handle down allowing for a arm full of equipment as I was used to in my field while entering a building.
