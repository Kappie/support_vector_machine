So I was given Cabcharge vouchers and jumped in a cab to parramatta from the city - I never realised it cost $50 in taxi fare... (you learn something new everyday right?)  So yea I still had to go back to head office in the city, so another trip into the city and then finally home at 8pm. (Yes I haven't been training lately, so sue me. :P) At least that was better than the guys who flew in from Melbourne this morning!
