This guy is best known for being the brains behind the  Backstreet Boys  and  N*Sync . He was also featured on the ABC show "Making the Band" for three years for his third boy band,  O-Town . That's the only reason I know what he looks like.  From his web site, I learnt that he was the guy who started Trans Contentintal Airlines (an airline charter service), and Art Garfunkel is his first cousin.  Anyways, inside the mall he was standing around 5 or 10 "pretty boys", whom I know is probably the latest boy band that I didn't recognize. I think a Toronto band, B4-4 was there - at least I recognized one of the members of that group. Oddly enough, there were no rabid fans mobbing them or anything. Everyone was pretty much just walking around them. Well, I guess some pop stars can go shopping like normal people. He he.
