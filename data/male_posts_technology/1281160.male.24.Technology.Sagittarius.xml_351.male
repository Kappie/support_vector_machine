I'ld be able to give my views then.   Does  college-time non-serious laid-back  activities have any significant impact on someone who really has the potential to make it big"...    Kicha, how many adjectives (that too hyphenated) are you using in tha bove sentence? Doesn't 'non-serious'  'laid-back' more or less convey the same meaning. As you had posted about education, I feel we should be able to implement it also. More later...  Busy validating the blog template as  XHTML ...
