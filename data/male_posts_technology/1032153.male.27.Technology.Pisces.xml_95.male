Isn't it so easy to dismiss someone by throwaway lines like these. I would suggest that if he was illiterate and stupid, he wouldn't be where he is today. Furthermore, IQ does not equate with 'thinking'. I know some very 'intelligent' people who cannot think. And then I know some people of average/below average intelligence, who are thinkers.   What I admire about Bush is his strength of convictions. See  urlLink this . Here we have a man who is willing to commit possible political suicide, for what he believes is right. God bless him, and may he continue in power to a second term.
