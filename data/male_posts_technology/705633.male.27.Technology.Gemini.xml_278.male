She was about 6 foot 5 and the size to go with it, she certainly would have whupped my ass at an arm wrestle. Never go out with a chick that could beat you in a fight, that's what I say. She came up to me and said...  Her:             "You were in Sports earlier, weren't you?" Me:              "Yeah" Her:               ................. Me:              "Well. eruhm... cya..!  I also did something exceedingly wicked and evil. A very drunk young brunette came up to me and was flirty, poking me in the ribs, etc. I responded by reaching tenderly down her back; slide my hands into her jeans and pulling her thong a good two feet up into the air. WEDGIE!!!!  Her mates gave me evils and the boys were in a foetal position on the floor with hysterics. Anyway, I bought her a drink in Follies to bury the hatchet so it's all good.  Custard, if you're out there we are all very worried about you. We know that you were playing tonsil tennis last night, and more importantly, we know whom with. I for one am scared. I hope she didn't bite if clean off when you left with her, and I hope you're not buried under somebody's patio right now. Please post a message to let us know you're OK :)  It's not very often I post something serious on here, but I have read something today that is very sobering and I'd like to draw attention to it here.  The Chinese goverment heavily censors the use of the internet, blocking sites such as the BBC and Amensty international, even Google. China is able to block sites from its citizens because there are a finite number of internet backbones running into the country, and it has control over all of them. According to Amnesty International, 33 people, including political activists, writers and follows of the  urlLink Falun Gong  (a spiritual practice similar to Taoism and Buddhism) are currently detained and being tortured for browsing internet sites or expressing their views on the internet. Some are have believed to have died in police custody.  You can read Amensty's  urlLink full report on the situation  and  urlLink what you can do to help.
