So the CVS of Sharma's Organizer is hosted on  urlLink http://sourceforge.net/projects/sharmaorganizer . This is not a really fundu project but a good one to start on at sourceforge. i have never worked in this sort of online collaborative environment so it is going to be interesting I guess.Nowcomes the hard part I need tofinish this is time with the hectic project schedule.     Anyways, Following are some of thestuff that I think are indispensable for any programmer working on windows (some of these are usefull for normal users also)       (Windows ...err.. Bad Joke)    FileMon, Pexplorer, DLL dependency viewerand TDMon:   These free utilities can be downloaded from   urlLink  http://www.sysinternals.com    and they are essential for any programmer.Filemon gives you details of what files are being used bydifferent processes, PExplorer gives you detailed view of all the processes hogging your system, Dependency Viewer will tell for each dll/exe all the dll'sit depends on. TDMon willtell you the details of all the TCP/IP connections made by each process.     Sygate Personal Firewall:   This is a must have for any user (even home users). This tells you what all processes are accessing the external network and any external connection being made inwards to your machine. You can backtrace and find out the I.P. address in case of any attacks and take corrective measures.    MyIE2:   This is the best browser available which provides number of features like mouse gestures, tabbed interface multiple proxies etc. A must for anyone and can be downloaded for free from   urlLink  www.myie2.com   . Also have a look at Robo form plug in it is cool and clean form filling tool (unlike gator which will irritate you by showing ads etc)    XPlorer2:    Advanced Windows Explorer. It has so many cool features like filter view, bookmarks, multiple panned view, touch, quick display and can improve your productivity if you start using it properly. Make sure you download the dirkey plugin when you install this .    Agent Ransack:   If you ever need to search for files or some texts inside files, this is your saviour. You can write regular expressions for searching and do whatever you want. Takes minimum 50% less time than windows search. Another good one is "Search  Replace", but I have not used that.    TextPad:   You might think why? but believe me this is essential for people who write a lot of sql queries and data intensive tasks. This has very good macros and also provides vertical block selection. So if you want to work with the data this is one tool which can make your life much easier (unless offcourse youare comfortable withemacs).    CygWin or SFU(Services For Unix):   Cygwin is a linux emulator on windows and you can run almost anything that can run on linux. so you can write your shell or perl scripts with those advanced string functionalities run on your windows box. SFU is my microsoft and it is a native application (unlike cygwin which is an emulator) and hence little faster but has less support from os community. If you install SFU then make sure you download teh bourne shell also (which is not part of default install)    Sharp Develop Fidalgo :  If you want to work on .Net and can't afford VS.Net then work on this one. As good as VS.Net (well almost) and is free with source code. It supports only C# as of now.    Yahoo POPs:   Want your yahoo mails on your mail client. I know yahoo had stopped POP access some time back. This is a fundu hack basically a POP server sitting on your machine and accesses the mails from yahoo and feeds your mail client. Go to sourceforge and search for this project.     There are many more good tools but I will post them at alater date. Hope this information is useful..... Tillthe next posting Byeeee.....
