I have the index page automatically redirecting to the gallery.  I had to get NetPBM and PHP to co-exist together, always fun.  I also had to turn the safe_mode attribute option in PHP off.  I think this is a lot easier for Jen, rather than email everyone the pics.  This way it's centralized.  I hope Jen and Alan like it.  ILY
