Oh well, another vacation this weekend (Coventry here I come).  My relationship with CW is transitioning to something serious.  While we are still joking to each other, and having a good time, the seed of a serious relationship has been sowed.   With care and attention I think it will flourish.   I haven't written much in the political realm yet, and I'm thinking today might be the day.  Listening to NPR today I was struck by the comments about Iraqi Cleric Al-Sadr.  Apparently he has sworn to fight against the U.S. occupation to the death.  I initially asked myself why he would fight an force that is ultimately trying to help the Iraqi people.  Quickly that thought was replaced by another question.  Are we really helping the Iraqi people? What reason do they have to trust us?   Do we have their best interests at heart?  Call me cynical, but I doubt it.   I don't trust this administration, and I am quickly losing all trust in the government.  I think there is just too much money, and too many conflicts of interest to withstand any kind of ideological explanation.  The Iraqis have simply changed which leader/group they are sacrificing self-determination for.  Perhaps we are more benign then Saddam, but if the Abu Gharib prison scandal, and the helicopter gunships currently strafing Iraqi civilian areas are any indication,  Americans  need to rethink our purpose in Iraq, and what we expect to achieve.  I love norah jones' voice.   Smoky, sexy, and evocative.  I don't think I've liked such vocal driven music in  years  .
