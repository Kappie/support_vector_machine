News in Brief  I am now clean shaven. Gross. Maybe not for long, as it makes me look a heck of a lot younger.  I am behind on my reading goals. I am too embarrassed to say how far, so don't ask.  Trogdor is currently hiding on top of his cave. Oh nope, now he is patrolling around his cave. And now he is in his cave.
