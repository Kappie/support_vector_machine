Manekshaw, his legendary wit and charm intact, cut his birthday cake with a silver khukri, the favourite dagger of the legendary Gurkha soldiers, as the large gathering sang Happy Birthday to You.  Yesterday, I was watching some footage of this birthday party on TV and I was struck by how active and sprightly FM (retd.)  Sam Manekshaw  (Sam Bahadur to his troops)  looked and acted, even at the age of 90. He looked dapper in a smart suit and he answered questions with enthusiasm.  One journalist asked him about his views on the war. " War?! What war are you talking about??!... I don't know of any war! ", he shot back almost immediately, " I'm a peace-loving man. The only fighting I did was with my wife. And she died two years ago! ".  We could really do with men like him in the Army and politics right now. Belated Birthday Wishes to you, Sam!!
