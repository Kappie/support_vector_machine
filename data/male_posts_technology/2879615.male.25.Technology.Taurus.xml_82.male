'at the end of this receiver is what's really wrong with me' -Boys Night Out  im at work.. today i showed up at 9 and guess what - my boss isn't here. ontop of that, i have no set plans. im just sitting here looking at webpages. mind you, this isnt really all that bad - it is quite boring. anyone with any fun things to occupy my mind please post on the blog.  p.s. a firetruck just drove through the middle of campus for no reason and theres been like 2 cops just walking around outside for an hour.  tcnj = cool bean = sarcasm underwear = farts  long live saddam!
