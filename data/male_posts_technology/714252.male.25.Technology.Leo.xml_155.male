Was browsing the web and found some white supremacist sites (gimme a sec to explain...) I had been watching RTE the other night and saw what was without doubt the worst piece of reporting ever.  There had been a murder and the police were "looking to speak to a nigerian man in connection with their enquiries".. They had released a picture which was shown on the news but then straight after they went to random shots of black people walking the streets of Dublin!  This was the worst thing I had ever seen.. If you had a report of a white man wanted in connection with etc. etc. etc. they wouldn't show random shots of a white man taking money out of the ATM etc.. I was so annoyed I actually decided to complain and do some research on the whole Irish racism thing when I found  urlLink This site .. It is horrible. A white supremacy group organised and running in Ireland.. Not only that but I found more! There was also the Storm Front organisation ( urlLink Here is the irish section of their site )  One glimmer of hope did come out of all this though.. On the nsrus site I did find their two primary contact numbers are mobiles!! So here I include the number you need to ring to go straight to their answering machine (so you don't have to pollute your ears with their racist voices)  Ireland direct call ~ 08757654682 ~ Dublin Direct ~ 08651975717  Or if you feel like like annonymously texting use  urlLink this site  with these numbers:  Ireland direct call ~ 0877654682 ~ Dublin Direct ~ 0861975717  Go play with the nasty racists!
