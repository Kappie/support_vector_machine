Not being subject to the obnoxious behavior of my old friends.  I've always hated the way they acted, obnoxious, loud, and selfish. If one of them could live here then they would understand how easy it is to be calm if you are not in the city.  It would be a gift if you could put up with them for more than 2 days if you have lived in Tyler. I myself have a lot of anger built up because of the inefficient way society works.  Company is like fish, only good for two days.  I am not sheltered, I was only annoyed.  ---  On the happier care-free side of Elad that only comes out when I am listening to music by  urlLink Nobuo .
