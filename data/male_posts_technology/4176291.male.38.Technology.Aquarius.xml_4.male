( urlLink http://www.newamericancentury.org/ ) There was never the intention to have an exit strategy. Instead, there was meant to be a military force in the region in perpetuity. And as such, I don't believe there was ever the intent to build a lot of support for our cause there, and to bring in extensive numbers of "allies". Bringing in "allies" would reduce our need to keep troops in the region, which would certainly run counter to the stated objectives of PNAC. Now, if we examine recent statements by Kerry, we see where he has a plan to reduce our forces in Iraq by the end of his first term. So where is his strategy any different than that of the the Shrub? It's really an amazing feat of newspeak, and both the incumbent and the challenger have basicly said the same things. They want to enlist help from other countries (who they know are too pissed to help us), they want to bring the troops home as quickly as possible, but the jobs not done, so plan to be there at least through the next presidential term. And I am sure that even that timeframe will change to "the extendable future". While they do a great little dance with the charade we call democracy, the semantics of their plans aside, the results will be the same. I am sure in the interim we will hear a lot, especially on the Fox Neocon Channel, about how Bush's "vision" is so much better than Kerry's "plan". And in some circles the argument will be vice versa. But when you wade through the muck of newspeak, you can see that both have subtly left us with the impression that we are going to be there awhile. And realistically, there are just too many good reasons to stay. All those reconstruction contracts, not to mention the oil, and the chance to intimidate and threaten other would be rogues in the neighborhood. Much like Bush, Kerry's fate will be decided by the millionaires and billionaires he serves, and cutting them off from the reconstruction contracts and the oil is not in the cards. Here's the link to Kerry's brotherspeak on the issue -  urlLink http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-kerryiraq9aug09,1,7671568.story?coll=la-headlines-nation
