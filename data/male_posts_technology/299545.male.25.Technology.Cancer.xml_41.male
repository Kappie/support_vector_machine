If it takes too long to deliver results or an additional word of text on the home page is too distracting, Google risks losing people's attention. If the search results are lousy, or if they are compromised by advertising, it risks losing people's trust. Attention and trust are sacrosanct.   From the  urlLink Fast Company article  the above quote is one of the reasons that Google.com is my homepage, and probably won't be changing anytime soon.   And in my vain sort of way, I can't help getting excited when this website is the first response on a google search on either  urlLink chittim  or  urlLink greg chittim .
