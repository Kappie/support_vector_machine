The band and I will just sit down to look over the stuff to see if there is anything else that needs to be fixed. I'm going to be remastering the original eight tracks also, but that is going to be easy compared to a full blown production.  Other than that Tropical Storm Charley visited the studio this morning around 7:30 AM. What makes this awesome is that I went to bed at 2:30 AM and when the rains started coming down and smacking my air conditioner in my room it was so loud it woke me up. We need the rain around here so Charley was actually welcome in this area.   My father and I have measured about 3.5" of rain in the last two days. Not bad since this is usually our driest part of the year.  Now that I'm pretty much done with the six songs I'm going to clean the studio and play some of my favorite Mozart pieces on the piano. I haven't played them in a while so I'll have to read the music all over again. :-(
