Hmmm... deeply disappointed. Just to clarify, I am not against the Congress party, just against Sonia. We did not shed so much blood for freedom to hand the reins of the country to another foreigner. Although I detest the idea of her becoming PM, I would like to confess that I have a grudging admiration for the lady. Who would have thought a month ago that this would be possible? The NDA looked like it would win the election in a canter. She did rally her party well and took it to victory. My respect for her would multiply if she proposed Manmohan Singh to be the PM. As for my own state Karnataka, I am sorry to see Krishna go. I believe he had done a good job, but was unlucky. Let's hope he will be able to cobble together an alliance with some smaller parties to get back into power. What are the lessons of this election? For me the biggest one is that the current model of development is creating islands of prosperity in an ocean of poverty. This is simply not acceptable. We have to make sure that benefits of globalization has to percolate to the lowest levels for true development to take place. For me, living in the US, it was easy to believe the "India Shining" campaign unleashed by the government. I guess the people exposed it as a farce. But there is hope. The stock markets have bounced back, now that a stable government looks likely. Honestly, I don't think there will be much difference in economic policies of NDA or the Congress, after all, it was the Congress that initiated the reforms. I just hope that the Communists who are likely to be an important part of the ruling coilation will not be allowed to hijack the policies.
