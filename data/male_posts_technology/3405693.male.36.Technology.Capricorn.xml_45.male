The metallic creak of my chair as I turn this way or that, the odd thunk as it passes a particular stressor point form their own percussion.  I take a drink from my bottle of diet coke, it hisses quickly as I open it then sputters briefly as I set it down and the carbonated goop gets angry at the motion.  My fingers beat out a somewhat irregular rythm on the keyboard, similar sounding clicks of a sort that if you'd never heard it before, you'd still know that it could only be a manmade sound.    One of the cats run past my doorway, making that sound that only running cats on carpet can make, and my lady Solitation hangs out just past the glass of my window.  It's eerily quiet on Davie st right now considering that it's Canada Day and all the partiers have been drinking since noon...perhaps they've all passed out already.  The heat is somewhat stifling and a thin sheen of sticky sweat covers my entire body; even sitting infront of the fan only brings a temporary reprieve.  I sway between sickly hot and a wierd chill from the sweat evaporating under the fan's spinning eye, and long for a nice cool shower...soon...soon...  In the apartment above me a certain amount of thumping is going on; this happens every night and it's like whoever lives up there has to redecorate their apartment before they go to bed.  That deadened bang that rattles in the walls but has no echo; a symptom of a carpeted apartment.  It always startles me when it first happens and I wonder if someone's getting pushed around.  But then I realize it's probably just a futon being unfolded, somewhat ungracefully, and my mind always strays to that old joke about throwing peanuts on the floor.  "Hi...I'm Peanuts..."  My hard drive spits out it's thinking rap, a new virus or spyware installing itself in a warm and cozy place...probably not actually...my protection systems work as well as they should.  It's just the everyday constant processes that need to be run, the subconscious and unconscious things the computer needs to survive, like breathing and pumping the heart and farting.   I hear the tinkling of breaking glass somewhere off in the distance, someone has dropped or thrown a beer bottle onto pavement.    And Solitation runs away for the time being.  I wonder when she'll be back...
