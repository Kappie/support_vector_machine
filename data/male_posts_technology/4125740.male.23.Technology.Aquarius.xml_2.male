The people that give it, great.  But like anything else, too much of it can cause it to lose its luster!  :-)   Now onto other things...let me start of by saying I appreciate the comments received about yesterdays posting.  Both of you left reasonable arguments, and I can't say any of you are wrong because you are two different people.  To "keep it real", you definitely brought forward some arguments that I hadn't thought of in the past.  It sounds like you have definitely been through, or am currently going through the particular scenario.  If you're letting it be known that you do have those feelings, but just have trouble letting them out, at least you are communicating.  But if you do have feelings, and say and act as if you don't when you really do, that is when a problem arises.  With that said, there is one comment made by "Anonymous" that speaks louder than anything else that was said...        "stuck on stupid" was in reference to the fact that she lets what happened in A, affect her relationship in B. If you weren't over A, then way jump into another scenario, therby hurting someone else in the equation? Wouldn't it have been better to give yourself time by yourself?"   It would be better to heal you wounds before jumping into another battle if you catch my drift.  If I treated every woman I met based on what an ex-girlfriend or two did to me, the new woman and I will never progress.    Now enough of this relationship mumbo-jumbo, lets talk about the fact that I'm going to Vegas in just  15  days!  I don't have time to think about being a one woman man, the SAVAGES are trying to get things poppin' in two weeks.  This will be my first venture to the west coast, and from what people have been telling me, Las Vegas is definitely the place to be.
