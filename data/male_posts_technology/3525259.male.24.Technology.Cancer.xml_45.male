Now is where the shit gets thick....it is harder and harder to find things to dish on each day. But imma try. VH1 had a thing called hottest hotties and ya know, i figured i could be david spade-esque and comment on a few of them.     100  Amy Smart  Are you kidding me? 100?! Why dont the VH1 producers re-watch Road Trip and tell me the scene where she initiates a naked porn interview with Breckin Meyer is not one of the best nude scenes of all times    99  Gavin Rossdale  Confession: when i was in 8th grade and this guy was cool, i wanted his hair style pretty badly. didnt really work out for me.    95   Heather Graham  Roller Girl? way hotter than this 95 shit    81  Charlize Theron  She gives Angelina Jolie a run for her money... DSL competition is a lock.    76  Orlando Bloom  From what the women in my office say, this guy is more swooned over right now than the likes of brad pitt.    69  Sarah Michelle Gellar  Fitting # spot, but Cruel Intentions was a hot hot flick... I WANNA FUCK! come on, you cant beat that.    51  Nick Lachey  Does anyone else in this world think this little couple should disappear away from MTV and the public eye in general.    48  Julia Roberts  Whether its the bubble bath scene from pretty woman or the descending the stair scene in oceans 11, julia roberts is hotter than a 48    43/41  Mandy Moore/Katie Holmes  Mmmmm.... this would be my threesome.    38  Kate Hudson     You all already know how I feel....this is blasphemy    33  Gwen Stefani  Had a crush on this one forever. So hot when she is dripping sweat and kicking ass on stage.... no one else does that for me.    30  Denise Richards  Pool scene with Neve Campbell can never be wiped from my memory.    26  Anna Kournikova  Does this girl even play tennis anymore? I just kinda know her as the hot girl from the Enrique Iglesias video or the nice one with the sweet ass who moans when she slams it up.    24  Eminem  This one is random... although I know a ton of white girls who want to fuck a guy named marshall mathers. i guess i shouldnt hate, but this guy would probably say some fucked up shit in your ear while he's having sex with you.    22  Demi Moore  one word: milf    19  Jennifer Aniston  I think Jennifer Aniston is my #1. She is so so pretty, so funny, seems so chill in real life. She tops all these fools below.    17   Cameron Diaz  Definitely my #2. Cameron Diaz is soooo good looking. So quirky-goofy, and of course she has been known to do some kink dances in her little boy underroos. hot.    14  Justin Timberlake  He gets around and ya every 14 year old girl is screaming his name. But this guy is younger than i am, so i can claim the following: he stole my name, he stole my haircut.    11  J. Lo's Ass  OVERRATED. How can J. Lo's ass rank above her physical being? Can we please stop talking about J Ho. she is not pretty.    06  Brad Pitt  I am taller than Brad Pitt!    04  Britney Spears  Britney Spears probably tastes like strawberry shortcake...she's just that hot.    03  Ashton Kutcher  I dont get it. He is funny, tall, handsome, whatever. But why is everyone so so so into Ashton. Please, any woman, explain!    02  Angelina Jolie  mmmmmm. ya as long as she didnt talk too much about weird shit like biting me, wanting to be intertwined in my soul and shit, i could deal with waking up next to angelina jolie :)    01  Beyonce  shazaaaam! hot hot hot this is the fucking hottest black chick on the planet right now.     Hotties not making the list:    Jodie Foster ala Jackie Brown when she is the little surfer girl.   Christine Taylor, Ben Stillers wife, beautiful in so many ways.   Eliza Dushku/Shannon Elizabeth-- impossible to believe these girls were passed up   Tara Reid-- I'll suck your cock for $1000. and no list? bullshit   Natalie Portman-- Jewish girls should be on it too right :)   Avril Lavigne-- angry hot girls are definitely mentionable   Ryan Phillipe-- ya ya, hes a guy but he is a cool dude who should have made it   Jack Black-- what, fat guys cant get love too?
