And I guess this applies to anyone who's praying for a life partner. You know how sometimes we ask God for a partner who loves God and well, attracts you (there should always be that chemistry to start with), the same deals with us because somewhere out there someone is asking God that we be attractive. At least, in their eyes. " Excerpts from Wainyan.mediahulk.com   Well my reasons for running in the early morning have something close to it but yet it is so far from it. I have recently attracted to a girl whose faith is the attractive point...of her...and I am encouraged to even build up that faith will attract people to God. I have and desire to continue to pursue that strengths in the Word and pursue God 's presence by running everyday morning or afternoon.  Early last year, i thanked God for being able to go to OZ for my graduate training and in the process being able to go to Kooroong , one of the mega Christian Bookstore in OZ. Being able to buy a Spirit Filled Bible with cover at equalivency of RM currency of RM 60.00 So i used to the max the bible in helping me to understand ROmans...and for every bible verses that strikes me, i wrote it down in cards and make a point to recite it loudly.  So early in the morning as i go jogging with Wai Nyan , as i run or jog or just walk , sweating..i will recite bible verses that is written earlier on. Even as i do that, i get to proclaim the Word , memorize it and let not the word of God depart from my lips and heart so that i can meditate on it day and nite. so that i might be prosperous.  It was great being able to kill 3 birds with one stone,...able to worship God in exercising physically and spiritually. Run, Pray and Worship.  I will open this invitation to SImply United members, as well fellow bloggers to come and join us. I will continue to cultivate this into my life that it will become an influencing culture and factor . I hope even as we choose to do this..we die to ourselves each day and be able to become the empty vessel for God 's annointing to do its work in us so that we can preach the gospel both to believers and unbelievers.  For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ to Salvation to those who believes, first to the Jews and then to the Greeks. For in the righteousness of God, Christ is revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written , The Just shall live by faith.
