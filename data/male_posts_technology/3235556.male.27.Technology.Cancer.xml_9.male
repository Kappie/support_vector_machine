Anyway, had to throw a twist in my usual number of starting my blog entry with a gripe, but don't get used to that.  Just had to try something different.  Today's tidbit of annoyance:  I'm getting tired of all those Linux folks out there, begging, pleeing, and poundin' their Linux Bible's saying that their operating system is the best, and can do everything you want to do that Windows does, but only better.  Yea, I'll agree, that Linux is a very stable operating system.  I'm very versatile in the computer world, with a very good working knowledge of computer hardware, and operating systems.  I've started with shootin' off commands in DOS 5.0, when you actually had to work to use your computer.  There was no internet, no pretty graphics or big hard drives to download gigs of MP3's.  We had two floppy drives, and a 20 megabyte hard drive if we were lucky. You heard me correctly, a 20mb hard drive, roughly the space contained on 14 3.5" floppy disks.  Anyway, with my brood knowledge of computer technology and operating systems, I've struggled to use Linux.  I'll admit, I'm a lazy computer user, a power user mind you, but a lazy one.  I find it ridiculous to re-compile the Kernel(core of the operating system) every time a hardware config, add/remove, or change is done.  In Windows, you turn off the system, add/remove the hardware, and power back up.  Windows finds it, and you're on your way.  If Windows has the drivers built in, great!  If not, your in for a slight annoyance, but nothing like recompiling a kernel.  To go back in time once again, we'll step back to the days of Windows 3.1, when there was no plug 'n play, which is a term long forgotten because plug 'n play has been around since Windows 95.  In Windows 3.1, you had to add the hardware and install the drivers and hope all works well, but again, no re-compiling of a kernel.  Don't get me wrong, maybe compiling a kernel isn't hard at all, but the term in itself sends herds of folks grabbing for Windows XP.  I've used Linux, and it's "Windows" type interface is neat, but lacks the luster of a Windows environment, and could use some methods for easier navigation.  Sure, Linux can do everything that Windows does, but doesn't often come straight out of the box with the ability to do so.  In many cases you gotta spend time online with various support forums to get answers on how to get some program to install and function correctly on your Linux box.  I hate installing a program like Netscape or an AIM type software only to find out that each program specifies its own directories it installs to, confusing things more.  In Linux, I don't think, by default has no "program files" type folder to install all your programs to, very annoying!!!  So now you have software spread all over the system, using disk space you can't keep track of.  Now with Red Hat, there's a thing called RPM(RedHat package manager) that will automatically install/de-install software, that's nothing new, Windows has been doing that for a while.  Let us say MSI(Microsoft Installer), it will by default, if you like, install to the program files directory, and if you don't want the program on your PC anymore,it can automatically remove the files from your computer. Whether your a programmer or not, Linux comes with tons of software that even a professional will never use.  If you do a install of Linux with everything, you can be above 4 gigs of HD space, but that is customizable.  The bottom line is, Linux is a great operating system based on Unix, with mostly the same commands, and interface, with an exception to some new tools.  The real operating system lies underneath the GUI, with a powerful DOS type interface that will let you do more than you would ever want to do in your lifetime, much more than you could ever do with DOS.  Linux however is not user friendly and is not recommended for a new user, or a amateur user, simply because everything you'll ever need is built into Windows 2000 or XP Pro.  Conclusion, if Linux were the best, Bill Gates would be out of business, and I'd be wearing a T-Shirt that says "Got Root?".  But there's a group of fanatics out there that claim Linux is the best, it can do whatever Windows does and even better.  But when all you have is time to sit in front of your PC and edit scripts, compile/rebuild kernels, and stand on street corners bashing Bill Gates, you just have too much time on your hands.  A lot of you folks have personal vendeta's against Microsoft and Bill Gates, and some of you are disillusioned and feel that they've been cheated or scammed somehow, or even lied to.  This isn't the Matrix people, come on.  Some people just have to be different, stubborn to the point where they are willing to miss out on tons of useful and fun to use software, because "Linux is better".  Not much commercial software is compatible with Linux, but there's this buggy program called "wine" that will allow the installation of some Windows programs, but....  Face it Linux people, your world isn't going to take over, Linux won't be the "end all", and I won't be hanging that poster on my wall with that ridiculous map of the Linux Kernel.  If you just want to install software, and just run the darn computer with no hassle, Windows is for you.  Windows is just about as stable now, with Windows XP and 2000 using the same stable NT kernel.  Maybe Windows doesn't stay up as long, but people are doing far more on their Windows boxes than they are on a Linux one. There's more software available for installation that can hang a system and eat up valuable system resources.  After much server experience, I noticed that NT systems are much more robust in the situation of crashes and such. You can walk up to a big Compaq server with 8 Pentium 4 processors and 16 gigs of ram with a huge Oracle database and just yank the plug.  Now, just do the usual number of waiting about 10 sec to allow the HD's to spin down, and power it back up.  when the system is almost all the way up, you'll automatically run scandisk and before you know it, customers are logged back in.  This is certainly not the case with a UNIX/Linux box, just too much sensative stuff going on under the hood that gets corrupted and lost during a hard shutdown.  I work in the IT field and see more SUN servers crash than Compaq NT's or Dells.  But if you truely want stability and uptime, you'll go with OS/390/MVS, or now known as Z/OS, but it's very expensive and requires a person with lots of patience and a good working knowledge of mainframe terminology, programming and hardware.  Uptime with these guys is measured in years, and handle most common business applications in use today.  There are no system panics, crashes, blue screens, users eating processor(not for long anyway), and file systems being filled up.  The comman misconception that mainframes are going away is a fallacy, and as a matter of fact, most servers are adopting methods and similar functions that mainframes have been using for almost 4 decades now.  Whewwww, I didn't mean to make this a computer lesson or lecture, but I just wanted to set some things straight.  Enjoy, and I hope you chose your operating system wisely.
