Anyway; she attended church last Sunday evening when I was preaching. This is very unusual for her. But even more so that when we came around tonight, she was asking many questions, about the sermon, and about Christianity in general. Dad was able to talk about what it means to be a Christian. It was very encouraging. Unfortunately in the middle of the conversation the phone rung and it was her son ringing to say happy birthday. How often does that happen when you are sharing with people or praying. Raa!
