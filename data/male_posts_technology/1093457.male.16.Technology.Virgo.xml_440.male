So Nikko, see me tomorrow and you'd better get writing! Anyway, in maths today I think Mr Blincoe was trying to suggest that we devise a method of cheating in the maths exam cos he said we need to have a signal to show what is wrong. OH dear, I really hope he wasn't serious, but he sounded as if he was. RE was ok cos we wacthed 'My Big fat Greek Wedding' which is such a funny film! None of my class seemed to get the jokes tho, I htink it was a bit wasted on them! I'm not writin gmuch cos I'm so excited about tomorrow and FRIDAY! I'm gonna just be a ball of e xcitement! If you can be that! But hey! Got to go cos I think Neighbours might be starting soon, bye!
