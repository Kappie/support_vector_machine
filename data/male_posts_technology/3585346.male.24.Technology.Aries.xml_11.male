I have not been putting in enough effort in my studies....and I keep finding excuse of working to cover it up. I SUCKS! Being professional have to start even while in studies. How professional are you in handling your studies while working. It is time for a wake up call.  I want to be extremely fantastic in what I am doing not just good.
