As if it wasn't not bad enough that it got itself  urlLink banned from New Zealand  it's now gone and committed a murder in this country. Well according to the  urlLink Daily Mail  and  urlLink Daily Mirror  anyway.  Yes it that's old chestnut again - video games make you kill people. Daft fsckers.  Mind you its such an important issue to the Mirror that they almost made it the same size as their Fantasy Football ad. And the Daily Mail's other main story today? They have 2(!) pages dedicated to  urlLink animals on the Underground . So that makes New Links like the Daily Mail but 5 months faster and without the racialism. Yay!
