I have listened to the whole CD more than once while driving around in the recently acquired minivan, and wasn't impressed. It seemed to lack the depth and dynamics I expected; I thought maybe Maynard didn't want APC to be known as The Little Tool That Could, so he kept it sullen.   Well, I brought the disc to work today, listened to it on the work system.  Analysis - It is really good. The stereo in my van is very lousy. Lousy to the point it can influence my perception of quality music. I thought maybe this was a subconscious thing, but I'm skilled in the audio wave propagation arts to the point where such a notion is far-fetched. At least I think I am. Bottom line is I gotta get some serious audio equipment in the van. I'll work on it.   Back to the CD -  First, APC is NOT tool. They lack the both-sides-of-the-spectrum sweeping dynamics that makes you (well, me anyway) think Tool is the most intense radio band ever. Also missing is the bass guitar use as more than a filler/rhythm instrument. However APC can make a song that is both muted yet moving. Their music can be quiet, yet not boring and repetitious. I'm not trying to connect the two groups, but you can't help comparing them.
