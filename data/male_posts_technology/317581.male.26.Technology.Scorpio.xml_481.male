I am going in early tomorrow so I can take off early for my weekend away.  I wonder if it's time for something new. I'm a wee bit tired, so I'm going to go to bed soon. Thus my scatter brain post. Anyway, I just wanted to make a note that we all wanted to see janet jacksons boobs and fuck those prude assholes for suing everyone. It's a fuckin boob. Half the population has em.  Anyway, we're looking for a roommate. Karla has to move out. If you're reading this and want to be an active participant you can email me and we'll see about getting you a room here :P  Peace out, my ever loving public-
