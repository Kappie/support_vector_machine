 I heard somewhere, and I need to get my fact checker working on this right away, that J.K. Rowling has gone from welfare to the richest author in the world.  I'm talking billionaire status, here.  Can you believe that?   urlLink Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone  was released in 1998.  So six years and five books later, she is now the richest author and one of I think three self-made female billionaires in the world.  And do you know how she did it?  Of course you don't, or you'd be a self-made billionaire yourself.  She did it by teasing people to death.  She creates such a buzz around her books that people can't help but get swept up in it all.  So now she's "unlocked the door" on her website, which reveals the title of her sixth book: Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.  I can't wait to see the feeding frenzy on  urlLink Amazon  once this book goes up for pre-sales.  Knowing the title is like blood in the water.  We'll see how long she holds us in anticipation...
