I don't have a fast and trying career ,where I had to break my head to stay in a company.This is what others are doing. You know what,lift operators and security gaurdsmen in my country are the only ones without any career.They just have a stagnant life,they reproduce and they die.  Since,the life of an outsourced administrator is no better.The manager here in the metlife site is forcing me to have an insurance policy.The catch, he has to sign the customer feedback form at the  end of every month.This is called harassment at work.  I get a phone call from my parents everyday,after my brief illness.Mother says it is dad who is worried about my health. First few days ,I cut up cucumber and tomatoes for salad.My brother-in-law insisted that ,I eat cooked food.When ,I started cooking potato ,I again got a call from my dad.This time was,I could get gas in my  stomach.  Still ,I am cooking potatoes.I watch a lot of T.V.Atleast a movie after coming back from work.I find it hard to start studying when working and cooking man.It is quite tough for a bacheoler.
