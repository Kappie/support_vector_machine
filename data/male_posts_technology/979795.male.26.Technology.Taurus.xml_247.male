Managed to get some pretty nifty footages too. There's only about 15 mins worth because we basically did tons of repetitions. I must admit that my bokken work has been improving a little. The daily exercises do help me really well. Even just this morning, I'm not sure how but I managed to get the feel of what Pauline Sensei mentioned before in the cutting motion. That it was pretty similar to fly fishing where the wrists will twist first. Don't know why it happened either but I got a sudden smooth feel to things and I do notice that the sword tip does fly a bit faster. Only thing I still noticed was that my shoulders seem to be locking up easily sometimes as I progress on in my cuts.  Anyway school revision has been quite tensed. What some of us are doing is that we do stupid stuff to ease the stress. Begh was on the Singapore's gymnastics team for the SEA Games a few years back. So we suddenly asked her how to do handstands. We've been trying like crazy daily. Haha... really interesting. A few knocks and falls here and there but Daniel, Justin and I do seem to be progressing. Justin seem to be able to get the most balance because he's not afraid of falling. I'm slow because I am afraid of falling too hard. Daniel seems stiff in the beginning, but at least now he seems to be able to do a cartwheel while practising the handstand. Now handstands are like a daily regime for us. We'd just do it against the wall for awhile before trying freefall. If I'm lucky I can let you guys see a 4 min footage I recorded. Annie did manage to snap some photos of us but I probably won't get to see those until after the exams.
