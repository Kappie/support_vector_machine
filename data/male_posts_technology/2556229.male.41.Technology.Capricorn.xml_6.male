They, in an effort to bolster their claims that the threat level needed to be raised, outed an alqa'ida double agent. Stupid White Men.  How are we supposed to recruit doubleagents if they are thrown to the wolves for political expedincy?   urlLink http://news.myway.com/top/article/id/369733top08-06-2004::19:06reuters.html
