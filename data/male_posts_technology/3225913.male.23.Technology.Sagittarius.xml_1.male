One of the few adverts was a scene with 2 black men in a room. One of them peering out the window. Seconds later he said to the other  "Come take a look" . They gazed out. Flashed to a next scene with both of them dashing out of the hotel into the outdoors. Snow was falling... Hope you understood and felt the what I did. Beautifully examplified.
