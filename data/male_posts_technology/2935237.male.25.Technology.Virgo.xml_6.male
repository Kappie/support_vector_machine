But being in a state of confusion or dealing with complexity, means, you are trying out something new, something different and something which you do not know whether will be a success or just a learning experience. How can assimilating something new, exploring something new, be a bad thing. No matter what the outcome, the end of confusion is always clarity. And clarity of mind is a great feeling to have. It is like having hot cup of tea on a hot summer day. When tea gets over, you feel good!!   >> Someone pointed out that I should be giving Kudos to the source of this post! It has been done !!!
