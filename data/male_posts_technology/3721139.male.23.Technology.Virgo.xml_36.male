Let's touch on Saturday real quick. I was sad on Saturday, I did nothing productive, and I just slunked around the aptartment all day long. I knew what was wrong, but I didn't fix it. Instead, I just let it fester in my mind. Then I fucking  called her , and she didn't call me back. Boy, that was dumb. Just dumb, and I knew I shouldn't have done it, but I didn't want to get off my lazy ass and fix the sadness problem.  Ok, fast forward to Sunday. I skipped church, and slept in. I considered going to Peace, but that would've just looked bad. So whatever, I ran some errands instead. Then I got a couch! and a coffee table! Actually, that may have happened on Saturday, but getting new furniture was definitely a not a Saturday thing. Whatever, they look great, and really fill out my living room. Then I went climbing ... for 6 hours.  We played games! This one game, you picked a "goal" hold, climbed to it, then removed a hold of your choice. Obviously, the jugs go first, and it takes more and more technical moves to get to the goal. Then we played a round of Add-On, with 8 people. It was the largest game of add-on I've ever played. We had people adding on their move, jumping off, running to the start, getting back to their last move, and facing 7 new moves to do. Insanity. I got to top rope, lead, and check out all the cute girls with Eric the Homophobe from the comfort of their nice couch.  Afterwards, I went to F's, met the girl that I'd been talking to who works there, and got a date. Can you see how Sunday was the good day? I drove off thinking that if the night ended right then it'd be ok. It was not to end, however, I ended up getting a call from one of the rec staffers with an invite to watch Best of Will Farrell DVDs and drink cheap wine with a bunch of people up at his place. When the Jeopardy skit came on, I nearly suffocated I was laughing so hard. "Suck it Trebek". Classic.  I slept so well.  Ok that's the end of the wrapup, but it's time for another installment of Ctae's Introspection Corner.  Basically, for the past two weeks or so, I've been talking with this girl, let's call her, Rachel. Nothing kinky, just flirting, talk, and whatnot. No need to get into it. Well, tonight I told her that it wouldn't work out between us because we're different in a couple of ways that, frankly, I don't want to have to deal with. Why do I mention this? Because it's probably the first time I've rejected someone. What normally happens is that the girl does things I don't like or can't stand, but I stay with it thinking good times will come. Then I can forget about the bad times, and move on. That never happens, if it had, I'd probably be married. For instance, with Misty, honestly, we should've broken up back in March. She's a good girl, but she wasn't meeting  my needs .  I should've ended it.  Misty and I could've been good  friends , but we're definitely not cut out to be  partners , and I knew it back in March. I'm a dumbass, however, and didn't brake or end it, I escalated it because "maybe she wants more,  and then , it'll be good times," I told myself. Dumbass. I escalated that train right into a wall. I told myself that I loved her. I believed it.  I loved her, but it was all wrong.  I was pushing things I had no honest control over. The train wreck was inevitable, I knew it, and could only hope the end was further off.  I took Misty rock climbing once. She was safe, and I pushed her to climb higher, farther. She was tired and wanted down, but I was in control (of the rope). She'd come down when I'd allow her, at the time, I wanted her to work harder, climb higher. She did for a bit, but then got pissed, and I let her down. Later, I told her that I did it to see how much she could take before she broke, but we recognized that it was ok since I was in control, and everyone was safe.  Well, in our relationship, I wasn't in control. There was no rope. I couldn't lower her down because I didn't want to admit that it wasn't ever going to work out. So I pushed her on and on until she broke. When she finally broke, so did my heart.  I took control today. I let Rachel down in a kind way. I didn't accelerate when I saw the gap in the tracks ahead. I let it go, and I'm moving on. Maybe the thing with the Fazoli's girl will work out, maybe it won't. I guess we'll see. I know exactly what I want, and, frankly, I'm not going to settle for less.
