On one hand you had 2 back woods red neck brothers driving a souped up charger running from the law screaming YEHAA!! as they drove "as the crow flies". And on the other hand you had a nomad lady killer driving a talking car with turbo boost and an ejection seat. If I was given the choice of either car it would be a very tough decision.
