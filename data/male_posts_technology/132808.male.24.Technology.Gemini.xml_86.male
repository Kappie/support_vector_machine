But let's be honest for a sec: if Calgary's offence, which had ALL of it's starters in except for Darnell McDonald, can't even score on a defence where NOT ONE regular starter even went to Calgary, much less played, I think that says less about our scouting, and more about what kind of trouble they're in in Stampeder-land.  I feel bad for Matt Dunigan, because as of right now, he's not only their coach and GM, he's also the best quarterback they've got.  The guys who really stood out for me, aside from Jon Ryan and Travis Ortega, were defensive end Tom Canada and linebacker Tony Ortiz.  Look for the Bombers to try and deal either Terry Ray or Lamar McGriggs now that Ortiz has shown he's the real deal.  We could maybe package together Stan Jackson and one of those two for a defensive end or a Canadian O-Lineman from either BC or Hamilton, where they have some quarterbacking issues.  On another note, happy belated Bees to best friend Wes Sayas.  How does two-four feel?  Same as the last three, where we predict that this is the year where "the fun has just begun"?  Yep, Nick, we STILL talk about that now-legendary jpeg.  Now that all of this hoopla with the Flames has died down, and now that they'll join Anaheim, Florida and Carolina as magical Cinderella stories that captured the hearts of millions, only to fall just short and be totally forgotten about three months later, I think it's okay for me to air my true feelings about the Flames.  I said they would make the Cup final.  I said that Calgary had the best goalie in the West in Mikka, and that Jarome was the leader they needed.  I thought that Vancouver had some holes, and that if they got past Vancouver, it was on to Detroit who was showing their age late in the season, and then probably Colorado, where I thought Mikka could outshine Aebischer.  That being said, I never really cheered for the Flames.  I was a total Jets fan in the 90's, an Oiler fan in the 80's.  And as Smythe Division rivals, there was ONLY one thing Jets and Oiler fans had in common: you both hated the Flames.  And you both hated the Canucks.  That's why I couldn't really cheer for them, cause I've been a Flames hater for like 18 of my 23 years on earth.  It's also why I don't cheer for the Moose.  Cause any player that becomes awesome becomes a Canuck.  Fuck the Canucks.
