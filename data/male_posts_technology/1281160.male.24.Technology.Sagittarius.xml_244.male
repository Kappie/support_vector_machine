HRD has told we can only bring our spouse and children for the show... None others...  But where do I get for one... ;-) Gosh, I guess I have to come alone...  It seems Kavi has got her mike and headfone. So, looking forward to some "talking" with her later today. Last day for rini in her present realm. When she's back its gonna be a different rini (I hope).  Surprisingly, I'm making steady progress reading the book "Conversations with God" that I got last week. Its more in the wavelength of my definition of God, Life and living. Really enjoying that stuff...
