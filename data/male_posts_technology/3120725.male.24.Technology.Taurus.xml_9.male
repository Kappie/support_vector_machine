The protectors of the Constitution, our Supreme Court has ruled that HMOs can now refuse you the treatment that is recommended by a doctor, you know those little bastards who only spent 10 plus years studying medicine, what the fuck do they know.  After refusing you this treatment and you almost die, as in the case of Aetna Health Inc.  v.  Davila, you now have no recourse to seek reimbursement for the damages done to your well-being, you can only try and get reimbursed for the cost of the treatment.  Jeez Jimmy, we sure are sorry that your HMO refused to pay for the heart medication, but on the positive side now your dirt poor family has one less mouth to feed.  They also stripped your right to sue in a state court, any lawsuit against HMO’s fall under ERISA.  “ERISA’s integrated enforcement mechanism, which are intended to ensure that employee benefit plan regulation is “exclusively a federal concern.”  That is directly from the opinion by Justice Clarence “Big Pimpin” Thomas.  I got one for you C.T. “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”  Suck on that, bitch!  I’d love to see the video from the hand-job party threw by the HMO lobby that got nine justices to green light HMOs to now dictate whether you live or die.  I’m guessing Ruth Ginsburg and Sandy O’Conner where tag teaming Rehnquist and Clarence “Pubic Hair” Thomas, while Scalia was giving Souter and Stevens hand-jobs in the closet, but the weird part was Steve Beyer and Tony Kennedy in the corner pouring hot wax on each others nipples while giggling.  The HMO lobby always throws the best parties. 	 Justices be proud, it takes a strong backbone to push the people aside in favor multi-billion dollar companies.  Don’t mind that pulsating chant of “Corporate-Whore” in your heads it's just your consciences try to reassert themselves.  In conclusion the United States Supreme Court can go fuck itself, Americans should always get preference over a company.
