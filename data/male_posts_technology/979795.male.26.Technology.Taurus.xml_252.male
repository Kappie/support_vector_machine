OK lah time to update people about my existence.  I just got back on the 18th morning about 4am. Immediately, I asked the cab driver to wait while I grab some stuff and went down to the Uni straightaway to check my Provisional results (may be subject to changes). I know it's a bit early but I was really nervous lah ok. My dept is accessed using ID cards so it's open to us 24 hrs anyway. When I checked my results online, I went to double check on the notice board. I got a 3rd class Honours. OK lah, to some people it's not fantastic. But to me, considering the fact I was expacting that I didn't manage to achieve my honours successfully, it was a tremendous relief. I'm seriously damn happy about it. Was really worried that the money and time spent in UK would be wasted if I didn't at least get home with a honours. granted lah, back in Singapore most people treat 3rd class the same as a normal degree but that's besides my point.  Just today, I managed to get my official results already. No different from my provisional. Still damn happy about it.  Well I did enjoy my trip to Scandinavia but it was a real experience with multiple hiccups along the way. I've managed to maintain a written journal in my notepad during my travels and I'll type it in asap. Meanwhile I only have a few days to settle some admin stuff and get my final results. I basically need to settle convocation details, accomodation for my parents, bills, handing over of the house back to the property management, packing my stuff for shipping back to S'pore, shop for some emergency items for my trek starting this Sun, air ticket, etc. Really 1 big pile of shit to do in 3 days.  By the way, I need to state for the record that the phone line in my house together with the Broadband internet will be cancelled this coming Sat on the 21st of June. So I probably won't be able to come online anytime soon. The best I can do is check my emails occasionally in Uni but that's not confirmed yet because I may be travelling around with my parents. A brief summary is found below:  Current - 21st Jun : Busy settling packing and admin. Won't be sleeping too well next 3 days.   HOUSE PHONE AND INTERNET CANCELLED.  Only contactable by mobile phone +44-77-1717-4992. Not sure of the temporary address at this point in time.  21st Jun - 8th Jul : Trekking in Lake District area all the way up to Scotland. Landscapes aren't suppose to be too difficult but the distance is going to be quite an experience for me. 8th - 14th Jul : Bumming and settling admin for parents visit to UK. 15th Jul : Parents arrive in UK. 15th - 25th Jul : With my parents. Note my convocation date is 17th Aug. So I'm probably busiest around this time. But I'm probably not contactable at all then either. 26th Jul - 2nd Aug : Visiting Stradford upon Avon (again. Sianz ...) with my folks, dunno wat on earth my parents wanna do there a 2nd time. 2nd Aug : Parents depart for Singapore. I'm on waiting list currently, so not confirmed if I can go back on this date. 2nd - 3rd Aug : If I dun fly back on the 2nd, I'll juz be buming around. 4th Aug : I've got a confirmed flight back on this date. Will depart UK latest on this date. 5th Aug : Should arrive in Singapore.
