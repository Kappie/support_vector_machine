Fifty-six hours of lectures, debates etc. in one week; which, while they’ll be no “lazy student” jokes here as they’re far too clichéd, seems to be about three-and-a-half times the quantity of the same as one could expect to be given at a “non-distance” university. This may mean I am unable to post (although  urlLink through  the  urlLink wonders  of my  urlLink mobile phone  and  urlLink those  of  urlLink Blogger  it should be possible) but I’m sure  urlLink Jim  and  urlLink Leo  will be able to come up with a piece or two either way.
