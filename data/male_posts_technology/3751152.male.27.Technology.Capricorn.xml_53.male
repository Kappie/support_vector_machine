I think it's a nice site, funny etc. but I also think it depends on a person's mood as to whether they want to invest themselves in having yet another website they have to check daily (or even hourly depending on how fast a site moves.)  I think everyone who spends significant amounts of time on the internet has their 'usual haunts' and they make the rounds quite often. It might be a forum for a favourite band, or *cough* even your favourite group blog :) Maybe throw in a few news sites, entertainment sites and even a work-related site or two. It just varies with each individual.  So what are your haunts? Show us your bookmarks :)  What does this have to do with Fark? Oh well it's just been added to my list of daily stops. I know everyone and their dog has been reading Fark for years, but better late than never eh?  So, here are my rounds, not necessarily in order:  - Saint Francis  Wellness Works - work sites.  -  urlLink Theindependent.com / urlLink Indie forums - my town's newspaper  forums -  urlLink Emotion Eric forums  - I adore Eric and the forums there are fun. I mostly lurk though. - TCZ Blog/tcz.org - duh - All my stuff - I have a bit of a network of sites of my own I check to see the stats etc. A couple of forums for my show that I run (one's busy, one isn't :), my own blog, my own site, my daughter's site etc. -  urlLink Television Without Pity  - Forums for a slew of shows on all networks. The Snarkiness never ends. - FOX 24 forums - where I find news and updates on the show and cast. - Dark Horizons,  urlLink Ain't it Cool  (shut up Fire) and  urlLink Zap2It - Movie news, and I only read Harry's site for movie updates, I swear :) -  urlLink IMDB  - I go here quite a lot looking up movie info and reading the entertainment news and stuff. -  urlLink The Cynic  - Seminole's blog. He doesn't update it often enough tho and when he's not carrying on about sports, there's funny stuff to be found here :) - Yahoo for my news needs - I like it because I can pick and choose the headline stories I want to read. I have UK  Ireland news, world news, and of course, entertainment news. I usually head for this stuff during my lunch hour at work.  - Fark - already mentioned it :) - Online banking/email etc - boring stuff. When I'm feeling too happy I go look at my bank account. -  urlLink Snopes  - I loved bursting my boss' bubble when she sends me the Allstate Warning email. Thanks Snopes! - Gmail - Woot! Google rocks my socks.  That's about it really. So when I'm idle on TCZ, I'm probably making my rounds :)
