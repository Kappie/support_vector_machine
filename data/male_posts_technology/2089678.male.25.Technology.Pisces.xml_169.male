It covers filenames, file organization, indentation, comments, declarations, statements, white space, naming conventions, programming practices and includes a code example.   Why have code conventions? Code conventions are important to programmers for a number of reasons:  80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance.  Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the original author.  Code conventions improve the readability of the software, allowing engineers to understand new code more quickly and thoroughly.  The Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language document was revised and updated on April 20, 1999.  PDF download also available.
