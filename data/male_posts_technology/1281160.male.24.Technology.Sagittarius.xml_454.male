Actually my senior had returned from Training today and so we had to finish off the work on friday and so couldnt blog any.   btw, this weekend bought a brand new Whirlpool fridge, 220litre, grey(almost looks like white) color, double door refrigerator. Need to learn to do ice creams. So bloggers, send me recipe of icecreams asap. And ya Ram had called me up, but couldnt even invite him to my place for my policy of planning to invite only when learnt cooking properly. So i am still under learning phase and dont want to trouble u guys with all those mishap cooks.  Hei guys @ TN, throw some light on Rain water harvesting. I heard that our CM has put a strict order in all corporation bound areas to have RWH setup. Is it so? I really am feeling happy. good that atleast now she has taken steps before it becomes too late. I like this. Remember few blogs away we were talking about environmental protection and we wanted people to encourage rainwater harvesting and now its becoming real is something good!  Ok then got some work and will get back to u all later
