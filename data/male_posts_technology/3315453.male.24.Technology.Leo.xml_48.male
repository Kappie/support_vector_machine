I know some of you are probably laughing at that and thinking that it would be nice to be that hot. However, we here in Seattle do not like the sun. What makes things worse is that we live on the 6th floor and have no air conditioning. All we have is a small fan. Becca just checked the thermometer in the house and it is 93 degrees in here. We have the lights out and are afraid to watch any T.V. because itmight put out too much heat. Anyways enough complaining for now I have to go to work soon. By 6:00pm my clothes will be completely soaked with sweat in the100+ degree trucks. I drink tons of water there yet never have to go to the bathroom because I sweat it all out.  If anyone has any tricks to keep the house cool let us know :)
