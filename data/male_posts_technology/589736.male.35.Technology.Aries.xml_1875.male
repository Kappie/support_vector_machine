Really, how much skill does it take to talk out of both sides of your mouth like most politicians do?  To quote James Carville (Clinton's attack dog), "It's the economy, stupid."  If people are feeling confident in their wallets, the incumbent generally has no problems.  Ben - So we should not have tracked him down, left the country, and let him resume control?  Reports on the news are that most of the attacks are being carried out by Hussein loyalists, Al Queda, or jihadists, not the normal citizens who were brutalized by Hussein.  I have not seen any smug comments for the Republicans, only satisfaction from the military commanders.  That's not to say there won't be, but I have not seen any yet.  As far as WMD, at this point I don't think anyone thinks they will be found.  We can debate from here to eternity about whether or not they ever existed, whether they were smuggled out of the country before the invasion, and whether we were intentionally misled by the President, or if he was misinformed by the intelligence aparatus.  We don't know and probably never will know the certain truth.  You'll believe what you want and I'll believe what I want.
