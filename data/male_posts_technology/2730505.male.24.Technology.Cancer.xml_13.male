It usually takes me 25 mins to get to work driving around in the suburbs to get to another suburb to work.  No major expressways to hop on to nothing like that.  Just main streets and busy road that are supposed to be fucking plowed so that people wouldn't be driving so damn slow.  Well it was still shitty.  It took me 50 mins to get from my house and drive 10 normally short ass miles.  I was more than relaxed though a little annoyed that it was moving so damn slow.  I sympathize for the people that actually had to take the expressways and wait two even three hours to get downtown to go to their place of employment.  That just blows.  I gotta admit though that it was fun pulling the e-brake around turns and having the ass end of this P.O.S. rental get loose and go sideways for a little while and then straighten out and continue driving.  Of course I don't do it when there are other cars around for fear of a lawsuit if I do hit another car.  Snow drifting baby!!!    Last night I had beer for dinner.  That probably is the cause for me being so damn tired this morning, not to mention hungry.  I can't wait for lunch so I can go to the local McDonald's for a number 3 with a  root beer or Dominick's for a Sushi platter and a slice of pizza.  My dad ate my lunch last night.  I was pretty bummed this morning about that.    On other news.  What about the next Ben Stiller movie titled "Meet The Fockers"?  Even though the first installment was kinda stupid, it was still very entertaining.  Now they bring in another big star to play the role of Gaylord's parents in Dustin Hoffman.  I don't know how that will go because he is a pretty serious actor.  It would be a nice change to see him play something outside of his role (kinda like what Robin Williams did in Death to Smoochy, very different from his normal comedic or good for the family oriented roles).  I do agree with  urlLink this  article that Ben's real parents should play the roles.  Not exactly sure who Anne Meara is but I do know Jerry Stiller and George's dad in Seinfeld.  that would be perfect!  In any event, I'm sure Dustin Hoffman will be a good job and play the role pretty well and I do look forward to watching the movie.  I just hope that it can be a good sequel to a funny movie.  Yeah Ted, I really couldn't care less if Friends went off the air.  I think I watched it for a total of 7 episodes.  There was really nothing else to watch for the last two times I did see it.  I did like to watch it when it was still in it's early days.  Right now though, I don't think I could even give two shits if it stayed on air or not.  It's definitely past it's "use by date"
