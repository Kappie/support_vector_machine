It was just another day, doing the daily chores ... doing this - doing that, solving a problem, browsing, talking, eating, driving etc etc.  half our life time goes sleeping, another half split between adoloscence and aged and whatever rest we are left out with we freak out, play, argue, enjoy and do what not!!!  but, whats that difference am i making here? am i a part of this ant colony, just another worker ant, doing its routine - if only to a larger extent?  that's a kind of thought, which goes undigested. mmmm.  each one of us can make a difference to the world around us... yes and i want to something! but where do i start? and in what way? I certainly don't want to do something for the sake of making a difference but  for what it is, wholeheartedly!  Thousand ideas, thousand thoughts go zooming past - but i need action. i need focus. i need more patience. i need to do something more ... to find that missing link!  let me see - try to sort out the spaghetti of unceasing thoughts, just atleast to find a focus - to square on something that would make me feel better in this aspect.  food for thought, challenges to the will.
