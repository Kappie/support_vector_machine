And I am on the 8th floor. Really pity those who live on the first few floors. With our advances in technology you would think they would have figured out how to make those damm drills quieter, i mean they did figure out how to make guns quieter didnt they.  Checked out a few songs from the White Stripes's new album, Elephant, and they sound really amazing I'm definitely gonna get the album as soon as I get my pay!  OK I think I better go do the laundry now and wash the dishes.
