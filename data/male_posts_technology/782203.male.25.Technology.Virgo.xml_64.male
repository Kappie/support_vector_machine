But i got no choice gotta go for it, beggars can't be choosers rite. So if i get it i will be earning 1k less than my friends in NCS...Life so fucking sucks doesn't it !   Other than that a really boring day, watched another ep of six feet under today and the first ep of sex and the city. ( i thought it was sex in the city ). And got this really bad headache that has been going on for 2 whole days, hope it disappears soon enuff; feels like someone drilling a screw into my brain.
