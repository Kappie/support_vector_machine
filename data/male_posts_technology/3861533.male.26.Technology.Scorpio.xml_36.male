Nothing much happens in this film - a deaf and mute boy starts surfing while his equally deaf and mute girlfriend watches. Because of their condition there is very little spoken dialogue in the film.  The contents could have been compressed into 20 minutes which would have made for a more poignant film. Instead there are a lot scenes where people are walking from one place to another or watching people surf. I'm sure that was what the director intended, but it's just not for me. -->
