Kevin Mitnick, hacker  par excellence , recently came out of federal probation and started a new security consulting company called,  urlLink Defensive Thinking . Twice in the last two weeks, hackers/vandals have managed to hack into the website of Mitnick's company.  The latest breach was by a hacker from Texas who said he hacked into Mitnick's site because he wanted to be hired as Mitnick's security officer.  In the earlier breach, a hacker calling themselves Bugbear simply added a page to the website saying; "welcome back to freedom mr.kevin ;)".   In both instances, the hackers took advantage of a flaw in Microsoft's popular Internet Information Server (IIS) to break into the web server.  Golly!! hearing this... I am wondering how many customers  urlLink Defensive Thinking  is going to get!!
