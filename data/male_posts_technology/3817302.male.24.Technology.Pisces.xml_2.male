What of the people with the scailed skin? the Zentarim? the mysterious artifact network? why has a once kindly elven wizard become a recluse and quick to anger? Why would powerful barbarians and wizards place them selves under the service of a simple merchant like Galimar? Was Galimar even the one being served?   All these are qestions the wait to be answered. And this is where you come in. What parts of Faerun do you wish to visit? Are thier treasures you wish to seek? Glory you wish to find? Wealth you wish to obtain? Comment and let me know.  And remember, the more character history you give me, the more I may work it into the story.
