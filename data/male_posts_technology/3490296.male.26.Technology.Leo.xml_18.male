Why?! I doubt i was this brain active everyday for the past 1 week, even if i was working previously with bigger system environment. It doesn't make sense? Well, its easier to work with computer than in an environment filled with ladies.. And because they are mostly females, i need to think before i say anything, coz' its not wise to offend female at ur workplace.. You will only end up with one pathetic end,   and probably my career will be ruined too.  I was pleased recently.. Just 1st day of work at 77th street, i was head hunted by another company to do a bank migration project, with better pay. But, since i had signed the contract with 77th street, i thought, its only the responsible part of me to stay and do what is required. On the 2nd day of work, i was head hunted again, this time, a Norway MNC that wants me to be their software consultant for some products they are selling, a MNC exposure coz im required to go regional. Again, i rejected them citing areas of responsibilities. Today, i'm head hunted again, by the software company doing 77th street's maintenance, however after some serious consideration, i thought it would be responsible of me to only accept them if they still have openings later, when i finished whats required of me @ 77th street. My mother chided me for being dumb coz all 3 companies offers me greater exposure and better pay, morever, 77th street might not appreciate what i do for them. She is right in some areas, but i thought, if i can't be responsible to my work, i will not be able to assume responsibilities in relationships and most importantly of all, to God.   You see, the weird thing about me is that, whenever i'm troubled by something, God never fail to bless me from above, and he will give me so much that spoils me with choices. I know he dotes me, yet at the same time, i felt that this is something of a test to train me to be contented with what i have because contentment is the key to happiness.   Just 1 week in the company, i had gathered and obtained information about the culture, the gossips as well as the conflicts laying around the areas. You might be wondering how i manage to find out so much? I dun know myself too, but a lot of times, when you are quiet and reserved, people tend to talk to you more and feed you with more information that you actually ask. Nope, i'm not quite a quiet person, but i find no need for me to be chatty in the office esp when this is a female working environment. If this is like what is happening in my previous job, Yes! it would be outrageously fun!   Oh well, time to go sleep. I have to work tomorrow... Oh ya, the good news of all the head hunting stuff is, the Norway MNC is keeping my CVs and resume for a readily position, should i quit 77th street and wants regional exposure, they would offer me a position immediately. I do not know true is this, coz this is certainly too good to resist it. Meanwhile, i will also do my best in the company, since this is going to be another masterpiece of my work.   I am an artist and i take pride in my system projects.   Seeya, Hap..  DJ
