How can they even decide on TOBI's fate when they haven't seen what he can do? Even Marcus makes the decision blindly. With all my heart I love the boy, but he is no programmer. He wouldn't know TOBI's capabilities if TOBI were able to walk up and smack him over the head. From his reaction, I would guess that there is no way for me to convince him. He's made up his mind and he'll follow through to whatever end he regards as best. He always has been stubborn like that. If only Jude or Marty one would have survived. They would have been able to convince him.  I can't believe how much finger pointing is going on. Someone actually accused me today of killing the boys. I can't believe that people would do that. How can they even think that? Uninformed decisions, assumptions...that is not the world that I'm from. Rather presumptuous...wretched....and downright hurtful. I hope none of these people ever talk to Virginia....it would break her heart.  I'm leaving Wednesday night to return to Amboy. I hope to find something that Marty left behind as a clue. He was such a prankster that he might've left us something unintentionally even. I hope so and I also hope that Ms. Heller will be willing to help. She seems at least to have an open mind about what TOBI can do, and haven't I always said, that's all that it takes.
