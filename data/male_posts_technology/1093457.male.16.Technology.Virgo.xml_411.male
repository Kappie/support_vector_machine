I got health and Eduaction, i would say they were the best 2, cause environment is well hard and so is youth culture ans future plans. Well my next exam is PE so i really have to revise a lot for that, i want to get an A and i know that i can get it if i try really hard. I would say it is my best subject so fingers crossed. Does anyone want to come Job hunting with me? I want to go into croydon some time next week and have a look. Well thats it from me.
