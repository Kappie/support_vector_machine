I pulled up every weed, whacked down every tall blade of grass, and even tilled the soil in the garden by hand so that we can plant some attractive plants there once we have money.  It was dirty, sweaty work, and my hands and back are still sore hours later, but it was worth it.  The yard looks great.    There is still work to be done out there, but the appearance has changed enough that I don't need to worry about complaints anymore.  It's my own green thumb that will keep me occupied now, rather than the bitchery of others.  I actually want to get some stuff growing out front as soon as I can.  I haven't done any gardening in more than a decade, and I guess I missed it more than I thought.  There are a couple of plants out there now that I didn't want to pull up because they were obviously "garden" plants and not weeds, but they're kind of ugly.  I'll probably wind up pulling them this weekend.    I splurged and bought myself dinner from a restaurant to reward myself for all the hard work.  I also managed to sit down and play a couple of hours worth of video games as well.  All in all, this was a pretty good day off.
