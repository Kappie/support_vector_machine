He had already opened presents from his grand parents (whom, oddly enough, he calls Mama and Papa.  Yeah...) and from Jenny.  I got there and we started playing with his "track."  It was cute.  He has a billion different  urlLink Hot Wheels   which was cool.  I got him a bunch of the tuner models to put a little flavor into it.  We then played with his fire engine with the ladder that went up and down.  He liked that a lot.  The he wanted to get tossed in the air and then caught.  He would get a running start and run towards me at full tilt and I would catch him and toss him in the air and catch him close to the ground so that he would have a little longer "falling" feeling.  He got a lot of laughs with that.  I was getting tired though.  He's getting big.  Jenny got him a cute little robe.  Just right for him and it will probably last him a year or so.  He got a nice little updated version of the Radio Flyer tricycle but it was branded Hot Wheels.  It was cool.  It even had shocks for the seat.  Fancy schmansy little thing.  He also got this Simba doll that talked back to you and -tried- to have a conversation.  It would ask "what do you want to be when you grow up?" I would say "I want to be a pimp (or something retarded like that) it would say back "That's a great idea!"  Yeah but it was cool, if you squeezed it's ears it would sing and dance (wag it's tail and shake it's head), I guess that is dancing for dolls.  So it was time for him to open my present.  It was nothing really big and I cheated by having him pick it out at the store the day before.  It was this car that would go forward and then backwards back to where it started and it also had a couple of songs that he liked and calls "noise"  He played with that for a long time.  The battery was almost dying when I left to go back home.  It was cute.  I feel bad for the other gifts but hey, "I'm really sorry."  It was awesome, other people would come and he would open those gifts, play with them for 5 minutes and go back to playing with the car.  It was gratifying to see that.    He still knows who I am.  I walked to the car when he and his Gramma got back from a quick errand and he stepped out of the car and looked at me and said "Daddy!"  That just made me smile.  He still knew me.   Sam in Iowa  Sam is still Sam.  Got to his house Saturday.  Dicked around for a little while drank a few beers (the other case that was there) and played some video games.  Met his friend Moe.  He's cool.  Seems like a good kid.  We waited for a call from some people to go to a party.  It was more of a hangout/get together.  It was still fun.  One of the favorite characters there was this girl named Danielle.  Her nickname was Cum Shot.  Yeah, that was messed up.  Went to the basement and there was a lot of country being played it was painful.  Drank more beer there.  I think this was where we started on the other case.  Oh yeah, why the hell does Iowa like Bud Lite?  UGH!!!!  I, myself am more of a Orange Whip (Miller Lite) drinker.  Eh whatever.  It was there I drank and enjoyed nonetheless.  It did give me gas though.  Bad gas.  Maybe it was caused by the easy bake thing.  I dunno.  We went to Hy-Vee for some breakfast.  Eggs, bacon, sausage.  It was good.  Spicy sausage with barbecue sauce on top.  Mmmm.  It was good.  Oh yeah I also busted out the video camera and filmed what we did on Sunday night.  It was bad.  We were real bored.  We tried to do a little Photoshop Tennis (as Meghan put it) but it was more of a collective effort.  We altered a picture of this girl and had fun doing it.  We then started playing Super Mario Brothers (the first one) on his PC.  It was cool except the controls were a little difficult to get used to.  I then had the "great" idea of mapping the buttons accordingly so that when I held the keyboard up it would seem that I was holding a regular controller.  That made things easier for Mario 1 as well as Street Fighter.  Then this chick came over.  Big girl, she was also a little pissy at the world.  Anyways, she got there stood up for a while and then proceeded to lay down on Sam's bed and fall asleep there.  Yeah, apparently this is a regular occurrence whenever she comes over and he has to boot her ass at 5:30 in the morning.  Bummer, not my problem.   Now for me to be cheesy.  I was actually thinking of you on my way up to Waterloo Monday thinking if I should call you or not.  I didn't have signal so I couldn't.  When I finally got signal I was surprised to see that I had a voicemail.  I was thinking it was from Jenny seeing where the hell I was and why I was late, but it was from you.  That put a smile on my face.  Thanks for calling.  I missed you.  I got pretty tired from last night's "talks" myself and had a nice sleep.  Thanks for talking to me during my lonely drive.  It prevented me from getting bored and falling asleep at the wheel.  3 Days sweetie.
