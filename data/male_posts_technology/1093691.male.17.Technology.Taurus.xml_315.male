Really i need some little person at my side to come up to me and go : Rivise you little scoundle u, or i will rip your head off and flush it down the loo! I think that way i would sit down and do some revision. But my problem is i find it so god damn boring! Id rather sit outside and burn my eyes out than revise !  The reason i dont come on during the day is because it costs a bomb if you dont have broadband, which idont have so therefore it means i cant come on during the day. I have only just realside that because it is a bank holiday today i could have come on earlier because it is cheap! But neva mind at least i am on half an hour earlier than usual.  I went down the park today with a couple of friends but it woz sooooooooo boring that we ended up coming back early ( i mean like we were down the park for less than an hour ) That dobbins hill really does your legs in even if you are used to going up it ! I think in toal i stopped like 20 times because i got knackered after going up like 3 steps. Nicki isnt coming on here today or tonight because she is up in Manchester i think and is seeing another Ronan concert with her mutter. Tom is on holiday in the Lake districk (I think) with Andy Pandy. Max is with his lovely girlfriend Nic at this moment in time so is probably too busy to deal with blogging! LOL ( they make a really good couple ) I have nothing else planned for the holidays although i want to go and see Jhonny English, hopefully dat will happen and i also have that Europa trip to look forward to on the extra day we have off. Oh what joys, I am begining to think it was a bad idea becuase you dont get to choose who you go with in a group, you just get shoved in a group as you go through "Customs". Which means i could end up with David Andrews or even Joanna. Ahhhhhhhh. Only kidding Jo ! I am dreading the french speaking cause i cant even understand what the teacher goes on about in english let alone what she is saying in french ! But hopefully i will get half decent grades in the other bits to give me a decent grade overall. You must be bored by reading this by now so i will leave you to blog for yourself or to ignore everything i have just writen ! hehe bye
