But then, something was missing. I wanted a free space where I could express my opinions without anybody's interference, and listen others' opinion on them. I first thought of writing a book. But then my work does not give me enough time to go back home and write a book. Or maybe it may, if I manage my time efficiently. But then, I came across this thing called Weblog. Although I had known about this earlier, I had never actually created one of my own. So here I am with my first blog. I hope that the topics that I take up might help you also to start thinking. That is my aim.  Have a nice time reading !  regards, Rajasekhar
