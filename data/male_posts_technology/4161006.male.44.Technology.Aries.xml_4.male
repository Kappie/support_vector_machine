Well, I came up with this idea. I learned how to sing and play "When Johnny Comes Marching Home". I played it in A minor. I wanted to serenade to the haunted spirits that roam the fields and woods of Gettysburg. Some people think I'm crazy. I am just trying to live to its fullest and howl at the moon.  Well, we got to Devil's Den at 9:40 pm. We started walking around. My pack was taking pics. My camera is at my ex wife's and I'll probably never see it again. We felt the spirits all around us. We walked to the Triangular Field and I started singing lightly (without guitar). At the top left corner of the Triangular Field, I started feeling a cold spot, then it got hot. My chest felt like it was getting squeezed and electricity was running through my veins. We walked into the field and the feeling left. We ran into a couple from Illinois taking pics. We could see orbs from the flashes. The lady told us last time she was there, something pushed her from behind real hard, though no one was there. It left a mark on her back.  We left the Triangular Field and headed back to Devil's Den. Everyone was leaving. It was 10:00 and the park closes at 10. I wanted to play my guitar. We went back to the truck, and I pulled out my guitar and sat on the wall facing the Slaughter Pen in front of Plum Run. I started playing and singing "When Johnny Comes Marching Home". I learned to play it nice and slow, giving it a creepy, eerie, haunted sound. About halfway through the song, I heard a woman singing with me in front of me. At first, I thought it was our pack female, but she doesn't sing. Then I heard more voices singing both in front of me and behind me. When I finished, I said to Margie, "were you singing? Somebody was singing!" She said no, but she heard a whole bunch of   people singing and it wasn't coming from our pack! She told me to play it again. I played it again and I had a haunted chorus join me. My whole body felt like it had electricity running thru it and was surrounded by some kind of energy field. Marg was trying to figure out if the voices we heard were just some kind of echo playing tricks on us. But the singing was on time with me, with no delay, and I could differentiate between a female voice and several other deep male voices.  I played it a total of 5 times. I had to stop because I was shaking so bad, and was also worried about the park cop showing up and giving us a ticket. My body felt like it was being pressurized and running with electricity. I could barely walk. I thanked whoever was out there for singing with me. I was in shock!  I said maybe some people were on top of Devil's Den and their car is parked behind it. We drove around Devil's Den and there were no cars anywhere. We had the whole area to ourselves. This was wednesday, and I still have that feeling 4 days later like I am surrounded by an energy field and something is squeezing my chest. This is freaking me out.  A former pack member of mine lives down in Florida. He's a musician, too.  urlLink http://www.johnnysquest.com/  I sent him one of my poems and he put music to it. It was cool. Well, here's the email that I sent him describing how I came up with another poem, and the poem itself.   John, I'm starting to scare myself. I can't get rid of this weird feeling, like I'm electrified or something. Like there's an energy field surrounding me. This all started when I was singing and playing at Devil's Den and I can't get rid of this feeling. Creepy. Speaking of creepy, I came up with this poem, mixing the experience of that night, along with some civil war stuff and you coming home. You are Johnny, and so is a civil war soldier, (When Johnny comes marching home) You and "Johnny" are yankees who joined (or moved to) the south. Emily was a real rebel female soldier during the civil war. Her family lived up north. She died after being shot in battle. Nobody knows her last name. She asked for someone to deliver a message to her dad to "Forgive your dying Daughter" just before she died. Rock Creek is a creek at Gettysburg where they setup a field hospital in the woods at Rock Creek where many soldiers died. Devil's Den is the haunted place at Gettysburg where I sang with the ghosts "When Johnnie comes marching home". This whole thing is creeping me out. Well, here is.       Coming Home   Johnny when you coming home It's been so long ago Since last time I saw you  Johnny when you coming home Our hometown rebel foe we're still waiting for you  Johnny when you coming home Emily's been shot dead Forgive your dying Daughter  Johnny when you coming home Rock Creek is running red Tainted by the slaughter  Spirits were singing At Devil's Den Wanting to know When you're coming home  Haunted rocks ringing At Devil's Den Echoes of glory For you're coming home  Johnny when you coming home   Well, that about sums up my most recent trip to Gettysburg. I shall return...
