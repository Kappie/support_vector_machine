Didn't "Elton John" and others call the voting "racist" and somehow rigged (puzzling allegations from a British poof that have a philosophical/sociological underpinnings too busy to deal with now)?  It reminds me of this quote from the indispensable Gene Collier:  "Do you ever get the feeling that waiting around for the Continental Tire Bowl to start is something like that dream where Michael Jackson is following you around the Giant Beagle with his shopping cart piled high with Mexican scallions and, when you both get to the check out, Jacko asks to borrow your Advantage Card? And you tell him you forgot yours and he says you wouldn't say that to a white man and you say, 'I just did.'"  I expect Reginald Dwight to make a public apology to all of us God fearing Americans for his slanderous musings.  I also expect American Idol to GO AWAY already.  No one cares.
