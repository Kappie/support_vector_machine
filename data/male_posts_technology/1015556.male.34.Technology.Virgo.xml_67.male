(It's a slow night covering a production release...)  =====  urlLink Here  is a very interesting article about a former Playboy playmate doing incredible community development work in Haiti.    A few things got my attention: - that she specifically went to the worst of the slums. - it seems like she is not just throwing short term solutions but looking at long term methods (ie not just feeding them but teaching them how to feed themselves...) - 16,000 children on $13,500 a month.  wow.   - look at how she handles the finances, low to zero overhead  ===== A free DVD on missions, the IMB International Missions Emphasis 2003.  Order it for free  urlLink here   Very nice, could be a very good resource for discussing with people. ===== Being a tentmaker and rebuilding Afghanistan  urlLink here    - only 21% of women and 51% of men can read - 40% of university professors are homeless - "If tentmakers never open their mouths, I think that's deceptive. If I simply only use my credentials as an agenda to get me in, so I can start preaching to people, that's false. I don't live two lives. I'm a Christian with five degrees."  ===== Reaching out to prostitutes in Vancouver  urlLink here
