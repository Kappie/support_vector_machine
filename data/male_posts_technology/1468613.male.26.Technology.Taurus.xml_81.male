Gede, my darling boy, I think Kaia may have already linked to this but  urlLink right here  is a picture of her and her new glasses drunkenly feeding Twisties to a rock so, as the title suggests, that they may grow.  Like mother, like daughter. Even in their hour of drunk thinking of the environment. Bless.  Also - I made over urlLink  A Little Distraction . Why don't you check it out and comment on the new layout. Or, you know, ignore me! It's all good!  Four days until the First and Last McLachlan St Cocktail Party. Don't worry, Gede, I'll take so many photos you'll feel like you were there and, also, Kai, James and I will pull our usualy trick of drinking to our absent friend every five minutes. Come to think of it you might be the reason we keep getting drunk. "Must drink to Gede....one......more....time....... Absent friend! Glahrrrgh...."
