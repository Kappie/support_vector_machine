I mean, Lexington is alright but I wanna get away from everything that is here ya know??? so, trying to find new jobs or something else I can do. I can program in C++ and learning perl and I have been working on computers for almost a decade now...  I just wanna get away ya know....  to get away....   help me to get free from this place I despise...   why you ask? why despise a place that loves everything about you because I have been here way too long too many memories bad memories. memories that keep haunting my daydreams... memories that haunt my night terrors...   memories that haunt my everyday life because  memories, are all around me.... memories...  memories...  need new ones forget the old ones.... memories, let them die....  R.I.P....
