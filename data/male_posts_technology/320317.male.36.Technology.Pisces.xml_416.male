 The big concern is backward compatibility. The XHTML 2.0 working draft forces you to move all your HTML to XHTML. The W3C  postion is if we are moving the web to XML then we  have to make the move . However, I can't imagine IE 7.0, or any new version of a major browser not supporting HTML 4.x, not to mention all of the developer tools currently in the marketplace.
