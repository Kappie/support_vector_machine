Between president bush and Saddam Hussein ... Hussein is the bad guy.  2. If you have faith in the United Nations to do the right thing keep  this in mind, they have Libya heading the committee on human rights and Iraq  heading the global disarmament committee. Do your own math here  3. If you use google search and type in "French military victories,"  your reply will be "did you mean French military defeats?"  4. If your only anti-war slogan is "no war for oil," sue your school  district for allowing you to slip through the cracks and robbing you of the  education you deserve.  5. Saddam and bin laden will not seek United Nations approval before  they try to kill us.  ... 7. Even if you are anti-war, you are still an "infidel!" and bin laden  wants you dead, too.  ... 10. Whether you are for military action or against it, our young men  and women overseas are fighting for us to defend our right to speak out. We  all need to support them without reservation.
