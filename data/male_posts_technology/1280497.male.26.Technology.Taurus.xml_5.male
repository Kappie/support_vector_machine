I wonder how it must have been for Mandelshtam, for Tsvetaeva, for Shalamov, to deal with knowing that what you have so carefully protected over the course of your life (be it protection provided by yourself or by your close ones) might be destroyed tomorrow, or that you might always have it around, but that you'll never succeed in getting it published.  So much stood in their way to having the kind of exposure they now have, and how did they deal with that?  And that brings up the personal side of the question: how do I muster the faith to write when I have zero guarantee that anyone will read it, much less get it published?  You might be saying, "Fool, you must purify your intentions for the writing itself, and that will eliminate the need to have other people read it."  I've thought of that, and I can't see myself progressing to that point any time soon.  But maybe that's what happened with the people who had to really endure before what they wrote was ever read.  Maybe Emily Dickenson really didn't care if anybody ever read her poems, and that she was just glad to have the creative juices flowing on a regular basis.  On a side note, after every thought I have, I feel like I should be putting in a link to something I read that would show you why I'm having these questions.  The problem is, my brain is not yet attached to the Internet in a way that would allow you to link to it.  Unless...
