Some organization called "The American Family Association" sent me a request to be polled, so I did.  It was a presidential poll, with John Kerry, Ralph Nader, and the Great Pretender on the list of possibilities.  So, naturally, I responded with John Kerry as I plan to vote for him and get the Shrub out of office.  After the poll was over, I got the results thus far.    John Kerry:  90.05% George Bush:  3.64% Ralph Nader:  6.32%  Smiling, I thought "You know, I don't even know who the American Family Association is."  So I checked out their website... they're a right-wing freak-job bunch - with issues on their site like "The Homosexual Agenda" and "Church In America."   I hope they look at these results they're getting and cry like babies.
