They elaborated what were their requirements, why did they chose SAP, how did they go about the implementation, what all they implemented, what all they need to do within the organization to adopt to SAP software, what did they benefit and finally what did they learn.  it was interesting to see them echo something i always believed, businesses need to look at software as an enabler, so they should first be clear on their business objectives and realize that they need to change to adopt to the changing environment. once they do that they can look at software to help them become more versatile, flexible and efficient...but they cant think that buying software would solve all their problems...another interesting aspect was how all of these companies adopted a change management strategies...everyone from private to public sector companies realized the concerns their employees may have and went about in a very employee friendly manner to make them get comfortable with it...success of a software implementation depends a lot on the people who finally are going to use and if they are not convinced about it, company will not benefit. Moreover having policies in place and involvement of senior management only helps to reteriate the commitment of the company towards employees and efficient management....   once back to my real life i had to struggle with pending work...still trying to complete it on time...but still in this i manage to watch an interesting play...some found it ordinary some found it too pseudo...but it made me reflect on one critical aspect...the play was about a guy who is software professional and a girl who is call center executive...how they are going about their daily life...what is their life like...both of them have one common thread...the girl's bf is guy's room mate...the set of the play was simple with just a box made as a sitting...they used video screen in the background to providing the settting for the play...  i could really relate to a lot of incidents in the guy's life...like not seeing ur room mate for days...just talking on phone to him even though staying in the same house...innundated with calls from people selling anything and everything...staying up late in office and being alone on the entire floor...these are some of the things made me reflect on my past...something i hardly do these days...getting back to the play...the twist happens when this guy who is link between the 2 dies....both of the come together and meet...then another twist happens when the guy is without work and girl is fired...so they have nothing to do and only each other go give company...they never had such free time and hence dont know what to do with it...they get more comfortable with each and fall in love...and thats when the play ends...  offcourse i forgot to mention about profanity used during the entire duration of the play, some of the people found that a little too much saying that they dont know if people spoke like that...but then didnt we use these when we were in college and even when we started working...we seem to think when we are little older and things dont happen a particular way but it may exactly they way people talk today...it would have been interesting to get a perspective from someone younger...  its a simple story nothing great...the guy was good...and girl was good looking but ok...but what was good to for me to see some shades of my past inacted infront of me...in one scene the guy is all alone on the whole floor of his office and screams that he wants to be free....thats is a scene that has been with since then...today i am obsessed with my freedom, may be this is because of my past being like that guy depicted...may be thats where this desire for freedom comes from...offcourse this may not be the only reason...but i know atleast one reason for it...  its quite amazing how work influences our personal thoughts and belief...hence more reason to work in a place where u can enjoy and grow positively...i realised another thing today...its more of a question....  "why is that i measure myself with something i am not doing or i am not able to do and not with things i am doing and i am able to do"  is it true for everyone around me? dont know but one has to stay positive its the only way one could stay happy...
