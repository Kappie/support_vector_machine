The town I live in...Hinckley....has lots of wiproites, TCS and Infosys...most of them are North Indians and Telugu's.... I was really fed up of talking to them in English with their accent....One fine day I came to know that a tamilian is residing in a nearby place.....that too from madurai......i cudnt resist the temptation to meet her....imdtly I started off to find her house.....didnt even wait for someone to make an introduction.......I barged into her house...hoping to talk in tamil...hear the words im so comfortable in......she greeted me with " hey...where u from??, ooh...from MADRAI!.....U KNOW, I SEE.....".....but the irony is i kept replying her in tamil........atlast she uttered some tamil words...just bcos i was so adamant abt talking in tamil.....i returned home with disappointment and agony!  Now...im plunging into the topic as well....Tamil is our mother tongue...but how many are proud of being a tamilian.....not many.. i am sure there are people out there who think that talking in tamil in a public place or with friends, as a disgrace.....an image spoiler....it has got more or less to do with our obsession for foreign languages.....the problem lies within us....as Xavier said....with our mindset....this has to change.....the future generations should be moulded to give respect for tamil.....at the same time compatible with other cultures and languages as well...  bye.
