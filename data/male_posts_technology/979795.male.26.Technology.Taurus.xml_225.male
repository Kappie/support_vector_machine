Anyway, let me just continue while I wait for my singlet to dry.  Wooooo  urlLink some people  reading technical stuff huh. FAQ somemore. Just telling me to get into a book will put me to sleep. In fact, just thinking about it, makes .... me .... a. .....   ... little ....... zzzzzzZZZZZZZZ .....   ...  This morning was supposed to go Chinese Quaters to 'yum cha' and have some Dim Sum with my housemates. But after buying groceries, I just felt really lazy to leave the house. When those that did go returned, I wished I went as well. WINTER SALE!!! Argh, David bought a nice 30ltr backpack, quite cheaply too. Hmmm ... maybe I'll go next Sat or something. Just hope the sale is still going to be on. I'm so used to being around Uni and home that it slipped my mind about winter sale season.  Feels kinda weird not training Aikido last week. By the way, I simply do not understand the  urlLink slamming exercise  you were referring to. Maybe I'll do act it out in front of my PC when I'm more free. About moving angmohs, well my Sensei (being of small built) really have no problem moving anyone of us who are bigger than her. And you gotta remember the european guys are also a whole lot bigger than me. And er ... I'm sure the fact that she's a 4th dan probably has something to do with it as well. Dunny thing about slamming, I've only heard the term used in Singapore. Over here, they use the term taking breakfall on quite a generic basis. Only diff is how soft/hard nage executes and nage takes breakfall. When I do gyaku hamni variations of kotegaeshi, the static versions are always very weird. Think really need some kinda giving in from uke if nage don't do it well. But once you bring it up to a more dynamic approach like a tsuki or sho/yoko-men, think can do it more smoothly coz there's a flowy feel then. If uke don't let nage do it ... think might as well use some other technique for effectiveness. Doesn't mean it's always the nage's fault. (I get that quite a lot ... from uke's perspective I mean haha). By the way, where do you think you stand in terms of technique and ukemi in the whole class? I'm sure you see some cuckoo things by some people as well right, pretty much like back home. Think I'll be doin nikkyo this coming week. Even if I don't I think the next one will. Coz Sensei gonna spring a grading test on us sometime this term (within 3 weeks). Panicky sia. Not ready leh. Also scared I may need to skip training in my last week coz projects are gonna be due then.  I understand what  urlLink you  meant by "throw yourself when the nage was just about to throw you". I have this problem with over anticipating my nage, like ALL the time. If they did something unpredictable, I doubt I can adjust myself well enough to take ukemi and come out unhurt. My Sensei tries to help us by making us do randori in the last few mins of almost every class. One it helps us recall what we've learnt for the whole 1+ hr, two it helps us take ukemi at a more unpredictable level. I think it's good and helpful for me but I will never be confident. My memory isn't very good. Even if I can remember a bit, my hands and legs rarely follow what I want. My brain just can't multi task at that level I suppose. So I always start after seeing the first few students do some techniques. Heh heh, monkey see monkey do. It's only after a few gos, then maybe I'd change the order a little. Yupz, as Tommy said, my Aikido also "has no life". Gary's right, Tommy's a good partner to practice with. There was this period where I almost almost always heng heng paired up with him for iriminage. It was like 95% of all my iriminage practice. Dunno why so coincidental. Haha I recalled coz after he grabs my neck and throws me, he sometimes commented "wah, you very wet ar you." and I'd just laugh. Damn farny man. Miss the irimanages with him hahaha. O yar, and I also enjoy the after-class-sessions with Jesse. Err ... 'cept that one time before I flew off to UK where he kinda damaged my specs. Now a bit scared hahaha XP  Hey the grabbing part y urlLink  ou mentioned I like what my Sensei does. She always tell us that when we grab nage, pretend there's a 50p coin between our palm and nage's arm. Whatever the nage does, uke needs to follow in such a way that the 50p coin won't drop off when you are doing techniques. Of coz there were always some occasions where we used a real 50p coin to try it out. Works a whole lot better than normal but just remember not to depend on it too much such that uke becomes really artificial. Err, and just in case someone who reads this don't know it, remmeber to let go of the arm when you do get thrown. Otherwise you'll usually find that while your body is somewhere else but your arm is still remaining on nage's arm ... gross out man. Anyway I think it's especially good when doing sitting kokyu-ho. A lot of people I do it with don't practice the grabs properly at all. Over here, my classes place a lot of emphasis on this. Think it's a trademark with my Sensei. In Singapore, almost none of the 6th kyus do it, some of the 5th kyus might though. Anyway, different Sensei - so different style and empahsis also. Sometimes when I grab my Sensei's wrist, she will say "I want you to hold it, not stop blood flowing through it" hahaha ... think that's my point. So I usually try to tell myself consciously to grab lightly to the point of just a touch kinda feeling, but with the palm having almost full and flat contact to her arm.  The part about ma-ai (distancing) is something I'm not doing right either. It's even harder when I want to apply atemi properly. My Sensei points out to me quite often that when I atemi nage, I should make sure I can at least touch him. Otherwise nage will need to shift in more just to do the technique on me. I'm not helping lah basically. I try to remind myself that but I got no 100% effective enough reminder at this moment. With my kinda atemi, my nage could probably just ignore me and step back and walk away. Heh, I'm lousy lah. But in Singapore, a lot of people I practice with don't quite get it leh. There were more than one occasion that I'd just not do my technique and just stand there coz my uke isn't even touching me. I didn't want to point out too obviously but they just hardly get it. Think the atemi I like best is Syed's. Strong, stylo, well at the very least it sure feels and looks like his arm is really gonna hit me (not just graze or touch me only). My Sensei will usually just stand there and not budge, then gimme a sian expression. If I still don't get it, then she'll say something. :P There's a Greek guy in my Uni class who's a 5th kyu. He has really nice ukemi and soft technique. Trying to take note and learn from him. Especially his ukemi is like ultra soft and I like the way he commits in his atemi. Soft yet commited enough for nage. With him, I know that if he falls weird, it's probably because I'm making him do it that way. Me again ... duhz.  Err dun really wanna comment much about the Iraq/UN/US/UK issue here, but I think since US/UK are gonna commit in a strike anyway. They might as well get it over with. I mean they've already expressed that no matter what other countries say, they're still going for it what. Everybody don't want the war obviously, but since there's no holding back so why ... hold back. Go lor go lor.   urlLink Heat wave ? Well, these last 2 days just got wet. REALLY WET AND WINDY. Doubt we'll get any good snow now. But can't complain lah. Weather has been really good since I got here. I should have guessed it wouldn't last. Heard things are gonna get wetter and 'windier' (??) coming weeks. Sianz. Hate walking 30 min to Uni already, now it's gonna be walking to Uni wet.
