She cried while she was writing it, but she knows I don't want my friends to be horrified by the fact I am moving. Every family does it.  During the awards ceremony I was given the award of best in Mrs. Morgan's english class. I should have been in pre-ap and she knows it. I didn't hear her but she said that she was going to miss me. Mrs. Morgan is my favorite teacher and I praise her for putting up with all the crap the other kids have given her, usually I am happiest in first period so maybe that is why she will miss me.  ^_^   urlLink A-kon  is coming up and I can't wait, I hope  urlLink wizzywig  is there.
