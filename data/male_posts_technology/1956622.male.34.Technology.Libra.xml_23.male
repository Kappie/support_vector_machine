She talked about a little lady bug she had caught and then it got away and she was not longer interested in talking.  in fact I would say she got beligerent but not in a bad way just simply that I could not talk to her as she was being loud and not talking anymore.  She gave me hugs and kisses, told me she missed me and gave the phone back to her mommy.    I hung up and that was that.
