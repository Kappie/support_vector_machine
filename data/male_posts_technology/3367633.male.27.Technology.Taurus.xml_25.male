What the hell, I thought these guys weren't supposed to be pampered, I thought that was the point of being in jail, though I do have to admit that there are probable a lot of guys in there that shouldn't be. Jail should be for people who harm/could harm others or them self. Yeah I do admit that people like from Enron should be in there, that stuff did harm people because low income family's suffered and such, but people (sorry to use this as in example) Martha Stewart shouldn't be in jail, so she sold stock when she shouldn't have. So what take that a way and fine her heavily.
