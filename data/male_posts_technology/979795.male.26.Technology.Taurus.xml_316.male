Besides ordering them and deciding which ones to develop extras, I started putting some of them into the new album I bought yesterday. Halfway through, I remembered that I had yet to scan in all of them. Hmmm ... it's too many for me to finish one shot. Oh man, sometimes maybe a digital camera is the better alternative afterall. At least I can just copy into my hdd straightaway.  Shouming (cousin) has already found a job with NCS. Mom was nagging me again today about getting a job. Also told her I didn't get shortlisted for the police. That kinda got her going again... nag nag nag nag nag. Oh please, it's not like I'm not looking for jobs. She just like to build up everything based on assumptions. Well, let her assume then ... I just want to be left alone. Preferably with zero interaction. Told my dad I'll find and take whatever comes along first, but I'll still reapply for SPF coming Feb. He asked if I really had to insist on the SPF. I said, it was my interest and we kinda left it at that. I'm getting a lot of grief from them these days. I also don't want them to have the excuse to try to psycho me out of applying for the SPF. Trying hard to not let what they say affect my decision. Naturally I recognise the need to get a temp job first. I also don't want to lobo around to be nagged at for the next few months to a year. Prob find something / anything that comes along. Even if it's a perm job I'll still take it. Just in case SPF rejects me again, at least I can fall back on this and continue on while waiting for the next application date. I guess that's the tentative plan I have now.  Will sort out all resumes, CV and copies of result slips first. Apply whatever comes along. While awaiting for reply, will need sort out the littel details at home, clean up my room, clear the junk. If time permits, think wef 2004 I can attempt volunteering at the SPCA on weekends/Sun. OK, got a plan in order now, time to put into action.
