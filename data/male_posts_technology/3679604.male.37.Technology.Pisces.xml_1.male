Well, I have basically stopped watching live television.  I PVR it and watch later...meaning that I skip the commercials...push the forward button a few times and poof commercials all gone!  It has gotten so that even if I am right there at the time the show starts, I prefer to just wait about 5 minutes so I can have 5 minutes of buffer to forward...  What is really freaky (man I mean freaky) is sometimes I will be listening to the radio or even watching a movie and I want to reach for the forward button!!!  I am wondering what the heck is this I am listening/watching to?!?  Awright I am out. -Mustafa
