Fox Searchlight's only pre-requisite was that I e-mailed an RSVP. I was the first one in line and in the theater. This would later come back to haunt me, but at the time I thought it was pretty cool.    The movie was great. It was a packed house and a great atmosphere. The movie was an instant classic and I urge everyone to see it as soon as possible. I am sure I will beseeingit withAnn (she decided that an opera was a better choice for a Thursday night...boy was she wrong) again this weekend. Besides the movie Fox was giving out all sorts of free stuff. I got a movie poster and a  urlLink "Vote for Pedro"  pin as I went in. Elizabeth had the scoop on the event and we were going to get a free t-shirt on the way out. I was hoping to get one with a liger on it or something, but because of my sweet seat we were the last ones out and they only had a size small tater tots t-shirt left. I was bummed. I am giving it to Ann, but think  urlLink eBay  may be a good option.    After the movie, on their web page,you can take the quizzes and listen to movie quotes.
