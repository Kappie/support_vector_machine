The atmosphere in the library Friday morning was indicative of finals week; about 20 people using the computer area that accommodates 150, and work study kids behind the information desk eyeing passersby with solemn contempt ( "Would you people hurry up and leave so that I can go DRINK already!" )Unfortunately for them, happy hour was a long way off, and a slow day was in the way - no one checks out books or needs help finding a certain journal on the last day of the school year. Well, maybe grad students. Nerds.   "The  urlLink Kelley Engineering Center  is going up quickly", I think to myself. Looking at the giant crane I was reminded of last fall, when my vector calc class was migrating to another building on campus. As we passed, we all watched this massive structure being erected by a smaller, yet still massive mobile crane. My thoughts go back to the progress of the build. There was a time when I would have considered the notion that experts -- quality thinkers and doers -- were due credit for what's been done in that amount of time. From the engineering team to the welder on the frame of the 2nd floor, these guys have a work ethic and a desire for excellence so strong that the physical evidence (the building) was the progress.  But instead, in a loathful voice I said, "Bet the state's burning huge sums of money to get this thing done so fast." My faith in the tireless proud worker is beaten with a stick when the state of OR gets involved.
