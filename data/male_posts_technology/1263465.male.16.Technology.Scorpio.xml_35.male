The lady was really nice and told me I wasn't mergin right and told me how to do it the right way.  Really cool.  Also, last night some friends that are moving came over to say goodbye and I got into a conversation with them about the best way to buy the Mac.  He said that buying a computer is a process, and that it would be really smart to buy it in pieces.  So, I'm going to save up for the CPU which comes with a mouse and keyboard and just buy a cheap little CRT monitor and then start saving up for the monitor I really want (which is going to cost about $1000 I think...), the 23" HD Cinema Display (not the new one, the older one).  Then after that I'll buy either the wireless keyboard/mouse or get an Airport base depending on if we have DSL/Cable/Satellite by then.  Then I'll get the sound system last as I'm hoping to get a fairly good one.  If anyone knows a site for good cheap computer audio systems, please tell me about it.  To pay for all of this I'm saving all the money (got paid today!) from the internship, and *hopefully* getting a job at MegaByte, the "Apple Store" (really an authorized reseller).  That way I should be able to get employee discounts and I could keep that job part time during school.  There's something that I've been thinking about trying to get started.  Since freelance is so popular and there is so much good talent that is freelancing (I'm talking web, video, and print design) out there, why not make a freelancing design studio?  It would be really cool to have some sort of an agency that has contact with 30-50 freelancers and sets up jobs with them after the client contacts 'leaders'.  Put that way it sounds like some websites out there that already exist, but it would be different.  One advantage would be the ability to have so much talent in so many areas available to the clientele, therefore generating the best product.  Almost like a collaborative effort on a single project with people from all over the globe working through a chat room-like form of communication.  There would be no relocation necessary as it would be totally digital.  Many projects could be processed at the same time unlike a design studio with only 6 members.  I think it's a really cool idea, and I'd love to hear what everyone thought about it.  I'm really interested in getting this up and running no matter how many people would be interested or available right off the bat.  Give me a  urlLink shout  about what you think.  peace out :)
