I tried to call you...all weekend. I couldnt get a hold of you. I called on saturday about once an hour from 12:00 to about 8:00, i now know why that didnt help, but none the less, call me and tell me! you KNOW that i'm a cave-dwelling geek. I dont go to sleep...uh...ever.  It's about 10:01 am, and i was about to go wake up my dad to tell him to drive me to your church to pick you up...
