No where in the Constitution does it say that foreigners who have fought against the US have the right to legal representation in our courts. That right is for Americans, not their enemies. The ACLU, which is celebrating this decision, is supposed to defend AMERICAN civil liberties. Perhaps they should change their name to the Arab Civil Liberties Union, since that's who they really want to protect. Also, has anyone else noticed how the media keeps calling this decision a defeat to "Bush's War on Terror?" This is not a defeat to President Bush, it is a defeat to Americans everywhere that don't want to see our enemies released so they can continue to fight us.
