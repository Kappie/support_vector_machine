One was "The best of Pandit Jasraj" and the other was Venkateswara Panch ratna mala vol-3 by M.S. These days i am falling in love with the voice of Sangeeth Maartand (as pandit is popularly known!). Especially i listened to one particular piece, "Om namoh bhagavate vasudevaya" and i felt like, he was singing it in the most beautiful way possible. yes, the flow was something so natural and true that i felt so pleasing! Ofcourse, since its a hindustani devotional kind, its rendered like a bhajan and it gave me a feel that he was teaching his followers how to sing, by profusing the rendition with more music and devotion.   The other one was by M.S. Subbu lakshmi and needless to say about her for any kind of carnatic lovers. Every piece in the casette was a gem. i was attracted to all songs equally and no wonder would be my favourite for the next few weeks, till i get them by heart.   Apart from this, we also bought a casette of BombayJayshri with songs on "Kashi". Need to hear some more time, to get lured by that casette. Hope i dint forget anything else.  bye for now.
