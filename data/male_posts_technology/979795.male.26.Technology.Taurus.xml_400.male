We generally did a series of wrist locks with Ikkyo, Nikkyo and Kotegaeshi, ai and gyaku hamni katatedori as well as morotedori Towards the end, Frankie Sensei wanted us to do randori with but only with morotedori ikkyo waza.  I thought everyone did ok 'cept me. Was nervous and caught unawares. Can't get myself to calm or quiet down and i tend to be rushing into things. Wish I can control my ukes' ki better.  After that, had to rush down to Plaza Singapura to meet up with some of the old 56th SAB guys. Luckily, Tang drove and gave me a lift down (as well as Tony a lift back). He was kinda rushing because we were pressed for time. When I was almost reaching, Bernard called to say they can't get tickets and they wanted to try Suntec instead. Actually I was wondering how come nobody bought the tickets in advance. It was a Sat evening afterall and we were planning to catch Brotherhood (Korean war film), which had a very good review. Oh well, turns out Bernard, Gary Tay, Andy Ng, Goh Leong Hwee and another guy I'm not to familar with by the name of Vincent turned up. Was nice seeing everyone, so we all walked down to Suntec, chatting at the same time. Turns out Brotherhood was left with only the 3rd row onwards. We didn't think it was wise to catch such a film that close, so we tried check on iRobot. Turns out that it was worse, being the sneak preview weekend, only the front row was left. We decided to grab aseat somewhere for a bite and a chat instead.  Anyway I was qutie keen on a movie so I SMSed Shouwen (cousin in NS now). Turns out he was in City Hall area and we decided to catch iRobot today (Sun). Just managed to book the tickets online. Woohoo... got good seats too, despite paying a bit extra. I think this show is well worth it lah, it looks really impressive. Anyway, if I don't catch it now, I'm not sure I can watch these on weekdays as it seems I'm quite packed for the week meeting Financial Advisors and with Aikido training.  This morning I went for a run again and I think I seriously need to maximise my next 10 wks to prepare for AHM. No joke. Think I'm slacking too much. Neo probably too slack and busy to go for the run this year so I'm all on my own. It's gonna be much harder this way. So I need to start training not jus the body but the mind as well. GAMBATTE!!!!
