I feel that this attitude fails to accept that software is part of a system, albeit often a crucial one. In my case, the system is an innovative scientific instrument. This is not a piece of software that exists purely in the binary innards of a computer. It reaches out and controls things in the real world: valves, relays, vacuum pumps, etc.  And I think of myself as a systems engineer; not just a programmer who uses a "requirements gathering process" to work out what to do next and how to do it. I feel that my systems knowledge allows me to make informed decisions based on prior experience with other (often quite different) systems. My boss, however, does not want to that. I was told in a recent feedback session, "we do software,  not  hardware". I have a lot of experience writing software at the software-hardware boundary. It has given me a lot of insight into how hardware and software should be co-designed. I enjoy this. He finds this troubling. If I speculate, I think this is because he does not want the responsibility of a software-related hardware design decision going wrong.  So what do I now? How do I keep doing what I feel I am good at if I constantly get feedback, in all its implicit and explicit forms, that says  "we don't like that, please stop doing it" ? Is this another reason for dusting off the CV and looking around?  Or am I just getting overly sensitive to my environment? I have come from a RTOS/Unix/Linux environment into a Windows only environment where the developers know Windows well but other platforms might as well not exist. They can make Visual C++ .NET sing but, once I got into it, so could I; and I still have RTOS/Unix/Linux skills.  So what am I saying?  I am  not  a coder.  I am  not  a developer.  I  am  a  systems software engineer .  Please don't waste my experience by trying to turn me into a coder. I have far more than that to offer and you are wasting my time, and your money, if you do so.
