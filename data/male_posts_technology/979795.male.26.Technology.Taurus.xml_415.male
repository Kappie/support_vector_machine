CHIJMES was great. My first time being involved in such an event so I found it pretty refreshing. Also the first time I ever had my hands on a polaroid camera. I didn't really stay long because of training in the afternoon.  Got to the dojo on time and we did the usual warm-ups, corrections of posture, etc. Seems like only white belts were present. Only other person there (besides Frankie Sensei) was Tang who came late. After that was 'revision' of Nicholas's grading syllabus. I think it's due next week or something. He tend to gets trapped thinking about the grading. I find that he's like the typical studious looking Singapore teen who treats everything like a test in school. Constantly pondering for a 'textbook' answer for even regular/daily practice. I don't know, I do get frustrated with my owbn progress ocassionally, but very often I take Aikido as it is. Hey, if I don't know it ... I don't know it. Racking my brains just isn't going to help me. Well, I'm just glad that the next lesson is going to be a weapons class on jo.  After class, Tang and I went down to Bugis and meet some of the old 56SAB folks. Was nice to see some familar faces. I had to admit though, I didn't know half the people there. But it was great to see Marcus Fam again. The guy is sooo different from before. He basically kept a pony tail and he's so physically pumped up he seriously resembles a miniature version of Jackie Chan (something most of his friends commented in Australia). One thing though, seeing him makes me really wish I was doing more consistent gym training again. It also makes me very hopeful that it's possible to get that kind of effect without the use of steroids and supplements. But one thing Marcus mentioned, it takes a lot of self-discipline and I'm not too sure I'm willing to give up some of the sinful food I really like. But I'm really having second thoughts about some serious training in a gym and planning a serious exercise regime. Then again, I never exercise to make myself look good, only feel good. Plus building myself up on mass has some down points. I'm not sure it'll help my Aikido. On the contrary, I'd worry that I will exert more physical strength in my regular trainings, somthing that's a definite no-no. I guess I need to find a balance somewhere.  Sun was a really slacked day for me. I spent time bumming around at home and just waiting for Mon to come. For helping out on Sat at CHIJMES, Tracey gave me halfday off on Mon. Decided it might be a good time to catch a movie alone. Got to town and found Plaza Singapura crowded with people. I guess being a school holiday that was only to be expected. Didn't feel like squeezing with a crowd to catch Spiderman 2 so I walked down to Kinokuniya in Ngee Ann City. Spent a good 2hrs plus browsing the martial art and military history sections. After that I went down to BB East CC for Alvin's class. Really been a long time since I last visited. I had forgotten how enjoyable his lessons always is. I just realised that his way of teaching bears some semblance to Yuishinkai's. After warmups, he'd explain certain way of how the warm-ups we did will help us in this or that technique, or even the idea of how we should be doing our warm-ups properly. It was just good lah. I had a very enjoyable time that evening. I do remember Alvin accidentally knocking me on the head when he was demonstrating something with the bokken. He was a bit blur also when it happened. Anyway, nothing fatal ... purely accidental ... it was a good laugh too. Oh man, but one thing I kinda can't stand. Someone let one go during the start of class. There was a soft sound (which I can't quite tell initially), followed by a really pungent smell which lasted about 7-8 sec before diffusing off into the other parts of the dojo. What was worse? The guy let one go again a few seconds later. Argh ... chemical attack, man! We shoulda all be wearing the SAF mop 4 (full attire for chemical/biological warfare) hahaha... Monday came and went quickly. If not for Alvin's class, I might've felt that I had wasted my time.  Tuesday came, I was suppossed to conduct a teacher's training and was a bit surprised when Mdm Tien mentioned she had seen my blog. Then some of the teachers present started asking about what's a blog and how often I update it. Oh man, feeling paiseh. Aiyar! Means now cannot talk bad about the school liao...  . Just kidding. Took 2 P1 classes today and they really enjoyed using the Paint software. One class did find it incredibly easy to use though. Really noticed some difference in the way Daphne and I would conduct the class for kids at such a tender age. I would stubbornly insist that they learn from the point of switching on electricity, powering up the PC, logging into a network, and shutting down a PC properly after logoff. Daphne on the other hand minimises the beginning by helping them start up. The kids do pick up things fast, which is why I'm quite insistent that the P1s know what they are doing and will need to enforce good PC care and habits from the very beginning. Of course, I still get the occasional one or two who would just press the power button to shutdown instead. However, basic PC skills in my book in far from complete. If I had more time, I'd make sure they learn what is proper file management. But I'm afraid that would be something I can teach only if I had more time/lessons with them. But practical and timetabling concerns makes that an impossibility for this year, by my estimate.  Aikido at BVCC was ok. Not a lot of people turned up and we laid the usual 143 mat area. It was a hard time training and keeping the mats after that. I'm just glad that almost everyone helped. Was really tired when I went to change out of my sweaty and stinky gi. We did some kokyunage+iriminage for starters. I paiered with a whitebelt Malaysian (I think) by the name of Jacky, who was really good. He used to train in Malaysia (and did he mention Hong Kong too?) for about 2 yrs inconsistently due to work commitments. After that he pretty much stopped for almost the same length of time. He has pretty good posture and his basic understanding is there. I'm guessing he was either a 5th or 4th kyu in his dojo then. But his technique is softer than some of the brown belts I've encountered in BV. He is a bit rusty but that's nothing a few months of practice can't help.
