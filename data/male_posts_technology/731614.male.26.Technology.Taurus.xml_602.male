According to  urlLink this article , the Japanese are working on a car that can express emotions:   Four inventors working for Toyota in Japan have won a patent for a car that they say can help drivers communicate better by glaring angrily at another car cutting through traffic as well as appear to cry, laugh, wink or just look around.  I think it would be a big help to those Japanese inventors if we were to suggest what emotions we would want our cars to express and how those emotions might be displayed. They might not have thought of all the possibilities, you see? Anyone?
