If any of the words in the definition are unknown, the process recurses until the originally looked up word make sense.  Can a computer do the same? Yes and no. Without a starting vocabulary, a computer program would approach the dictionary not knowing any words. The process of looking up one word would spiral into a deep recursion ending in cycles of simple words such as "the", "a", "that" and synonyms such as "man", "male human being", "person".  I don't have this problem, because I have a vocabulary that can help explain the new concept.  The trick in having a computer "understand" a dictionary is by having the computer understand the  But, what functions can a computer with no vocabluary perform on a dictionary? To start, let's examine the data available in a dictionary, a definition:            car  ( urlLink cars )          vehicle that moves independently, steered by a driver mostly for personal transportation. See also  urlLink automobile .     a non-powered unit in a  urlLink railroad  train.    a passenger-carrying unit in a subway or elevated train, whether powered or not.    the passenger-carrying portion of certain amusement park rides, such as Ferris wheels.           Synonyms           urlLink automobile  ( US )     urlLink motorcar         A simple representation of a word is that it  depends   on  the words of its definition and is  equivalent to  its synonyms. After stemming and removal of stop words, the definition of car can be condensed to a set of words for each definition and an equivalency set of synonyms.    Synonyms  car = { automobile, motorcar }    Definitions  car := { vehicle, moves, independently, steered, driver, personal, transportation } car := { non-powered, unit, railroad, train }    car := { passenger, carrying, unit, subway, elevated, train, powered }    car := {   passenger, carrying, portion, certain, amusement, park, rides, Ferris, wheels }  For example, here's a run through a 'dictionary graph algorithm' on dictionary.com.        Question:    Why do cars need gas?    Answer :    urlLink car  (equivalent to)  urlLink automobile  (depends on)  urlLink engine  (depends on)  urlLink fuel  (equivalent to)  urlLink gas   This example shows that a simple question such as "Why do cars need gas?" can be answered by taking the nouns from the question ("cars" and "gas") and finding the shortest path between the words.  While this won't work in all cases, noun to noun relations could be explained this way.
