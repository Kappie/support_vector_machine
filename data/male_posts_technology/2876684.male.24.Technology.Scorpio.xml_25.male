I felt so frustrated and disheartened I was close to breaking down into tears - I don't know what was wrong with me today, I didn't have any "zip" and even the simplest stuff took a lot of effort to do. On top of that, I fought like a complete amateur today, not like someone who's going to be competing in the open division of a full contact tournament.  Shihan gave me a ride to the station like he always does and before I go we usually hug, but today he held me a little longer and said, "It's okay buddy, you'll be strong - put today behind you and tomorrow will be a good day." I started crying right there and then, partly because of my performance tonight but also realising how lucky I am to be able to see the soft side of him that so many people don't see. He is a hardcore instructor no doubt, but underneath all that hardness he only has the best of intentions for all of us.  How privileged I am to train with this man.
