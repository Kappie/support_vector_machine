Today folks, I am going to talk about my Girlfriends mum.   I would call her a battleaxe, yet feel it would be unfair as battleaxes serve a purpose. I would call her a dragon, but that would involve me imagining her breathing (even if it  was  fire). I would call her every name under sun, but the sun never shines where she lives. Harsh words I hear you bellow at the screen. Not harsh enough I bellow back. Myself and The Woman That Shall Remain Nameless (she-devil for short) have never seen eye to eye, at first I thought it was because she was cross-eyed but later discovered its because we just don't get on. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate her (as such) hate is such a strong word isn't it? Dislike, now theres a fluffy word. Detest, less fluffy, not as strong as hate, yeah that will do.  Now, I am in a unique position here (mental note to self, I really must send that take yoga book back to the library) my girlfriend happens to be in a bad mood with her family today, so when asked "what can I write about today?" she replied "write about my bleeding mother, you could rant all day about that!". Little did she realise I would take her up on that offer and am clearly writing about aforementioned mother.  Nothing I ever say or do will ever change the fact her mother doesn't like me, why bother kidding myself. Lets be honest, if you are going to be hated by someone, you might as well get your moneys worth out of the situation and rant about her to the world on a website! I am just extremely glad she will never find out due to not being able to read....  DISCLAIMER. THIS POST IS ENTIRELY FICTIONAL. THE CHARACTERS IN THIS RANT MAY RESEMBLE REAL LIFE PEOPLE, BUT I ASSURE YOU THIS IS ENTIRELY COINCIDENTAL. THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THE VIEWS EXPRESSED ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO FALLACY AND CREATIVE LICENSE AND SHOULD BE TAKEN AS BEING MADE UP AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE ACTUAL VIEWS OF THE AUTHOR.*   *just in case she ever learns to read.
