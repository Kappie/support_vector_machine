The suit against Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other military officials, names the plaintiff only as John Doe. It says he served in the Marine Corps and Army for nine years on active duty and three years as a reservist.  'This lawsuit seeks to stop the forced retention of men and women who have fulfilled their service obligations,' said attorney Michael Sorgen. 'When their period of enlistment ends, they should be entitled to return to their families.'  "Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction." --13th Amendment to US Constitution.
