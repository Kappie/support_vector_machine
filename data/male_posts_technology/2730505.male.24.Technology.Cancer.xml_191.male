This year though I think there will be a bigger turn out than last year.  Don't get me wrong, I had a few people there last year, somewhere around 30 people but I played volleyball and got all sweaty and shit; fun and all but not conducive to picking up the girls (well unless they play with you too I suppose).  Anyways, it's the same deal as last year, 9-11 free cover and 10-11 free drinks as long as you say  GONZO  at the door.  So for anyone who's going to be in town that weekend or want to come up that weekend, it's all good.  I got a big living room and I'm sure it's not going to be a problem for people to passout there and leave the next day.  The night would probably start out at my apartment, meet there for those who are in the area.  Nerd it up by playing a little HALO or Rainbow Six 3 online while polishing off a case before heading out.  Get to North Beach around 9:30 or so to avoid the rush and shit.  Probably stay there till close and then head over to an after hours bar or whatever.  If anything, just head back to the apartment and party it up there.  Sounds like a plan to me.
