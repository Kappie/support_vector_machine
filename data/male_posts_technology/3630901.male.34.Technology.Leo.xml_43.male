Speak man speak! ------------------------------------- Date: Thu, 8 Jul 2004 08:24:18 -0700 (PDT) From: Simon To: Dean Subject: Re: So tell me  The conversation was great again.  We started to make plans for a date on Tuesday, but I dunno, I really like her, so I'm gonna see her Friday, instead - delaying my arrival for the camping until Saturday morning.  I'm not sure how that's going to work, logistically, but I'm going to her house to watch a video and get some dinner.  I also invited her to a date on 7/23 - taking Ivy and Aidan to a Bridgeport Bluefish baseball game.   She just seems so right, but maybe I'm blinded to some things about her.    My therapist urges me to take it slow, note red flags, seek my ideal mate, and not settle for less than that.  Being completely honest with her is a great feeling, though.  L and I were clearly not completely honest with each other, and it's been that way for some time.  We both adopted the policy of "don't ask, don't tell".  I think we were both frequently dissatisfied with our relationship but didn't discuss it, maybe out of fear of hurting the other person.  I withheld my emotions and fears and regrets and stuff about money matters.  L and I were also talking about what to do for dates, and we both got a good laugh about how we never really dated - we just kind of fell into a relationship.  Our dates always consisted of a meal and a movie or a play.    But I still wonder if I really like S or if I like the idea of S.  I do feel stronger though - that I'll stand up for what I want rather than giving in to make someone else happy.  But I have to be vigilant about that. ------------------------------------- Date: Thu, 8 Jul 2004 13:58:53 -0400 (GMT-04:00) From: Dean To: Simon Subject: Re: So tell me  What about just enjoying and being in the moment?  I agree with your therapist about heeding the red flags (of which you have mentioned none), but the notion of looking for the "ideal" mate seems to be a setup for failure.  The fact is...no one is "ideal," even when one is not in an emotional/mental state such as yours.  Your state of being right now might preclude certain measuring criteria.  Think of it this way: You meet a guy named Bob.  You don't like Bob.  Bob starts telling you about his best friend Bill.  What information might you extrapolate from this?  Pythagorean Theory.  If Bob is an A-hole and Bob's best friend is Bill it might be easy to hypothesize that Bill is an A-hole as well.  While this might not be true it can be called upon logically.   You are in a state of mind right now where you are just getting to know yourself and coming out of a place where you have not liked yourself for a very long time.  Therefore...if you do not like yourself subconsciously you are always second guessing anyone you do like because if you don't like you then how can you trust that the people you like are of "good stock," much less "ideal?"  This is especially true for you right now in intimate relationships.  You have consistently picked women who have done bad things to you...betrayed you...hurt you.    How can you trust that you wont make those same mistakes again?  The fact is...you never can.  You have a certain schemata that you have built up over the years through which you filter information.  You are in the process of breaking that schemata down and rebuilding it, but in the meantime it is what you have to guide you through the world.  Many times what we expect to happen happens simply because we expect it and therefore make it happen.  My suggestion to you in this very critical time of transition and major change both inside and out is to enjoy yourself.  Enjoy the people you spend time with.  Be open to experience.  Even be open to love and falling in love.  You are just starting to remove the blinders and when the storm clears the people who you love who also love you will still be there...the others might have moved on.  Just make sure that if you push them away that you are doing so for the right reasons.  Given everything I have said the "right" reasons might seem obscured by the clouds and difficult to parse out from the minutia.  Just know that your "ideal" is an ever changing thing right now.    Be true to yourself.  Be honest with yourself and others and while your heart might be bruised and battered it is still beating in your chest and should have a say in matters as well as your brain even in it's damaged state.    OK...I have rambled (hopefully somewhat coherently).  Call me later. ------------------------------ Date: Fri, 9 Jul 2004 06:30:57 -0700 (PDT) From: Simon To: Dean Subject: Re: So tell me  Thank you very much for this mail note.  I've read it a couple of times already and I appreciate your insight and your rambling.  The date with P last night was fun, but I guess we were a little rushed at our picnic to get to yoga.  And then when yoga was over it was just kind of time to go.  It would have been more romantic if we didn't have yoga to go to, but I think she enjoyed it.  I got a nice kiss at the end.  But when I got home, all I wanted to do was talk to S.  I called her and we talked for about 45 minutes, and firmed up our date for tonight.    I liked what you said about "being open to love and falling in love".  I'm going to stop trying to figure out where I'm going and stop trying to figure out (at least this early on) what I'm feeling - I'm just going to go and I'm just going to feel.   I just have to remember to be who I am, do what I want to do, and say what I want to say.  And not be afraid that someone is not going to like me for any of those things.  I've gotten used to quelling who I am, what I want to do and saying what I want to say for fear of rocking the boat.  All this leaves me with the thought of what should I do about P.  Maybe it's easier because she's moving to the white plains area soon (1-2 weeks).  On our date we talked a little about the flags that came up for me in our last date - her telling me what to do (simple things - like I'm waiting at a stop sign, and she tells me to go right - not from directions, but that's the way that she wants to go), or her accentuating the "generation gap" that she saw but I didn't.  Should I just wait for her to call me to do something again, or should I call her and tell her that I'm seeing someone else.  She also just seems so adult, so mature.  Much more than I feel.  But maybe that's just my perception since she's older.
