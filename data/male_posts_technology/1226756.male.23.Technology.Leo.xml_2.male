I will post info on what I'm doing with the PIC-Micro and JAL here. My latest project was interfacing the PIC16F84 with a 7-segment LED (the type that can display numbers.) Counting down from 5..0 and then holding the 0 for another 5 seconds, then starting the whole procedure again. Today I will start my next project, which will be to interface the 16F84 with a 40character -/ 2lines LCD display. I don't believe this will be a problem, but somehow I never know these things.
