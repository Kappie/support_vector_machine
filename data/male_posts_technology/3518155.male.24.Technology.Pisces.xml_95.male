I'm turning into a poster child for tennis-related ailments. Some known. Some unheard of.    Speaking of tennis, I retract my previous rant about today's tennis being overwhelmed by the all-power, no-elegance types. Early this morning, I watched the Swiss champ  urlLink Roger Federer  demolish a venomous  urlLink Andy Roddick  during the Men's finals at Wimbledon.   Federer does not possess a 140mph serve. He does not grunt when playing his shots. And does not have a double handed backhand. His is a game of precision, elegance and gorgeous single handed backhand top spin shots. He executes clean strokes with the least amount of effort required, and using the sharpest angles possible. During the finals, his minimalist approach went too far at times; at one point he squandered away a decisive game by trying to flick the ball onto an open court when the easiest of strokes would have sufficed. But such glitches aside, it was the best display of all-round tennis mastery since  urlLink Sampras  left the scene.  Apu tells me Federer was even better during last year's finals (which he also won). Too bad I missed it.
