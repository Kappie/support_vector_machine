If you are not busy on Monday perhaps I can pop over after work to give you your pressie on my way to Pauls house? Would do over weekend but working all day both days I think so no time :( But yea, have a cooooooool day!  War and Peace yesterday was cool. Brought some more camo's. Slightly sunburnt....oh man it hurts so much! When I have a shower I thought ooo the water will perhaps cool it but oh no, just stings! GAH! Ah well.  Working all day today. May try and book a weekend off somewhere just so I can relax a bit. So far all my weekends off have consisted of me taking them off for a reason so perhaps it'll be nice just to have a weekend to do sod all.  Hope your day is cool everyone!
