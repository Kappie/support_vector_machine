Yeah yeah yeah Vegas is great and all but I have three main things here that are hanging against me on this trip:  1)I am not going with my wife Courtney, who I am going to miss dearly 2)I am not seeing the Cirque du Soleil's O when I am there 3)I am going to Vegas on a business trip that will occupy AT LEAST 9 hours everyday I am there, excluding the 13th, Sunday, when I will be flying home at around 1.pm.  These three factors have already taken away greatly from mypleasurable experiences availiable on the trip.  If only I could have conned the company into paying the $160 ticket for Cirque I would have been happy!  BUT NOOOOOOO!!!!  They don't want Brian to have a good time on the trip to Vegas, they want him to WORK!!  I mean what the FUCK!?!?!  =)  I hopefully will have fun.
