Could you imagine if an attack occurred and THEN we found out that they had all this intel and it was 3 or 4 years old?  Kerry would explode on the spot. (Hey, maybe that's not such a bad idea.)  If Bush acts on the intelligence, then he's doing too much.  Or, its political.  Or, he stole the election.  Or, Kerry served in Vietnam.
