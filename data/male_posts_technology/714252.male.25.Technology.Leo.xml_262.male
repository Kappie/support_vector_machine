There is a channel called reality TV and on it today was a show called cheaters. It is the weirdest thing. People contact the show and they get investigators to follow and survey their “partners” who they suspect are cheating on them. Then when all the evidence is gathered they confront the cheating spouse while they are with their love monkeys.  This has to be the lowest of the low.. What is the world coming to?  I love TV. REALLY really love TV. I watch anything and everything on TV.. But this years TV is trying my Patience.. Tonight Sky Ones line up was Mr. Personality (A show where a woman date 25 masked men and spends a load of time waiting to choose which one she is going to MARRY. Only what she is MARRIED does she get to see what her husband looks like) Then there was “John Leslie: My year of hell” followed by six degrees of penetration.. (Who slept with who among the rich and famous) Not one thing is even vaguely intellectually stimulating or socially challenging.  I also flicked over to sex and the city today and got there at the bit where the blonde with terrible clothes (The lead) was saying something about how there should be some sort of state funded halfway house for boyfriends who have broken up with their girlfriends until they can get back on their feet.. Yes.. That’s a priority.. Ignore the people who can’t read and write.. Oh yeah and all the homeless (Hey Bubbs) What about the people who have been downsized and have been on welfare for the last 5 years.. Never mind the legions of people who die all the time just because they can’t afford healthcare.. What really matters are your “Enter Designer name” Shoes and who did who with what..  It infuriates me.. How can this be the best that our society can do???  Anyway..  What else to say…  Went to the dentist today.. I have had a thing about dentists (In that I avoid them) for the last six years or so and today I learnt (thanks to some excellent nagging from Orla) that actually they aren’t as bad as I once thought.. I had two fillings today, Tuesday I get a tooth out, Week after I get another tooth out and then the week after two more fillings and then I’ll be sexy again.. WooHooo!  There has been some other stuff going on but to be honest it is all a bit too personal for blogging (Yes,  I do know what I said after my last drinking session.. Just think.. What could be so personal that I won’t say it here??) It’s nothing bad.. In fact I think it is all pretty damn good really.  Anyway.. I have a mad few days weeks and months ahead of me to make things work but it is all looking good so far.. I’ll keep you all posted..  Good night, Good fight..
