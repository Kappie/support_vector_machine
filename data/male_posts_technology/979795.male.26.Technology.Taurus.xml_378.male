They may appear somewhat 'arrogant' the first few seconds you see them. But I think they display a level of confidence that makes them so at ease with being around people they've only met a few times (namely me lah). Class JO5, the group of girls who were screaming at the ghostly website I mentioned in my last post, and AM6, my HoD's form class. These two classes are really really alike that I find it quite intriguing, considering the fact ehy have different form teachers.  Just remembered that James called me sometime ago. He's inviting me to his wedding dinner on 7 May. But I think he probably won't be inviting most of our classmates down because he don't feel like he knows everyone that well. But I think he has to bear a part of that responsibility because he's been flying us so many aeroplane the past few years. Shuhua's gonna be invited so I guess that's one familar face there, whew. I think Yvonne and husband will be invited as well.  Failed the company test I took about 2 wks ago. When I went back yesterday for re-training, I finally understood why. Seems like I failed to attach the file I was working on and I basically failed the practical part. Geez man, what a waste. I coulda passed. It's ok doing the things again because I didn't find them to be too much of a problem. But I sure felt like I made a wasted trip down. Oh man...  Training at Ayer Raja CC was nice. I realised my mentality is changing a little. Originally I wanted to train with Yuishinkai hoping that it will improve my Aikido. But I found myself feeling twice as stupid, twice as lost, twice as lousy. But I still enjoyed the experience because it opened up another area to me that I've not felt before. Also made me realise that I may need to work twice as hard to reach the standard I hope to arrive at someday. Gotta gambatte in this area.  Spoke to Marcus (Poly classmate) lastnight and found out he's been posted onboard one of Singapore's submarine. Of course lah, considering he's a submariner. We talked about the usual blah blah about people to people relationship at work which you can find almost everywhere. Shared with him what I've been going through in my job since Feb. Was quite interesting and enjoyable having such a long conversation again. Found out Ivy's having another baby coming end of Aug. Woohoo ... damn happy for the both of them. Haha... I asked hime whether it was planned or accidental and he said they did plan for it but didn't expect the next one to come so early only.  A bit of reflection since my last post. Realised I've not been keeping to much in touch with my friends and old classmates. Feeling kinda guilty over this also. Spoke with Bin Soon via MSN also few weeks ago and realised some of our friends have switched companies. Think he's doing fine as well. Seriously man, hope to meet with them someday but I doubt this month is gonna be good for me. Think I better update our usual bunch via email soon.  On ICQ, I asked someone how was her day and I got a statement asking me to check out her blog. I'm not trying to criticise or direct this at anyone but I'm just trying to recollect and understand the thoughts that came to my mind after that. Sigh, I remember telling someone (could it be Gary? Lynette? Roy?) to go read my blog a long time ago, think it was around the time when I started blogging. Idea was just to get people to read my blog so I was quite excited about 'promoting' its existence. But I realised that that's so lame. If I ever direct someone I know to go read my blog rather than take a bit of effort to tell them about it, it only goes to show the person I am, the way I treat them, or value them. Nonono... I absolutely refuse to do so from this day forth. If I can't even bother talking to them (via phone or ICQ), why would/should they even bother talking to me, or respond in kind? Everything goes both ways. I gotta start treating people the way I want them to treat me.
