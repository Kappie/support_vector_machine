If you haven't seen it yet, go see  urlLink Lost in Translation.   It just won three  urlLink Golden Globes  on Sunday.  
 
 The film is about Bill Murray who plays a washed up actor by the name of Bob Harris who comes to Tokyo to endorse a Japanese whiskey company.  He's tired of his wife and he wants to be acting in plays rather than shooting commercials in a foreign country.  Staying in the same hotel is Charlotte (played by Scarlett Johansson), a recent graduate from Yale University, who is visiting Tokyo her newlywed husband who is town for a photo shoot (he's a photographer).  Charlotte is young, doesn't know what she wants to do with her life, and is quickly becoming overwhelmed with the complexities of married life.  Both Bob and Charlotte are miserable in Tokyo, and it's their misery that brings them together.
 
 I'm not going to give any more plot details away.  Go see the movie.  It's artsy, and a little dark to be considered a comedy, but you'll be glad you saw it.  I promise.  Later.
