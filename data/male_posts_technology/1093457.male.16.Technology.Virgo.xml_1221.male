This is something which most people really cannot do as they live in their shallow world of only listening to one style of music, which quite frankly, bores me to tears. My brother and Paul have this habit in the mornings, getting ready to go to school, of only listening to rock, and if it is not rock or a song that they have not heard before or is not to there usual taste, will straight away change the channel. At all costs, they will watch Kerrang! or Q. If a song, for example like this morning, came on by Oasis then that’s not ‘rock’ enough for David and Paul so they want to watch something else. Both of them call all other styles of music crap, rubbish or just bad. It is not bad music at all, they just live in a shallow world.  How about listening to new music rather than sitting in your shallow musical worlds and listen to the other music out there? I do enjoy rock, I really have no problem with it, it’s one of my favourite styles, but I also enjoy all other types of music.  This kind of behaviour is very similar to Joe, he enjoys his particular type ‘music’; however Joe expresses it in the different manner: by inflicting it on the rest of the 6th form who really, do not care for it at all. I do not mind listening to Kiss (being the most popular in the common room), they play some good songs that obviously Virgin would never play. Most people seem to be happy, everybody has their personal favourite, but as far as pleasing as many as possible a combination of Kiss and Capital, with Virgin after school, seems to be fine.  However, Joe’s ‘music’ is where ‘ urlLink music ’, defined as “ urlLink an artistic form of auditory communication incorporating instrumental or vocal tones in a structured and continuous manner ” stops being music. His ‘music’ gives me head aches, he always plays the same songs, and he doesn’t give a flying fuck about what anybody else thinks. The continuous beats with some bloke who probably mugged some kid on the way to record the song. Joe does not even buy the songs; all those CDs are burnt and obviously the songs have been stolen through the Internet. If you support and enjoy music, buy the bloody song.  Tomorrow I am going to buy the Britney Spears single Toxic. Why? I like the song, it has a fabulous violin part, which is ringing around in my head, it has interesting lyrics, to me it is a good song, just like when I bought Shut Up by The Black Eyed Peas. If any of you think buying either of them is sad, pathetic, stupid, silly or whatever - you can go fuck yourself. I enjoy listening to all kinds of music and deciding on what I want to listen to, not what an industry wants me to listen to or sitting in a shallow world of a mono-style.
