Being the days before the internet there weren't alot of avenues to travel to achieve my goal of finding the guy that would become my first boyfriend and being underage a bar seemed out of the question as well. Our local paper did however have a personals section so I decided to place an ad.   The first detail of placing the ad was to secure a post office box in which I could receive replies while also insuring my discretion. The details of my ad are long forgotten but I suspect it was probably fairly generic. Looking back I would have expected my replies than the 7 or 8I received; I say this since nowadays it seems every guy wants a 20 year old to break in. I was rather shocked and more than a little turned off with the reply of an "x" pic and rather profane letter. Needless to say that one went in the garbage. The one reply that does stand out in my memorybecause it is the one I ultimated answered was from a doctor. I thought, wow, that's a catch. Isn't it every gay boy's dream to land a doctor husband? The doctor included a phone number which I used to contact him and after a brief chat we decided to meet in person at a diner in Dover, NJ. I figured Dover was close enough to where I lived, about 10-12 miles but far enough that I wouldn't see anyone I knew, lest I got "caught" on this date.   Being a doctor (a grown up profession), I understood he was older, about 35-38. I hate to admit it, but I was disappointed when we met face to face, he really wasn't my type, not that I knew at that point what my type was. But seeing as we were both there, it seemed silly to turn around and leave, not that I would have thought then that it would have been ok to leave. Being 20 I was the pinnacle of wide eyed earnestness; not yet having developed intothejaded cynical being I am now proud to be.  Doctor "X" (I have no idea what his name was) turned out to be a geuinely nice guy, but - and isn't there always a "but"? - had a strange fixation on the Muppets which, I have to say I found strange and a little bit of a turn off. The moreI ponder this in the present I find it ironic since I now have a bit of a crush on an actor starring in Avenue Q on Broadway, which of course, is a satire of Sesame Street crossed with Rent; replete with a cast of very muppet like puppets.   If the muppet fixation wasn't damning enough the good doctor turned out to bea podiatrist, which I grant you is a noble and necessary profession but hardly what I had in mind as a potential life mate.   Alas, Chuck Woolery was unable to make a love connection for us and I never saw him again after our one and only date. But it did give me the experience I had been seeking for as long as I could rememebr, up to that point. And it diminshed the possiblity that I would be alone for the rest of my life. There have been many dates since and although I am, as I stated before, a self professed jaded and cynical being; nothing can brighten a day as much as the prospect of going out on a date. The mere opportunity to meet, face to face with a possible significant otherI find very exciting and always fun.   Dating is nice. Make someone happy, go on a date this weekend.
