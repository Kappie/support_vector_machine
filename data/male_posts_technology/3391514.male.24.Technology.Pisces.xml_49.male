It'll make an interesting read for later on I reckon.  My days are now spent doing very little, 'cause I can barely see.  Thus no reading, no sustained Pc use, no TV... only music and sleep.  The pain isn't helping.  The throat pain is now accompained with the eyedrops running down there (did you know that the tear ducts, nasal passages and throat are all connected?  No?  Now you do), my hand still aches and the eye... don't get me start3d on the damn eye.  Not much else to report... I hspoke to some people, and wasa ctually called by a friends to see how I was doing... ha first, believe it or not.  Going to see my optician tomorrow... hopefully some things will be sorted.  Then its a struggle to see whether I make it to Fridays roleplaying game or not...  Joy.
