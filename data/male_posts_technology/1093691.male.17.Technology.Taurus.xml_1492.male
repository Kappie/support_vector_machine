Got into an argument with my manager a bit about being allowed to do refunds. I don't want to do them, he wants everyone to do them. Had a lecture on shrinkage. Great. Um yea the new tills are fun, they are touch screen and we will go live in August at some point so if you come into woolies watch out because queues may be long what with getting to know the tills an all.  After work I popped over to Jackies to give her pressie, yay! Then went to Paul's which was fun. We played Spiderman monoolopy! Yay! It was cool. :) Today may be off to Ikea to get bedroom furni.  Dave why you break up with Becky? You two seemed cool.
