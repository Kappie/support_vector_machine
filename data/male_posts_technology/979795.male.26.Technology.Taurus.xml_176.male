But only for about an hour or so as we had to pack up and check out soon. We took the same breakfast we had 2 days ago of bake beans and bread and went back to bed to sleep a little more.1030 hrsGot out of bed, packed up and checked out of the hostel. Purchased some tokens at the Internet cafe nearby and cleared our emails while waiting for the ferry which will be taking us to Gudvagen. We whiled time away sitting along the harbour waiting for the ferry.   1430 hrs  Boarded our ferry and departed Flem for Gudvagen.   1700 hrs  Arrived at Gudvagen and boarded a coach bound for Voss.   Before 1900 hrs  Arrived at Voss and got on the 1915 hrs train to Burgen.  Basically, our whole day was spent travelling and getting to Burgen.  It's raining / drizzling when we arrived in Burgen. Horrible. Checked into the local YMCA here. It's newly renovated but everything seems half done. They were still in the process of renovating the place and you can still smell the new plaster everywhere. We grabbed an expensive dinner at a 'cheap' restaurant. That's not the worst. The toilet in the restaurant was coin-operated, same as the public toilets in the damn country. I can understand a public toilet being coin-operated but to do the same to the restaurant's toilet is simply outrageous.  The shower rooms were horrible. Not a proper changing room was done yet. The way the doors opened, I think someone walking past the male showers can look in easily. Can't imagine what's it like for the ladies shower room. I had a hard time showering. I'd classify the shower and changing rooms to be simply pathetic. The dorm was similar to military style bunks. They were double-decked. It took me a long time to fall asleep. Some bugger was snoring loudly nearby. My first impression Burgen has been dramatically damaged.
