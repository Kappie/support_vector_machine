We're having a King of the Hill tournament which should be fun.  In the News:  A tube strike proposed by the RMT has gone ahead today causing widespread disruption in London.   Two militants and one policeman have been killed in gun battles in the capital of Saudi Arabia - Riyadh.  A new system is being trialled in the UK to stop plagiarism in universities. The software will search for blogs of text or entire essays lifted from websites. It seems unlikely that it will be able to detect altered text e.g.  "America and the USSR were the main rivals during the cold war."  changed to  "Russia was the main rival of America during the cold war."  However, it should prevent simple "copy  paste essays".  Other Stuff:  Sports day tomorrow... It might rain but otherwise, its quite likely I'll be running the relay :( oh well.  Now I'm off to play Planetside :)
