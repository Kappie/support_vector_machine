I know some of those less interested in these things must be getting bored, so on Wednesday I will talk about butterflys or something equally contraversial. So look forward to the break from contraversy!   Allan's Blog and Racism - edited with help from Nato  1. Racial Discrimination (a form of racism) is dealing with people according to their race, and not according to their actual circumstances. (For example one could say “All Asians are bad drivers so Mr Chang being an Asian cannot have a drivers license. However Mr Chang may in fact be an excellent driver, and should have a drivers license.)  2. To allow people of Maori or Pacific origin into a computer course for free, but to charge those from other backgrounds is racial discrimination, since it deals with Maori Pacific Islanders as if they are all poor and in need of help, and Pakeha as if they are all rich and able to help support others and help themselves.  3. Racial Discrimination is wrong  Conclusion:- It is wrong for Maori and Pacific Islanders to get into a computer course for free when other races cannot.   To disagree with the conclusion this you must disagree with one of the premises, since if you agree with the premises, the conclusion follows logically. Perhaps you might like to argue that even if the premises are correct, some racial discrimination is not bad. In that case you will need to spell out in which cases, and why. Otherwise, I would tend to think that this case we discussed in Allan’s blog is bad, and is something that shouldn’t be happening!   A better way of arguing this would is summarized by Nato “race isn't an accurate measure of need. Need is the best measure of need”   Extract From My Essay On NZ Society  As a nation we have scoffed at the idea of absolute truth, and embraced relativism. We thus make ourselves hypocrites, because we want a society where people respect each other, yet we have rejected a basis for absolute standards of morality that can produce such a society. Not surprisingly, the government, representing us, has pulled the plug on civil society; it has rejected virtue, just as it’s citizens have. Society has elected to run with ’values’ which are subjective and personal, and now reaps the consequences of the ‘freedom’ sown. By rejecting the boundaries of absolute morality and personal responsibility, we have opted instead for the shackles of increased state control and responsibility over our lives. Edmunde Burke, hit the nail on the head when he said;    “Men are qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition  to put moral chains upon their own appetites.........Society cannot exist unless a controlling  power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere, and the less of it there is within, the more there must be without.”   Government social policy has tried to legitimatize and subtly supported alternate forms of ’family’ other than the traditional marriage based family. It has done this through laws such as no-fault divorce, through the legitimisation of homosexual relationships, through the welfare system, and through education. Government welfare programmes created disincentives for families aiding their members, and in the long run have encouraged family break down. These programmes have made it economically viable for women to have babies outside of marriage, and for fathers to shirk responsibility in favour of government income assistance. The very fact that we support these lifestyles gives those who live them reason for doing so.  In the research for this paper, I read the 1998 Business Plan for the Department of Social Welfare. (Does anybody else find it strange that a department which ideally should be reducing it’s cliental is creating a business plan as if it were a growth industry?) Inside the front cover, it proudly stated that Social Welfare handled one in every three dollars of government expenditure. This is shocking. One third of tax payer money is being used to support lifestyles many of which are proven to be disastrous for children and society, producing tragedies such as the death of Michael Choy and his youthful murderers. Furthermore, these lifestyles are uneconomical. We are too busy focussing on poverty, by giving handouts instead of looking at one of the primary causes of poverty, which is found in social policy hostile to marriage. Thus we are continually exacerbating the problem. The welfare state itself discourages families from staying together, as it offers finance for other lifestyles. However, the very lifestyles that this promotes leads to further poverty, both physically, and morally.      Personal Responsibility  Does society owe us? Do we have a right to money from other people if we are poor? These questions are not the same as "Should society help those in need?" A problem I think we have is that we confuse these questions. No person has a right to another persons money. It is not some God-given right. Here is a further extract:-     "It will also be vital to create a strong independent voluntary sector that can offer an alternative to government welfare..... As we reduce government welfare, less tax will be required, and people will have more disposable income to give to charity. Volunteer organizations are a major component in building social capital. They enable people to publicly practise the virtues that should be learned in the family. Family and friends are important in temporarily supporting others in need, but when this is not possible, voluntary associations provide the best alternative, not the government. When assistance comes from real people, and not some monolithic state organisation, face to face relationships will result, and people will respect the aid that comes to them, not as a right, but as a gift. This will decrease the likelihood of dishonesty and abuse of welfare. Voluntary institutions will flourish in a society that loves virtue, as the government steps back and allows them to fulfill their proper task. These institutions create a context for rights to be matched by responsibility, and hold back the power of the state."
