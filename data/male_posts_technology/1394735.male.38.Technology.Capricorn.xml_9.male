So the other night I was watching "Castle in the Sky" with my son and I had a strong impression that this story would make a great animated movie.  The more I think about it, the more I am convinced that is what I should do.  Obviously the story needs more work to make it a successful animated movie, but I've already begun addressing that issue.  My problem/question is, "How do I go about getting the job done?"  I have no experience in film-making.  I certainly don't have the capital required to launch a major production of this sort.  Any advice would be appreciated.
