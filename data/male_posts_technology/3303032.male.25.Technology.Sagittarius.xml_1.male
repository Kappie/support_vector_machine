It's a good show, but I'm not what one would call a "TV Watcher," so Star Trek automatically gets lumped in with Fear Factor and CSI:  Ghent, WV.  At any rate, it still has great writing and usually slips good themes in every episode.  The example of Sophistry is the following (if I can remember it all in detail):  The gang is hovering over a planet, trying to figure out a way to 'lawfully' get some aleins from a dying world onto the ship.  They're going to violate the Prime Directive if they just beam down, so they need to either 1> Be okay with rubbing sand in Starfleet's vagina, or 2> Come up with a good reason to go down.  LeVar Burton's character suggests they tweak the signal they got from them, suggesting that they 'think' it's a distress call, even when they know it is not.  It would allow them to have a good reason to go down and do what everyone knows is the right thing to do.  Picard looks at him, and dismisses him with one word.  "Sophistry."  I don't remember the rest of the episode, unfortunately.  One of my philosophy professors in college brought in that clip to demonstrate a good working example of Sophistry (he was also a big Star Trek fan).    There is no way around it but to make a choice.  On the one hand you have the idea that you're going to violate some command given by a higher power.  You're going to possibly make people mad at you for focusing on what you believe is the right thing to do.  Or, you can choose to alter the facts ever so slightly (and often times people do this without even realizing they're doing it) and let that leeway be your out in choosing to do that right thing you have decided upon.  I'm pretty sure by the end of the episode Picard just said "Fuck it," and beamed the people up.  It was a good demonstration of choosing to serve your higher ideals rather than make other people happy.  The truth, no matter how ugly, or the consequences, is always a good choice.    Unfortunately in day to day life you're not faced with easy choices like this.  Typically your choices of right/wrong are focused around your friends, what's right or wrong at work, and the people you're going to aleinate with your ideals today.  It's not as dramatic as what's on tv (otherwise it'd be easier for me to make a living as a writer) but it's still there.  You're deciding every day what's right and what's wrong, and then deciding how much that is worth to you.  Usually this decision, and how much it's worth, determines how many friends you have and how likable you are.    I've found that it makes for much deeper friendships.  I'll take one person knowing that I want only the absolute best for my friends, that I'd do anything anytime for any of them, and that I'd die before I'd ever betray them or leave them behind, if it means that five other people think I'm judgmental and an asshole.    I keep telling people that I've done some horrible, awful things in my life, and that I don't have any kind of moral or judgmental leg to stand on when it comes to the things in their life they've done.  I just want them to understand that I'm not going to pull punches with them, and that if I think something isn't right, I'm not going to sit back and let it happen.  I can be wrong (and I am) but I won't be passive.
