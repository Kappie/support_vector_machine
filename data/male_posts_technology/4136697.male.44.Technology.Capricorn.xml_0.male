He's an interesting character and we always have a good conversation.  I guess its part of having shared some of the same experience as professional musicians, and now we're just government hacks.  He showed me some pictures of a couple of gigs we did and it brought back lots of memories.  He's a good player and a good guy and it was a pleasure playing together.  I get stressed and frustrated being around the house and its good to get out with friends.  I got a call from T today - he's looking at buying a 65 foot sailboat.  He's as big a dreamer as I am.  He's considering selling his house and living on the boat - I guess its a pretty common sentiment among men of a certain age.  Sure looks appealing! Later....
