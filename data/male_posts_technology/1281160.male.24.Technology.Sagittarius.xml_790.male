Much later attempts were made to recover the knowledge of the Vedas and this lead to the emergence of the Upanishads.The Upanishads were discovered by personages called rishis or the seers (of thought). These spiritual principles  were not created but discovered  by the rishis. These truths are the utterances of the sages on the basis of their illumined experience. These illumined experiences of the sages were not ordinary perceptions, inference or reflections, but experiences of an independent reality which impinge on their consciousness. Sri Aurobindo states:  The rishis of the Upanishads sought to recover the lost or waning knowledge of the Veda by meditation and spiritual experience and they used the text of the ancient Mantras as a prop and authority for their own intuitions and perception or else the Vedic word was a seed of thought and vision by which they recovered old truths in new forms. What they found, they expressed in other terms more intelligible to the age in which they lived. It is because the seers of the Upanishads reveal to us their pictures of the splendours of the unseen, that we are inspired to rise above the attractions and distractions of the materialistic life. These Upanishads have inspired generations of Indians with vision and strength by their spiritual power and their life-giving message. Swami Vivekananda declared: Strength, strength is what the Upanishads speak to me from every page. This is the one great thing to remember, it has been the one great lesson I have been taught in my life. Strength, it says, strength O man, be not weak. Are there no human weaknesses? Asks man. There are, says the Upanishads, but would more weakness heal them? Would you try to wash dirt with dirt? Will sin cure sin, weakness cure weakness? Ay, it is the only literature in the world where you find the word  Abhih , fearless, used again and again. In no other scripture in the world is this adjective applied either to God or man.  And the Upanishads are the great mine of strength. Therein lies the strength enough to invigorate the whole world. The whole world can be vivified, made strong, energized through them. They will call with trumpet voice upon the weak, the miserable, and the downtrodden of all races, all creeds, all sects, to stand on their feet and be free. Freedom - physical freedom, mental freedom, and spiritual freedom are the watchwords of the Upanishads.
