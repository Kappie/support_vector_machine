Then again, I do tend be more rabid then Ben and sometimes Miriam.  As for O'Neill, I am not saying he is lying, or making anything up.  It could all be true.  But, do you really expect him to say nice things about the President who fired him?  I can barely say nice things about the bosses of places where I quit.    Back to my earlier comment about Bush being similar to Reagan (Teflon President), it seems this controversy is already dieing.  Monday and Tuesday it was covered in the first half hour of the Today show (my only brush with network news anymore).  This morning it was not even mentioned.  Another similarity is in one of O'Neill's claims of the President being disengaged during Cabinet meetings.  I seem to recall people saying Reagan was a doddering old fool in his Cabinet meetings.
