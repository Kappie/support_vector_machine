Usually it takes about 1 1/2 weeks to finish one, so there is going to be a lot to do.  I am hoping that there will only be one more test in my math class, but I am not sure since we have already started the last lesson.  On the other hand it would be nice to have two more tests so that I can bring up my grade, because I did very badly on the last test.  I am hoping that UPS will not need me much this week so they will call me and tell me I don't need to come in.  That way I can concentrate on my school.
