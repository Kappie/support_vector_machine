Myself, Ajayan and Senthil(my friend) left our home around 12pm in two bikes for purchasing dresses for ajayan. i think everyone know ajayan's another name, ie., Royal. if anyone doesnt know, then dont worry at the end of this blog u ll come to know it.  First we went to Nungambakkam High Road and get into "Cavin Kellys" show room, after commenting abt all the dresses present there, atlast ajayan selected a trouser, fortunately for his size that model was not available. i said fortunately bcos we wanted to escape from there without buying anything, so now we got a reason for that and escaped from there. Then we went to the "Basics" showroom which is also present in the same road. Ajayan only showed interest in seeing all the dress, but hasnt interested in buy one. but this time i didnt want him to escape from there, so i thought of kozhi pudichifying him, senthil too helped me, so senthil and myself ran here and there and selected some shirts and one of us told ajayan this one was really superb, then other one opposed, no da this one suits u better. but after putting all those efforts ajayan told in a very cool manner, ok i select this shirt but we hav enough time, so why dont we go to some other show rooms and come back in the evening and take this shirt. but somehow senthil convinced him and made him to buy a shirt. so he took almost 2 hours to buy a single shirt, then we had our lunch at Ceylon hotel.   We continued our purchasing, because there is no more show rooms at Nungambakkam High Road, we went to Pondy Bazaar. There we went to "Derby" show room. Here Ajayan selected a trouser immediately, bcos that trouser matched very well to the shirt we bought earlier. Ajayan told come on we can continue our purchasing, bcos he needs to buy one more pair. but senthil told we can go some where else.  Muttukkadu ---------- So we started to Muttukadu, it is famous for its backwater and boating. it is 30kms away from our place and it lies in ECR(East Coast Roadways). it was a very nice experience to drive in this road, the people who travelled in this road know y i m saying like this, bcos it is difficult to find such a road in our Tamilnadu. After rasichifying the crowd for sometime, we decided to take a boat along with a helper. once our boat moved little bit, ajayan got the oar from the helper and he begin to row the boat. initially he struggled, but after that he did well. asai yaarai vittathu? so i too tried, the helper patiently told me how to ride 3 to 4 times, but even after that i havnt did well, so he took incharge. after that we walked to the centre of the bridge present over that backwater and stand there and viewed the sea from there, it was amazing to see the sea from that view. then we started from there to our place(T.Nagar).  Continued purchasing --------- ---------- After returned to our home from muttukkadu, ajayan again started saying abt purchasing, so avan thondharavu thanga mudiyama, we started from our place. but it was almost 7.30 at that time, still we went to Madura Garments factory outlet, which is present in Velachery. we reached there by 7.45, but the security told they closed it 7pm itself. I was too hungry, so I thought of having some snacks, so we went to a Food World present in Velachery. We only entered to buy something to korichifying, but ended with a Rs.800 bill, bcos senthil and ajayan potti pottu kittu bought axe effect,this effect and that effect. i silently watched all these things and when we came out it was 8.30, but ajayan was still strong in his points, said that we hav to buy dress now itself. so we went back to our home, left the vehicles there and ran to Jeyachandran textiles. There he bought a Van Heusen shirt and Sparky trouser. Appada, oru vazhiya ajayan dress eduthu mudithan. Have u now understand what Royal means? To wind up the day we had our usual beef rice and special milk and we went to bed.   Note:- ------- If i bored u with this blog, then u can very well  scold  valli, bcos she only mentioned that if i continuously send msgs in general then she ll rename my name. so who is going to take the honor of scolding her first?  a kind request, i dont know to use a better word in place of scolding, i searched in online dictionaries, even i had come up with lot of words, i dont know whether i can use them in this place or not, so pls post some synonyms for scolding with examples of where  how to use it. this is the nice opportunity for everyone, bcos in the examples u can use the name of the person whom u like(?) most. it is default that u all like(?) me most, so dont use my name, use some others name.
