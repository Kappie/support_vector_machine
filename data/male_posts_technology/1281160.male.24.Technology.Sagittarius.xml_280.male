Hope it’ll take few more days to get into the stream of blogging…. I hope kishore Gopalan is in his full swing in the blogger…ha ha.   My days are fine and rolling on here at chennai.   Had a nice time with all my “Natpu Thozhargal” during my sis marriage at trichy. Really its all the moments of enjoyment after a long gap, that too with all my chaps, or rather I wud say, my kith and kins  who had their time to spare with me in my sis marriage.   I will send u the snaps of the moments later...even I haven’t seen them yet.  Ok cutys, bye bye, Will get back to you people later…  Mahen.
