Of course, the pure of heart will use Linux and a  urlLink Mosix  cluster, avoiding the whole Mac business alltogether.  Home-brew  urlLink BLAST  servers anyone?  Interestingly, they use the same program ( urlLink POV-Ray ) to  urlLink test  their cluster that I did when I was keen on building Mosix clusters back in the day!  Also, apparently  urlLink these  crazy little cars are going to  urlLink start selling sometime this summer.   They sort of look like a duck to me, cool mind you, but cool like a duck.  I would probably still drive one (I'm sure girls would flock like mississippi-moths to a candle, after all Austin Powers drove  urlLink one  right?).  The real question is which  urlLink color ?  And do they come in a pack like skittles candies?
