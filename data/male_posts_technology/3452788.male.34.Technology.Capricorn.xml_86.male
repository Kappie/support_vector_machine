This film (like the first) has a very European feel to it, from the scenery to the shot selection to the soundtrack to the vehicles.  There are a few humorous turns, but they usually precede some bas-ass action by Bourne.  Matt Damon IS Bourne, without a doubt - another good acting job.    Not to give anything away, but you could tell after the first 10 minutes that the movie was in no way based on the book.  Having read all 3 books in the series, I know that they are interdependent on each other.  The way the movie started, it was clear that the remaining 90% of book number 2 and all of book 3 were no longer possible.  OK, fine, once I got over that, I enjoyed it.  I think I liked the first movie better because it was the first, and the audience discovered along with the characters what was happening.  In this one, the only person who doesn't know what is going on ... is Bourne.  The guy selling popcorn knew more than the main character did.  The premise was already in place from the first film, and the second added very little to the persona of Bourne, other than just another problem to solve for the same character.  I'm sure there is a film term for this plot device, but it is essentially "Wheels are alrady in motion, drop the poor schmuck into the situation and see if he gets ground up into a chicken pie".  The first movie was more true to Ludlum's novels in that regard.  Finally, some of the effects and chase scenes are simply beyond the realm of possibility, given the structural limits of funky Russian taxis against souped-up Mercedes sedans and the frailty of the human body.    Enough complaining, i'm being way too picky.  It was great!  B+.
