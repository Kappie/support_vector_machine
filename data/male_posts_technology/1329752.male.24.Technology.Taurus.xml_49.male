(misshuu), and the one i will never have: bgp01097977bg (misshuuu shoe mmuchh).    "You put the blue back in the sky You put the rainbow in my eyes A silver lining in my prayers And now there’s color everywhere You put the red back in the rose Just when I needed it the most You came along to show you care And now there’s color everywhere"    i got bitten by our dog yesterday. it was really an ouch to see my foot bleed. umm... i can handle the pain but the thing that freaks me is that i'm not quite sure if our dog have been vaccinated or not. now i'm observing myself for signs of rabbies infection. this will be less than 48 hours... well i'm not afraid to die, i just don't want to die because of stupid dog bite infection.  it'll make me feel so dumb.  the hell...    mang pedro: "ano kinamatay niyan?" mang buloy: "rabbies. nakagat ng aso... kawawa naman. (cute pa naman)." mang pedro: "tsk tsk tsk. oo nga. sayang...."      tangina.  nakuha ko pa mag joke eh'    "My life is so predictable Never any mystery But ever since you shined the light All of that history But now I have a hand to hold And a reason to believe, yeah There’s someone in my life worth living for I was hanging around just wishing on a star To put the happiness back in my heart      "You put the blue back in the sky You put the rainbow in my life A silver lining in my prayers And now there’s color everywhere You put the red back in the rose Just when I needed it the most You came along to show you care And now there’s color everywhere"
