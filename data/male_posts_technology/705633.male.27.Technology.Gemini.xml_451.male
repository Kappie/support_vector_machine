The idea is you're given a number and a bit of card, you talk to ten random girlies for two minutes each. At the end, if you like them you write a yes (or a no) next to their number. If there's two yes's between a guy and a girl then you go on a date.  Myself, Custard, Dougal, Baity and Captain Kirk all went along. What a laugh. Only me and Kirk did the dating thing, and there were some lovely girls there and it was good fun. One of them was a cow though - I sat down opposite her and she had this look on like.. "you're scum and you haven't got a hope with me"... so i said "Hey love.. shave the 'tache and drop the attitude and you might have a shot at the title!" :)  Then, as it always seems to do with us lot, things got a bit crazy.. shots and burning the credit card on champagne, silly... silly.. the latter part of the night is mostly a blur of schoolgirls and the floor of a taxi.  If you're wondering if I got a date, well.. that'd be telling wouldn't it ? :P
