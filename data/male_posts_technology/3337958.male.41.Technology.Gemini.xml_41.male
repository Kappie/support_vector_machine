I’ve begun to divide my friends with the same “ urlLink us versus them ” mentality that I believe the Bush supporters do, and I don’t care for that.  While I have a fair number of conservative friends,  I’ve begun to separate myself from Right Wingers with a ferocity that I once reserved for lepers, Amway salesmen and Alabama fans.  While this mentality doesn’t sit well with me emotionally, it does fit within the spirit of my overall  urlLink political convictions , and I think it may be a key to recovering the liberal faction of the political spectrum from the jaws of non-existence.  If we don’t fight the warmongers as if we’re in a war ourselves, we’ll be irrelevant before we know it.  It says something that we have settled on someone as milquetoast as Kerry, when we so recently had someone as dynamic as Clinton to lead the charge.  If Democrats had known at the onset of Clinton’s run what we know now (vis a vis his inability to keep his penis exclusively in his or his wife’s pants), we wouldn’t have even nominated him, and that’s a damn shame.
