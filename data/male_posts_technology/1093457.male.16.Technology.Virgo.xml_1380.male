To start a topic of conversation (becuase there doesnt seem to be one) what does everything think about our new presidents? Personally i think they deserved it and danny will get everything we want done, while andy is just a great guy. (did anyone realise Danny could sing? (i didnt)) I am also happy with the vice presidents. mainly because i like megan! Anyway i cant type loads, i got millions of things to do. Talk to you all soon.  have a good weekm Dave
