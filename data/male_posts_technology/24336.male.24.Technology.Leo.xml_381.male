Even with the money I will get for the old laptop, that is still a paycheck and a half!  Here are my requirements for a used laptop:  Pentium III (thus, 450MHz or better)  256 megs of ram  5 gig hard drive  14" or larger LCD screen that supports at least 1024x768  DVD drive  10/100 network port  A working battery!  All for under $750  If something like that shows up on eBay, I am all set.   urlLink These guys  just might have something I am looking for...
