I thought about this for a moment. Laugh? Cry? Commit suicide? Then the truth revealed itself to me: killing spree.  I know most people would go with something like "Backpack around Europe" or "Find true love," but think about it. I'm guaranteed to live "well and fully" for six months, which means I won't be going to jail or dropping in a hail of police bullets. Normally I have to face the fact that if I kill people, I might get into some kind of trouble. So that's my answer: 179 days of mayhem and violence, pillaging and plundering. To accomplish this, I think I'll need a horned viking helmet and a  urlLink Harley-Davidson   urlLink Fatboy  equipped with a scabbard on each side, one for my chainsaw and another for my flame-thrower.  On the 180th day I'd visit every church, temple, and mosque I could find and beg forgiveness from every god I could think of. Then I'd go for a banana daiquiri and calmly await the inevitable.  So, what would you do?  Terminal, out
