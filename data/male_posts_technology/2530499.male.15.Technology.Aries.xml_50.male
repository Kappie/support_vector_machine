Then we'll send you a suprise happy meal from Zackdonald's! (See Chugworth.)  I talked it over with JaQ:   (22:17:30) Jacque!!: That was not spontaneous. (22:17:45) Me.: What IS is and what WAS was! (22:17:47) Jacque!!: You liar. (22:17:52) Me.: See the colon? (22:17:55) Me.: :::::::! (22:18:01) Me.: That means I AM STILL BLOGGING! (22:18:03) Jacque!!: Oh Jesus... (22:18:11) Me.: So you have to disagree, but make it funny. (22:18:43) Jacque!!: And JaQ is going to wring your f[reaking] neck if you consider posting anything I say.
