I tried to call Karissa but apparently she was having an attitude and did not want to talk to me.    I tried 3 more times.  On the last try I got Karissa on the phone she said "Hi Daddy I don't want to talk to you right now" and hung up the phone.  Jeremey called back and gave the phone to Karissa.  She did not even say anything that time she just hung up.  It is good to see Lisa has taught Karissa well when it comes to phone etiquette.  If you can't get your way on the phone just hang up on them.
