It starts off bad with a couple of  urlLink Ben Affleck 's early lines sounding kind of stilted. I know there are many people who don't like him, but I generally do.  All throughout the beginning and middle part there are great individual scenes but for some reason they don't sum up well together. It does get better, however, in the last 20-30 minutes. Clichés abound, and the ending is a no-brainer, but the sweetness and some cleverness in their execution overcomes that.  To mention some of the characters,  urlLink Raquel Castro , playing the 7 year old daughter, plays her as being older than her years, something that works well.   urlLink Liv Tyler , whom I normally don't care for that much (except, of course, her Arwen-stint in Lord of the Rings), is really sweet and likeable. -->
