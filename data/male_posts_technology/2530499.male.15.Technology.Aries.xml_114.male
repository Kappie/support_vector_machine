PEBKAC!: KELLY KELLY KEEELLLLYY! KELLY2: YOU DON'T THINK IM IMPORTANT! PEBKAC!: What? KELLY2: i wasnt in your blog day at all! (At this point, DreamBeej knows she's kidding, but DreamBeej feels bad.) PEBKAC!: KELLY! You know you're one of the most important peeps in my life!  (Then I woke up.) [/end]  So, now I feel obligated to say:   KELLY GAVIN, YOU ARE AT 98%. DON'T WORRY. YOU'RE VERYUCKINGIMPORTANT TO ME.   I've come to dislike Linkin Park...PUNK MY ASS. They think they're cool because they can  SCREAM  into a microphone. WOW! SUCH TALENT!   Enough.  -beej
