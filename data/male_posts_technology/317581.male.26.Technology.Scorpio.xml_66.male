I used to be Zorf.  But I can't do it anymore.  My voice changed.  My youth is lost.  I have a 929.  Where are my Gordon Lightfoot LP's?  Frick!  I payed for them last week.  Argh!  What's the use of having a turntable.  I have tickets.  American Pie 2 is funny.  I'm going back to SPU.  I think.  Jebe is far away.  I wear pajamas to work.  Jeff is a cop.  I used to play the oboe.  Why do I have to look at my life as a timeline I need to plan to fill?  Why should I care what happens tomorrow?  Frick.  Frock.  Uncle Toad said you better straighten up right.  It'd be nice to have money.  I think I'm gonna become a nomad.  Don't beat me down.
