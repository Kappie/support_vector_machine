 This time i made a lasagna. My first. It was kosher -- i replaced the meat with mushrooms, which was a gamble, but came out really well. 
 The night after that i had some weird dreams -- first, that i'm a character in a Big Lebowski sequel, where Walter "Shomer-Shabbes" Sobchak becomes a cheese factory manager. And later, that i went to a trip with El'ad and forgot to take the food and had to come back and somehow made all the way to a supermarket in Moscow, where i had to choose between Gouda cheese and  urlLink beef jerky  ... Guess what i got.
