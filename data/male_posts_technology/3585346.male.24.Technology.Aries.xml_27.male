I have some fucker come to tell me " You so daring leh give up your job just to come out on your own, when he is the one in the first place asked me to come out" Anyway it is my decision and I will be responsible for my own decision. But I hate hypocrite.   Coming back to myself.....I finished smoking my last stick of ciggy at 3.30pm. And till now I have not smoke, I get tired of it and due to health reason I think it is better to try quitting now. It is tough especially without anyone by myside. But i will try.  For those single out there...Have you ever thought of having someone you like or you love by your side or in your arms quietly enjoying the peaceful quiet moment by the sea side or any place nice. It has been years since I last enjoy that. Sometime when you are extremely down, all you need is that someone to be by yourside and you feel better even without she/he saying anything or do anything. I dunno for ladies but sometimes guys do need that.   Frankly speaking I am hanging in there still.....Thing is not as easy as I initially planned....all lot of unexpected things happened. At the moment, I am pretty lost and confused. Think I shall go for a jog at the gym tomorrow.
