Not everyone was so glad today unfortunately.  At least some people weren't going to let a little thing like Friday get in the way of some serious road rage.    In the parking lot outside the office where i work, i bore witness to some Grade A road rage this afternoon.  I didn't see what caused it, but a car whipped into our parking lot, pulled a U-ey, and got cornered by this rather large delivery truck.  The next second, the delivery truck driver leaps out of the truck, runs over to the car and starts bawling out this guy with a car full of kids.  I'm assuming the guy with the kids must have cut off the truck driver at the intersection up the road, but whatever it was, he was getting a tongue-lashing for it.  Ah well, no punches thrown, and everyone lived happily ever after.  On a completely unrelated note, i've found out that Les Triplettes de Belleville is coming out on DVD next Tuesday and i'm PSYCHED!  I guess all of us 'anglophones' are calling it "Belleville Rendezvous".  For those who don't know, this is an independently produced animated feature out of Quebec.  I missed this one at the theatre, and i've been waiting not-so-patiently for it to come out.  There was a tiny tease of it at the Academy Awards in March when it was nominated for Best Original Song.  The visuals are really striking, and i hope it's critical success signals a shift in the way these films are produced.  But more on this after i've seen it on Tuesday.  I'm out.
