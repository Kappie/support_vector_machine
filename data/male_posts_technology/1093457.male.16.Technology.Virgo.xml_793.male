Well I've been working since I got home about 3.15 today, I literally finished 10 minutes ago, I've washed my hair, running a bath, going to dry my hair, then go online to chat to people until I feel that the time has come for me to retire to bed!  WEll today for homework I have had to write a piece on why Mussolini came to power, make notes on a chapter of geography on urbanisation, Research and do a piece on tides, learn the present tense in Spanish (regular an irregular), Do some french questions on a text then translate the whole of the text into English, 4 questions on Algorithms for Decision maths, and finally a whole exercise on manipulating surds (in the words of my teacher, "sounds vaguely obscene") for pure maths. Oh the joys! Well at least I am enjoying it atm!
