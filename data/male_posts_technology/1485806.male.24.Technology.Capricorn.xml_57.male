Because we were talking about how most Simply United Cell members except for Yun Hann, Siew Ching and Erin and of course Daniel.., have their blogs ..why not united these blogs together under one Blog. Simply United's blog aka Lord of the Blogs...and under it the Fellowship of the Blogs..which happens to be us. Yeah i know the name is lame...but it is kinda cool looking at it...the idea itself.  Siew Ching, of course a frequent visitor of our blogs , should of course..start her own blogs and of course Erin as well cause she got so much to share ...  The point of it all is that we have a unique culture in Simply United which is very different from the rest of the cells found in Simply United...the most unique of all have alredi been highlighted. Simply United have an online community where we all can find out about one another and encourage one another thru our blogs as well as the frequent readers.   So Keep it up..
