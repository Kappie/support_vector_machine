Hope your curiosity on who wrote "My Identity" was satisfied.  Manny, Sorry da, didn't get the mood to post anything on VVS. This week surely, there will be a few postings from me.  Started reading " urlLink Jack: Straight from the Gut " by Jack Welch, ex-CEO, General Electric. Got the book from Sri.   Guys, anyone planning to go to "Jay Jay". My advice: Don't. I learnt a lesson the hard way on Friday. First day, last show. The previous Tamil film I had seen in a theatre was "Rojakootam". After that, this one. No more watching tamil films in theatre here onwards. If it was a fifty rupees note in Rojakootam, this film features a hundred rupees note. I guess the next film that "Oscar" Ravichandran produces will feature a five-hundred or a thousand rupees note. The film is a total waste of time and money. And to think I skipped dinner to go to the movie makes me feel .....  The film is a straight copy from "Serendipity", shown on Zee MGM last month. The funny thing is that Nov. 7 saw the release of "Unnai Partha Naal Mudhal", Nov. 14 - "Jay Jay" and Nov. 21, "Ennaku 20, Unnaku 18" will be released. All three movies have been copied from "Serendipity".  If you think, you can watch the movie for Madhavan, it is a total waste of his talents. If you think you can watch the movie for the heroines, forget it. The music by Bharadwaj gets irritating after a couple of times. Location-wise, Kolkatta and Greece provide some succour. There is no comedy at all. Villains are totally pathetic and cliched.   If you have any hard feelings towards anyone, get them a ticket to this film and your revenge will never be such sweet.
