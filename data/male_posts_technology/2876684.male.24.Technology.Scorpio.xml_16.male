Well I've heard from my immigration agent that my residency application is nearing a result and I just handed in the last of the paperwork today - hopefully there'll be good news in the next few weeks!  Also been busy with the dojo move, we were digging up all the crap out the back today and I started reacting to all the dust *agh* and I was starting to feel REAL crap. Time and drugs helped get me back into shape before training though.  Kickboxing class tonight was pretty good - we're averaging about 20 people a class so it's pretty lively and has a good atmosphere. Oh, my partner for the night was the karate black belt who caught my eye some time back; she's started coming to kickboxing classes because she can't make the karate classes. Guess I'll be seeing more of her then... ;)
