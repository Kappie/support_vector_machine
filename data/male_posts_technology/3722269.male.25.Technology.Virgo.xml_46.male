Allblacks - you didnt play hard enough. merts' should've been in from the begining and byron, but hey - what would I know. And where's my mate that starts the fights? robinson is it? bah. Nevermind :D I rediscovered soft jubes today, yummo. My mate mike seems to be missing.. his tauranga mates are asking me if I know where he is - little disturbing, but I'm sure he'll turn up. I got a parcel from mum, across the ditch, which was nice, took over a month to get here air mail tho.. thats a bit ..odd. I've lost my scrabble buddie, she's lost her internet connection, gay as, beating yourself at scrabble just aint the same. Set my webcam up again but no one wants to see my ugly mug anyway, so meebles bleh! *pout* Great new series I'm downloading, a reality tv show I actually approve of, they've taken 6 amish people and 8 normal people, and popped them together. It's quite cool, and the amish chicks are quite hot ;) I wonder if I can pass for an Izekial? prolly not huh. Ahh well. Nite nite
