Ash came in as well for this special occasion, and with Brandt, the 4 of us were able to hammer out a newly designed verse for SOLAR, which needed the revamp. Link plays some sexy sax in it. Its very deep now, more the album closer I was hoping it would end up being.  We then did an improv jam, totally over 10 minutes of the four of us playing to a click. Very light, very jazz. Look for this song, now called CHATTING BIRDS, as the hidden track. Last but not least, we recorded tons of Link just playing sax for future use. Lots of incredible material to go through.  We then had a fun pac/poontang meal and drinks. Great stuff.  ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO was entertaining, but see LOST IN TRANSLATION immediately. NOW. Go. The Links, Danny-Boy, SO and myself checked it out tonight and its wonder ful. I love Scarlett Johanssen. She's a heartbreaker. In the theatre was the guitarist from Interpol with the muttonchop sideburns and let me tell you, he LIVES the gimmick. All I'm saying.
