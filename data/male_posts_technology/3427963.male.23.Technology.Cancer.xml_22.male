Some malays are very hardworking one.....well as for indians, some of them also very hardworking.   I was in a cab going back to office from SMU today, i saw two indians standing on the road divider looking thru a elevation device.( everytime u see construction workers looking thru something on a tripod??) Both of them wearing luminous vest and safety helmet....and i dont see any major construction nearby, and apparently, one of them was the supervisor of some kind teaching the other one to use the thingy. and the supervisor, he was actually holding a Hammer in one of his hand. Two indian guy, in the middle of the road, wearing safety helmet and one of them holding a hammer. Then this thot came into my mind, was the hammer used to knock the other indian's head who was actually learning to use the thingy when he made mistakes?? Maybe that explains the safety helmet which i dont see the neccessity of wearing one.  well so much for all the stupid stuff on races and Muslims.....was very busy as usual like last week and the week before last and the week before last, and before i know it, two more days before the weekend again....time passes super fast when u r busy....its like in a blink of an eye lah realli....Well, realli learnt a lot from my current job lah...gone thru a lot in such short time and i tell myself that all this is part of life and treat this as a training for my future endeavour. I can say that i'm truly lucky to be able to acquire this challenging job and be able to learn and also allowed to make mistakes and not get into deep shit. And of cos, i will definitely learn thru all the mistakes i had commited and pick up new skills and knowledge on the way.....Hopefully they will make me a better person in life and help me in my future business venture. Dont ask me what business i am going into cos i also dun know....i believe in chances and opportunities. So til my chances and opportunities pass by, i will have to keep learning and make sure that when the chances appears, the mistakes i made will help me by not repeating them again. Dun be afraid to make mistakes, learn from them. Mistakes are our teacher of life. Make mistakes while u r still young, cos when u grow older, it might be too late when forgiveness is not an option anymore.  cheers, Teddy (177155HY)
