Really need to get my breathing back in check someday.  I felt a bit kanchiong, because Sensei actually wanted John and I to just demo a bit on breakfall. Wah liew, I was so kanchiong I think I got really unnatural. Basically I felt very conscious tht there were a few pair of eyes on me. Sigh ... when the mind is not calm, the body naturally follows. I distinctly remembered a very cuckoo fall but at least I didn't hurt myself.  When the first hour was over, Angelo turned up to join us (he had missed Tue's class). Sensei told us she was going through some techniques for our 5th kyu grading. Argh ... imagine that. I was happy of course, but I still don't feel confident with it. But she also said she had to check the syllabus again so yesterday I think we only did some techniques which (may/may not) be inside for 5th kyu. Oh no. John said he'd be glad to help us train, and that we could meet up just before the grading (good ol' John!).  Well, anyway class went on and we did shihonage from gyaku hamni. Some tenchinage, iriminage amd kotegaishi/kotegaeshi (err ... dunno wats the right romanji spelling, need to check up someday when I can remember). Well, throughout all the throwing around, I got back my more normal ukemi than the cuckoo style I had demonstrated just earlier. Felt real comfortable about it then as well.  Anyway we ended by being uke for 2 beginners (Steve and Alex) who had just extended their training hours into the second hour with the seniors. Must admit, Steve seems to be picking up really comfortably. They were doing about four variations of kokyunage and we had to just keep rolling and rolling one after another. Good practice for both. At the end of the rools I did somehow manage to get a bit of my breath back.  Now that Aikido for the week is over, I'll have to concentrate on completing my essays and working on my VRML and VR projects now. OKOK, maybe I'll just revise a bit of bokken work with David once a twice each evening. But I gotta go home and prepare dinner for the house today. Hmm ... haven't quite thought over what I need to cook tonight yet. Hmmmm .... gotta go dig around the fridge.
