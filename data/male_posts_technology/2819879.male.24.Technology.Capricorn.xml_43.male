Hmm... maybe I do have to speed up a little, it's been 3 weeks already and i only lost 2kg.  I've seen people (My Cousin, Julian) lost 20+ kg over a period of time.  And seriously, salute to them.  For some of us, to lose weight in a healthy way is really not an easy path to take.  As it requires time, effort, resistance to food and many many other factors in order to succeed.  Losing weight is both a mental and physical game, and DAMN for how hard this game is.  It's just so not right - how come (generally) all the food that taste best to me are considered to be "bad food" to my health. There must be something wrong with my blueprint.  My designer should have designed me the way that whenever I do the stuff that pleases myself (without violates other people's rights, of course), I become healthier and healthier. Or, at least, when I'm trying to do something to damage myself, the warning siren should be more immediate and "LOUDER PLEASE!!". For example, when i'm already overweight, whenever I eat KFC chicken, make me puke asap...  Hmm... It's hard to deny that I wasn't complaining. But no, I wasn't complaining.  It's just something to think of... maybe this universe or "GOD" or supernatural force or whatever u calls it, works in mysterious ways that my puny little brain will never be able to understand its true purpose and reason.  And no, I'm not trying to understand it. Because I don't have wings, so I would never try to fly.  Until then...  P.S. If none of you understand what I'm talking about, it's okay, me either...
