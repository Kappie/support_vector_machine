I think nothing is more maddening than knowing a person is being profoundly less discerning than they are capable of being. Being handicapped is one thing, but laziness or selectivity is another. life deserves your complete attention here, folks. Bring all the intelligence you have to bear on each problem.  At least, attempt.
