Mage  was cancelled as one of the players decided to be lazy and not get her arse out of her house, despite being able to get a lift from the damn place, BY SOMEONE WHO LIVES THERE.  I decided, as it was only the second session, to cancel it until next week, and if she doesn't bother then, she is ejected from the game and I'll have to struggle on regardless.  Additionally, the return of the oft-delayed game was not as exciting as anticipated.  I can only hope it gets better.  And not much else has happened.   Aliens  is on tonight, which is a good thing... interesting to see the non-special edition again.
