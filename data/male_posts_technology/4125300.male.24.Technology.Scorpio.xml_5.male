Haven't packed at all, and need to pick up a cooler of some sorts for food, alcohol, water, etc.   Really getting quite excited!  Sounds like Phish is handling this well.  Reading reports of lots of extra tickets being sold at the gate, and this will be a good thing(tm), so crazy w00ks don't crash the gates.  Pity the guy that bought the ticket for $400 off of ebay however.   Stole my roommies Led Zeppelin CD.  Not exactly morning music, but I'm not complaining.  Realize rock has a rich history, and exploring it will require some time.   Also been listening to D.J. Icey(trance), Dubtribe(dub),  Norah Jones(blues),  GD, and Brothers Past.  Oh yea, and Phish I suppose.   Reading Diamond Age by Neil Stephenson.  Don't think I like it nearly as much as I did Cryptnomicon or Snow Crash.  Both of those were very clever -- not in the typical novelistic sense, but rather in observational and character humor.   Diamond Age has very little of this edgy humor, but still is enjoyable to read, and a page turner.
