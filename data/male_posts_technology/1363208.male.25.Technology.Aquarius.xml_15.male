I was really surprised and excited at the same time to know that the one time very popular Saga Artakusiad (a fantasy/fiction series by Ahmad Patria Abdullah) will be printed out again. No. Not the old Book 1 to Book 6. The book that will be published (currently from what I read, is still on the way) is Book 7. Never been published before. But the sad thing is, there's no reprint for the previous 6 books.  urlLink Search for Saga Artakusiad using Google.  You'll be very pleased. Ah... I'm a big fan of the series. Yay!
