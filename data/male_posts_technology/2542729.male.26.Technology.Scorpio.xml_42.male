Had some ups and some downs Leveled to the ground But I'm healed, oh I'm healed  Had to wrestle all night long Wondered what went wrong But I'm healed, oh I'm healed  Had some sunshine, some rain Heartache and some pain I'm healed, oh I'm healed  My God has touched me Delivered, He set my soul free My heart is mended, I'm whole again No chains are holding me Got my liberty, I am healed I'm healed today!   -- urlLink Jonathan Nelson  Purose: I'm Healed   I feel pretty good...purposeful in spite of the lack of things i've done since being back. The past two days i've been working on beautifying the yard. I've chopped down bamboo chutes, clipped down bushes, small trees, etc. Everything short of cutting the grass, which will prolly end up being a Wednesday job. Grass looks really green tho....healthy too. The only regret I have about the work i've done is I accidentally killed an unhatched bird :-(. I was clipping the bushes in the front yard yesterday and, truth be told, there are nests all over the place...but most of them are abandoned! Make it so bad, this nest only had one egg in it...well, to other news, i've submitted my resume for some positions at some Army bases (civil service) that could work out far better than i'd planned in the past. If one goes thru, i'd be able to stay in the NG or Reserves and still get quality work in my field. I'll be praying about the outcome, hoping that thru all things God will bless.  I've decided to create another hero on the Justice server on  urlLink City of Heroes  because my current mutant scrapper Rowen isn't the destructive badbutt I hoped he'd be by his level. He can't fly, has no long range attacks and I gave him a ponytail 'n glasses. This new one, Nyghtrage still can't fly but he has excellent long range attacks (all electrical), a solid hand to hand melee game and a fantastic look! Check him out,  urlLink Nyghtrage is hot!  It was a trip too...these chicks invited me to fight on their team...3 women and a dude! They had their pink  purple colors...and they were lily white. Me with my whole dark thing goin on...we were kicking butt tho. I recommend this game to video game lovers  novices because it is truly engrossing! U can spend hours playing  not even realizing it! Speak of the devil, time to play some more :p
