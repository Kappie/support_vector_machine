A biography of Che Guevara, it chronicles his life, from birth to death, his experiences as he travels, fights and governs, his family life and his views.  I was gonna write a brief summary but realised that even a brief one would be quite long and take too much time. So read  this instead . It seems accurate even though it's more brief than I would have wished.  It's an interesting book about a subject I really had no previous knowledge of (all I knew was that he was a revolutionary, that he was dead and that he was active in Latin America). It's a long book (ca 1050 pages) and sometimes it gets a bit bogged down in details. But in a book like this, I'd rather have that over brevity and summary.  I'm bumping Latin and South America to the top of my areas-to-read-about-list.   -->
