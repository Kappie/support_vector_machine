We should be in for some interesting music for the next album after 'Off the Deep End'. I guess it's no surprise that Rick would switch to pop. His music has always had a dance edge to it since his dance club days. With 'Off the Deep End' finally ready to makes it debut there has been word that the produciton of that album took a very large toll on the musician. He hasn't said anything publically yet about the work, but we can expect a press release when the album is ready for release.  Rumor has it Rick has also been working on the side with his friend Victor who is a producer. We're hoping to get more on this soon!
