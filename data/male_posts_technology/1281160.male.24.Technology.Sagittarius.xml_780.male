My parents, my sis and we both went in a car from Kumbakonam. So we had a pleasant journey and the climate was also very good.  First day, it was raining but still so enjoyable and the second day, it was sunny, but not scorching.   And in all temples we had a heartful dharshan. It was a satisfying trip for us. Especially we went to  urlLink Airadeeswarar  temple in Tarasuram. U cant just imagine the richness our ancestors have showered in the form of sculpture there. Simply beautiful u know. Full of  urlLink pillars  high in beautifully carved dance postures, fighting postures, all great saints, lords, and there were some very good sculpture which i think are worth sharing with u people.   There was one sculpture, where in there is a head of a women and four bodies, which are sculpted in such a way that which so ever way u look, the head is attached to any one of the body. Really so nice.  One more sculpture namely  urlLink Gajasamhara murthy  in Tamil, shows that Lord shiva is coming out from the inside of an Elephant. There are similar kind of sculptures found in Belur Temple and in Meenakshi amman temple too. The one which i have provided here as link is the one found in Belur. But the one which i found in Tarasuram was the most beautiful of all the three. I am sorry since i dint take snaps, i couldnt provide u one found at Tarasuram. It so gracefully shows how Lord Shiva tears out of the stomach of a mighty elephant like that of a tearing a Banana leaf and stepping on the head of that monstrous thing as stepping out of the bed (sombal murikira maathiri kai vachirukkar) It was really a thing to watch.Expressions on the face was infinite!  To end this blog, here are some mystic lines which held me most!   Overpassing lines that please the outward eyes   But hide the sight of that which lives within   Sculpture and painting concentrated sense   Upon an inner vision's motionless verge,   Revealed a figure of the invisible,   Unveiled all Nature's meaning in a form,   Or caught into a body the Divine.
