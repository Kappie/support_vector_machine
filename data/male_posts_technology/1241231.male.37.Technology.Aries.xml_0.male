To start with, some favourite quotes on the US and foreign policy:  "The enormous gap between what US leaders do in the world and what Americans think their leaders are doing is one of the great propaganda accomplishments of the dominant political mythology. " -- Michael Parenti, political scientist and author  Never before in modern history has acountry dominated the earth so totally as the United States does today. America is now the Schwarzenegger of international politics: showing of fmuscles, obtrusive, intimidating. The Americans, in the absence of limits put to them by anybody or anything, act as if they own a kind of blank check in their McWorld. -- Der Spiegel, Germany's leading newsmagazine, 1997   I will never apologize for the United States  of America.  I don't care what the facts are. -- George Bush,  Speaking as vice president in the context of the shooting down of an Iranian passenger plane by an American ship, taking 290 lives, Newsweek, August 15, 1988  Throughout the world, on any given day, a man, woman or child is likely to be displaced,tortured,killed or "disappeared", at the hands of governments or armed political groups.   More often than not, the United States shares the blame. --   Amnesty International, 1996  "Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger." -- Herman Goering at the Nuremberg Trials
