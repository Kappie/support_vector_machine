We just spent the last few hours recording Greg "Slo' Hand" Lucas on the guitar. He's adding that dirty chem guitar sound that the kids love. Jared jumps for joy. Jamie, Jared, and I took a section of a song omitted from the album and turned it into some chemlab goodness. Maybe it will make it onto the album. Jared's voice is in fine shape, he's two songs and a few overdubs away from wrapping the vox up for this beeyotch. Phrase of the day is "Velveteen Pouch". Don't ask. Crackhouse is always a fun place to hang out and work and the Novak/Brittion clan are excellent hosts who take good care of their guests. And yes, the new Acumen record is as dirty and nasty and as hard as Jason promised. My poor ears. Good friends, good times, good music being made...home tomorrow.  F
