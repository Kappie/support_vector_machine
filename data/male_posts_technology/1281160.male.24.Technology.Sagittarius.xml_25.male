But "  the best laid plans of mice and men oft go awry  " came true. this is what actually happened...    Saturday  -> Came in at 8:30 am (supposed to be in at 8:00),  worked  ... , left office by 12:30 am. 	  Sunday  -> Came in again at 11:30 am,  worked  ... , left office by 11:45 pm  That's it.  Jax.
