I even accepted the job I was offered but I still remain highly sceptical about it; put it this way if I don't like it or feel I'm being set-up I'm off. Also if told to be a 'gate keepr' role I'll do just that and expect to be backed up when people try to 'go around the side door' etc and not use procedures!  Keep the faith and keep comping
