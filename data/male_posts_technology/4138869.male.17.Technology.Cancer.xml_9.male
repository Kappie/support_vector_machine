Feel free to lend me a hand in any of these areas. I'm open to all suggestions.   Concept art  Drawings, 3d renders, paintings. Everything that somehow visually describes the mood, the setting, characters or the plot in the game.   Concept texts  Short stories, novels, poems, one-line-mood-setters, conversations and character descriptions. Everything that by text describes the mood, the setting, characters or plot elements in the game. I've already written one short story in a previous post. It doesn't have to be something actually usable in the game.   Story outlines   How the player progress through the story. What happens and when, and in what sequence. What has happened before and what will happen. It can be a rough outline or detailed descriptions.   Musical/sound themes  What kind of sounds should be used? What kind of music? Create new sounds and music, or put up a reference to a CD track that fits the mood perfectly. When should the different musical pieces be used? Does it change (moody piano to Aphex Twin) when the plot twists, or should an ongoing theme (think StarWars) be used? How should voices be used, and what would they say?   Scenes   Any good idea to any scene a player would experience should be written down. Include descriptions, how the player experiences it, sounds and music, changes in vision. It can be both closely related to the story and just a good scene to experience at any time.  I'll start doing all of these myself, but if anyone reading this wants to help; feel free to do so. I'd be happy to include any creative thought, idea or contribution. My talent is programming, not writing.
