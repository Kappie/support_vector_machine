And my parents have change the status for the Davis Deportation to 100%, that means, yes, I am going to germany(Hell Yesers). I am still having fun with Linux and, OH OH OH, I bought the Rocky Horror Picture Show DVD, havent had time to watch it yet but now I can watch it when ever I want(hellz yes). I also decided that I would be dooing the BRAG(Bike Ride Across Georgia) to get rid of my P.E unit, It's 400 miles in seven days. I also checked the prices for Alienware laptops and now have a goal to save up for. I also re-inserted my dvd player into my computer and decided to install freevo(TivO excet free and for linux) But am having some trouble with that BUT i'll live with it. So till next time
