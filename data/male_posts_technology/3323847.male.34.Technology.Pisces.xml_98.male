What this "nStant Media" basically does is give you the ability to use your machine (most like a laptop or tablet PC) as a media player  without  having to fully load an operating system (i.e. Windows 95/98/XP/SE, Linux, MacOS).  Thus, if you're just interested in playing a DVD on your laptop, you can boot up to this nStant Media thingy and watch your DVD - instead of going through the arduous task of booting XP, logging in and running your DVD player of choice.  I'd expect to see more things like this cropping up in laptops within the next year.
