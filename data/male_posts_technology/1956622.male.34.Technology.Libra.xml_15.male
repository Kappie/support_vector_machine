Of course she still blames me and now her sister-in-law for the misfortunes in her life!  Of course the finger of blame never points at herself.   Maybe the saying when you point the finger at someone there are 3 fingers pointing back applies in this case.  I called my daughter today and had a con-call going with her Aunt and Uncle. The call did not last very long Karissa I think had issues with the aunt and uncle being on the phone and it made her sad.  Of course she handed the phone to her mommy and Mommy would not talk to anyone.  She is a big girl these days and does not like conflict.  Of course she spends a lot of time creating conflict so I am not sure where that bunch of BS came from.
