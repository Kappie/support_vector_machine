You look out at 6-inch surf and think to yourself "You know....maybe I could ride that......just maybe....." Drives you kind of crazy in the end, especially if you try to ride those ankle-slappers!    So I turn to upgrading the  urlLink weather service  on the site. It's now actually a really handy page cause you can see at a glance what the next five days are going to be like. If you've got a mobile phone with a color screen you can access these images on your phone by going to http://www.corksurf.com/wap/ You may need to clear your phones browser cache to make sure you're looking at the latest version, on some phones there's a menu option for this, I just switch off my phone and switch it back on again. A small inconvenience for the benefits of getting the charts when you're in the pub.     I've also done some work on a new version of the chatterbox, one that will actually archive what you people have to say rather than just spit it out. You'll be able to search the archive and relive the banter. Or at least that's the idea.    Looks like there might be some windslop later tonight.... I think I might be able to ride that....
