But since that revelation about She, and what we share, I've been over that.  I've gone past the past, as it were.    But now my thougths turn more and more to the future.  Could, for example, She and I have found each other, made such a profound impact upon each other, but yet be destined to stay apart for the rest of our lives?  Surely not, says I.  Surely we're destined to be together someday, aren't we?  Well, I had a though on that score.  I am a firm believer in past lives and reincarnation.  Not only that, but I am of the school that says that between lives, you plot out what you want to happen in the next one.  Certain way points along the path that you'll meet in your efforts to learn the things you need to learn.  Kinda pre-destination lite.  She believes in pretty much the same thing.  That being said, I think that what this means is that we've set everything out.  I think it's all set up.  I think that we will be together someday, because I think that's what we laid out before either of us was even born.  So now, my mind is forever turning that way:  So *when* will this happen?  *How* will it come about?  I'm terrible.  I just get past one and get caught up in another.  I have to learn to live in the here and now, and that's the trick.  How much do I  urlLink love life ?  7
