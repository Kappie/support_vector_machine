They wanted a sleepover in the living room but I said nada, considering it was already after 10 p.m.   I asked them this morning and they seem to sleep good as well. I think I will try to go watch shrek 2 with them today. Kelli (wife) has to go into work for some time today, I personally dare not even look at my buisiness email yet, as I will feel like I will have to do work. So rather than have the feeling we are home, ok vacation is over, I am going to try to keep us going on the good times. Reality is all too near in the future, back to the ball and grime, penny pinching, you get the drill.   I checked Yahoo on Shrek 2 reviews and see that most state the story was half way done as the first, but I think the kids will love it anyway.   I still havent had a chance to check out Quantum Leap. I will probably watch that tonight when everyone else crashes. Currently catching up on Laundry from the trip. We pretty much  have everything else put away. Since we cleaned the house real good prior of leaving for the trip, we didnt have a messy house to come home to, which was nice.   We will also get our dogs back today. Our Aunt babysitted them while we were away.   Better go fix some breakfast, my son already is watching the DinoThunder PowerRanger dvd again.
