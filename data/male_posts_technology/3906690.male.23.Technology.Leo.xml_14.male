I doubt there will be much posted on this thing..Then again I may be wrong. *shrugs* I figure I'll post whatever...Probably mostly my writings, lyrics/poems or whatever. Not sure what they're called, but they seem more...Poetry structured I guess, but I call them lyrics. With that said, I will post my first "BLEH" that I wrote out of boredom. Oh, it's untitled..Haven’t thought of a title yet. I will someday. I've also got the music that goes along with this piece, not recorded, but in my mind. It's bad@ss. I will also be working on my template or whatever for this blog, right now it is cheesy looking. In a couple of weeks it should be better. I don't have much else to say, except that I had a fucked up weekend..*FUCKERS*  *UNTITLED* Once again Im just killing time Just throwin it all away Left behind Im bored to tears Too numb to cry I am hated Living through hells wrath Aint life grand 22 steps to nowhere the damage has begun hey you peddlers of the night bringer of termination what the hell are you lookin for you wont find it here no way... the things you do I refuse to bowdown fuck you fear me I am stronger than death Copyright © 2004 SJohnson
