The only problem with a cocktail party is you have to actually organise the thing properly and tell people what to bring, otherwise they all bring bottles of vodka. There's only so many variations of vodka and ice you can have, so a bit of organisation was needed. Paul, Debs and myself put a list of about 22 people together for the nights drinks and the price was pretty much a bottle a head. it may seem a bit excessive, but last cocktail party we ran out of booze and I'm not going through that again. [shudder]  So we got about Â£30 [AUS$75] worth of mixers to go with all the alcohol and a couple of blenders to make sure we could get through it all.  The verdict?  A raging success. The night consisted of  Cocktails: Black/White russions Blue Lagoons Fruit Fizz Yellow Submarine Caparinia WooWoos [my personal favourite, Vodka, Peach schnapps and cranberry juice]  BushWackers Mudslide  Shots: Cowboy Cocksuckers Cunnilingus Small Guiness'  Well. That was what we were supposed to be making. I kept to the format pretty well as I was the main cocktail maker for the first couple of hours. But I got tired and wanted to chat to some more friends who had just come in, so I left it. I got about two steps when someone said that knew a great cocktail and reached for the baileys and blue caracao.  I did NOT want to try the result and ran.  Casualties for the night? Well, for once we didn't break a glass. The Satan glasses were everyones favourites to drink from for the night. Well. Apart form the plastic peanut bowl the Paul and Debs got me for a cocktail drink. Very messy.  However, we did have one broken chair and a number of scorche marks"through" the carpet. Mental note. Don't break out the sheesha when the only people using it are going to be pissed out of their brain. Hot Coal and cheap carpet are not the best of friends. That might be a bit tricky to explain to the mangement, but I'm sure we can blag it.  I don't want to even talk about the state of the Kitchen. It was akin to a sweet sticky Chenobyl.  We managed to go through: 3.5 bottles of kahlua 3 bottles of peach schnapps 1 bottle of butterscotch schnapps 2 bottles of baileys 1 bottle of blue caracao 1 bottle of cechaca 1 litre of gin 5 LITRES of vodka.  So yes. A good night. I can wait a little until our next cocktail party I think.
