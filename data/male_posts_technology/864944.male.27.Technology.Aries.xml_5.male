Nuff said  :)  Chris.. you and Barbara ROCK!  ----  I got a note from Dee, a old friend from school, this past weekend.  My first reunion thanks to this blog :)  Dee is a peach of a woman who all but completely runs the day to day operations of the  urlLink Student Senate of the University of Rhode Island , a body I served on for two years.  Dee had spread the rumor that she would finally retire from her position after my senior year at school, but apparently she is a glutton for punishment, and has remained to keep another student government from shooting itself in the ass.  *good luck*  ;p  Seriously though, it was great to hear from her and hear how some other x-senators are faring in life after college.  ----  Christina (my lovely fiance) and I have made plans to head to the White Mountains this weekend.  I have been wanting to go camping all summer, and now that fall is here, we finally found the time to scrape together.  The plan is to stay at a campground in Glen, NH, and on Saturday morning, drive to the base of Mt. WAshington, and see how far we get hiking up it.   I plan on limiting us based on ability (we may get too tired.. it is said to be a moderate to strenuous hike), time, and weather.   If any of those conditions get too tough, we will turn around.. drive back to our happy family campground, and call it a day.   I look forward to a challenging hike, and some time away from tvs and computers.  Oh.. and I want to poke a fire with a stick.   Yes.. its the simple things :)   My link for you today (not that i will always have one mind you) is  urlLink http://www.gorp.com .   This site is pretty nice for all your outdoor needs.  You can shop (i hear prices are very good *even used stuff!*), plan trips, or just find general information.  If you sign up (free) they even print you topographical hiking maps.. VERY nice feature.  Here is the trail we plan to hike:  urlLink http://gorptools.gorp.com/gorpApps/trails/trails_template.asp?trailid=3478  And info on the White Mountains in general:  urlLink http://gorp.com/gorp/resource/us_national_forest/nh_white.htm
