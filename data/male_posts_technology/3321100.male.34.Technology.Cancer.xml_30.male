It was the first time since I've been riding trial bikes that I have fallen like this. In fact I really flew on the air for 1 or 2 seconds, after this, I had hit the rock again and my motorbike fell on me, hurting my leg. My best friend who waited while I climbed the rock ran to help me, his face was as white as a sheet, he was frightened and he took me in his arms, until he was sure I hadn't broken anything. I don't think I can ride my motorbike for another two weeks, because I had problems walking today.  I'll remember this day really well only because I didn't have time to be afraid and because I know that all my friends will talk about this fall like "the best fall of the year 2004". I sincerely hope it will be the best fall of my life. I need to be more cautious next time, I was lucky last time, thank my lucky stars.    Corrected by Mike da hat;)
