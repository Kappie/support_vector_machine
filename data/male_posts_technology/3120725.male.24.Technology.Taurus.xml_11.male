I being a subcontractor for one of their large and horribly mismanaged contracts had my pay cut, while other subcontractor were forced to slash their work forces by as much as 44%.  This has put me in a unique position to give very helpful advice.  Now I can’t speak for EDS’s other projects only the one I work on, and if they handle their other contracts they way they handle this one people should sell their stock now and invest in helmets for the handicapped.  Here’s a list of helpful tips to get EDS back on track.  o	Don’t make the most drastic cuts in the information security department, firing the people who know all your secrets and are now in desperate need of money is not good thinking.  o	It’s really not good for employee morale to cut pay then ask them to take up the slack for people they fired.  We tend to get bitchy and work quality mysteriously degrades.  o	Don’t ask employees to take pay cuts, and then ask them to work harder so that upper management can get performance bonuses.  If you do, don’t whine when they call you Weasel Fucking Bastards, it’s how the game is played.  o	Don’t sign contracts that calls for you to pay $400 for maintenance on light bulbs.  It makes you look retarded.  o	Communication between departments is a good thing.  Despite what you think we are actually working with each other and not plotting a bloody coup.  o	If you have information that can help your people do their jobs better, give it to them.  Do not treat like treasure and bury it.  o	Pay cuts should start at the top, where the piss poor management happens.  Don’t punish employees and subcontractors because you hired your semi-retarded nephew who doesn’t know the first thing about managing a multibillion-dollar contract.  EDS just follow these simple tips and your stock will rise, and the revolution will be quelled.
