USA had a special Deadzone marathon that I was able to tape one weekend to catch up on the first season I missed. Since that time I have seen all of them. My wife even bought the 1st season DVD set for me on Valentines day this year. I see  that the second season is being release June 8th. Wife if you read this, hint hint. ; )  The official Dead Zone webpage is  urlLink Here . I try to watch this and Monk. Not much else on the television for me, other than Fox News and The Orielly Factor.  So those that don't have a clue on this show then check the website and go find the Season one at blockbuster or something. heh heh
