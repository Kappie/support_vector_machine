Project report for 1. If u guys are interested, I'll just upload the thingy somewhere. But you'll need to download a plugin for your browser to be able to view VRML. I didn't manage to have time to integrate these into Java (heard it takes a whole lot of time so I decided to forego it, no point spending that amount of time when it's just 4 buttons to press around.)  A lot of stuff has been happening this past week. Aikido, work, house, friends. I'll share them later coz ... today is the LAST DAY OF SCHOOL!!!!! I need to clear some stuff and photocopy some notes so I can start my lessons next week. Hate to come running to school and waste time doing all these during holidays. If I have to come, I'd much rather it was productive rather organising all the shitty stuff mentioned above.  Ja mata.
