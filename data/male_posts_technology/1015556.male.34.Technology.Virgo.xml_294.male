And I'm not a great traveller first thing in the morning.  Heck, I'm not a great anything first thing in the morning.  Anyway, to the Origins conference tomorrow.  It should be great once I get over the initial travelling issues... Pray for the fam if you think of it.  Everytime I travel for ministry, something very odd happens around the house.  One summer it was a tornado that flipped a glass patio table.  Anyway, the Enemy knows....
