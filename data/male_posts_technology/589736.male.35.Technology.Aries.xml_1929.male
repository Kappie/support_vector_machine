The FAA has specific requirements for the grades (steepness) of runways, taxiways and the areas surrounding them to provide a safe operational environment.  Local, state, and Federal requirements then dictate that the designs be accomplished with the smallest amount of impcat to waters of the US, wetlands, and forests (especially in Maryland - the tree is as holy as cows are in India).  It all ends up being a balancing act of safe environment, limited environmental impacts, and minimizing costs (which are 95% funded by the FAA).  In the end, the owner usually does not have too much input on the specifics of how something is done, after all that is what they are paying me for.  They just want their new runway (in this case) and leave the details to us.  To answewr your question, we go to the middle ground as much as possible, if for no other reason than it is legally required.  If I did not have these restrictions, my job would be much easier, but also way more boring.    It is kind of funny because in WWII there were alot of airfield constructed.  In Virginia alone Norfolk, Richmond, Newport News, Roanoke, Suffolk, Franklin, West Point, Emporia, Petersburg, Accomack, and Danville were all constructed in the early 1940's.  For the most part these were built by the Army on swamp land.  Today, they would never be built, because of all the wetland (swamp) impacts.  The group that oversees wetlands?  The US Army Corps of Engineers.  How's that for irony?
