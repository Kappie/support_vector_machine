One of those moments when you have to face the undeniable truth.To make matters worse , loads of other people also ask for your snap as if they can't just look up at my face. It's as though they tell you..."see that" ..."its what we have to look at day in and day out".    It should be stopped i decry.Neverthless i still get my snap done. Hope is what drives me. Everytime i get the developed copies there's a techie acronom that jumps up at me "WYSIWYG" is such a complete description of it.    To make matters worse there was this cousin of mine who was hell bent on picking up one of my snaps. I was sure she was about to take it to her town and tell her friends..."look at this" ..there are people who look worse than my brother.    Everytime i thot of looking worse than Chintu...i shuddered...that had to be really bad...and then there was the moment of temporary joy...i didnt have to look at myself.......    Oh depravation has solutions and a silver lining too.....that happens...when i get to see other's snaps......its like asking yourself....can technology improve this thing.......    Then there are specifications....and complications that go hand in hand with every request. Nowadays with everyone asking for foto identification i keep getting this horrible dream about all these guys huddling together in a room..and laughing their guts out....    In any case the story is about five years old when my dad asked me to get a snap done for my passport , at the end of the statement he clenched his fists....and bore down upon me..."get the negatives too and do it today " he growled.    Imperatives in the form of impending tv programs and a few games of cricket at soma ate up my time like some grouchy whale. Having had a blast with over three scores of 30 that evening , the thought of the task on hand slipped away like an eel in buttered fingers.    As i sauntered back home .....contemplating the usual sequence of lies that delayed my return , i bumped into my dad on the stairs. Now this was unexpected and threw my thoughts out of sequence. While i had focussed on answering the question " Why are you late" , my dad raised his palms in knowing certainity and like a stress interview at the iim's " Have you taken the foto " he asked doubtfully.         A clenched fist and an angry dad are worse than Gilchrist in flow , so unfailing ly and involuntarily nodded my head.This took him by surprise and that gave me more steam, you thought i wouldnt have done it did'nt ya" i chattered. Maybe is hould have stopped but i taunted him a little more and again another unexpected question."When will you get it ?". The answer had to be the next day , no other answer would convince him , he was too smart. Tomorrow , i smiled and rushed up. Having averted a disaster temporarily i was relieved , but I knew there was work to be done.    The next day was going to be a long one, so i suspended all work for the night and to plan for the next day hit the sack ealry and woke up late , already on the back foot....i told myself.    5.30pm was deadline. I tried not to think about it till noon and spent my time watching the most boring of vijay flicks , like food on a hungry stomach , the movie was rivetting....and suddenly i glanced up at the clock. It was 2.30. No ways ....there was no technology in the year '99 that delivered foto's with a negative within an hour.Not one to accept defeat.....i ran to the nearest studio and got a polaroid snap clicked.The logical step was to tackle the issue of the negative , I hastily scrawled a number on the cover and walked back home, a plan was brewing.    "Here" i held out my hand, four snaps and "here's the number for the negative" i said. "Number" appa looked down quizzically. Yes some new system, he maintains negatives and gives you copies if you quote the number i fibbed. Nice business model i threw in...for good measure. He turned the snaps over...."are these polaroid" he glared.    I froze in my tracks. He knew he always knows."Never give up " i told my self. Nope , i said , What is polaroid? i questioned. If there was an oscar nearby , the academy would have readily parted with it.    A few months the issue crept under the carpet , for i didnt need the fotos.Suddenly one day it was time for them again and as fate would have it , the guy at the passport office remembered he had six sisters and so thought he loved the number six.....and wanted to respect the number. I happened to pass by his counter then , six foto's he snarled.....sir...but i have four....and i have been in the queue for the last six hours i pleaded. Another six...definitely six snaps....he told himself...and mentally wrote himself a reminder ....should check with the astrologer...maybe its my lucky number.    Thus i was back home...and like all of us...i turned to my dad for solace....he wants six snaps i said......he looked at me...and for a minute i thought i saw a small smile cross his face...but u have the number you can go get the copies.    "Number what number" ...i quipped...then it all came rolling back in a wave.........oh that number...ya so simplee......i smiled...and walked out...I think i must have kicked the gate 14 times ........i swore i wouldnt lie........    But never one to give up....i had to wear the same dress and get another polaroid done.......but one small problem.....the spectacles i had worn in the last snap......had decided to give one side of the frame..retirement benefits..........and suddenly....the world was coming to an end.......    Okie to cut an already long story short...i did get the snap done with a broken specs and an angled face......somehting my dad figured out..but what he still cant figure out is how i got copies to a polaroid....snap.........         But if your a lady readin this...all i can say is I'm not Mr.Photogenic....so lets meet up for coffee.....with me pickin up the tab you can make an informed decision...;)
