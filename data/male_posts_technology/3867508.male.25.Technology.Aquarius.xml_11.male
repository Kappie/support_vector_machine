Here's the latest:   urlLink AlterNet: Election 2004: GOP and Nader sittin' in a tree...in Michigan     Well it looks like Nader is going to get on the ballot in the swing state of Michigan. He got the necessary 40,000 signatures. Not too long ago he only had 6,000 signatures of his own. Where did the rest come from? The good old GOP. The GOP claim that they believe in the importance of third party candidates. O-K.   Michigan was going for Kerry in the latest polls that did not include Ralph Nader, but now most likely that will no longer be the case, the 17 electoral votes may go to Bush.   Here's what Nader spokesmanKevin Zeese had to say:   "We have to get on the ballot somehow."  Yeah and that is why I no longer have any respect for Ralph Nader.
