Did a lot of practice in terms of proper atemi, combining intent with momentum, flowiness, etc. Both from uke and nage's point of view. It was good. But I think it still took some getting used to because most of us usually did things really slowly. Too slow in fact to be considered proper practice. Like he said, if uke doesn't come in properly, it doesn't benefit either one.  Classes today was quite horrendous. Had to scold 3 out of 4 of the classes I took today. But the good class was exceptional and by far the most obedient so far. Told them about it and asked them to give themselves a round of applause. Haha...  The naughty ones, 2 of which were the older ones in Pri 3. Seriously man, at that age, they feel like they know enough things to be able to take a lot of short cuts and start ignoring instructions. Had to raise my voice at them a few times. Luckily Tracey gave me off tomorrow and school holiday starts next week. I can take the 1 week break itself to rest my voice as I've been feeling a bit of sore throat coming up since 2 days ago. Sigh ... can't imagine how I'll need to discipline the older batch of students later a on.
