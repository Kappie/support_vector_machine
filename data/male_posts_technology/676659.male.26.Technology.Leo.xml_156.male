I had to borrow from a dormate nga na connect na ya sang isp namon diri sa dorm. O well, i'm not that much of a "techy" pa naman a. Diba ren? Hehe. Dasiga na di bala lakat para kagwa ta di. Daw feeling ko indi nagid ninyo ko love. Naks. Hehe. =) O well, i'm dying here because of schoolwork. I can't believe how fast summer goes. @ chapters on sociology in a matter of days and a really long test this friday na. Not to mention studying -pa for my "Literature of the Phils." subject. Man, all the more i'm hating filipino. =)   To the bacolod people, musta na da kamo. Hows BTCC doing. You'd better promise me sa pagbalik ko mas nag-improve nagid ta. Or else mahibi gid ko. Kumusta na da ang mga leaders. Ren, since hambal mo sakon mas free ka magtok over blog then answer me some of these ?'s. How were you able to be sure nga mafull-time ka? Was there ever a time nga nagdoubt ka about going full time? (Btw, in case your wondering, no i'm not doubting but please answer the ?'s lang, thanks gid.) Kumusta na da gli knday gemz, gigi, isis, laurz, ,elissa, michy and the other women? How bout the guys? Pray gid da kamo for andrew ha. I can tell you nga budlay gid life diri ya. He needs all the covering he can get. I need as much covering as i can get.  Guys, congatulate edmar and his little bro raymund. They got baptized kagina sa prince david (Condo where ptr. johnny and atsi len lives in). Ed, happy gid ko nga kamo ni shote mo nagdecide nga mapabaptize. And I am really looking forward to work together with you in the immediate future. :p And i'm also looking forward to the many lagaws that we will be having together. Btw, God bless gali para sa treatment mo this coming week. Hope everything turns out fine. Maybe you can spend the time meditating on some issues, huh? =)  Well, i guess i'll have to end here for now. Dunno when I can be online again. I hope the dorm isp can get be connected asap (NO!!!!! I AM NOT A TECHY!!! Hehe) And ker, kung abi mo ang mga suya ko is just my way of harassing you, well ma-apologize na lang gid ko daan kay amo lang gid ko na ya. Sunluganon loang gid ko nga tawo. Ask everybody. God bless all of you guys. To the FCCF delagates, hope that I'll be able to meet with you guys while you are here.
