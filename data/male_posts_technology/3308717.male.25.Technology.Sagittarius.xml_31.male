It also comes with a lot of the development hardware and software. It's labled as the "Japanese TV Game Museum Collection Set" and spans around 20 years of video gaming history.  So if any of you feel like owning my soul, just get this for me and I'll be your slave for quite some time. Well, whenever I am not occupied with the merchandise. =)   -intX    Sorry, but the princess is in another castle.
