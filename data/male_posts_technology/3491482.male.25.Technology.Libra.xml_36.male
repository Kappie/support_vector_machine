One of the problems with current speech recognition is that people around you can hear what you're 'typing', which distracts the dictator who is worried about sounding stupid and having to constantly correct themselves (I know I'm glad nobody watches me type) and distracts the eavesdropper, who should really be focussing on their own work.  I want one.
