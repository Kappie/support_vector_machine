I got this letter in the mail this morning:  urlLink    (Click for a full size picture)  I phoned a few people for advise and then called the golden pages to talk to the guy and found out there was no-one there by that name... So what do I do next? Well, Karl hadn't turned his phone on yet (he was off shagging last night) so I had left him some messages before I found out it was a prank and I decided to not tell him that it was a prank.. Kept him freaked out all the way into the office and then when he got in I explained that the fact we were a limited company put some awkard new angles to the whole situation and that the company secretary (Karl) had to phone Mr. A. Lyon (their legal guy) at a phone number I gave him.. When he phoned he got through to the Dubiln Zoo :)  It was a fun morning I have to say :)  Mike
