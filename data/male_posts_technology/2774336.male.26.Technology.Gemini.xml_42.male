 I woke probably an hour ago, but spent time slipping in and out of sleep.  The past two nights I've woken on my stomach, which is something I can never do if I'm not feeling well.  I've also been quite sweaty when I wake up, which was common before I was ill, but hasn't happened much recently.  I'm taking these both as good signs. 

 I'm counting yesterday in the "wins" column.  I slept very well.  I didn't feel ill at all (or close to not at all) when I was sitting in bed reading - preparing to sleep.  I also feel good this morning. The chamomile tea I drank before bed didn't cause any belching, however I did get some mild belching after I snuck up stairs to eat a tiny piece of brownie.  I don't know if it was the movement or the brownie that was the catalyst. Also, I didn't eat very much yesterday or the two days before.  Was it the food I ate, or the food I didn't eat that kept me feeling well this past day?  Why did the Citrucel I guzzled two nights ago trigger a major bloating and nausea attack, but the whole cup of chamomile tea didn't? 

 Today I'm going to do my best to stick to items in the new book and eat very small portions.  I'm going to try to eat more than I did yesterday, and I'm going to include the full dose of Citrucel today as well (which I've been skipping every other day it seems).  I'm going to read more from my book that just the recipe I make, and I'm going to keep the peppermint on my person in case of a bloating or belching attack.  I feel like a soldier preparing for battle.  Lets see how this works.
