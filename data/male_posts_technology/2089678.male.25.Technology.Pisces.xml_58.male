I posted this comment today at java.net to urge the industry members and development community to be more proactive and supportive. It is really a great set back to learn that those free products/services could not serve you more because of yourself. If this is going to be the payoff, nobody would involve himself into Open Source or Free projects.   So I recommend everyone take a resolution for this year. "Whenever I use any free product/service which fullfills my need and does add value to myself, I will contribute at my best possible level."   Remember, In case you are not able to contribute anything, atleast make it a point and write a letter of appreciation.   Once again, I thank you and congratulate you all to be a part of the Java Technology.   Eat... Sleep... Dream... only Java. Happy Coding....  [Resource-Type: Enlightenment? ............ ]
