Once I get to know someone, I don't have a problem talking to them it's just at first....   I guess, in the end, I don't want to be rejected or laughed at ya know??  But what can I say?  I want to come off nice and sweet and grab her heart ya know? but I don't want to be desperate or anything? Hell, I would even love for a lady to walk up to me and be like hi!  that is all she would have to say, then I could go from there but that would atleast let me know she is interested.   all well, life goes on.. I just hate being alone! talk to you all later!!
