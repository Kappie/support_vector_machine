Kirk has been running the gauntlet of Toasterfileism for some time now, and proved his worth with several complex and eye catching dance moves. He has also won a drinking game on a pirate ship, and took one for the team in Cancun. High praise indeed. So please be upstanding for Captain Kirk, official baptism to follow shortly in Libby Square fountain. *w00t*hoorah*etc*  Bring on the bank holiday!
