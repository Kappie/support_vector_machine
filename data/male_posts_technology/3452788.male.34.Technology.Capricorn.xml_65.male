       
      I work at a not-quite-small engineering and geology consulting firm locally (not naming names in case someone is googling for my company).  We have about 45 people that do a wide variety of things.  We have doubled in size in the 5+ years I have been here, and there have been growing pains.  This also comes at a time when I personally have been in the depressional tank, bothered by career angst, lack of self-worth, restlessness, disrespect for authority, occasional job-hunting, etc.  Looking objectively, I have a pretty good job, though.  I was originally an environmental engineer (mostly underground tank cleanup), then a civil engineer (mostly grading, drainage, stormwater, erosion control, road design), and now part engineer, part Drafting Manager, and full-time IT manager.  I always was the "computer guy". but in the last 3 years I have solidified and defined that position here.  I wear many hats, I am a "fixer" who makes himself valuable by doing many things relatively well, and apparently the company values my talents.  I still am getting paid, at least, and they were willing to allow me to transfer to the IT position.    Anyway, that is the setup for all the workplace posts that may follow, starting today.
