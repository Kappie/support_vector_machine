Last night was different, for once I actually went to bed at a decent hour and woke up at 2:30 in the morning, ate some chicken fettucini and then went back to bed, waking up just in time to get my butt to work. LOL. How close things are sometimes scares me, but this week has drug by the toes and it's nice to have the weekend off.  I do miss having one day here a week, then one here off as well. But dog gone it, it's not like I accomplish anything on the 2 days im off for the weekend, more less the 5 days that I work. LOL I love the car, its so pretty, blue like the sky, its my baby! Finally nice to have something new, and not be Poor! LOL like I would ever be anyways, even if I didn't lift a finger, it always seems like money comes to me from friendliness and computers *L*  Summertime is almost over, look at this crap, and i havent even gone swimming but once, or bbq'd outside but maybe 2 times since the summer.  What a crapper. I think im gonna spend like a weekend and go camping, reguardless of who comes or not, I havent spent anytime doin anything outdoors this summer (insert boo hoo here) *L*  Welp i'm out ...more blogging later i suppose lol
