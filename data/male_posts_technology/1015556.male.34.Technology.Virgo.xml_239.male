So my prayer is that in the midst of all the setup, practicing your talks, getting communion ready, sunrise services on the Beach, trying to keep kids awake or quiet, balancing your ministry and your family, helping your little children and your teens understand Easter, and all of that....  My prayer is that you yourself enjoy and embrace Easter and the truth that it represents.  Jesus is Alive!
