When i get offline, everyone gets offline. I broke it. MowhoahahHHAHAHAHAHAHHAAH. Jeez I was only gone for what, 20 minutes?  Check, check it out, check, check it out Check, check it out, check, check it out Check, check it out, check, check it out Check it out I'm in line behind a barbizon And she really looks like one She says "Hi, I'm skin," And shows a whole lot But doesn't seem to have a whole lot Within, I'm small talk Blah, blah, blah, blah about the weather and all Because I'd love to stand here Another year, winter, spring, summer, fall Into pieces it pleases the eye It's nice to know that there are problems outside of my own I feel better, better Move to ten items or less Should I let her, let her, let me in front of her? Sure, I guess I'm close to checkout, she asks, "Are you the walrus?" I said "yes" without listening "Oh, come on, be honest." I'm close to checkout, she asks, "Are you the walrus?" I said, "Yes, and that's a promise!" "Oh, come on, be honest." Be, be honest, be, be, be honest Be, be honest, be, be, be honest I have five items in the waiting asylum Take everybody's burdens, let's pile 'em up On the counter, call it a conveyer belt And as I look around I see a wanna-be dad using his belt On his screaming baby, a baby, oh baby The constellation on her face said he did the same to his lady Ten thousand maniacs asked the question But it's way too late, he made a lasting impression I wish it wasn't so, I wish it wasn't so But I'm not supposed to impose family values, you know The sale of the century wasn't meant to be like this But how can you resist the madness? I'm so glad it's almost my turn Only one lady away from the freedom I yearn for But before you get excited, She's gotta check the writing, I'm sorry to announce that the check is gonna bounce I feel better, better Move to ten items or less Should I let her, let her, let her me in front of her? Sure I guess I'm at the checkout She asks, "Are you the walrus?" I said "yes" without listening "Oh, come on, be honest." I'm at the checkout, She asks, "Are you the walrus?" I said, "Yes, and that's a promise." "Oh, come on, be honest." Be, be honest, be, be, be honest Be, be honest, be, be, be honest Honestly, We are moderately moving Situation slowly is improving I find the Percy Faith on the P.A. Is sort of soothing Collect my change and I jet Then I'm cruising Check, check it out, check, check it out Check, check it out, check, check it out Check, check it out, check, check it out Check it out Wandering around looking for my car I'm amazed at the maze Who even knows where you are? Who knows why that's a cart resting in the dent it made? Another car waiting for our places to trade I wish it wasn't so, I wish it wasn't so I wish I was in the distance and heading to home base And now the race to red lights begin When the convertible girl slows down to let me in I feel better, better, like as if I was blessed Should I let her, let her, let me in front of her? Sure, I guess I roll down the window, she asks, "Are you the walrus?" I said "yes" without listening "Oh, come on, be honest" I roll down the window, she asks, "Are you the walrus?" I said "Yes, and that's a promise!" "Oh, come on, be honest." Be, be honest, be, be, be honest Be, be honest, be, be, be honest  "Are you the walrus" - Furthermore  This song is teh r0x0rz. Even if it takes me back to the good old days (sarcasm) of cha. It's just a feel-good cd. And melting vinyl makes one's head hurt. And i've REALLY got to show it to mr. stephens. He'd rock out to it.
