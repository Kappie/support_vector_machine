What is man without his dreams? A withered flower awaiting mandates of time, and as such flutter away all signs of the previous life. If all man were kin to his end, meaning, aware that eventually, there would no longer be a John or a Jane Doe, would their frugal pursuits of a more pristine lifestyle mean as much? Everyone wants nice things...does that mean everyone should HAVE nice things? A man gets to reevaluating his external environment after he has been put thru some things. God said He would never put more on his children than they could bear. That's the only thing that keeps my soul with the desire to stay above the water and not drown. I know that somehow all this malevolent foolishness will one day be over The Lord has blessed me beyond measure, and it isn't in my better interests to ever take his mercy for granted.  Well, i'm sleepy, and somewhat frustrated....and electrically torn down physically. Make it so bad, the worst part is yet to come. But i'm keeping my hopes up because I clearly see past the moment. I see past the here n now...its the post uncle sam drama i'm concerned with. To all the also-rans that haven't heard from me in a while...keep your short on (Unless you're baby girl, then by all means take them off :D).
