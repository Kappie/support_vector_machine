It all started with speedy and I having lunch at 12 then who do I see walking down the street but the one and only Dougal on he’s week off so the boy crabs him self a sit and it all starts there with the first drink of J.D.  Then off we go to get my lovely new phone mmmmm, then from there we think about where to go on such a sunny day as this, then it hits us off to tams bar in st brelade so we find the closest taxi and take a ride. So we get there and first things first bar so then all day we do this and have loads of games of pool then we get the girls to come down for the day Kate and elly to drink it large.  So coming to about 7ish now and we start to think about some food to go with all this drink so pizza time it is. Goes down well so then off we go with 6 in a car with Baity in the driving seat to Chicago in town for even more drink and what do we find there but 3 lovely girls on the stage doing a kylie tribute, man its not the same but she had a great arse.  Then to liquid we go to find the place empty but who cares the drink was still good. Didn’t stay there for long we decided to try out follies to see how that was but we get to the door and something happened which I thought was funny we all got asked for I.D so of course none of us had it so that was the end of the night but man it was a great day and cant wait for it to happen again.
