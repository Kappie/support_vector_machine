I would insert a quip about Friday at Friday's or something to that effect, but that would be pretty gay.  Plus I hate trying to humor someone when they make some pun about my last name being 'Hay' and 9 times out of 10 I wind up responding with... "Oh wow, I need to tell my parents that one!"... especially when they say something really unoriginal.  So, in the interest of TGIFriday's not being a jackass to me, I'll save the one liner.  Anyway, things were a little slow and we had Cindy as our server, whose name has been changed here for her protection.  This was Cindy's first week and she compensated for her lack of speed and order blunders with extra giggles and the occasional 'hon' rather than 'sir'.  Or maybe that was just "classic" Cindy.  We got our food and were nearly done when I overheard a hushed conversation between the hostess and another server.  "Did you hear?" breathed the hostess.  "The square dancers called and they're on their way."  "Oh no, this late?"  The hostess nodded gravely.  "So they'll have to be in Cindy's section," she added.  "You'll have to help."  The other woman looked somewhere between exasperated and horrified and I couldn't tell if it was the square dancers or the idea of working with Cindy.  Needless to say, my interest was peeked.  We wondered what about this group would cause someone to speak so conspiratorially as if she were referring to the mob.  Perhaps it was just the size of the group.  Or maybe they were monsters to deal with or notoriously poor tippers.  We traded theories, but the more we overheard other murmured bits of conversation between staff members and looks of fear or pity, the more these explanations seemed insufficient.  We were determined to stay.  Six or seven tables were pushed together right next to us and by the time the first couple came in, we were well done with our meal.  The woman was in her mid-sixties.  An alarmed gray cat was dead and hairsprayed into position on her head and no one had bothered to tell her.  She and her partner wore turquoise with more confidence than anyone you will ever know.  Hers in the form of a dress complete with puffed sleeves and a poofy skirt that sounded like Christmas presents being unwrapped whenever she moved.  His was a simple shirt with his name on the pocket and black slacks.  When the next wave came in, we noticed some of the women were also wearing slick black jackets with 'Cobb County Squares' embroidered on the back in bright red.  My roommate looked up at me nervously.  "Oh my god... THEY'RE IN A GANG."  "Take it easy man," I whispered to him.  "We don't want any trouble and I'm sure they don't either."  After a few minutes of trying not to laugh at each other we decided it was time to go.  We paid with a credit card, and as we were waiting to sign, one Lady Square was on her way past us and to the restroom.  There was a step up between our section and the rest of the restaurant and she lurched over the elevation change, but her ninja-like square dancing reflexes paid off and she stabilized.  However, the nearby manager, who seemed supremely happy that the Cobb County Squares were there, said... "Watch that step miss, it's a dosie doe."  My roommate and I looked at each other in brief verification that we both heard the same thing.  That those words were spoken out loud.  The man seemed far too pleased with himself.  I wondered how long he had been sitting on that cunning word play.  How many nights since that original thought had he secretly hoped for one of the Squares to take a spill.  We left quickly, mindful of our step and with the mutual warning of "Don't make eye contact!" on our way out.
