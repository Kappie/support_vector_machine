I don't, and I don't know if any of them renewed their membership after the free year was up, so I would guess it isn't really worth it.  From my personal experience, the Xbox Live world is filled with cheaters and 13 year olds who swear way too much.  Look at that, a quick answer to a complicated question.  It's what we here at blog my salad are all about.
