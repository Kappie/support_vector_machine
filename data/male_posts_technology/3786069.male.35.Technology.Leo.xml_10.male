Actually my processes were nothing like what some other ITT people experienced that came before me. Apparently they had extensive delays in Kuwait, some 2 to 3 months and others never even went anywhere. Well I guess since then ITT has gotten their act together and decided no more letting people sit around and do nothing (darn, I wouldn't have complained if I got a paycheck to do nothing). They whiz you off to your assigned site in the blink of an eye. I was in Kuwait for a total of 4 days. Actually that was disappointing as I would have liked to have gone into Kuwait City to see the sites and possible visit some familiar faces, former co-workers. Maybe on the way back. So I left Kuwait that day (same as my last posting).  A couple of log entries ago I had a rant about my flight from the states to Kuwait. Well let the ranting continue.  To this point my flight experiences have not been champagne and caviar. The day of my last log which was about 1400, I go back to our bay and our ITT representative meets us there to take us to get manifested on a flight to go to Iraq. This is a large bay where people assemble and wait for flights to take them to their destinations. In this bay they have cots setup (the old fashion army cots that fold out) for people waiting for the next available flight. When we arrive we find out that there is a flight leaving to Baghdad at 1830 and by this time it was 1430. So with only a couple of hours notice we go back to our bay where we stayed and I basically cram all my stuff in my duffle bags and head off to the bay to await my flight. I was a little irritated being that I would have liked to have comfortably organize and put my belongings into the duffle bag so nothing gets damaged or destroyed. But this is why they pay us the big bucks, I guess. So I sit and wait at the bay and when 1830 comes they do a roll call and call out the people who get to go on the flight. Of course yours truly wasn't called on the roll call, strike one. The next flight and roll call to Baghdad happened at 0700. That roll call happens again without yours truly.  In the meantime my fellow companions Rocio  James had a flight leaving to their base at 0200 the following morning. They got to sleep then casually bring over their belongings to the bay. Roll call was announced their names were called and they boarded the bus to go to the plane without any wait or inconvenience. So as I'm sitting in the bay on this uncomfortable cot I'm thinking I hope things get better when I get to Babylon.  Finally after about 24hrs (1 day) 1600 they call my name to board the bus. We drive to the airport only to do a typical military "hurry up and wait" procedure. I think our plane landed around 2000. We board the C130 to fly north to Baghdad.  It was a very nice flight coming north. I was relieved I wasn't assigned to any baggage detail. We flew up on a C130 and if you've never flew on a military aircraft it's completely unlike a commercial airline most notably there are only a few windows (a couple in the forward section and a couple in the aft section with none in between). But I did manage to look out and see Iraq. There was a lot of sand. Sadly we landed at BIAP (Baghdad International Airport) at about 2200, completely dark out. The reason this is a problem is because when I call the ITT contacts to let them know I have arrived they tell me they can't pick me up at night as it's not safe to drive at night. So once again I spend the night on an uncomfortable army cot. One thing to point out here, we arrived a few hours before a large army unit that flying out came to the airport. The tent that is setup for people waiting for flights only has a few cots. My luck changed that night as I was lucky to have one of those uncomfortable army cots vs. a chair or worse, the floor. So I slept it out until the morning.
