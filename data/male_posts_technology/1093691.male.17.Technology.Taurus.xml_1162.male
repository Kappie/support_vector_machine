I should be going to the cinema with Paul later but when I checked my hours for tomorrow I found that I am working from 8.30 and I may be working all day until 5.30 so ahhhh that means we'll have to refigure our plan. Gah.  Hope you all have a good day, half term now so at least we can chill out. A bit. I have a riduclus amount of work to be doing. Ack.   Matt has been invited to join us.
