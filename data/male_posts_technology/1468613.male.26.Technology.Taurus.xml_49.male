We (Craig, Vanessa, Danielle and I) flew out of Glasgow for Belfast at 7 am on Saturday morning and lest to say... I was asleep on the plane. However not for very long as the flight takes about 20min. As it was such a nice day when we landed, we decided to take a bus up to Derry to do some sight-seeing (it is also called Londonderry but now the Irish have renamed it back to just Derry).  Derry an interesting, quaint little town on the river. It's right up the north of Ireland and used to be the main port where emmigrants would leave to go to America and Australia. There's a 6-metre wide wall that surrounds the centre of the town and you can actually walk around the whole perimiter of the city on top of the wall. Derry is also the place where Bloody Sunday took place and many un-armed people were killed by the British Army when they were protesting for civil rights. We entered the city on the more quaint side where there are old pubs and stores but around on the other side you can look down from the wall onto the 'Bog' where the Irish catholics tradionally have lived. And from the wall you can the murals on the side of houses depicting people who have lost their lives and other Irish heroes. Also, on that side of the town there's a huge tower with an arry of surveillance cameras. Also there's a watch-tower with a large screen in front of it protecting the people inside from rocks and balloons filled with paint. So in Derry you could still see there's a bit of tension.  Belfast was similar and we even took a black-cab tour. The driver was very good and told us many stories about what happened in certain places. The stories told us more about how brutal people can be to each other people and it sounds more like it's less about religion and more about just getting your own back. Even when we stopped, a kid about 7 or 8 years old, came up and asked us what we were doing looking at the murals and then talked to the cab driver about throwing stones at people who were giving them a hard time.  The tour took us through both areas and we didn't realise how close some of these communities live together. There's still tenstion and you can feel it in the air. All the barbed wire, high fences and police cameras and watch towers don't help making the place more relaxed. The police still drive around in heavily armoured vans and when the marching season starts (in 2 days time) it still stirs up trouble.  Belfast was a good place to visit but I'm not sure if a place I'd like to spend a long time in.  well, getting back to work again, cya soon! (in about 4 weeks now)  -gede
