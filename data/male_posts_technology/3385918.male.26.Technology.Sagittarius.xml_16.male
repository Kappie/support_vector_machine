I usually read excellent Mr. Tito's review of RAW on the  urlLink Lords of Pain  website.   Yesterday I tried to jolt some notes to use to day, but for the life of me I will never understand how Mr. Tito and the guys who participate at the wrestling forums can watch the show and type at the same time. Trust me, it's very hard. I kept missing stuff as I wrote stuff down and I decided to forget about the notes all together as the show progressed. I wanted to take notes because I am very forgetful, but I guess I will have to go with my memories. Anyway, I left the notes at home, so I have no other choice.  Okay, show starts off with a recap of last weeks battle royal where Shawn Michaels cost HHH a win. Next we move to a segment where HHH chews out the rest of Evolution for not being there for him (clearly forgetting that his team took out most of the participants in the battle royal until they where also eventually eliminated). This segment only served to announce the first match of the night which was Ric Flair VS. Edge.   Ric Flair VS. Edge  This match was a total disappointment mostly because it was so sloppy. Neither performer looked motivated. Edge tried two spears that were poorly executed. There also seem to be confusion in several parts of the match, probably due to miss pacing by the participants or a missed event. Either way, it was a surprising poor start to RAW.  Funny how people chant Edge's name, but explode into cheer when Ric Flair gets the upper hand. It's hard not to love the guy, even taught recent comments he's made have made him seem like a total ass. Particularly comments related to how he dislikes fans using insider terms and talking like wrestlers...  Ric, wrestling is not real. People know it's not real. People like the fantasy aspect of wrestling. Most imagine themselves as being part of that fantasy and greatly enjoy talking like insiders and believing that they are part of a good thing. That's what good fans do. It's not a bad thing, it's a good thing.   Still, Ric is the man in the ring. Even taught I am still curious of what exacly he is trying to accomplish all those times he goes to the third rope. He never gets to execute that move. Yesterday I taught he was actually going to make it, but Edge caught him in mid air with what I believe to be a spear (it looked more like a car crash actually). Some people say that he is actually trying to do a shooting star press. Funny stuff. Who knows? What ever it is, it's probably devastating given that he still insists on going up and trying it out.   Now that I think of it, that would probably be the mark out moment of 2004 if he actually gets to pull of a move from the third rope and win.   A little mistake in the match, or it seems like it, where Edge pins Ric Flair and there is a three count, but the referee says it's a two count. Edge looks confused and J.R. comments that Flair got his shoulder up. He didn't. What happened there? Probably Orton, who was at ring side, was supposed to make the save, but didn't. The crowd was not happy about that.  Randy Orton's intervention leads to Shelton Benjamin running in to confront him. They brawl and we get to see one of Randy Orton's biggest flaws. He sells the beating in a silly way. Reminds me of "Hollywood" Rock, who is a great talker, but exaggerate his movements and reaction in the ring for entertainment effect. This is not the effect Randy Orton should be looking for (even taught sometimes it can be funny, but no in the way it should be).  Watch ends with Edge getting the pin. Lame. Could have been better.   We move to a segment with HHH and Batista waiting for Shawn Michaels in the parking lot. Which leads to HHH confusing Steve Richard and beating the stuffing out of him. It's sad cause I have a feeling that Steve Richards can do much more than what he is given.  Next I believe was a segment with Lita and Matt Hardy, who claims that she has been ignoring his calls. She tells Matt that she loves him and that she will show him how much she loves him tonight. She goes into her locker room, where an apparent invisible camera man happens to be tapping everything without her knowing it (look, just because wrestling is fake, doesn't mean you have to take liberties in destroying the illusion of reality. Very poor, WWE!). Kane pops up behind her and Lita insinuate that they "did something together" and that since that was done, everything is "over". To which Kane says, in a menacing voice, that it's over... Everything is over. Yeah, right! Anyway, she backs away, straightens herself, walks out of the locker room and leaves with Matt. I hope this isn't the WWE ideas of ending the story line (even taught it deserves to end quickly).  This story line is a mystery. I have a feeling that the whole Kane - Matt - Lita triangle was just an excuse to bring Jeff Hardy back to the WWE. Since Jeff still doesn't want to go to drug rehabilitation, the WWE is holding firm on not bringing him back until he does. I have a feeling that they gave up on him and decided to end the story line quickly, which was why Kane got the win in the battle royal and is now set to face Benoir in the main event of the Bad Blood PPV. What a mess!  I believe that the next segment was a match between La Resistance and the team of Hurricane and Rosey.  For God sake, get Hurricane back to the cruserweight division at Smack down. That is where he belongs. Right now you have four people in the ring who have fought each other hundreds of times. It's the same freaking match. And they are all stale. Why? Cause these gimmicks don't have legs. Their old. There is not much more that you can squeeze out of them and, truth be told, is hurting them. With no more back stage segments (which were pretty funny), this team is just floating around with no clear path.   La Resistance wins, but nobody cares.   Now, my memory is faulty, but I believe there is a segment with HHH and Shawn Michaels beating the living daylights out of each other in the parking lot. Pretty boring given that we've seen this hundreds of times last year with their original feud. They get separated and HHH goes to Eric Bischoff's office to complain which leads to an announced match at Bad Blood between HHH and Shawn Michaels. Shawn attacks HHH from behind and they both land on poor Eric (hahahahaha). They brawl and totally destroy Eric's office which prompts him to order every wrestler in the building to help keep HHH and Shawn Michaels away from each other or he is going to fire everyone.   Right here I think I clustered several segments together. Other than this, we had a good match between Randy Orton and Batista VS. the team of Shelton Benjamin and Jericho. Jericho was really on tonight.   I like the new RAW structure where they start the show with a hot match (even taught tonight's was a dud), follow it up with another hot match at the middle hour and then Finish up with a match or a brawl. No long rants!!!!! Please keep it that way. Nothing makes people want to change channels and see something else than a guy saying how good he is and how he is going to rip his opponent in half for the hundredth time this month.   I was also thinking of the "Smackdown Five" (as in, five wrestlers that made the show great). I recall a year ago that RAW was the declining program and Smackdown was the hit show. Now, the table have been turned. RAW is the hot program, whereas Smackdown is going down the drain in ratings and quality. Or so I've heard. I don't get UPN, so I don't get to see Smackdown.   Who were these "Smackdown Five"? Kurt Angle, Brock Lesnar, Eddie Guerrero, Edge and Benoir. Besides these five, we had Chavo Guerrero, Shelton Benjamin, Rhyno and Tajiri who also gave excellent performances in the ring, making this show the superior show. What happened? For starters, Edge, Benoir, Shelton Benjamin, Tajiri and Rhyno (who is doing absolutely nothing on RAW) are no longer in Smackdown. Brock Lesner flew the coup for the NFL. Kurt Angle is injured. And Chave Guerrero, as the cruiserweight champion, who is feuding with... Jackie!?!?! WTF!?!?!? Well, that leaves Eddie Guerro as champion feuding with... Bradshaw?!?!?! WTF?!?!?!? Also, didn't the writers tell Rey Mysterio the other day that "they didn't have anything for him" right now storyline wise?   But wait, at least they have several new wrestlers that they got from RAW... Like... Rico (who has potential to be a great wrestler, but is being held back by a dumb gimmick)!!!!! Erm... okay, how about Booket T (who got his ass handed back to him by the Undertaker at Judgement Day). Then, there is the Dudley Boyz. I like the Dudley Boyz. Now they are heals. All is good in the world... If they are used properly. And, at least RVD is giving Rey Mysterio something to do on Smackdown.   I will say this, sounds like Rene Dupree (with his feud for the United States Championship against John Cena) is working out fine. Which is good. Cause Smackdown needs new stars bad.   Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, Jericho rules. Thanks for reminding me.   The "RAW Five" have really helped the show. These guys are Jericho, Shawn Michaels, Benoir, HHH (yes, once he started selling and loosing matches clean, he's become interesting and actually fun to watch) and Shelton Benjamin. What??? Shelton Benjamin??? You heard me right. This kid was ready for the main event scene. Keep pushing him. Sure, his mic skills suck, but he has power and speed in the ring. Plus the crowd loves him and, given his two wins on HHH, he is hot as hell.   Edge just isn't 100% in his game (yet) and that mini feud with Kane did nothing for both of them.   Rhyno isn't being used for shit.   Ric Flair is always great (except for his match with Edge just now), but the age is showing. Still, when he is on his game, he looks like a million bucks.   Randy Orton has the looks, the mic skills, the attitude (that cocky, arrogant attitude just makes you wanna slap him and hate him... Perfect !!!) and, to be frank, the ring skills. But he is missing something. Can't put my finger on it. Maybe if he stops selling in a silly, exaggerated way, then he would be something great. I hope his feud with Shelton Benjamin elevates both.   (I must add something here. Randy Orton's match with Mick Foley proved that this guy wants to give 100% for the fans. I really think that in a year or two, this guy is going to be one of the permanent main event wrestlers of the company. He is almost there now.)  Batista... Look, Batista is clumsy, but I feel like he has a lot of potential. He has the brutish look. Has the intensity. He just has to learn that even if you play a hulking animal, that doesn't mean you have to destroy your opponent for real. He has to protect more. By the way, on that subject, has anybody seen Tajiri since his match with Batista a while back...  One last thing on Batista. Last week, during the battle royal, there was a moment where he confronted Kane that generated such excitement that it became almost surreal. There was intensity and chemistry between both in that confrontation. The audience felt it and they actually cheered. Interesting...  Oh, also, Tajiri is always great. Love the guy. I was sad when RVD went to Smackdown, until I found out Tajiri would be coming to RAW. Gee, I suddenly don't miss RVD.   Something I forgot to mention is that Mr. McMahon announced the start of the "RAW Diva Search reality contest". The winner will get $250,000 and a one year contract (One year? What happened to the life time contract they usually offer? Like the one that they gave Tough Enough champions Nydia and Jackie Gaylard... oh, I see...).   Anyway, back to the show.  Victoria came out to new music and a new dance step that really does shit for her as a wrestler. I mean, yes, I like that booty shake she is doing, but it really doesn't give her the same depth that crazy bitch gimmick gave her (and the TATU song she came used to have was much better music). The trouble with Victoria is that she is fantastic and the crowd loves her, but since she turned face (Mr. Flair, don't get pissed at me cause I used this word, ok?), she hasn't received any development into her character. She went from crazy bitch to... to... well, smiling and waving women's wrestler. I liked the crazy bitch better. I will say this, she does something that I think is essential and that is to play to the crowd. Like I said, the crowed loves her. I'm not sure what the audience will think of the dance moves taught. I mean, she's a wrestler, not Michael Jackson (thank God, for that). Also, there isn't a gimmick to justify all the dancing, except for the new music. Also, simply dancing does not get wrestlers over with the crowd (*cough* *cough* Lance Storm *cough*).  Another thing, it seemed so awkward the way she was dancing. Not really sexy. Just, weird. Not sure how it looked live. Maybe people will cheer it. Dunno. Time will tell.   Pretty decent match with Victoria defeating Molly in a non-tile match (A word of advice to the WWE: too many of these will ruin the women's title).   I like the woman's wrestling division. I think they work really hard, but they are so disorganized story line wise. Funny, cause a year ago people complained that there was too much story to the women's matches and bad wrestling. Now the wrestling is pretty good, but the writers don't seen to give a damn.  Sad, cause they brought Nydia and I have a feeling they have no idea what to do with her (I have a couple of suggestions). She doesn't have the ring or mic skills to be a credible face (again, Mr. Flair, forgive me).   Molly and Gail Kim are great as heels. Actually, I just say this cause I think that Gail Kim is very very sexy (but then again I find all Asian women to be sexy). I am glad Gail Kim is getting pushed. That way I can see her more in TV. I am looking forward to the Victoria VS. Gail Kim match at Bad Blood. Yes, sir.  Oh, then we have Trish and Lita rounding up the women's division. Trish is in a story line that apparently doesn't have room for her to fight. And Lita is stuck in that dead end Kane gimmick (which, like I said, I believe just self destruct tonight due to lack on interest or simply stupidity on the WWE writers part).  And what the fuck happened to Ivory. Yes, I know she is in that Saturday morning WWE show called...erm... Experience, right? Something like that. Don't watch it. Don't care. Saturday morning is for sleeping or cartoons.   We move on to the Eugene and Regal VS. Garrison Cade  Jonathan Coachman. But wait !!! Johnny Nitro announces that William Regal ca't fight cause Eric Bischoff hasn't reinstated him. So, now it will be a handicap match with Eugene VS. Garrison Cade  Jonathan Coachman (Gee, like Eugene could break the Coachman in half).   I was kinda sad cause I was looking forward to seeing Regal fight in the ring again. I like the guy. I think he is great. I was very sad when I heard that he might be retiring due to the blood thinning decease that had cause him to take so much time off. When I read that not only was he coming back, but he was training to come back at the top of his game, I was ecstatic. Alas, tonight will not be the night we will see the guy wrestle. Still, judging from bhis reaction, looks like he will be turning face to protect Eugene from big, bad Eric Bischoff. Which is good, cause I always wanted to see William Regal go head to head as a face against a heel like Ric Flair. I hope we can see something like that in the near future.  A comment on the Eugene "retard" gimmick. Like many, I have reservations about this gimmick. Mostly cause the wrestler that is doing the character looks to have charisma and good to great wrestling skill. He really does deserve better.   Right now, the gimmick is working and is over big time, but... Why do I worry? One word: RICO !!!!! Nothing worst than having a good wrestler with a gimmick he can't recover from. And, people please, how do you stop being retarded or "slow"? You don't.   I will also comment on the fact that while in the short term I think the gimmick is funny and entertaining, I have a beef with it cause my real name is Eugene too !!! Dammit, get so much shit from my friends about that. Grrrrrr !!!!!   Eugene looks to have a handicap match against the team of Garrison Cade  Jonathan Coachman until it's announced that benoir is going to be his tag team partner. Pretty decent match that is mostly for entertainment purposes. Nothing better that watching Benoir beat the shit out of the Coach.  I will add here that unlike what is being said, I like the Coach as a heel (Sorry!!! Sorry, Mr. Flair. Please don't get angry with me for using this word). I remmeber when everybody and their sister would get in the Coach's face. It was a matter of time before Coach went postal.  Heel Coach is better than face Coach (Damn, Flair must really hate me now. Maybe he will stop this post and get someone else to write it *wink* *wink*).    Benoir and Eugene win and all is right in the world. Until we go back to HHH and HBK brawling and having half of the locker room try unsuccessfully to keep them apart. Damn, they're really beating the crap out of each other. One thing I will give them is that they are pulling no punches for this feud.   Funny how both of these guys seem so powerful, no other wrestler can keep them apart.   Eric comes out and announces that for Bad Blood, it's going to be HHH VS. Shawn Micheals in a Hell in the Cell match (which I know will deliver in spades and be a total blood bath).   Then, the show ends. Okay, back to your normal lives people. There is nothing more to see here (Unless you wanna see that cartoon with the super hero who is also a stripper).   Well, that ends my recalp of the show. Now for the review.   It was an ok show, which is much better than what we had a year ago this same time where the show was pure garbage. Only one real, solid match with Jericho and Shelton Benjamin taking on Randy Orton and Batista. A lot of build up for the Bad Blood PPV, which is a big plus. The show was entertaining, but, given the almost excellent track record RAW has had in the last few weeks, it was pretty lack luster. I would give this show a C- in rating.  I am very interested in seeing what the grade for the show is when Mr. Tito loads up his review of the show. When I like a show, Mr. Tito hates it. When Mr. Tito like a show, I hate it. Still, I never miss it. Since I didn't like this show mutch, I'm guessing he probably liked it. Even taught, I will be frank, there was a lot to hate in this show.   You can read his review in this  urlLink page  (he takes a while in putting up his review cause, unlike me, he has a life). Be sure to visist Mr. Tito at his blog  urlLink here .   Well, that's it. No more to say. This was my first and, due to the amount of time and trouble, I think it's probably my last. Just kidding. I will try to have one of these done every Tuesday. Next Tuesday's will probably be shorter. As you can see, this one was long cause I added my two cents on just about everything. I plan to be brief next time around. As in "I like this" or "I hate that".  I hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I liked typing it. Well, until next Tuesday (or at least my next post). Bai bai    urlLink Sailor Ecchi
