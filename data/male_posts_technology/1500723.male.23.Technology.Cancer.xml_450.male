I stay awake and I see things that make me shake the wind is still my hair is blowing I want to know where am I going? Daylight has come but I can't see if this is really reality. My eyes are open but still I sleep I still see things that make me shake the wind is blowing but all is still now I know That I am here.   - Jason Raymer
