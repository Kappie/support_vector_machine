Custard mentioned to me at one point that he had never, ever, been on a night out with me that I wasn't drinking/drunk before. Which is REALLY scary. Over the years I must be the largest sole consumer of Jose Cuervo in Jersey, I hope the little mexican bastard appriecates my efforts.  Grist gets big love from all of us for his amazing "MJ Thriller" style make-up, which distressed the tarts no end.  Driving home, a police car pulled out behind me alone the five mile and followed me all the way up to St Peter's Bars (me doing about 20mph, hahaha..) then they flick the lights on and pull me over. It's 1:20 AM.  "Good evening sir" "Good morning, officer" "Yes.. morning. We are doing a random spot check." (I look into my mirror and examine my face. He seems to miss the subtle humor involved in this one..) "Where have you.. " "The Watersplash" "Have you -" "No, no drinks at all" "Are you the-" "The registered owner of this vehicle, yes, I am" "What would that be?" "What, the registration of my vehicle or my name?" "Name" "Adam Currie" "Thank you sir. Good night." "Thank you."  I can understand spot checks and they are a good idea, just rather bored of being pulled over now.
