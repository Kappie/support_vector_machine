When I move or just spend a lot of time in a dumpy part of town, my mood turns sour. This isn't just a minor mood change, mind you. This is a full blown change of perception, actions, and life overall. Why does something as simple as surroundings, effect me so much? I've asked around and I seem to be in the minority with this phenomenon. Unfortunately I don't have the monetary requirements to move into somewhere nicer at the moment, so I suppose I'm stuck.  Your perception is your reality, and mine is on the decline...
