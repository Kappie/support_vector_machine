I'm hoping for a miracle cure just in time for my city-league basketball game tomorrow at nine-thirty.  I went to a trial last week, and it was the first I had ever been to. It was sorta like I thought it would be, but I was surprised that the jury was allowed to write down questions and submit them for the judge to then ask whatever witness was on the stand at the time. I always thought that juries were more passive than that, but I was definitely glad to discover that they aren't simply sitting in their chairs, drooling out of boredom (although on second thought, I saw some of that, too).   Witnessing a bona fide trial did awaken in me some desire to be able to articulate an argument as effectively as both sets of lawyers are able to, but it also awakened in me the realization that if I were able to argue better than I do now, I would simply become that much more annoying to other people, and there wouldn't be much gain from it. It's not like I'm going to sue Julie for not appreciating the Del Taco I brought home (she did appreciate it, lest there be any misunderstanding on that point).   There is, however, something to be said for the  sharpness  that permeates their demeanor. The attorneys listen very attentively to the other person, remember (seemingly) insignificant facts from others' testimony, and manage to bring those facts back into light to create an advantage over their opponent at the opportune moment. In short, they employ all the methods that would bring a marriage to its very knees. I respect that even though I fear it for myself.
