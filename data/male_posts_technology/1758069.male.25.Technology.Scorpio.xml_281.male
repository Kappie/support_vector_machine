This is the normal procedure that the left has taken on such matters."  if you read that article (linked above), you'll see that the family  did not  want their son's execution made public.  it was, in fact, the state department that released the story (maybe to lessen criticism brought about by the prisoner abuse photos?).  interesting nugget of the day:  for every $3 we spend on the iraqi shimsham mishmash, we spend $1 on homeland security.  look it up, i promise.     album du jour:   urlLink   ash       meltdown
