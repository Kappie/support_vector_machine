But, what if she needed somebody? Must i act indifferent and be so cruel to her?   My presence might even cause her troubles and unhappiness. I don't know what may happen when her bf is back. Although i know that even if his heart changed, she will still love him that much as before. Ya, Hap.. i should get myself over her and do something else. Shouldn't be like a pest and hope that something may happen.   Hap, falling in love is difficult.. forcing myself to fall out of love is even more difficult. I can't force her to accept me either. Can only blame myself for getting into such shit.. :~(  Hap.. *hugs* Tks..
