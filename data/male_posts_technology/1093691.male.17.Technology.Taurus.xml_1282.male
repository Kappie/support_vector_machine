Looking through the last few posts i am fairly concerned with what i have to live up with, and hope my meaningless comments and sexual innuendos will be good enough for this sacred blogg.  My day today has been relatively boring and no where near exciting enough to mention here, overall this week for me has been absolutely brilliant and a much needed break, the amount of work i have got through and the pain and sweat i have put into all my subjects 18 hours a day has been totally and completely unbelievable. (and indeed you may choose not to believe that). Anyway i must now go and stare aimlessly at the motorola ICOM 2 way radios, because i am like that. Hope you are all having a great holiday and i will be back soon. Dave  (also known as, David, David Thomas, The new boy on the block, Sexy, sex bomb, as well as some others which will remain undisclosed)
