However, if they can get more memory in those phones to store more music, bump up the battery life and put in a headphone jack, it'd bring the cell phones into the music player realm, which really just makes sense.  Personally, I like the devices which do more than one thing.  This means there's fewer things I need to drag around with me.  Too bad that these multi-use devices are frequently "jack of all trades, master of one" where they do a little of everything, but don't do any one thing well.  Hopefully as technology progresses, this will be less true.  One can only hope.
