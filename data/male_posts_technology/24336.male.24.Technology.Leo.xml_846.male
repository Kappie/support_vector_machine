I went to a RallyCross on Sunday ( urlLink pictures ). It was fairly interesting, but I'm not subjecting my only car to that treatment. Today I got my new Microsoft Prime card (discount card for restaurants, hotels, etc). The old design was fairly metrosexual (polka dots and all) but the new one takes the cake!
