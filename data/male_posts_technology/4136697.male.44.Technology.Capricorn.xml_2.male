So far, none have been forthcoming.  Perhaps my faithful readers feel intimidated by my writing prowess or feel that their mere words would not do justice to my lofty ponderings.  Here are a few sample comments you may wish to consider using. "Get a life ya looser!" "What a self-indulgent asshole you are!  Do you honestly think anyone cares????!!!" "People like you are what's wrong with this world!"  The above are merely suggestions, feel free to compose your own.  The only comments which I despise are those with biblical quotes reminding me of how Jesus loves me and is willing to forgive my many sins if I only had the balls to repent!  Today, I had a Big Meeting (as they're called) with the honchos regarding some work I'll be doing.  It was an easy sell, as they're all real estate types and understood what I was talking about.  Interestingly, my project was the only one approved out of a raft of money-wasting schemes floated.  Since my work is based in reality (ie: Land information), the end product is something of lasting value which can be built upon, rather than some airy-fairy scheme that is as likely to vanish into the ether as Tinkerbell on her way back to Never-Land.  I managed to get a bunch of stuff off my desk today, which always feels good.  Things tend to pile up easily and sometimes I have to run my ass off to get stuff moving.  Mostly, I don't like to be rushed and I prefer having the time to consider things rather than having to dash off an immediate response.  I usually find that other things come to mind over time, which help me to formulate a better response.  Unfortunately, I don't always have that time, however, I do my best to consider things carefully as often a lot of weight is placed on my conclusions.  But as I like to say, no one has ever died from a surveying error - although maybe that's not strictly true if you consider the outcome of some property disputes!  Something is wrong with the "good" computer at home now.  The old computer bit the dust last week and now the new one is acting strange.  I'm getting tired of doing the maintenance on them , as I never use them and am not responsible for maintaining them.  The parties that use them have hours to fool around on them, but can't seem to find the time to fix them when they've screwed them up - interesting.  Maybe its time they learn...... I'm getting tired of it.  Tonight I want to write up the songs we're doing for the 20th.   Right now, my notes are in a mess and I don't want to be trying to find my way through a pile of papers when we're gigging.  I've also got to go to Cdn Tire and pick up some parts for the boat tonight (see yesterday's post).  The plumbing is supposed to be done today, so that means all that's left of the kitchen renos is painting, lighting and flooring (in that order).  The flooring contractor came last night and took the measurements, so he can order the materials.  He's going on holidays in a couple of weeks and it seems unlikely that he'll do it before he goes (after telling me he could do the work right away - which got him the job in the first place!).  I told him to get it done before school starts - he assured me he would - yeah, right!   These flooring guys seem like a funny lot.  He's my second choice as the first guy proved to be even less reliable.  Well, that's it for today.... no big earth-shattering revelations, other than that according to The Daily Reckoning (a contrarian economic newsletter) oil prices are set to go through the roof in a couple of years - I wonder if I should sell my gas-guzzling boat?  I'm planning on moving it next year and doing less cruising anyway, but it will be harder to sell if fuel prices go up.  I'm planning on buying something more fuel-efficient eventually anyway. (read: sailboat).  Thoughts???
