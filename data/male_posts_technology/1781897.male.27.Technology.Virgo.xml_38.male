She is the first grandparent that i've lost, and i just can't believe that she is gone!  I didn't get to see her often, as she lived in Detroit, but never the less she is someone whom I have known my whole life.  She was in pain in the end, which makes me sad..but I'm happy that she is suffering no more......She'll be missed by many people.  On a lighter note...looks like my father's pre-planning of the funeral paid off for him....she did't make it till Sunday.....morbid.
