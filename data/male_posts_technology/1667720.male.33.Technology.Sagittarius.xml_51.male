However, I peddled on my trainer for 20 minutes yesterday to warm me up for the week and stay with an advice from Marc Evans to do at least light exercise on off days. Today morning I was supposed to get up at 4.30am and run my 3 mileswith intervals. But guess what, I couldn’t sleep all night, did not hear the alarm, and woke up feeling fatigue just in time to go to work.    After work I tried to meet Rob for a swim. Pool was full of children horsing around and no space for “triathlete” to practice. I was too tired to argue with management about the proper use of swimming pool. (“swimming” being the important word here.) So, I returned home and went for a half hour run. Run was little bit more difficult than usually as I tried to practice higher stride. Other than that it was a good run (of course I’m not counting that my iPod refused to play for the second 15 minutes of the run).    I hope this is not an indication how the rest of my week will look like.
