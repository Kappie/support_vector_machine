I've been doing this off and on for nine months, although I've only been making regular contributions to this site in the last two or three months. I met someone for the first time today, and they started the conversation by saying, "So I had a chance to stop by your web site...".  I was momentarily worried about it. What did he see there? Did they see my main site ( urlLink mydemos.com ) or did they see this one? Did they read some of the opinions posted to this site? Did they agree or disagree with some of them?   And that, I suppose is one of the implications of blogging. Every day, people are reading what I say here and making prejudgements about me. Normally, in the Internet world, prejudgements are fine. But when you're meeting someone in the real world for the first time, and that person already knows quite a bit about you from the Internet, that's quite scary. This is a one way medium, after all. It's like a bathroom wall in some respects. There is no opportunity for me to explain things or rephrase things if someone misunderstands me. If I am opposed to something one month, and in favor of it the next, which opinion will this person see? Will I say something offensive?  Moral of the story: I have to watch what I say here. Sadly, I also may have to go back and remove comments that turned out to be rash or ill-advised. After all, this blog is a reflection of who am I. I don't mind people knowing a bit about me from this blog, but I don't want to give the wrong impression either.  Best regards, Scott
