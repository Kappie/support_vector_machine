According to one source in Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI),  "The Pakistani government is really desperate and wants to flush out bin Laden and his associates after the latest pressures from the U.S. administration to deliver before the [upcoming] U.S. elections."  Introducing target dates for Al Qaeda captures is a new twist in U.S.-Pakistani counterterrorism relations - according to a recently departed intelligence official, "no timetable[s]" were discussed in 2002 or 2003 - but the November election is apparently bringing a new deadline pressure to the hunt.   Another official, this one from the Pakistani Interior Ministry, which is responsible for internal security, explains,  "The Musharraf government has a history of rescuing the Bush administration. They now want Musharraf to bail them out when they are facing hard times in the coming elections."  (These sources insisted on remaining anonymous. Under Pakistan's Official Secrets Act, an official leaking information to the press can be imprisoned for up to ten years.)   A third source, an official who works under ISI's director, Lieutenant General Ehsan ul-Haq, informed tnr that the Pakistanis  "have been told at every level that apprehension or killing of HVTs before [the] election is [an] absolute must."  What's more, this source claims that Bush administration officials have told their Pakistani counterparts they have a date in mind for announcing this achievement:  "The last ten days of July deadline has been given repeatedly by visitors to Islamabad and during [ul-Haq's] meetings in Washington."  Says McCormack: "I'm aware of no such comment." But according to this ISI official, a White House aide told ul-Haq last spring that  "it would be best if the arrest or killing of [any] HVT were announced on twenty-six, twenty-seven, or twenty-eight July" - the first three days of the Democratic National Convention in Boston.    read the rest of the article  urlLink here .    concerning reports of Iraqi children being held in U.S. detention centers:   'According to information from the International Red Cross,  more than a 100 children are imprisoned in Iraq, including in the infamous prison Abu Ghraib.
