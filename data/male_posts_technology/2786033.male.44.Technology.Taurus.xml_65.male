I'd like to think I'm snatching it up like a doberman to a filet, but I guess it could be described as Bob using all ten of his fingertips, gently but intently, to push me past my objections (no time, no resources, yadda, yadda, yadda) and get some ideas into open space. That is, after our radio talk show idea fell through.  As I said, all my quips come two minutes too late for radio. (Costanza)  That's it! That's what I shoulda said!  What do I bring to Eugene Rant? Bob will take care of the politics and policy stuff (to which I'll lend a hand); I'd like to put up some realizations, some wit, and the blatantly obvious happenings that define the seemingly boundless idiots of our day, both locally and globally.  What do I hope to get from Eugene Rant?  The usual I guess - a place to share ideas, get things off my chest, use cliches at will  to hell with that. (Bob, is 'hell' OK? Y'know, it's kinda hard to tell you I want something to go to  HELL  without using the word  HELL .) I hope to get some honest feedback, whether folks think I've got a good point, I put up a well-considered argument, I'm a hack, a phony, a plagiarist, I use too many  urlLink hyperlinks WhyTheSamScratchCan'tHeWriteHisOwnOpinions, etc.  My legitimacy is not in question here. Rather, I hope my self-consiousness regarding my writing style is appeased. Please? C'mmonnn, help a guy out? Thanks.
