I think Freddy Sensei must be feeling kinda sad about this. Also just realised there's a combined training every last Tues of the month. That's a fantastic idea. Sensei is encouraging each one to cross train with people they've not seen before. I think this should be a regular practice which should be carried on as time goes by.   urlLink Eileen's blog  has a fantastic account of a training session with Tommy. I think it's really wonderful. I also believe it's a great way to improve the stamina.  I'm staying in camp again. Somf of the nicer folks in camp are doing overnight duties today so I though staying back shuold be quite interesting. Anyway, probably going for a quick run around 8:30pm later since this morning's life-run was cancelled due to bad weather. Again, the whole Bde got screwed up by the RSM. Over discipline and performance again. I think he made really valid points about the discipline in the Bde. Problem is not many people realise it till it's too late. When that happens, we all deserve the lecture we're getting. Even I realised my discipline slackened down. Before the Sun run at Selarang, I did take my own sweet time to get to camp even though I was already late. Instead we the juniors made the officers wait for us. Of course the weather was bad but still it didn't project a good image. I guess some things can be quite ' wayang' (just to put up a show / front for people to see), but image is pretty important too. We all know how kokup things can be in NS, but if we let foreign powers know every knitty gritty mess we encounter, I think we'd have been attacked and conquered a long time ago. Professionalism is not something found in every organisation, or every level of an organisation, but it definitely needs to be projected to external parties. It's like a hawker ctr and a foodcourt thing.  OK almost time for the run. Ciaoz.
