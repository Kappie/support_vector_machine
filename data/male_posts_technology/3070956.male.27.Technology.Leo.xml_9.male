I was thoroughly impressed and can't wait to see another.  If you ever go to New York and want to see a show in times square you can get last minute tickets right in the middle of times square at this little red and white booth.  We almost went to see Rent, but the girl I was with already saw it so we asked what was the most popular out of what was left and so it was... Bombay Dreams!  The costumes were amazing the dancing was amazing, and the story line was interesting to me.   I decided I need a digital camera.  I am always doing things and don't have pictures when it would really be cool. So... I did my homework and the camera I want is the  urlLink Minolta Dimage XT . I especially like it because I can take it anywhere with me (it's about the size of a wallet) and it has a lot of features for a pretty low-cost camera (  After the show we went to a nice Mexican restaurant on 48th and 8th street.  FYI, there is a great place to park if you want to hang out in New York for the night right next door to this place, but only if you are staying until midnight.  If you want to stay overnight, there are other garages on 48th that are fairly priced at about $25/day. The hotel was OK for the location - we stayed at the Best Western President and parked right across the street at the Ritz.   The next day I ran some errands and we ate Lunch at the Olive Garden, which is also right in the middle of Times Square.  I reccomend it if you're on a budget - you know what to expect with the food there and you get a pretty good deal; I myself always go for the unlimited soup and salad special, hehe.  Unfortunately, getting back was not so cool, though. We had to wait forever for my car, and then I wasn't;t sure how to get to the Lincoln tunnel.  I bought a map and then it took a lot longer to get out of the city then expected - oh well.    I ran to my place in NJ, picked up my stuff from my parents place (I also had to quickly set up wireless networking at my parent's place), and then promptly left... though we got to visit with all my family, pretty much for  avery short while.    The drive back was ok... Oh!  What an adventure my life is... If you know me, you will know that I drive like a maniac. I can get from Pittsburgh to Piscataway, NJ or NYC in 5 Hours.  I can get back in 4.5 hours (somehow the route coming back is was shorter).  I make this drive constantly to see my family, so I'm used to it and know the route well: PA Turnpike -> Route 81 North -> Route 78 East -> Route 22 E (Shortcut don;t take it during rush-hour) -> back on Route 78 East -> Route 287 South (or keep going for NYC) I sometimes get it up to > 110 mph. People got freaked out by my driving called the cops on me on the way out there... and I was scared since any mistakes until between now and November will cost me dearly since in November my insurance goes way down (it's the three year anniversary of me totaling my old 1996 Acura Integra (man, I used to love that car!). In the end I only got a ticket for not having my car inspected since that is all they could prove.     oh well. The fucked-up thing is that my car was inspected - they just couldn't put the sticker on since the registration stickers weren't on the license plate (in PA we have little registration stickers that go on the corner of out license plates instead of on the windshield).  Yeah... so that could cost me up to $105 (grrrr).  Oh well.
