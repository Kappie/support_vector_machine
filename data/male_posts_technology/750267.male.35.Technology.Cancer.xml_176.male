One of the police representatives stood up to the microphone and said, "I would like to sincerely acknowledge the help of...".  Doesn't anyone understand the meaning of the word acknowledge any more?  acknowledge (v): "To admit the existence of".   I personally would like to acknowledge the guy who dented my truck causing me $750 damage. If that was you, please introduce yourself next time we see each other. I'd like to express my acknowledgement in person.   (Yes, I guess "to acknowledge" can also be an expression of gratitude. But in my mind, it's a weaker word than "to thank".)
