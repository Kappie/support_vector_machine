YAY!   Though I'm not quite sure yet if Boz let me in because he likes me or because he couldn't stand Jonnie's begging any more... . But now that I got a foot in the door, you won't get rid of me easily... mwahaha!  So, what shall I say... I'm german, currently living in Hamburg, 25 years old and well, check my blog, there's a little about me-section too. Feel free to make jokes about all my spelling- and grammar-mistakes and also feel free to ask me everything you ever wanted to know about Sauerkraut.  What else? I got a diploma in economics and a job in marketing but as this isn't satisfying at all, I'm currently busy establishing a cult with me as the deified leader.   That's basically it. So will somebody show me where the bathroom is? I brought my special toothbrush, just in case I'll get a little homesick.      (mwahaha, let's see how long it takes untill they realize that I infiltrated this house for disciple-recruiting and brainwashing purposes only... MWAHAHA... ooops, did I just say that loud?!?!)
