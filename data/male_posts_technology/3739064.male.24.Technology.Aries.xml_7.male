But it's always fun to go somewhere semi-new for a little bit on the company card.  One observation up here are the girls. They don't always check me out like they do in florida. Of course I'm joking. Maybe it's my hairy neck cause i need a haircut. Well ones thing for sure...I DONT LIKE EM! Now that I think of it. Very few people up here are in a  good mood. glad i didnt move here.  Strange how I don't like to ask a lot of people. And that most of the facility manager job is asking people to do things for you. Not sure if that's the job for me.  Holy crap get this, I found out why I'm gaining weight....It's because I eat too friggin much.  I don't make enough money to exercise.  I think that's it for now.
