Slashdot had an  urlLink article  about Enterprise and how Rick Berman is going to try to salvage it.  The discussion about this article ranged from how Berman needs to be executed to reasoning why the first series were much better.  Out of the blue comes  urlLink this comment .  It is an idea for a new Star Trek show.  The basic premise is of a cadre of special ops members of the Federation that take care of the dirty work.  Read the comment.  If it was shot in a dark, plodding, almost psycho manner, it could be a hit.  If it turns into another wild cowboy show, it could fail.
