Anyway, I'm not  urlLink funny  like FrankJ, not as  urlLink smart  as FrankJ, not as  urlLink boyishly handsome  as FrankJ, not as skilled a  urlLink Ronin  as FrankJ, and I don't have  urlLink SarahK  for a  urlLink T-Shirt Babe .  But I do have lots of opinions.  So, if this site generates any traffic, then there you are.  If not, then I'll just be talking to myself.  At least I'll be more disciplined in my soliloquy's.
