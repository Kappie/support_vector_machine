I guess it was pretty fun, I got to play airsoft for the first time and we were on the parks property after closing, which i guess is bad.  Some cops came after us, and my group got away, and the rest of the people were escorted back to brandon's house.  We watched .hack and did some other stuff.   but I'm really tired!    Alt code of the day- alt 154= Ãœ  a look of whats to come on my new sites...
