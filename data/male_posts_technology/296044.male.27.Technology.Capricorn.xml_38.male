Everything is unboxed, pictures are hung, and everything is in its place. The move went remarkably smooth no trouble at all. And amazingly, the place looks great! If youd like to check out some pictures, check  urlLink here .                I should go back to my old place this evening and do some cleaning. Which, I probably will do a little of. I need to wash some dishes, and dust. Thursday or Friday I need to go over there and clean my shower/bathtub. Ugh. Fun.                What do you want to bet Jeremy wont do any cleaning at all? He says hes gonna rent a carpet cleaning but I doubt it.                 WHAT-EV-ER!
