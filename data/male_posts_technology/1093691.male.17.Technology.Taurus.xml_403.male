With his innocent sweetness and his boyish good looks, how can any girl go wrong?  He's the type of guy to supply you with all the TLC that you can handle, and he'll always be there for you when you need moral support, or just a shoulder to cry on.  Though he is still young, he lacks the experiences of life, and can be naive.    urlLink   Who Is Your Ideal X-Men 2 Mate? (ladies only)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
