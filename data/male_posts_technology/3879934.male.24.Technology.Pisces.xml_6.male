I am a bit satisfied that i`m giving the assignment on time, now i have to start completing my semester project which is supposed to be a stupid job bank website containing all ASP scary tags that call upon 'access' data values, to make things worse i have to write a case study, a user manual and also give a presentation on the project.   The weird part of me (I think yours too!)  sometimes i get drifted away thinking of some not very imoprtant topics like "why did i enroll for this degree program?" which ultimately branches onto something else like "how many stars are in the sky?", "which branches to "are aliens a science fiction crap or are they for real", and that leads to something more spookier, then suddenly "BANG" i switch back to normal mode, where i ask myself what was i doing for the past 10 - 30 minutes. spoooky! Don`t you get that feeling?
