Coz there can be some problem in that single quote. If it doesnt occur, then no probs, just '03 is enough. For eg. 10 Aug '03 will do. What do u say?  and now after few days the blog is looking good once we start aclimatising it.  and that Bach CD is a collection titled Unforgetteble Classics. So there is any particular thing mentioned on CD cover regarding compilation.   Two weeks holidays for u valli? Enjoy well.  will catch u all later Ranjini
