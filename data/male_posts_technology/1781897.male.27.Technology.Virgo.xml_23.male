The early bird is busy dicking around with worms, whilst the party animal is in a deep sleep dreaming of the previous night's festivities.  In the evening, when the "early bird" is soaking their dentures and roosting, the party animal is sharpening his wit, and heading out for the booty (in the treasure sense of the word of course).  As for me and my house, I say fuck worms, and fuck getting up early....it's not like Good Morning America offers any compelling content worth being up for anyway!  Damn I tired......
