Someone on the Nets needs to warn the captain about the iceberg, 'cause right now Bruce Ratner is sitting in the hold of the ship guarding the treasure chests and can't see outside.   Fantasy  Impact    Rogers is expected to start for the Hornets and should be able to post about 8 and 5. Not a sentence I'm going to end an exclamation mark with, but it might be enough for the deeper leagues out there. Ratner, on the other hand, is going for leagues about 20,000 times deeper than those Rogers will be valuable in.  Count it.
