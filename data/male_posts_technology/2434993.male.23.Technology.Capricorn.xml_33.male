We constantly look for excuses and so we are not able to do anything for our own growth. So there is not a constant experience of growth. Life becomes a constant struggle as I begin to feel bound by the situations.   Solution: When I am conscious of my own growth I am able to be aware of my own thoughts, feelings and emotions and to understand how they influence my behaviour. Then I am able to take responsibility for my own choices and actions. Thus I begin to experience freedom not feeling bound by any situation.
