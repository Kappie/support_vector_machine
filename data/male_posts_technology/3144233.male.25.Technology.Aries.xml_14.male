As plans are taking shape we realise the limitations of this short period of time remaining.   We have elected our five leaders for the school youth club (Green Club) They are great kids and have taken on the responsibilities brilliantly. Our work put into teaching has paid off in terms of trust from the kids. They have already organised there own after school activity. What remains for us now, is to train them up as much as possible in the art of fun learning. In the green club there are seven units. Health, Environment, Out of school Youth, Library, Juniors, Creativity and Games. The principle is to orchestrate activities which blend many or all of these sections. For example a puppet show. This can involve a health related plot theme, litter picking (for building resources, props, stage etc), encouraging out of school enthusiasts to join in, acting, singing for cretivity etc etc. With the help of our nominated guide teacher, the children will soon be able to run their own sustainable youth club once we are gone. Fun creativity and learning. Development bliss I say. However, getting this club on its feet and running properly in 9 weeks or strikes, scholl management squabbles and monsson is going to be a challenge.  We also have to set up community commitees, which I have previously described. It is quite fun to feel ourselves becoming more and more liked and respected in our community. Our mantra must always be catlysing and faciltating  as opposed to doing. Clearly more effective in the long run but quite a challenge.  I saw another snake a few days ago allegedly more poisonous than the cobra, but was a lot smaller. It got into a room on the outside of a neigbours house, and was set upon by a dozen villagers with sticks, I felt quite sorry for the little blighter but couldnt help thinking that i should where my boots when outside at night. Maoisits have apparently blown up ambulances driving on strike days. The combination of power cuts an strikes does not make for hopeful rescue if bitten. Some snake bites here kill in fifteen minutes. Lovely. I would like to see a cobra before I leave, having seen only shed skins. They are pretty big I gather.  My health seems to be improving as i am eating well and excercising again. I am also enjoying very early starts and three washes a day. I am becoming very accustomed to washing at a hand pump in the open outdoors, and have taken to doing so three times a day. When its hot it is the only relief, as there are no swimming pools.   The team dynamics are volatile here, and i find myself playing manager. trying to balance the motivation, with the communication in our team is a consant struggle and is proving to be an important part of my experience. More detail and less tact for those I see on return.  bye  love Joel   From Joel's Napali Adventures.
