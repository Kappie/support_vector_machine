Tirupur is located in Coimbatore district, 54 Kms away from Coimbatore(Bala veetula iruntha just 6 km than!!!). Most  people are mainly into Garment Exports. The turnover of Tirupur per year is estimated to be about Rs.7500 crores.   Many foreign companies like  urlLink Wal-Mart ,  urlLink JC Penny , urlLink FUBU  , Classic polo are outsourcing their T-shirts from here. Some of the main exporters in Tirupur are Eastman Exports, Premdurai Exports, Stallion Garments. Around 3,00,000 people are getting employment directly and indirectly from these garment companies. Many people from near by cities like Coimbatore, Erode, Somanur, Avanashi are coming to job by means of train to Tirupur.(Yours truly is one of them).  Indian Cricket and Hockey team players are made in Tirupur. Tirupur has taken order to supply garments for the forecoming  urlLink Athens 2004 olympics  Garments are designed for different ages from Kids to Old people.  Garments are designed by taking into consideration of design, aesthetics, colour. Nearly 1500 big companies(nearly 70% are ISO 9001:2000 Certified, 35% are ISO 14001 Certified companies are here.   Tirupur supports well for the revenue for Government of Tamilnadu. Tirupur is spearheading in revenues after Chennai. But, Tirupur lacks behind is in the professionalism in which people work. Even Tirupur is financially very strong, but infrastructure is very worst.  Ok I will continue my Tirupur episode again , after some time  Nanban Ramgopalkum, Sogothari Josibakum en inya pirantha naal nal valthugal.  Bye for now
