And, thanks to my PL, my presentation got postponed to today and am back to full strength. Saturday I was waiting for Ramgopal to call me at my house. But didn't receive his call. It was in late sunday afternoon that I realized the secrect behind why Ramg didn't call me - our phone was out-of-order. Today, I'm looking forward to the first presentation that I'm giving in my corporate life.   And its great to see the blog growing. All credits to jax, as he was the one who first introduced this concept of WebLogs to all of us. This is getting exciting by the day.  Kicha
