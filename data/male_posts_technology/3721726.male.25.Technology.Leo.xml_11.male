Nobody else in my department was in when I actually rolled up at 08:30, and as they're not due in until 09:00 I probably could have at least taken a shower.  8(  I hate being unclean.  Like when I happened upon a  urlLink Loxodon Warhammer , or a leper.  So I've been thinking about the blogging phenomenon, and wondering why some people blog.  It's a crazy world we live in, I guess, where your good buddies  mom  has a blog.    there...is...another...Sky..walker
