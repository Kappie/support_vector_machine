Let me start by saying that I've never read the comics so I don't have any expectations coming from there. My only Catwoman experience comes from watching  urlLink Michelle Pfeiffer  in  urlLink Batman Returns  and that was a long time ago. I was also warned by a colleague that the movie was utter crap so my expectations were very low.  Still, on paper things don't look that bad: starring  urlLink Halle Berry ,  urlLink Sharon Stone  and  urlLink Benjamin Bratt  (whom I've liked ever since  urlLink Blood In, Blood Out  and  urlLink Texas ) should guarantee at least a certain degree of quality. Secondly, the story does contain some very good building blocks for an interesting dramatic movie.   But it's not. It's not even a good action movie, just a so-so one.  Now I don't know about you, but I never thought I'd find scenes with a lightly dressed, leather-clad Halle Berry to be problematic, but I did. They're the least interesting scenes in the movie.   I wasn't impressed by the special effects showing Catwoman climbing walls scaling buildings. And that comes from someone that normally doesn't pay that much attention to special effects if they're believable within their context.   I instead found myself to be more interested in seeing Catwoman's normal alter ego, Patience Phillips, and the chemistry between her and Bratt's character, detective Tom Lone.  Put all of that together with the fact that she (understandably) is Catwoman for considerable parts of the movie, and you've got yourself a large problem.  I know, I know - it's a Hollywood summer action movie. I shouldn't be surprised. And I'm not, I'm just disappointed that it couldn't even a be a good one in that category. -->
