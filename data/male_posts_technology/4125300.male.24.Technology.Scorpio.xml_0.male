The only times I feel reality is during physical activity. Perhaps I'm on the verge of a new spiritual consciousness. My instincts tell me that I'd have to sacrifice things very dear to me to achieve it. I believe that if one is heavily concerned with the sacrifices, then they aren't ready for the ideology. Such changes should not be choices, but rather almost innate decisions. Change comes from within.  Speaking of physical activity, I just bought a pretty nice (older) racing bike for $75.   Very excited!  Apparently the person who sold it used to race it during college, but now rides something newer. The bike I've been riding is quite old, poorly maintained, and weighs a ton. Somehow it got to the U.S. from China somehow, or at least I assume due to the mandarin script on it. Anyway, the new bike is well maintained, has a lot of racing features, and is much lighter. Can't wait to get the bike on the trail!  Had some serious conversations with CW lately. They seem to end up with us laughing. This is a really good sign. If we can take conversations that have the potential for emotional intensity and reduce them to humor, then we will not hesitate to talk about the things that bother us. Every issue is easier to resolve if you have a smile on your face!
