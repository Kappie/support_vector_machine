That's not even half of a presidential term, which is more than he deserves.  I am completely flabbergasted that he has been able to single handedly exposed every flaw in our system of government.
 
 He proved that the electoral college is an antiquated system that fails the people.  He proved that a maniacal executive can steal war powers from congress under cloak of public tragedy (read 9/11).  He proved that he could pass legislation ( urlLink The PATRIOT ACT ) to "fight terrorism" by making sure you don't read the  urlLink wrong books .  He proved that Americans are capable of equal to greater degrees of torture than the "dictators" we like to overthrow.  
 
 Now Dubya is trying to prove that he can write discrimination and religious ideology into our federal constitution.  This while we are still fighting the affects of our past discrimination against blacks and women.  I know that you may not be the most politically active person out there; I'm definitely not.  I know that you may not agree with gay marriage.  But please try to think long term and do the American thing, the right thing.  Send an email your  urlLink Senator  asking him or her vote against  urlLink writing discrimination  into the fabric of our society.
