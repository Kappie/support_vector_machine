I am thinking that procrastination may not be that good, but I will wait until I see the results of the paper that I wrote practically in one day (10 pages) to give my opinion. I know a bit more than I used to about Russia now tho. Did you know that it used to be legal for husbands to beat their wives, and some wives expected to be beaten a little bit every night! I was shocked, but not really, at this revelation. People used to do a lot of pretty shitty misogynistic things. Anyways, it was at least a comfort to read that not many people actually beat their wives a lot in the old days of Russia. Apparently it was mostly a thing that the rich landowning class did! The poorermen had to work with their wives and were much closer to them (not to mention, needed their help around the house), and the rich women were not really even supposed to show their face in public. I also found out that in the old days of Russia you could divorce twice if you wanted to but the women would usually be sent into convents where they had their head shaved and were not allowed to marry again. I thought that such a woman would make a great subject of a movie. But, I am not a writer.  ...paper over = good news  Yeah, well I had another weekend with partying (had to celebrate). I am starting to wonder if I should slow down and not do this every weekend. I mean it does get pretty expensive sometimes. Friday was not that expensive. I went to go see a play at the Arena stage since I had a comp ticket so greatly appreciated from my ex-girlfriend ummm... 'A' I guess I will call her from now on. The play I saw was called Crowns and it seemed to offer an insight to black (African American)culture that I hadn't really seem much of before. I highly recommend it. It is very lively and the singing was teriffic. Saturday after proofreading the paper (or... trying to proofread the paper but actually watching King Ralph on tv), then adding citations to it, I went to Baltimore to visit my friend 'K' who is one of the nicest girls you would want to meet. We went to this art museum by the harbor that had works from people with mental handicaps or startling emotional trauma. It was pretty awesome. One sculpture by this mental patient was an excellent wood carving of himself, but unfortunately he killed himselfafter being released for 2 yearsfrom the mental hospital. Then we ate at a Cuban restaurant called "little Havana" which was nice. Thenn... we came back to her place and got ready to go out on the town. She was soo hot in her cute little outfit. If she wasn't engaged to another friend of mine then I would hit on her ;-P hehe Anyways, we went to this chic little club called  urlLink Red Maple . It had no cover, but the drinks were kind of expensive, which I am used to since DC costs a lot usually. That place looked like the  urlLink Queer Eye  guys ran through there. Then went to  urlLink Coburns  in Canton Square for a little bit of dancing and beer.K and I had a good time. Then her roommate (who was moving out) woke me up in the morning with some vaccuuming yay! nothing like waking up at around 8:30 am after a night of drinking! I would have punched him in the face, but then who would move his shit out... not me. It was fun watching him and his friends struggle with the couch as they tried to get it down the stairs anyways. That guy is an asshole anyways, K told him so, and he will probably get what he deserves someday. He is becoming a doctor I believe, maybe someone will be shoving a needle in his ass sometime soon! We can only hope.
