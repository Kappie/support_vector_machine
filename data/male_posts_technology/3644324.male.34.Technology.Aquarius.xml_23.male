I mean honestly, everything isn’t always about you.  The Ladies of Swarm:  Cindy Chan “TMTDB”: When Cindy says “Throw me the disk, bitch!”, bitches throw her the disk. Cindy is a levelheaded, sweet woman off the field but on the field she’s a hellcat who refuses to be looked off. There is nary a Swarmer who hasn’t felt the searing heat of the “C. Chan Scowl”.  Cindy Ong “Slash”: Is her nickname because her cuts have been studied by F1 engineers in hopes of improving the performance of their racing machines or is it because there is widespread speculation concerning why she always declines to accompany the Swarm on their post-game drinking binges on nights with a full moon. Is she a mild mannered Swarmer or is she a bloodthirsty werewolf?  Lindsay “The Schoolmistress”: Beneath the façade of her pleasant disposition lays the smoldering heart of a genuinely benevolent soul. But just to the left and down a little of from that heart lays the spleen of a petulant six year old. Fortunately for all, the spleen is a very low ranking organ and is only allowed to call the shots (at least the verbal shots) while behind the wheel of a two thousand pound automobile and of course that other time, but we have all decided to forget about that.  Lisa Personality #1: “The Barbarian”: Having played Ultimate for nigh on four hundred years there is nothing that Lisa doesn’t know about the game and nothing she won’t do to win. She rails against those less competitive than herself and those who fail to appreciate her balls-tothe-wall playing style.  Personality #2: “Oprah”: Lisa wants everyone to enjoy the game and will do whatever she can to ensure harmony and contentment on the field. Always quick with a complement, Lisa wants you to be the best Ultimate player you can be.  Mel “The Siren”: Sings like an angel, runs like a gazelle. Mel is able to run at full speed, circling the handler for hours on end without tiring, all the time playing the guitar and belting out “I said I” and “Five minutes after the call”,available for sale at:  urlLink http://www.melaniedekker.com/   Verlane “Cap’n Smiley Crotch”: Don’t let her curly, red hair fool you, this girl is no Shirley Temple, she’s a Strawberry Daiquiri and make that a double. When she’s patrolling the field she’ll take no guff from anyone. If you’ve got guff, you’d best keep it to yourself or dispose of it elsewhere.  The Gentlemen of Swarm: Alfred “The mercenary”: Exhausted from a full day of Ultimate-for-hire he showed up to bolster the depleted Swarm line-up after some undisclosed “persuasion” from Verlane.  Geoffrey C “A-game, S-game”: Bemused savant with devastating good-looks (see: http://www3.telus.net/nutmilk/Swarm 2004/GPC2.jpg) who, when he brings his stellar Ultimate A-game is the ultimate in unstoppable Ultimate forces but when he brings his S-game………Ultimately, which game will he bring today?  Geoffrey L “Lifestyle guy”: Granola Hemp Hippy turned Tri-athlete Tax Lawyer soon to be turned Snooty, Riche Pants, Oxford Master of Laws. His body sacrificing layout-or-die defense is surpassed only by his ability to fire off writs and torts and argue the minutia of the penal code while delivering “Loomer Laser” passes to the dump.  Glenn “Grumpdaddy”: Among Glenn’s weekly contribution to the team is bringing two very comfy chairs. His best four weeks were when he managed to occupy one of the chairs for the entire duration of each and every game. When Glenn isn’t grumping it up on the field or the sidelines he’s usually at work writing long, incomprehensible, unsolicited email in order to help fill his fellow Swarmer’s trash bins.  King: “New Guy”: King is a long time Ultimater, first time Swarmer. King’s unconventional how-about-we-try-and-win attitude and his propensity both for catching disks thrown to him and throwing disks where other Swarmers could catch them have been labeled “Unswarmish”, a stigma he’s still learning to deal with.  Paul: “DVD”: If you met him on the field you’d think he’s called DVD for his Defense, Vitality  Determination. Actually it’s for his stellar string of straight to DVD blockbusters such as Mindstorm, The Operative, Escape Velocity and the upcoming Crash Landing (see http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0083590). When Paul isn’t tearing up the field in his patented “no traction” cleats he’s in front of his computer “making marvelous movie magic, man!”  Peter “The Rookie”: International melon magnate on the run from the Brazilian mango mob Peter has a highly refined strategic mind and a set of hands that would make an NFL receiver turn green with envy. His adept brain is always three steps ahead; his burly body is oft playing catch up.  The Capricious Gods:  Wendell “God of Loose Connections”: The god who is to blame when wires don’t quite meet, when connectors aren’t snug and when the plug doesn’t exactly fit into the socket. Wendell is a spiteful dweeb who can only be appeased through ritual sacrifice, please see page #42728 of “How to Placate the Modern Techno Gods” revised 2003.  Susie “God of Servers Being Down”: Part malevolent destroyer, part random menace, part creator of free time, this god is a big ol’ hunk of cheese in the office’s intestinal tract. Susie is more an arbiter of pleadings  prayer than a receiver of sacrifice. For more details see Chapter 72 of “Oh please! Oh Please! Groveling for Techno Success in the 21st Century”.  Angus Longshaft “God of Cable Loss”: God to blame when the cable you absolutely, positively must have just isn’t to be found. Angus is a very ancient god and isn’t exactly the brightest light in the pantheon. All supplications to Angus involve a fair bit of prostration, a kilt, and a skillfully placed haggis (sort of explains the popularity of wireless technology, no?), see Chapter 162 of “Oh please! Oh Please! Groveling for Techno Success in the 21st Century”.  The Folks Watching it on TV:  Stan  Nancy Vul “Stan  Nancy or The Vuls”: A nice middle-aged couple watching TV, you probably know someone just like them.  ANGUS LONGSHAFT BACK STORY: The year was 1127 the place was somewhere north of Glasgow and somewhere south of the Norwegian Sea, more specifically a small town in the highlands called Glennglennic. In this town lived a man, a large man, a towering behemoth of a man. This man’s name was Angus Longshaft and what Angus could do better than anyone else in the history of history was throw a 20ft toothpick for distance. So dominant was Angus’ caber tossing ability that he had never, in his short but distinguished history, been beaten.  On a fine day in June it was time, once again, for the Huge Highland Games. The event kicked off with the usual pretty girls dancing around swords for reasons that were a bit sketchy even then. Next followed a few lads smacking each other about the head and neck with claymores followed by a round or two of the ever-popular Highland Leapfrog. With all of the preliminaries events out of the way it was time for the main event, the crowd pleaser, the Caber Toss.  Angus, being the reigning champion, was scheduled to throw last so he sat back comfortably, scratched, drank mead, and pursued his other avenue of interest - chatting up the bonnie lasses. There were many fine competitors on this day but none came close to reaching Angus’ previous years record of two spins, and 35ft. In the final round it came down to two competitors: Angus and Rogered Patterson (so named for an unfortunate incident during a hotly contested game of Highland Leapfrog – but that’s an entirely different story). Angus threw his final caber and achieved a remarkable throw of 2.25 revolutions, 41ft. Rogered knew he was going to lose and started to sweat (he’d wagered a cask of his best whiskey that he’d win) and sweat. In fact folks were heard to say “Wow, sweaty Rogered Patterson sure is sweaty, even for him.”  Rogered waddled up to the line with his caber balanced precariously on his shoulder and his unfortunately slick palms. Off to the left Angus was putting the moves on the young lass who, though she didn’t win, had bounced her way through the sword dance competition in the most delightful way. Rogered reared back and tossed the caber like he’d never tossed a caber before – exceptionally poorly. In fact the caber slid off Rogered’s perspiration soaked mitts and careened up and to the left, up and to the left, landing directly on the back of Angus’ head. The force of the impact drove Angus face-first onto the anvil he’d been leaning against and then spilled the contents of his cranium onto the skirt of the aforementioned lass.  Now really this was a grave injustice. No champion should go out this way. It was uncool. Kenny “The God of the Despicable Demise” noticed this abomination and decided to do what he could to rectify it. He went before the Council for the Creation of New Gods and Lipstick Colours and argued that Angus represented the epitome of Caber Tossing prowess and as the Caber was growing in popularity as something to toss – having recently passed both the boulder and the cat in the latest poll by “Things to Toss Quarterly” magazine. The Council pondered this argument and then the Chairwoman asked “So, Angus Longshaft…? How long?”  Long years passed with Angus reigning supreme in all things Caber Toss related.  Even longer years passed and at a certain point the number of people tossing the Caber began to slowly decline. It wasn’t as if people suddenly one day said “I shan’t pick up that 150lb stick anymore” it was more that the young folk weren’t as likely to fling the broom (as everyone knows, the first step on the road to caber toss) and there were a lot more bridges around so the need to chuck a log across a stream just didn’t come up as much.  Frankly Angus didn’t really notice the waning of his godly area of influence, he wasn’t that big on noticing what was going on anywhere. Angus had only two interests: Caber Toss and enjoying the bonny lasses; he was spectacularily talented at both endeavors. In fact all the goddesses, from time to time, would pay a call on Angus to “get things sorted” and because of this, among the gods, he earned a reputation (completely unjustifiably I might add, but you know how it is when you hear people repeating the same thing for six or seven centuries, eventually you just assume that its true) as someone who could sort things out. Apparently the gods don’t understand what a euphemism is.  The year is now 2004 and Caber Toss is suffering yet another year in what has been centuries of decline. The Godly Director of Observances, Supplications, Prayers, Pleadings  Sacrifice is doing her quarterly tabulation of the books and discovers that Caber Toss is no longer viable. Normally this would mean that Angus (as the deity in this area) would be cast out of Godland to be eaten by the crows and other angry forest creatures in the Forest of Angry Forest Creatures that surrounds Godland. But, Deloris thought back to all the evenings that Angus had helped her get things sorted and decided that Angus was just too valuable to let go. Instead she wrote out a pink slip for Angus and made an appointment for him to speak with the employment counselor and handed it to Mercury. After Angus finished his morning two-hour Caber practice Mercury handed him the pink slip.  Angus asked him, “So, what the hell is this then?”.  Mercury replied, “It’s a pink slip dude…you’ve been laid off.”  Angus looked at him, the light of comprehension decidedly absent from his eye. “So Deloris is handing out pink slips afterwards now is she? I mean I admit our last time wasn’t my best performance but…but I’m not sure what I’m supposed to do with this” eyeing the note suspiciously.  “No Angus. The note is informing you that you are no longer the God of Caber Toss. You’ve been sacked.” Mercury informed him. “You have to go and talk to Simon over at the Employment Center.” With that Mercury decided that he was needed elsewhere and flew off before the confused Scottish god with the big stick decided to take out his frustrations on a certain winged, bearer of bad news.  Angus still had no idea what Mercury had been on about but he thought that maybe that new fellow Simon could explain it to him – Angus had been meaning to get over and talk to him to see if he’d be interested in tossing the Caber about.  Angus walked into the Employment Center and found Simon’s office. Simon looked up and asked what he could do for him. Angus said that he’d had a visit from Mercury, some kind of pink paper from Deloris and he thought he’d come by and chat with Simon about it. Simon asked if he could see the paper and after examining it started to flip through his gigantic ledger (because gods only ever read from giant books) and found the available position section. He then asked Angus what his interests were, he said “So Angus, what are your interests, what are you good at?”.  Angus realized that he’d finally found someone he could talk to and belted out in his proudest, thickest Scottish brogue “Well Simon, I like f#%ing and Caber Toss”.  Simon, being a simple god, was so taken aback by Angus’ reply that he blushed bright pink and didn’t take the time to get Angus to repeat the last bit that he’d only half heard. He eventually managed to say, “Well I believe that Aphrodite and Eros have got that one area covered…so, lets see about the other.”  Angus wondered if that meant that Simon was interested in a bit o’ the toss. He sat expectantly and waited while Simon flipped through his big book.  Eventually Simon stopped flipping, believing he had found something appropriate, in fact it seemed to be the exact thing that Angus wanted “God of Cable Loss” by all accounts it seemed to even be in an area of serious growth. Simon looked up and said, “Well Angus, I think I’ve found just the thing for you…Cable Loss”  Angus realized at that moment that Simon was probably a bit of an idiot but at least he was into the toss, even if he pronounced it a bit oddly. He responded with “Yeah, Caber Toss, care to go fling a few?”  Simon, confirming his previous assumption that Angus was a dolt-in-gods-clothing, smiled, nodded at the man and said “Sure, maybe later. Here’s your Techno God Guild card, your new Tome of Responsibilities and Privileges (colloquially known as the TORAP, think of it as the Idiot’s Guide to being the God of X, where in this case, unbeknownst to Angus, X is Cable Loss), and the keys to your new place in the new Techno neighbourhood. Menial and Tedious will look after moving your things for you. Best of luck to you!” then he extended his hand in hopes of accelerating Angus’ progress towards the door.  Angus was nonplussed (he didn’t know the he was nonplussed, he was under the mistaken impression that his condition could be most accurately described as flummoxed but I’m telling you that he was definitely nonplussed). His day had started normally but had gone strangely since then. But, on the upside, he was holding the keys to a new house and that was good because the old place was getting a bit beaten up - what with the occasional Caber-through-the-wall accident and all. Angus gathered his thoughts, an action of scant milliseconds, and uttered, “Well nice to meet you Simon, thanks for the house, we’ll get together for that toss and maybe grab some pie as well”, because he found that people always felt better at the mere mention of pie, and he set off to find this new house of his.  GETTING CLOSER TO THE SWARM-RELATED BIT OF THE STORY:  Angus found his house, across the street from the houses of Wendell – God of Loose Connections and Susie – Goddess of Servers Being Down, who were newly anointed gods and were also moving in. The three gods introduced themselves and the two newbies were excited to learn how long Angus had been reigning in Godland. They assumed, a mistake that would taint the first three or four decades of their reigns but we’ll get to that later, that Angus would be an excellent source of information on all things godly and god related. They chatted for a while and then Wendell said that he had to go home and start reading his TORAP.  “TORAP? Nooooo, you two must come on over and we’ll lift a few pints. There’s plenty of time for reading tomorrow, or next week, maybe next month, next year, in a hundred years…”, Angus said as he tried to coax his new friends back to the full service bar in his new home (all god homes have a full service bar – the god’s architect got mentally blocked in 1970’s American suburbia.)  Wendell and Susie spent the next four hours listening to Angus tell them Caber Toss stories. Luckily they were still so starry eyed at having become gods that they didn’t realize that Angus was boring the living snot out of them. Eventually Angus got tired of talking and realizing that it was time for his afternoon practice. He tried to convince his new friends to come with him for some log lobbing but they both declined saying that they had to settle into their new places.  Over the next few days Susie and Wendell met more of their fellow gods and heard, repeatedly, how lucky they were to have someone as good at getting things sorted as Angus for a neighbour - though Susie still hadn’t figured out why the other goddesses always said it with a wink and a nod. Susie also discovered, much to her chagrin, that Wendell appeared to be a morning person who was prone to start collecting his ritual offerings (a process that is much too disgusting to describe here but if you’ve ever seen a grown man run for the phone and stub his toe on the coffee table causing him to hop in pain, loose his balance on the hardwood floor, and then carom crotch first into the banister then you at least have some idea what it sounds like, only imagine it about forty-three times louder) at six in the morning. Susie, on the other hand, enjoyed staying up late into the night blasting the prayers and pleadings of her devotees on her zillion watt stereo not heading to bed until Apollo had stumbled out of the shower and had his morning coffee – of course Apollo was at his own home across town in the old Greek neighbourhood (imagine street after street of the Parthenon only no rubble) but you know what I’m getting at.  This clash of sleeping habits led to a bit of enmity between the Goddess of Servers Being Down and the God of Loose Connections. Relations across the picket fence became frosty. When Susie needed eggs one day, Wendell claimed to be fresh out. When Wendell popped over in hopes of replenishing his depleted salsa stocks during the Superbowl (yes, even the gods watch sports on TV), Susie said she couldn’t spare any. If you’re wondering why gods and goddesses are running out of groceries its because neither of them had got around to reading their TORAP yet (Angus’ illiterate influence, plus they really are intimidatingly large books) and they weren’t aware that a river of salsa was only a finger snap away. Anyway, as sleeplessness continued to take its toll Wendell began to describe his neighbour as “the shrew next door” and Susie spitefully referred to Wendell as “that screaming ass”.  One Wednesday morning as Angus was about to head out to practice Wendell intercepted him and described his problem with the goddess next door in hopes that he could benefit from Angus’ renowned talent for sorting things out.  Angus was, of course, oblivious to this build-up of tension in the neighbourhood but he pondered the problem for a minute and then said, “what always works for me when dealing with an unhappy goddess is to invite her over, give her a glass or two of wine, play some sexy bagpipe music on the stereo, dim the lights, rub her shoulders for a while, and then…well…you know.” Wendell was disgusted by the very idea.  Angus then suggested that Wendell could come with him to give the caber a bit of a go and they could come up with a solution. Wendell managed to wriggle out of having to try and heave a tree across a field but still got Angus to commit to coming up with a solution to his goddess problem. Angus trotted off and promptly forgot all about poor Wendell.  On Angus’ return from practice Susie stopped him and told him about all the problems she was having with Wendell. Angus immediately proposed his wine, bagpipes, shoulder rub solution but Susie rejected it even faster than Wendell had. Angus then advocated a Caber Toss – the loser of which would have to move into Angus’ old house (as Angus dimly recalled hearing through the goddess grapevine – they always wanted to talk afterward… - that his old house was still unoccupied due to all the caber damage). Susie wasn’t crazy about the caber aspect but did relish the idea of crushing Wendell in a competition and being rid of him. Susie then said, and if she’d only known then what she knows now she never would have, “Well Angus, I don’t have any idea how gods handle this sort of thing but I’ll go for any sort of godlike, goddish, godly contest to decide this thing. I’ll leave it in your capable hands to sort out.” Susie then gave Angus her best smile and sashayed on home. Angus watched her walk away and had several thoughts, none of which had anything to do with caber toss.  It occurred to Angus that he’d heard countless times that he knew how to sort things out and that this was an occasion where being able to sort things out would definitely be an asset. So, he just needed to sort this out. Angus went inside and sat down in his favourite chair. He then kicked his feet up on his favourite wooly footstool and began to think. His first idea was that Wendell and Susie should just…but no, neither of them was willing to give that a try. His next idea…no Susie said no caber.  His third idea was to turn on the TV and see if the Highland Games were on. After flipping through 900 channels he finally found one showing the 1983 games from Inverness and he settled back in his chair to think. Eleven hours later Angus hadn’t moved from his chair (gods don’t pee) but he was still waiting for idea number four. Finally at 3am he gave up attempting to come up with an idea on his own and decided that he’d ask someone. So, having solved how he would solve the problem he went to bed.  Thursday morning he got up and, as per his routine for the past nine hundred years, he had some porridge and headed off to practice. And, as had been his routine since yesterday, an exhausted Wendell accosted him. “Aye, Wendell, I’ve got a solution for you. I just need to work out a few kinks and I’ll have it for you tomorrow. Just leave me to sort it all out.” Wendell was so ecstatic that Angus was going to tame the wicked wench for him that he almost forgot himself and agreed to throw the twig with him. Instead he scurried back inside and performed an stunning rendition of the Myposian dance of joy.  After practice Angus ran into Diana who’d had a frustrating morning – only scratches and sweat to show for three hours chasing an elusive hind through the forest. A few hours later Angus was laying on a bearskin rug, basking in the afterglow, half-listening to Diana describe, in excruciating detail, a dispute she’d had with Fanny - Goddess of the Henhouse. As Angus contemplated attempting another go, something in what Diana said coaxed another thought to the surface.  “So, you settled your problem using mortals?” was the thought that Angus managed to express.  “Of course, it’s Rule #3 in every TORAP ‘All disputes between the good gods and goddesses of Godland shall be decided by contest between mortals.’ ” Diana said and then after a strategic glance nether-wards realized that Angus wasn’t using his big brain currently and there really were more pressing issues than talking about the TORAP.  After sorting the pressing issues and a bit more basking Angus headed home to solve Wendell and Susie’s problem once and for all. He settled into his chair and thought “Mortal competition…mortal competition” over and over. It then occurred to him that beside caber toss he had no idea what mortals were up to these days. In fact, he hadn’t had any contact with the mortal world at all besides watching Highland games on TV and that one fellow who’d prayed to him two years ago. “What was the fellows name again? Stamp, Stain, Dido, no…Stan, that was it.” Angus fondly remembered Stan, who’d taken his wife – Nancy if memory served – on a trip to Scotland and had decided that when in Scotland you must toss a caber. Angus briefly forgot about everything as he relived the moment when Stan had held the caber wobbling up off the ground and had started praying with a vengeance “Oh god don’t let this oversized chopstick crush me into the ground, oh please, don’t let my back give out, oh let me just get this one toss so I can tell the grandkids I did it!” Fortunately for Stan, Angus had heard his prayers and had helped Stan’s back hold out. And, in a further bit of good luck Scotland has an excellent medical system and your pinky toe really isn’t as important as everyone makes it out to be. Additionally, the cast had impressed the grandchildren even more than the piece of paper with, “This certifies that on the 3rd of July, 2002 Stan Vul of Quallicum Beach threw the Caber a total of 0 revolutions, 3 inches distance.” written on it.  Angus took a moment to gather his thought and then decided that he’d just take a peek and see what Stan was up to and maybe that would give him a clue as to what kind of mortal competition was going on these days.  STAN AND NANCY VUL: Stan and Nancy live in Quallicum Beach, which, as the name may lead you to believe, is situated right where the majestic, temperate rainforest meets the cool waters of the Juan de Fuca Straight. Quallicum Beach is the kind of place you pass through and think that it might be nice to come back and visit when you needed to get away from it all. It’s the kind of place where you imagine you wouldn’t be hassled by having to ‘do things’ or worry about anything ‘happening’. It’s the kind of place where everyone has a satellite dish that pipes pseudo-life into their homes via the 5700-channel television universe.  The Vuls have set aside this particular evening to watch ESPN 17’s Thursday Night Ultimate Doubleheader. Many of Stan and Nancy’s neighbours think that they are nutty for watching Thursday Ultimate when it is generally acknowledged that it is the weakest night but Stan and Nancy swear by the entertainment value to be found on Thursday. And tonight was doubly good because both of their favourite teams were playing – not each other, but that would be next week.  Stan’s favourite team is the Swarm, a rag-tag group who’s season thus far has consisted of a five game winning streak that saw them boosted into the First Division, followed by a nine game losing streak that saw them relegated back to Second Division. One of the things that Stan liked best about them was that on any given week there’s no telling which team will show up, the dominating force or the godforsaken nightmare, they always kept you on the edge of your seat. Stan also liked that it was fun to try and figure out how different members of the team were connected to each other, it was like playing that Kevin Bacon game, with all of the Swarm being connected somehow – school, work, other sports, relationships, but the overall connection was pretty loose. The final thing about the Swarm that Stan appreciated was that they weren’t a team that got all caught up in the whole “Spirit of the Game” non-sense, in fact they’d almost come to blows in one game which had had Stan up cheering until the game had been called on account of hard feelings.  Nancy, on the other hand, like a team called Wham-O. They weren’t as spectacular as the Swarm could be at it’s best but they were solid and courteous and those were the things that Nancy appreciated. She also liked that all the players on Wham-O were waiters and waitresses, people who had jobs she could understand, not like those Swarm with their Melon magnates, show business folk, and high-tech phone weirdoes. Nancy was born in Quallicum Beach and aside from that disastrous trip to Scotland hadn’t left.  As the first game got underway Nancy began her usual torrent of mockery for Stan’s beloved Swarm. “So, I see your big fellow is doing his job keeping that chair from blowing away in the wind.”  “Yes Nancy, he’s still on the DL but the doctor’s say he’ll be ready to play next week. All right!! Did you see Pete catch that one in the endzone? We’re up! BZZZZ! Go Swarm!!” Stan replied as he leapt to his feet in celebration.  The game was a seesaw battle back and forth with the Swarm getting to the dreaded eight-point-wall first.  AND THIS IS WHERE ANGUS STARTS PEEKING IN:  “My team of loose connections is kicking some serious Ultimate butt now Nancy. Swarm rules! Yeah Swarm! Oh…domination!”  Angus heard this and couldn’t believe his good fortune – but then he thought about it and realized that Stephanie (Goddess of Unexpected Good Fortune) really did owe him one after last Saturday. Here he’d been looking for a mortal competition and Stan and Nancy had provided one – granted it looked like a bunch of people running around a field with a broken fly-swatter but if that’s what the mortals were into these days then that was fine with him. And double bonus, Wendell God of Loose Connections already had a team here, the Swarm! Angus decided to revel in his success for a few minutes and in doing so he completely missed the end of the game, but no matter, all he had to do now was find a team for Susie and he was set.  By this time the second game was underway and Stan had taken over the mocking duties. On one play the handler for Wham-O ran for a disk and somehow managed to trip himself and sprawled onto the grass as the disk flew through the space where his hands had been only milliseconds before. Stan burst out “We’ve got a waiter down! Waiter down, Nancy!” with a giggle.  Nancy indignantly replied, “They’re called servers now Stanly, Martha says that you have to call them servers”.  Stan laughed all the louder as he yelled out “Server down! Nancy, we’ve got a server down!” in his best Scottish accent. This time Angus took having the solution to his problem handed to him in stride – after all he wasn’t well know as a man who could sort things out for nothing – and wrote “Wham-O for Susie” in his mental notebook. Now the only problem was arranging for Swarm to play Wham-O.  Now, one of the real treats in being a god is that arranging things for mortals is right up their alley, it’s kind of what they do. That is, gods who’ve read the TORAP, which, as I’m sure you’ve realized by now, Angus has not done.  So, Angus tried to figure out a way that he could get the two teams to play each other…nothing came to mind. Then he had a brainstorm, maybe he could get someone else to arrange it for him, it seemed like all his goddess friends were always on about how they had to arrange this or that thing all the time. Just as he was about to stop peeking and start looking for help he heard the announcer rap up the broadcast by saying “And tune in next Thursday when you’ll see Swarm vs. Wham-O and the Belligerent Buddha’s vs. the Dawdling Sherpas.”  At that point he stopped his peeking in on the Vuls and headed over to tell Wendell and Susie that he’d arranged for their competition next Thursday night.  He stood out on the sidewalk and bellowed for his neighbors to come out and hear the exciting news. Wendell and Susie wandered outside expending great energy to give the impression that they were effortlessly ignoring each other. Angus explained, “There’s going to be an Ultimate game next Thursday to decide this problem the two of you are having.” Angus would have gone into greater detail on the problem but he’d completely forgotten what the problem was, what with all the thinking he’d had to do to solve it – there’s only so much room in a man’s brain.  Angus continued, “Susie, you’re team is Wham-O and Wendell the Swarm will play for you. Whoever’s team loses has to move to my old house on… well… over that-a-way,” he said with a vague wave nowhere near the direction of his former domicile. “So, now that that’s settled, who’s up for a…” but before he could get his chronic question out, Wendell and Susie both erupted with questions of their own, questions such as, “What are the rules? Who is Swarm? When on Thursday? Where is the game? What is Ultimate?”  Angus replied with, “The rules…whoever wins, wins. Swarm is Wendell’s team, weren’t you listening? The game is on TV. It’s a mortal game where they run around, count to ten, stand around a lot, and try to hit each other in the head with a flying plate.”  With that Susie and Wendell threw petulant scowls across the fence at each other for a few seconds and then withdrew to ponder their upcoming competition. Angus stood for a few minutes thinking that maybe he should try working on getting a reputation as a ladies-man and leave this “sorting things out” to someone else. He glanced down at his CaberMan Timex and judged that it was probably a good time to get in some practice and headed off to, well, you know.  AT SUSIE’S: Susie walked back inside seething from having that screaming ass scowl at her. She wound up and booted the first thing she saw in her foyer and her TORAP moved a good three inches and flopped open. (Like I said, gods only do big books.) After unleashing a torrent of scorn upon the offending tome she bent down and looked at what the open page said, “Messing with Mortals for Fun  Profit” was the title of the chapter. Susie sat down, flipped to the front of the book and began to read.  All through the night and well into the next afternoon exclamations such as, “You’re kidding me! That’s all I had to do?! Oh my me!” could be heard emanating from her foyer.  AT WENDEL’S: Wendell walked back inside seething from having that shrew scowl at him. He wound up and booted the first thing he saw in his foyer and his TORAP moved a good three inches and flopped open. (Like I said, gods only do big books.) After unleashing a torrent of scorn upon the offending tome he wound up and booted it again, and again, and again until it ended up in the closet. He then limped up the stairs and cracked open a bottle of Zima to help settle his nerves. After two more bottles Wendell’s anger was mostly forgotten, he flipped on the TV and spent the evening watching a “Monster Garage” marathon.  GAME NIGHT: It was a dark and stormy night. Lightening flashed, thunder thundered, wind howled, rain slashed down pelting everything and everyone foolish enough to expose themselves to the tempestuous onslaught.  On the southern edge of the Ultimate field the seven men and six women of Swarm gathered together like muskox in a blizzard hoping to somehow ward off the rain and maintain body heat before the game began. Across the muddy morass the players of Wham-O appeared to be lounging in an inexplicable shaft of brilliant warmth  sunshine as they gathered to sing “O Canada” on this balmy July 1st evening.  The game began and Wham-O jumped out to an early lead. Discs that appeared poorly thrown would somehow find their way directly into the hands of it’s intended Wham-O target, often bouncing off a Swarm’s skull or left buttock en route. Large puddles would open up and swamp a Swarm player but then mysteriously dry up and disappear entirely when a Wham-O player ran by.  Even impartial observers would have had to admit that something was fishy. Unfortunately there were no impartial observers watching anywhere.  AT STAN  NANCY’S: Stan was screaming “B_llshit! This is total BS!” but we’ve already established that Stan was far from impartial.  Nancy was giggling with glee as her team unleashed a Costco sized can of whoopass on the nasty Swarm. “Oh precious, yes, beat the nasty Swarm, yes, we hates them, we kills them, yes!”  AT WENDELL’S: Wendell sat on his couch, completely dumbfounded. He could see what was going on but was completely impotent to counteract it. He tried holding his breath, flailing his arms and thinking really hard but that didn’t do any good. He tried throwing things and cursing, which did make him feel a little better, but it didn’t effect what was happening on the field. He then decided to go next door and snap the shrew in half.  He ran out his door and attempted to jump over the white picket fence but at the apex of his jump he ran headfirst into some disconcertingly dense air. In fact the air didn’t possess the most important properties of air – like being breathable and permeable. Upon further examination Wendell discovered that his entire home appeared to be surrounded by this oddly un-airy air. Wendell did what anyone would do in his situation and tried repeatedly to smash through the invisible barrier with his face but after he regained consciousness the second time he gave up and trudged back inside to watch the conclusion of the game and start packing up his stuff.  AT SUSIE’S: “Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow. Don’t stop, it’ll soon be here. It’ll be here, better than before. Yesterday’s gone, yesterday’s gone.” Susie danced around her living room in a somewhat embarrassing manner, lip-syncing along to the words. Fireworks appeared over her head and she leaped onto the back of her unicorn and flew around her suddenly colossal living room. (Isn’t it amazing what a goddess can do when she finally sits down and reads the manual?!)  AT ANGUS’: Angus rolled off the bed and headed for the kitchen. He grabbed two glasses of water and then headed back into the bedroom. “Here you go lass, now since we’ve got a few minutes before my wee caber’s ready for another go, I’ll tell you the story of how…” In the back of his mind he had a vague recollection that something important was going on tonight but that thought quickly slipped away as he recounted one of his favorite Caber Toss stories to a disinterested but attentive goddess.  AFTER THE GAME: The disconsolate Swarm sat in the mud and tried to understand what had happened. Even with their best effort they had had their butts handed to them…again. To add insult to defeat, about two minutes after the game ended the mud dried up, the clouds parted and the temperature rose fifteen degrees. The team couldn’t help feeling frustrated that even though they were obviously all absolutely faultless in all of their losses, the universe was continuing to conspire against them. The team considered ways to overcome these hexes, spells and malicious deities but all their only ideas were: everyone abstaining from sex or everyone engaging in a Matrix’esque orgy. Both solutions seemed worse than the problem they were attempting to fix so it was agreed that nothing would be done and no one would speak of it again.  After that the Swarm went out and succeeded in losing their next game as well. No scapegoat was readily available for this loss.  CONCLUSION: Wendell spent the next few months repairing log-sized holes in the walls of his new house.  Angus continued to be Angus but he gradually gained a reputation as a really dumb guy who was very popular with the ladies.  Susie was integral to Angus’ “transformation”.  Swarm went on to win some, and lose some, but through it all their Spirit rating remained reassuringly low.  Everyone continued to enjoy pie.
