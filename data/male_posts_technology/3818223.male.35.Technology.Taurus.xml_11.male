I've been cruising the google blogs for a few weeks now, and most of the ones I've found from people near my age consist of grocery and to-do lists, complaints about their miserable jobs, and lamentations of lost love (there's my daily alliteration). Not that I'm trying to trivialize anyone's pain, but I have all the "I need bread, my job sucks, and nobody loves me" I need. Where's the passion, people? The dreams? The psychotic ramblings? You're telling me I can't find nut-jobs on the  Internet ? What has this world come to? I remember when I was your age and everything cost a nickel and I had to walk to and from school, uphill, both ways, through three feet of snow under the blazing July sun...  Ah, who am I to resist. My to-do list:   Buy bread.  Find true love, or a cheap tart, or something in-between.  Write at least 500 words tonight.  Halle Berry.   Thoreau once asserted that most people lost more than they gained as they aged. Let's not let the smug bastard be right.
