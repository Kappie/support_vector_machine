(parang gago noh?) i always tell to myself "tangina pare kaya mo yan" but then again (boinnggg) ... i can't. i'm born torpe eh'.  weh'...  that girl used to be my crush for almost a week now, she's from HRD, a newly hired newly grad yata'. everytime we cross path and she looks at me, i lower my head (as if i was melting like ice) arrgghhh.. i hate it. my co-dept already knew about this. last week her mouse ain't working and my colleague was teasing me to change it. i almost told them: "pano ko papalitan yung mouse? ano gagawin ko hoy?" wahihihihi... my co-dept's answer makes me laugh everytime i'm being reminded of that funny remark she said: "Dyos ko naman, ikabit mo lang yung mouse tapos sabihin mo don, don sa batang maputi nayon' "alam mo hindi kapa pinapanganak mahal na kita.."" (batang maputi amp.) lol. well i don't have plans of courting, i'm just trying to be friendly.  daw...  i woke up this morning with a message in my phone from an old friend i used to love: "Te hice sentir especial. Gracias" it's in spanish right? umm... the only words i can understand was especial and gracias. can somebody please translate to me these words... please. or maybe i should try using  urlLink babelfish .  i've got the perfect solution for those people who wishes to stop masturbation. try my mantra... say this every morning, everytime you're taking a bath or at bed before sleeping (well everytime you're horny). say these words repeatedly, slowly: "to masturbate is to worship the devil..." "to masturbate is to worship the devil..." you shoud be losing your urge for quite awhile, feeling you're between the battle of good or evil. now put your wrists behind your head then repeat those words again: "to masturbate is to worship the devil..." repeat it until you completely lost the urge.  well it worked for me. i bet it'll work for you too. ;)  next week i'll tackle a "celebrity deathmatch" between two religions. cheers for now.
