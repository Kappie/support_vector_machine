Rather sad really but I am dead chuffed.  I have decide to get my 200th in Oxford, as it was the same place I got my 100th(Chester's Oxford Park #7) and I also have been itching to go back and finish the Chester's Oxford Park Series and University Challenge.   My plan of attack is to attack the ones on the outskirts by car, and then find parking in the center of Oxford, and knock off the rest in the series on foot. This shouldn't be a problem as last weekend I managed just over 24miles(about 36km??) on foot in London, and not to mention that I climbed both St Paul's and Monument a combined total of nearly 800 steps, so i think I am rather fit at the moment.  I am also hoping that tomorrow, I will break my record of "Most in a Day Record" of 18, which I set last Weekend.  Jemma(my fiance) is going to probably kill me this evening for the 4th day in a row iIhave forgotten to ask if two people at work are coming to our Wedding. My memory at the moment is of goldfish proportions. I think it is stress.  Oh... totally forget jem's going out tonight so I should be able to do a few caches today, am thinking of doing some around the Newbury area.   Work is rather stressful at the moment, I have so much work to do but I don't seem to have enough motivation to do it, it is not to say I am not doing anything, I am just not doing it as fast as I could.
