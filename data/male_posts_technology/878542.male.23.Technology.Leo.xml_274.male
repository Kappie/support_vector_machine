Mono is an attempt to build a free implementation of the .NET Development Framework.   I repeat, Holy fucking shit. If they succeed in this, they could have completely invalidated everything Microsoft is trying to do here. A free open source implementation would lay all their advantages to use by anyone who can spare the programmers to adapt it for whatever platform they please.   You could run anything you have the code for on.. say, OSX, or even Solaris. Or Win98. Why hasn't this project been nuked from orbit yet? Have they already faced the legal challenge?  This is something real, and something dangerous. This is bigger than linux getting a better windows manager, bigger than OSX going up a few points in mindshare. bigger than iPods, bigger than anything I can think of.   Why is this website still up?
