I guess you all must be using mostly  Internet Explorer  for your browsing. But there are alternatives to IE. I am not against Microsoft products. But after using  urlLink Mozilla , I have become a fan of that browser. I wouldn't say that Mozilla is the best browser, but it has a few features that I really have come to like like tabbed browsing. Though  Netscape  is built using the Mozilla base, I feel that Netscape is resource hungry.    Mozilla has some really wonderful tools to help in blogging. A few of my earlier posts were made through those tools. The irony is that I am composing this blog using IE, not Mozilla.    In case you need any more information on Mozilla or any other browser, try   urlLink googling!     BTW, R.Sinduja's birthday is tomorrow. Right?   Jax.
