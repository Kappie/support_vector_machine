I've been thinking about relationships recently. It seems like I'm fairly good at destroying them, even when I think that it's where I want to be. (see pushing away) Along with relationships comes the idea of how people meet. In college I fell in love with 1 girl because she shared her poetry with me, when she would show it to no one else. I totally fucked up that relationship :P What about the blogs? Are they a good way to meet people? You deal with peoples inner most thoughts on here, maybe something they never tell anyone in RL. They could be completely socially dipolar, but you may never know. They could be the best thing since sliced bread. Trust is a funny thing.  Am I being cynical? I don't know. I should go back to bed... Peace- T
