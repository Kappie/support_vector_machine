I think I should go find some topics to write about. A random topic a week should be nice. I will find them over the weekend. Monday will start the new format.  I have been out for the past couple days. 1:00 am now and I just got home. Not tired though.   I have been e-mailing an old "girlfriend" of mine. I use the "" because we were never really serious. Just physical as they say. Anyway she IM'ed me a while back and we have been chatting. She always seems to be interested in my sex life this one. I am not sure why. This girl was not at all my type though. In fact I had some friends over to her house one time and everyone, yes including me, were talking shit about her. You should have seen her music collection. All crap. She had ABBA and Winger. You should have seen the faces we were giving each other.   We were seeing each other like 7 years ago and then I broke up with her when I met my baby's mama. We also started hanging out about 4 years ago. She had a shaved head when I first met her which was cool but she worked on her own car. That was what I remember liking the most. I know another girl that can do that. Why is that so hot? So when we were seeing each other 4 years ago she ended up leaving that time. It wasn't even anything like seeing each other really I guess. She would just come over once and a while. That was back in my parting days though. Every time she came over I was drunk. I don't think she liked that very much. I don't think I would either. Actually I know I wouldn't. I remember the last time she was over. I was in my bad passing out and I couldn't stay away for the life of me. She was sitting over me looking at me like I was degenerate. It wasn't more then a couple weeks after that when she met her current boyfriend. They actually met at a club right by my house. At the time she and I lived about 30 minutes apart. So now she is doing well and I am happy for her. She is graduating with a BA soon actually. Funny enough she is in graphics now and using a computer all the time. I remember when she got her first one and having to get her connected to the internet over the phone. She had plugged the RJ-11 plus into the wrong jacks in the modem. Anyway this is getting boring now.  Maybe I should make relationships my first topic. Seems I have a lot to say about it.   I am not tired at all and am hungry. I think I will go grab something to eat and look for a DUI check point to go through. They give you free pens and shit sometimes. What a Friday night huh. Haha.  - Matt
