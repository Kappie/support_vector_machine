On Monday, I spent the day shadowing Andy Clapp, a venture capitalist at  urlLink Brook Venture . I didn't really know what to expect going into the day, but it turned out to be really interesting. I imagined all VCs to have the outrageously swank lifestyles and offices, and ruling their funded companies like lords rules their middle age serfs. It turned out to be quite the opposite. In spending the day with Andy and his partners, I found them the be extremely smart and nice businessmen, who worked very hard to support the companies they have funded. They act as advisors for groups that need their support and help, and probably wouldn't be as successful if they didn't have access to the VCs experience. In the end, I can't imagine many more interesting jobs that what a VC does -- you are involved with multiple companies, often at the leading edge of technology, helping to make them a successful reality.
