I want to go see Oklamhoma, mainly because Mr Merriman comes form there but hey, who says thats tha only the reason? Me. Oh yea.  Jo, in your emails siggies you have the url for this blog, you need to take off the www so it is just http://el-bloggo.blogspot.com then it will work properly. Right now I'm doing textiles homework. How incredibly fun. I still have art work to do but it is slightly more enjoyable than usual as I am sticking pictures of Mr Merriman down! Wahoo! Oooooooooo! Jaffa cakes! Did you know they don't sell jaffa cakes in America!!!! Outrageous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
