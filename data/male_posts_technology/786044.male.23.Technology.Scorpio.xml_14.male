With the acquisition of Kerry Kittles for a second round draft pick, they basically just traded Quentin Richardson and the pick for KK. I mean, that's great if you're a Villanova fan living in LA... but seriously, can all NBA teams be  that  cost-conscious that they let good players leave when they are on the edge of stardom?    I guess they must, 'cause... look where this trade leaves the Nets... They're basically putting the whole team on Richard Jefferson's shoulders.  I guess they're rebuilding while Kidd rests his knee... They've got 4 picks coming soon, so that must be the plan, right?     Fantasy Impact       If it weren't for everyone saying how they want to rest Kidd's knee, he would be a great pick. The Nets have one other player on their roster beyond Kidd that I would even consider drafting.  RJ looks like a great pick.  How could he not improve on 14.5, 5.3, and 2.7 with draft picks taking the place of K-Mart and Kerry Kittles???     Kittle maintains his value with this trade. He was about the 3rd or 4th option on the Nets and will be the starting SG for the Clips. I can see Elton Brand and Corey Maggette absorbing a lot of shots and points with the departure of Q-Rich. His rebounds may actually improve, and depending on how well Shaun Livingston distributes the ball, his assists may improve as well. He and Livingston will be feeding Brand and Maggette a lot.      RJ is the Money Ball. Count it.
