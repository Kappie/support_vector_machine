But this title defers far from that.  Men never plans to fail but fail to plan most of the time.And well for me..I have fail to plan. Now more and more I have to buy that PDA to help me organize my work, plans and the time for everything. SO much things to do and yet I did the most idiotic things that a guy could do ... Let me give u background details about it ..In the midst of work, i received the last minute preparation of that day's WORD sharing. Ps Lindy have some emergencies to attend to which explain the lateness of the sharing. But also because we (SIMPLY UNITED) , among the college zone cells , have started a week in advance in the Purpose Driven Life Study.  But then we had a good time in cell....me ...facilitating the whole cell...No probs..in that...God was there witnesssing and teaching us What am I on Earth for ? Part II      FOUNDATION OF PURPOSE DRIVEN LIVING 1.	Life On Earth Is A Test •	Character is both developed and revealed by tests, and all of life is a test. •	When you understand that life is a test, you realize that nothing is insignificant in your life. Some test seem overwhelming, while others you don’t’ even notice.  But all of them have eternal implications. •	1 Cor 10:13, Jam 1:12 2.	Life On Earth Is A Trust •	We never really own anything during our brief stay on earth. •	How you manage your money (worldly wealth) determines how much God can trust you with spiritual blessings (true riches). •	Ps 24:1, 1 Cor 4:2, Luke 12:48b 3.	Life On Earth Is A Temporary Assignment •	Compared to eternity, life is extremely brief. •	Earth is only a temporary residence. •	You will never feel completely satisfied on earth, because you were made for more. •	Ps 119:19, 2 Cor 4:18  So Saturday Chaos starts with me missing the Early Dawn Prayer meeting that I have strongly urged my cell to go ...but me not going...because of what happen yesterday with me so tired from work the day before and to the addition of leading the cell. But praise God, I managed to make it for the Timothy Leadership Training.    urlLink    PDA of my Dreams. urlLink      Then later I went to Low Yat plaza to go PDA hunting that fits my budget. The Elusive Sony PEG TJ37 complete with Wifi and Palm OS. Sony have recently stop production of the SOny PDAs and now they are like Gold. Especially the TH55 ...the last product of SOny in the PDA market...which even if i have to makan bread for the next month, It was futile cause it is out of stock.  So Of course the Clie PEG TJ37 still have what i needed to organize my work and be more professional.  Okay enough about PDA and technology.  Managed to come back in time to bath and to prepare for Saturday Service preceeding before the NaNYang Night Run in Bukit Kiara.Church was half filled on that day with people wearing T-Shirts representing different camps of differing age and Districts.  Went for the walk rite after service ...a mad rush to Taman Tun ..and then managed to find Pure Joy ppl to walk with... Simply United have Siew Ching , Daphne , Wai Nyan , Jamie and Daniel Lim walking as a cell.  One word for the experience of the RUN ...is SYIOK Betul. Pure Joy ppl consisted of Javen, Darren, Melissa Wong, Chia Huey, Reena , Ken ...and of course we did the most unique thing in the entire run. We stopped before the entrance of the school when everyone else went out in a rampage..hmm..reminds me of the Spanish festival where the bull was released to chase after the ppl in town,  Pure JOy stopped near the 100plus stand to stock up drinks and walk slowly.  The walk with Pure Joy was fun, cause we share almost everything under the moon, while walking , sharing jokes..and even get to know everyone else from church.  Had a good time myself...and Melinda...Mel Wong' sis is so funny ...she walked and ran before us participating in the rampage mentioned before and when we completed the last leg of the run, she was walking like a crab...side to side in exhaustion. Mel Wong was even more funnier...her dad went like a rocket...and really in the fitness business..one have to be strong. Mel pulak is super exhausted when she completed the last leg of the "run", we actually walk.   We came back and went to makan in TTDI. And then exhausted went back home to prepare ourselves for next day...  The next day 's..I leave it as part II...to be continued.
