Thrilled to have my stinky old Luke back...he's all guatamala-ed out.  holla at the capital in selling $.10 bracelets to hippies for $3.  he's a business man. So today was a little funny.  Wake up at Fresh's feeling like shit at 1.  Scrape myself together and go over to the foodstore with my sister La to get dinner. First, we see feasterfeasterfeaster checking out so we run away haha.  There we are in with the frozen foods watching these two black bitches get in a fight over a shopping cart.  Holla at the one bitch walking away and walking back to shake the cart "I SAAAAID EXCUSSSE ME!" she had a point to prove.  We stole some creamy buttery avocados. ha.  on the way home a braceface cop pulled us over. and we had open box wine in the backseat.  "Now I need you to tell me the truth Lauren...did you break a law because there are groceries in the back seat that you need to get into a fridge, or is you friend really sick?" hahahahhahaha Oh the dog days of Autumn, you are so awesome.  Anybody seen Yast?
