"i was just following orders" comes to mind.  aside from the fact that saddam hussein was evil and inhumane to his people (and if that's our only rationale how many other countries can we thus "liberate"), i see no redeeming quality whatsoever in invading iraq.  there's that whole "region-stablizing" theory that we can't know for sure about for several years, but that seems at best flimsy to me.  maybe there's something i'm missing in all this; i honestly and truly hope so.  if anyone can offer some semblance of a sensible reason why any of this is going on please let me know, because i'm getting exponentially disheartened in our country as the days go by.   this is why we shouldn't vote for kerry:  he threw away two medals he was awarded for his vietnam service 30 years ago and owns an suv.  i know these aren't the only arguments, but it's funny how they're the ones you hear being shouted most loudly from the peanut gallery.  sorry about the political tirade, i needed it.    album du jour:   urlLink   french kicks       the trial of the century
