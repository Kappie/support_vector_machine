Are people's lives so utterly dull that they have to buy into this shit. I don't understand it. Our concept of news is totally fucked. It's like... "Welcome to News at Ten. Posh and Becks, ... *blah blah* text message *blah blah* sex.. *blah blah* and in other news, a million people died in a war somewhere. But back to Becks and his text messages.. ARGH!  2.  Never, ever, ever do the "Smile!" thing. This has bugged me for ages. I was walking down the road a few weeks back, minding my own business. Some sour-faced old craggy woman was walking past me and said, really sarcastically, "Ohhh... don't YOU look happy?". What the fuck! I was in a perfectly good mood till she opened her trap, besides, what the fuck has it got to do with her? That really pissed me off. Never, ever do that... "Smile!" thing to somebody. People have a right to be miserable if they want to be. You know nothing about that person, their entire family could have just died in some hideous car wreck, and you're telling them to SMILE.   3. If you're dumb enough to double-click every piece of crap that arrives in your inbox, you're going to get a computer virus.  Try exercising some self-restraint and using a decent  urlLink e-mail client .  Thank you for letting me vent my spleen. I feel much better.
