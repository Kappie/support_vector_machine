 This is so idiotic.  Regardless of whether or not the White House used the threat warning for their own political reasons, they really screwed the pooch on this one.  I don't understand this stupid threat level scale.  It seems to me that its only purpose is to scare Americans into believing that Bush and Co. can protect us.  The fact of the matter is, I don't really need to know what specific buildings are threatened because I can't do anything more than cower in a corner somewhere hoping that the intelligence is accurate this time.  
 
 What they  should  have in place is a simple communication hierarchy for the powers that do have the authority and the means to affect local security.  When they discovered that the financial buildings in New York, Washington DC, and Newark were under threat, those towns and the owners of those buildings should have been warned directly.  There was no need to raise the threat level publicly.  Because then you need to justify it because it looks like you're trying to give the sitting President a bump in the polls.  Which leads to exposing a sting operative, which kills your chances for completely unraveling a major al Qaeda cell that is actively plotting to commit mass murder in the US.  What idiocy!
