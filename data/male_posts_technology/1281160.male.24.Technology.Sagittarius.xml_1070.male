I put that 'generally' in bracket because these days women also tend to keep their hair short.. at times as short as men, if not shorter... and while there are men too who like to keep their's as long as women, if not longer...   But having said that, its been a norm down the generations that as we utter the word "girl", "woman" and any of its sibling synonyms we visualize a homo sapien with a longer hair... When would this ever have begun..??  Stone-Age humans would never have thought of cutting their hair... in fact, they started dressing with leaves and twigs only after quite a while as their 6th sense of civilization began gradually to take root... But this case happened for both men and women of stone-age.. but how did the "cutting the hair short" thing held on only with the male species...  I do have my explanation for this.. but would like to hear from u too...
