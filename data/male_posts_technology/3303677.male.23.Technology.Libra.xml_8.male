I then went to New Orleans with my closest friends and got smashed (not horribly this time). It was one of the best weekends I have had in a long time and I can only see more on the horizon like this. Wow I am in a great mood today. It could be better but I am a chicken shit. Chuck knows what I mean.   Well After a great weekend I have a rainy Monday. It is not a bad Monday, but it is rainy. I wish my job didn't make me go outside. Well I have to go get wet again.
