Nice small party for the girlies.   urlLink This  was a big hit for Christmas, along with lots of Barbie stuff...  Had a potluck for our neighbors last night, very very fun.  Lots of diversity here.  In 8 families, two are Indian, three are Caucasian (one of them is a mixed-race Caucasian and Panamanian), one African American, one Korean, and then us.... Ha.  Chinese, yes, definitely.  A great part was having this whole mix of different kinds of food.  Will be neat to see as the years go by what impact we make on them.
