What I want to know is, if the WMD thing craps out, but it's ultimately ok because he was a cruel man and now the terrorists have one less country from which to operate, can we move on and invade and occupy other countries with cruel leaders and ample land for terrorist hideaways?  Or is oil the only remaining prerequisite for us to provide this service?  Wouldn't it be funny if, upon invading Iraq, we had found no WMD, *and* the country had now run out of oil.  If the *only* reason left was the liberation(?) of the Iraqi people.  I wonder what the pro-war side would say then.  If they would gladly invade other countries, to gain *only* the liberation(?) of the populace.  Personally, I certainly hope WMD are found.  I'm ashamed enough of this administration's arrogant, bullying, cowboy, cartoon behavior -- what a fiasco if it wasn't even warranted.  Well, except for the part about the liberation(?) of the people, and the hidden terrorists in the hills.  Oh, wait -- and the oil.  Yeah.  I keep forgetting about that.  It's so minor...just slips right out of my mind...silly me...
