I'm in the throes now of trying to figure out what to buy.  I play toy soldier game and I want to get a new army, but I'm not sure what to buy or what size to get it in.  I know, tough choice right?  It's not like I'm worrying about anything real....like what I have to pay my ex-wife, or how my kid's going to grow up or where my next meal is coming from or anything.  Just what size of toys I want.  Why does writing this thing always make me melancholy?  Am I just so used to *drama* in these things that it doesn't feel right unless there is some?  Or is it that I only journal when I feel this way? Hmmmmmm.....
