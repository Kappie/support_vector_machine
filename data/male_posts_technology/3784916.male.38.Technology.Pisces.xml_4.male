I was concerned that there was not going to be much english to read on the signs and I was somewhat surprised. Most airport, street and informational signs flashed both Kanji and English.  The bus trip to Yokohama was also fairly easy; however, the time difference was hitting me pretty hard. I thought I was going to drool on the Japanese gentleman next to me. I met Susan and another employee of mine today...Linda. Linda is going to be very important for the resilience team.  The registration for the conference and the cocktail reception is at 7pm this evening. I'm sitting in my hotel room switching television stations between a Queen retrospective and CNNj. During the flight I watched Hidalgo (not a bad movie) and Jersey Girl (Ben Affleck has some serious career rejuvination to do).  Anyway...that's it for today. I'll check in later.
