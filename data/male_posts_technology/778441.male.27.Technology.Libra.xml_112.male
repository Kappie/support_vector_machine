Here's what it was all about...  Ever wondered how much "nature" your lifestyle requires? You're about to find out. This Ecological Footprint Quiz estimates how much productive land and water you need to support what you use and what you discard. After answering 15 easy questions you'll be able to compare your Ecological Footprint to what other people use and to what is available on this planet.  And the result was quite interesting. It seems my Ecological Footprint is   1.6 Global Hectares  !! Now they have calculated that currently, worldwide, there exists  1.8  biologically productive Global Hectares per person. So, going by that account, I am within the world average and so I pose very little threat to the world's ecosystem!  But, the average figures for India indicate that Indians, on an average, posses an ecological footprint of   0.8 Global Hectares  per person. So, going by that number, I'm a glutton as far as my consumption of ecological resources, in the National context, are concerned!! ...  Bad Boy !!!  So, go ahead, measure your footprint and be ecologically aware!!  Being Green is cool!
