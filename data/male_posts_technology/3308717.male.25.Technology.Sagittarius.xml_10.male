I don't know about you but this is some earth-shattering news that has been laid upon me. Appearantly it is also news for  urlLink this couple . I'm glad I found out now instead of when I decided to start a family. I mean, I can barely imagine the anger these people must feel having tried fo so long and in so many different positions: Sitting on wooden chairs, standing on stepping stools, riding a marry-go-round. All of these seem like wonderfull ways to conceive a child, but I guess it just doesn't work that way.  Oh well, live and learn I guess.   -intX    what would YOU do for a klondike bar?
