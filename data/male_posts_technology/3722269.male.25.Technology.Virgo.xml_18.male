The underlying message/theme/symbolism I get out of the book is one of 'balance' something I've long believed myself. And something I've rambled here about before too.. A positive for every negative, and a negative for every positive. Males are not complete by themselves, and females are also, not complete by themselves. It is through our differences with the opposite sex, and through others, that our greatest strengths come. Through gaining the key attributes of both parents, our offspring stand to have the potential to be greater as an indivdual than either parent by themselves was. This process continues, and our species gets stronger, faster, smarter and better looking. It's a pretty cool system.. shame I had to be around when there will still so many goddamn stupid ugly skanky smelly horrible.. sorry I'm getting off track :D balance. I love that someone is stupid, because it is through their stupidity, that my intelligence has value. I thank the powers that be that I'm not -too- hideously deformed.. the balance being, that some poor fuck actually is. Sorry cuz, but it was either you or me, and the better man won. I thank the powers that be, that I'm sitting inside, relatively warm, infront of a computer, with no real 'needs' that arent being met.. the balance of course being that someone else -isnt-. The upside? This poor bastard, the 'balance' to my own existence, actually, its probably a chick.. to keep the 'opposites' going.. on that note probably a black chick. Probably well underweight, to a dangerous degree, thick as pigshit, ugly as a motherfucker, homeless, and really not smooth at all. She probably has never seen a computer.. probably lives in Suddam. I feel sorry for her.. but there is one thing that lets me sleep at night.. in my double bed, all to myself, with all I could ever hope to eat and drink, and more.. while she starves and farts cobwebs.. and that is.. ..that to keep the balance right, she's too stupid to realise how teh_sux she is. Bravo.  It's a good book, read it. Aight? Ciao.
