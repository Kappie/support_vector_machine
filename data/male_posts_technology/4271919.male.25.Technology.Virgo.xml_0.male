What happens when you semi-randomly drop a resume on companies? You get call-backs by people about jobs you swear you never applied for in the first place. This happened to me last week. I get a call from a person wanting to schedule a phone interview for a position of assistant trader. I agreed, since I was vaguely looking for jobs in the financial field, but do not remember having applied for any sort of assistant trader position. In any case, the guy calls me back on Friday, at the agreed phone interview time, and says that he wants to ask me some basic math questions, like addition and subtraction. Fine. He also kindly asks if I could not use a calculator or pen and paper as he wants to test how well and quickly I can do calculations in my head. Fuck me. I answer his first 4 questions promptly and without error. Good, I'm a little more relaxed now. The fifth question is "what is 133 minus 261?". I err and answer "-118" (the correct answer is -128, in my mind not a terrible mistake). At that point, the guy makes a deep sigh and says: "I'm sorry. If we continue, this will be sheer torture for you. I'm sorry to have wasted your time." Click. Since when did being an ASSISTANT trader involve having ridiculous, infallible mental math skills?
