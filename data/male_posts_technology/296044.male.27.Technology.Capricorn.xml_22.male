This project manager walks in here and starts spewing about what he thinks about the latest news on the sniper.  I don't care.  But apparently he thinks the three guys currently sitting here are thrilled to here his mindless banter.  Yeah, yeah, I'm doing the same thing right now.  But I didn't force it on you.  You clicked the link.  I get eough about the damn sniper everyday at lunch while CNN looms on the big screen tv in our cafe.  This guy is like a walking CNN.  So Jackass the Movie is coming out.  I find myself strangely wanting to see it.  Dear God, what's wrong with me?  It looks funny though.  Dangerously funny.  Why do we get a kick out of seeing other people do what we would never dream of?  That basic human need to know the truth?  What really happens when you throw a bowling ball at your crotch?  So what's the in thing for Halloween this year?  Last year it was cops and firemen.  This year?  Be your greatest fear.  Fear is in.  Fear is cool.  Later.
