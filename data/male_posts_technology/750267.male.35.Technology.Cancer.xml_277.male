Expenses   At one time in my life, I didn’t have to think too much about my expenses. Back before 2001, I was living without worrying about money. That allowed me to travel all over the world, go out to dinner several nights a week, and even purchase a nice condominium on the Toronto waterfront.  My biggest problem, at this point, is the high cost of credit payments. I pay as much in credit payments as I do for my mortgage. It’s insane – I could afford two houses!   Savings and Assets   Ah, and now we’re cutting to the chase, aren’t we? Despite my problems with debt, I have done alright with savings and assets. I could be well ahead, but I also could be penniless. Anything is better than nothing.  During the late 90’s, I did fairly well at putting aside money in my retirement account. In 1999, I used most of that money as a down payment on my condo. Lucky for me, I missed the drastic drops in stocks over the past few years – I sold at the peak.  My condo has done well. I estimate its value has increased by 30% since I moved in. Add my original 15% down payment to that, and I have a significant amount of equity waiting to be tapped. (Last year we refinanced our mortgage to lock in a low rate, and take a few bucks out to pay debt. The debt paid off at that time remains paid off.)  I also have some money tucked away in cash (for emergencies), and have been putting some into my retirement accounts. Again, my bad experiences with unemployment make me want to keep lots and lots of cash on hand just in case.  In my next entry, I will discuss my problems with debt. Then we can wrap the story up with a discussion of net worth.
