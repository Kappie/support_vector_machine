Marilyn Manson takes his inspirations from the glamour of 1930s Hollywood, the grotesque of Vaudeville to the extreme height of cabaret decadence and so-called "degenerate" art in Weimar Berlin just before its destruction. Manson says, "This album is about expression. The imagination and personality of the individual cannot be trapped by small minds or defined by any one person. The genius of art finds sanctuary among children and madmen to survive. That, is who we are."  Marilyn Manson has collaborated with renown artist Gottfried Helnwein for the album's controversial artwork which is part of a greater series that will be exhibited in museums all across the world.
