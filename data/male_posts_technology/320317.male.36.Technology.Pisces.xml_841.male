Whenever a designer (be it an interaction designer, an information designer, or a visual designer) presents a client with too many options they risk undermining their value and opening themselves up to “design by committee”. The message is “I don’t know enough about your users or goals so you pick what works best.” Now the design is in a non-designer’s hands ....  every interface designer should focus on building a reputation as a problem solver and communicating that through the language of design and business. The design medium will change, the need to solve problems will not. " 

 I couldn't agree more.
