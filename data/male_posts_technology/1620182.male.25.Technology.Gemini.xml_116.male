 The little woman and I started looking at houses immediately following my boss' approval of the move to VA.  Now, I have very little experience with this.  Actually, scratch that.  I have  no  experience with buying a house.  My experience is on the order of overhearing guys talk about it in the locker room here at work (no, I don't work for a football team).  Fortunately, I have my parents to fall back on, considering they have bought and sold many a house in their day.  My Dad was in the  urlLink Air Force , afterall.  Even their abundance of experience could not prepare them for this market.
 
 Houses stay on the market in Northern VA for about three days.  THREE DAYS!  This isn't the kind of market where you can sit and think about what you want.  You also can't make any mistakes as we found out the hard way.  Ah well, that house wasn't meant to be, so we will just find something better and cheaper and save money in the meantime.  Jerks.
