Now if you were to ask any person who has met me briefly, or even some friends that I don't see often, then you would be told that I am a fairly nice sort of guy who is peaceful and easy going........but.......ask one of the Toaster Files crew then they will tell you different hehe!!!  That right, underneath the quiet and peaceful shell that is 'John' lies an evil and dark soul! So when I sat down to watch the 'Happy Tree People' I was a bit taken aback when the introduction clip appeared to be that of a kiddies cartoon!! (I was displeased to say the least). However, showing a great deal of self control I continued to watch the video......  The main introduction clip before any episode starts with one of the cartoons characters watching a huge TV and humming to her cute little self.....suddenly a loud crashing noise becomes apparent and suddenly......the TV crashes screen first onto our helpless and cute little character, squashing her flat and sending brain matter and gore everywhere! "This is going to be excellent, I think to myself".  And sure enough, I watched every episode on the the website in the space of half an hour hehehehehe! Lots of gore, lots of laughs. After I was finished, I went to check out their websites store and was happily surprised to find some T-shirts which I promptly bought.  Anyway, times up, got to go, post soon.  Baity signing off.....
