Finally started on doing a proposal and plan to track my pace of getting things done. Else I will be lazing off somewhere and dunno when to start to get more income to fund my projects. Realistic and more realistic and of course feasible plan for me to start off.  I always have very nice start but who can teach me to carry on?
