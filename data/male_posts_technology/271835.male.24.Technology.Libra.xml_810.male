So, until it works, we can ponder over the rumour that Bruce has turned down the  urlLink 2.75 million bid  in favour of staying with Birmingham.  Whilst we're on about fitba can someone explain how England are automatically through to the next stage providing we draw against Croatia tonight? What if France lose to Switzerland? Wouldn't that leave us with three teams on four points? Assuming that scenario is resolved by counting goals scored then how can we be certain that we will have scored more goals than France or Switzerland?
