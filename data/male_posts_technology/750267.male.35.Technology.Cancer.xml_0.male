Why haven't I ever seen this show, other than the "top story" on Entertainment Tonight?  * I can't wait for Amazing Race 3. Amazing Race is an extremely entertaining and well produced show. I'd love to do it myself (and I would never do Survivor, and you would have to heavily medicate me to get me to be on Big Brother). Anyways, can't wait for it to be on.  * I wouldn't be surprised if that was it for The Mole. I enjoyed Mole 1 immensely, and Mole 2 was interrupted by a long delay - more than a year between when it was taped and when it was aired, which deflated some of the excitement. It was still an OK show, and Anderson Cooper has moved on to CNN or something as a real news man. He probably is hoping Mole 3 never gets made. Me too, kind of.  * Cannot wait for football season to start.(I love Will Ferrel's Hank Williams Jr. impression... They should replace the real Hank Williams Jr with Ferrel for at least one of the Monday Night Football games!)
