As you are no doubt aware (arf.. arf..)  my birthday is rapidly approaching. I have thought long and hard for a few minutes about what I want to do to mark this slightly scary occasion, (24.. OMFG!!) and I think a meal at Hotrocks (get to cook your own food and play with fire) followed by beers and breakdancing in town would be ideal. I'm trying to arrange this for Friday the 14th, so if you're down with it email me (or use the shout out thing below) so I can get an idea of numbers...  If you're into astrology or spiritual stuff you may be interested in  urlLink the alignment of the planets this Sunday..  If you're are kind and generous, you may want to buy me something from my  urlLink ThinkGeek Wishlist  for my birthday.. Or perhaps you'd rather be a  urlLink fish
