In closed-door report to Security Council, UN inspector Perricos also said sites in Iraq known to contain WMD production equipment and materials were cleaned out and destroyed for wholesale export of scrap metal. He urged stopping this export"  It's nowhere on Google news, nowhere on Yahoo, nowhere on AP, nowhere on Reuters... more proof basically exonerating the USA from the 'There Were No WMD's!' horseshit  still  being spewed from the left, and nobody is informed.  It just makes no sense. What the hell is the US administration doing? I can only surmise they're sitting on all the information as it comes in, in a futile hope to acquire a large enough body of evidence to compile one single, weighty report that'll hopefully have enough pages to convince the world that they were right all along. Or they realise that people are intrinsically uninterested in anything less than earth-shattering news, and that waiting to find the Smoking Gun is the only thing that'll swing world opinion. Which seems like a bad idea to me. People  also  tend to have very short memories...
