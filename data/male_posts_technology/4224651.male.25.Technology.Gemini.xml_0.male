The reason for the coal stove was that Dad never believed in electric heat because it was too expensive so he hired a service to come deliver loads of coal about 2-3 times throughout the season. It was effective enough, I suppose. Dirty, because one would have to shovel coal into the stove and afterwards, remove the ashes left by the coal that had already burned, but still effective. My father's only rule was this: "Nobody shovels coal into the stove but me. If you're cold at night, take out another blanket from the closet and put it on." Needless to say, we spent many a cold night at Chez Loubier. But none so cold as the nights spent during that winter.  My mother had placed the candlesticks she got from that tag sale on the mantel above the coal stove. Sometimes she'd take them down to burn a candle or two, but mainly they were put there for the "ambiance," as Mom liked to say. I really don't think the ambiance she got was the kind of ambiance she intended to achieve. I think it started one night in December of '84. And it scared the hell out of us.
