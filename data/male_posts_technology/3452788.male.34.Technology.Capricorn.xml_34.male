       
      Therapy day today, so I take off work early.  I came in 1 hour early to make up for the lost time, and spent it writing and catching up on the Giants.  Oh well, the best of intentions.  I don't know what I am going to discuss with the therapist; I rarely know ahead of time where I want the conversation to go.  I have come in with a specific issue a few times, but usually I just let it happen (very difficult for me).  I am SO tired.  I can hardly keep my eyes open, sitting at my desk and yawning like a fool.    I don't want to be here, I don't care about the tribe's casino design, I dont care about the other tribe's road decommissioning, I don't care about the third tribe's road building project.  Lately we have been doing a lot of engineering and environmental work for the three major Indian tribes in the area.  This area in particular has a rich native culture that is appreciated and supported by the non-Indians as well.  I would love to study their cultures rather than doing engineering for them.  OK, hi ho, off to work.  Bye for now.
