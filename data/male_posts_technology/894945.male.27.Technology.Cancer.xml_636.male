Thanks to Toaster  Jo for hosting a fun games night, alas Trivial Pursuits Genus II appears to consist mostly of American based questions referring to events that happened before my birth.  Oh well, I managed to sneak in a piece of brown pie into our counter while nobody was paying much attention.  We still came last.  Oops, is that the time, better head out.  If bored (or like the new Anchor Spreadable adverts), check out the amazing adventures of  urlLink Weebl (and sometime's Weebl's friend Bob) .  [)amo
