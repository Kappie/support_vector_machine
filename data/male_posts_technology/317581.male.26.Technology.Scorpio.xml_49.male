Weird, well, anyway, I had some free time today so I bought some movies and a couple of records. I'm soooooooooooo excited. I got some Anime and Forest Gump.  So, I've been having Anime cravings recently. Some people don't understand Anime I guess, but somehow it just makes sense to me. I LOVE Anime. Also, I think I have one of the best jobs in the world. Play video games then tell the dev's how to make it more fun:)   Well, lunch is almost over, I hope you are having a great day:)
