But maybe the U.S. wants to add to the list of countries that don't participate in OPEC. It's possible...  If enough oil production happens outside of OPEC's control, then OPEC will have no power. Member countries won't follow the production limits if other countries are not heeding those limits.   As you can see, I'm still struggling to come up with a motive that fits.
