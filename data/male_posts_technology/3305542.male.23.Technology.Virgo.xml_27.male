I like reading them, and they give you an opportunity to tell me how you really feel anonymously (if you wish to stay anonymous).  For example, you could make a comment like "After the post on Frou Frou, I must admit I'm beginning to question your sexuality. - I {Heart} Korn" and I would never know who wrote it.  Now you try it.  I'll give you some topics...  Tell me what you thought of Fahrenheit 9/11.  Tell me how much you love TMBG.  Tell me what you thought of "Things My Girlfriend And I Have Argued About".  Give me suggestions for other movies or bands I might like.  Anything.  Now go, ye, and comment.
