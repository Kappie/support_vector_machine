I shouldn't complain i guess, i'm still getting paid, but man trying to look busy for 8 hours is pretty discouraging. It was also freezing cold and raining all day not much typical June weather these days.  But on a high note, Angel got her hope chest today and all kinds of goodies that came inside it.  It was like Christmas all over again, and more stuff is finding it's way out into the apartment.  It's really looking good. Called my folks tonight, my Dad was working a shift at the Coast Guard College supposedly guarding Kuwaiti dignitaries, but they didn't show, so he too was trying to look busy for 10 hours. Maybe i'll head out and bash some golf balls tomorrow evening if it's not raining after work.  I'm out.
