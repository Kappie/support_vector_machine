I've accepted a summer research position on campus, but it doesn't start until June 14.  Until then, I've got plenty of time on my hands.  I've set a goal to get my Sun Certified Java Programmer certification by the end of the summer, so I'm using the extra free time to refresh myself on some Java programming stuff.  I'm fairly confident that I can pass, but that isn't enough for me.  I can't waste the two hundred dollars it takes to sign up for the exam.  Well, that's enough for now.  If anyone reads this, I hope you have a great summer.
