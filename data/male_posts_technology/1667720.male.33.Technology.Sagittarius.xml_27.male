Luckily, both the run and swim were done in the evening so I had some time to recover. Never the less, the 1.5 hr 1500 meter swim program was hard to do immediately after the 1 hour run. Ouch. Thank goodness it's Friday.   BTW, Martin and I are hoping to increase our swim program to 2000 meters in a week or so. Not sure if this is sane but it sounds like a fun challenge. I'm getting more comfortable in the water and my breathing is improving. I don't  forget  exhale as much.   Oh, and I almost forgot. Meet my new best friend, the pull float.
