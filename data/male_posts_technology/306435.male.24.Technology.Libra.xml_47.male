It was the infamous night of "The Horse Whisper".  Any way for some reason I can't think of right now, I know that Greg and I spent an uncomfortable ten minutes standing in the parking lot of a shopping center waiting for kristin to come back...that is not a slight on Greg, I just remember being very uncomfortable, maybe that is just the memory of "The Horse Whisper".    I have learned a lot about Greg since then from the ramblings of Kristin over the last couple of years and I know that they will live a happy and loving life together..
