This really is vacation for me since there are no relatives involved and there is nothing remotely business related to interfere with my time off. Although it seems when I take trips like these the most unexpected things seem to occur. The last such jaunt, about a year ago, ended with an interesting trip to a nudist colony (For your own safety do not create a mental image). Quite a new experience for me. Ask me about it some time if you need to laugh.
