Yay! ...so it was supposed to be a big night last night, but I think like a damp firework it kind of fizzled out and left people with a slapped-arse expression on their faces. Sometimes the vibe just isn't there, and you can't push it - even more alcohol will not light the party blue touch paper in these situations. The best thing to do is Cinderella/pumpkin it before midnight and go out the next day instead. This is exactly what I am doing today. It's Francis Rocha's birthday bash, and also the end of an era for me as I am handing in my notice at my current employer, whom I have been with for seven years.  So I’ll be out in town causing mayhem all day - if anyone fancies joining me for a banana daiquiri then give me a holler. Peace out !
