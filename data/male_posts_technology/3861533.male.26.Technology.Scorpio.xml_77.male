The main characters are fictional, but they interact with real historical figures such as Ben-Gurion, Moshe Dayan, Golda Meir, Eskhol and Yitzak Rabin to name a few.  Written in 1993, it has a lot more perspective than Leon Uris' book  urlLink Exodus  from 1958 (see  urlLink previous post ). Even though Wouk is a sionist, he has tried to be historically accurate. The book is told from the Israeli point of view and the other side is seen through their eyes at the time and with the fog of war that's always there in real life.  One thing I really liked was that after the book ended, Wouk devotes a few pages to describing what actually happened and what was fictionalised.  As stated before, this book is continued by  urlLink The Glory , which I've already started reading. -->
