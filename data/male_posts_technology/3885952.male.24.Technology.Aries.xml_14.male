It's very beautiful, i can't seem to get enough of it. It almost seems haunting in a way, just the sound of the strings. i wish i could play like that. when i go to mexico in a two weeks, I think I might look for a classical guitar to purchase. i figure i've always wanted one, so why not? There's a guy here at work, who growing up he would go to a youth place after school. I guess it was a program or some sort of place to keep kids off the street. Well either way he said there was a teacher who taught him how to play the classical guitar. He works here, but he does side jobs with some mariachis. he plays guitar, trumpet, bass, and is working on the accordion. I think that's so awesome. how someone can be so talented like that. I wish i would have made that decision when i was younger, to learn to play. well I did make that decision. When i was in 5th grade we had music glass and we would all have instruments. Moving on to middle school, I had decided that I wanted to be in band. So I signed up for it, and when the year came around, i didn't have band on my list of classes. I checked with the counselors, but they had screwed up and put me in choir. maybe they thought i would make a better singer. well anyways, i tried to get it changed, but by that time it was too late and the band class had already begun and starting figuring out what instruments were for whom. so I missed out on it. I don't know which instrument I would have played, part of me says drums, but then part of me (even back then) wanted to play the Cello. Which actually would have put me in Orchestra not band. So who know's I could have been a great Cello player, and maybe learned guitar through that. I don't know, it's to late now to worry about it. I guess I'll just have to buy my mexican guitar and hope for the best. Maybe someday I'll write and play a song. I surely have enough lyrics. Well hope all is well with everyone, take care all. Adios.
