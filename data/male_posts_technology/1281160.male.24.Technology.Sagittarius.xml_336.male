Imagine if you have some 100 archivves, the whole page will be like flooded with archives section alone.  About All in a Day's work and Archives box looks too colorful (bright yellow). The blank space after Archives box also looks a bit odd.  We can have a single background color for the whole layout instead of 2 colors for the RHS of blog. I feel the part which contains the blog title shd have some background color as well.  will continue later... bye
