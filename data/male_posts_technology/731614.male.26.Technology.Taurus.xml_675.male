Created by Sherilyn Sue. Schamber  Everything is done by sight and taste.  Make pie dough.  Pull just enough  dough off to fill a small tin with excess on the sides for sealing and crimping. Fork bottom in a few places so the crust doesn't rise and bubble.  Spray tin with nonstick spray.   In a large pot, cook meat and onion.  Add broth and a small amount of water to cut the strong  taste of broth.  Season with nutmeg, Worcestershire Sauce, salt and pepper.  Add flour and water mixture.  Cook and stir until thickened.  The sauce should be quite thick.  Cool the filling on top of the stove and then fill the pies.  Place a little warm water around edges of crust; cover with puff pastry; seal and crimp.  Makes holes on top with a fork for steam release.  Brush with egg wash.  Bake 350 F until tops are browned.  Cool on wire racks.    Serve with plenty of mashed potatoes, green peas, and lots of tomato sauce (Catsup.)  Meat pies maybe freeze well.  Place in freezer bags.  Reheat at 350 F until thoroughly heated.  If edges of crust start browning too quickly, cover with strips of foil.
