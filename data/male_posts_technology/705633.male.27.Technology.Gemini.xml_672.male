He also has kidney problems so he's on a special diet. Oh, and he has FIV - the cat equivalent of HIV. So he can't go outside or be around other cats." Purrfect. I am at the animal shelter looking at a foster cat that's come in and needs a home. After this description I am expected to see something half-dead with a leg sellotaped on and a coat hanger instead of a tail. Jo has been twisting my arm since we first moved in that she wants a cat.  Perferably one that's old so it can't run away when she wants to hug it.   In fact Ben is just a very quiet, very sad looking little moggy that looks like he's wondering what's going to happen next, after being brought in half dead and having various tests ran on him.  I've always thought of myself as more of a dog person but I've been persuaded into bringing a moggy into our home.  So a few weeks later and little Ben is welcomed home.  We read up on how to bring a cat into a new house, so we do it properly and leave him to explore a single room by himself. He spends the first few hours sitting in a corner, then watching the world go by on window sill. Eventually he starts to explore the rest of the flat, things are going well.  By about 8:30, I realize it's been a while since I saw him. So I look around the whole flat. Three times. Then I have a beer and look again.  Everywhere. The doors and windows are all shut. I am convinced that he's turned ethereal and ascended to heaven, like a zen master. Then I happen to glance at the base of the kitchen units, to a small gap about the size of an coconut between the cupboards and the floor. I wonder... So I get a maglite and a mirror, and sure enough, two winking cats eyes are smiling back at me from the farthest reaches of our flat. Little bastard. He could teach David Blaine a thing or two. I decide to leave him overnight, after all, if he got in there he can get himself out.   Next morning, he's still not budged. I call the animal shelter, saying my cat has turned into a protesting hippy and handcuffed himself to the underside of my oven. They say he's got to come out. They say they are sending the boys around. So one panel of broken chipboard later, little Ben is pulled from his hidey-hole and emerges into the sunlight.   Since that little episode he's fitting in really well, and is keeping me amused during the commercials when  Scrubs  is on. Perhaps I am a cat person after all.
