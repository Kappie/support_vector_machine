I mean after all georgie shrub has done in these last 4 years I can't imagine how anyone would want to vote for him.  ANYONE.  But what do I know?  Oh and how about Dick Ch*ney coming here to NM.  Like a mile from my office.    urlLink ABQjournal: Obtaining Cheney Rally Ticket Requires Signing Bush Endorsement  There was a story in the local paper here that in order to get tickets to the rally to see him you had to sign an endorsement of the prez.  Here is what the endorsement form says:  "I, (full name) ... do herby (sic) endorse George W. Bush for reelection of the United States." It later adds that, "In signing the above endorsement you are consenting to use and release of your name by Bush-Cheney as an endorser of President Bush." I think that is ridiculous.  But what do I know. Hey Kerry is coming back to NM soon, I'll keep you posted about that.
