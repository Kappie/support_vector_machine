Got into my current job as a Project Coordinator in Jardine OneSolution(JOS) withour having to go thru any interview or watsoever, the kind of job where u cant find elsewhere, amount of things to be picked up and learned in the company, chance to perform in Muchuan(the Ark) where a lot of ppl dream about. if all the above is not enough, then u will never be satisfied with watever in life and i urge u to go get urself an insurance and go commit suicide after a year.  Dont know leh....suddenly so much feelings rush into my head. Life can actually be wonderful but it all depend on how u want it lor. One sad day is a day passed, one happy day is a day passed, so y not make ur day a happy one? I know, easier said than done u might say but wats so difficult, try to laugh or smile at least once a day. Try to make other ppl's day.   One experience i had in bugis food court. Met a fren for lunch and she went ahead to order her food while i wait and jagar the seats. Table full of used utensils and cockeries. The cleaner auntie who looked ard 40+ came along and started clearing the table. Her face huh....hwah.....think someone owe her billions of dollars nv pay ah!! Then dun know y lah that day in good mood, i told the auntie :" auntie, xie xie ni, xin ku ni leh". Hwah and u know wat happened? No, she didnt throw the leftover fishball soup at me.... instead, she gave me a big grin. The most wonderful smile i ever seen on a cleaner auntie face b4. Like she tio beh bioh like that. Realli and i feel so wonderful after that and kept thinking about the incident for the entire day feeling good. She passed by a few times while i was lunching away and smile to me. No lah, i dont think she interested in me lah. Couldnt be one lah...;) haha. well thats it for making other ppl's day and in turn making ur day. Enjoy everyday, be happy every morning that u actually have a chance to open ur eyes and have the chance to live another day. Make ur day today!!!!  cheers, Teddy
