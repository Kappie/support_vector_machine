I have a friend that this (very similar) thing happened to recently. He was/is crushed. It's a bad thing that happens between people. I urge you to keep praying about it if you still have feelings for her. This may be God's way of preparing her for a good relationship with you? Who among us knows the mind of God? Anyway, my point is she can still change her mind in the future. ~Kevin    The sad thing is, I was planning to tell her everything about how I feel and how much she means to me the next time I talked to her, but now I’m glad I didn’t. I can’t imagine how hard it would have been for her to tell me that if I had started out by telling her how I felt about her. She has a hard enough time as it is just telling me stuff that could potentially hurt me to begin with. (She’s such a sweet girl... she really doesn’t want to hurt me, but at the same time, she doesn’t want to lead me on. I really respect her for that.)  Anyway, yeah, I really don’t want to loose her as a friend. I guess that I would venture to say that keeping a good friendship with her is more important than any type of romantic relationship, if it has the possibility of leaving us farther apart than when we started. Plus, the only way I’ll be happy with the situation is if she’s happy: We could be dating steadily, but if she’s not happy, I’m not happy. Same goes with another guy: If she’s in a relationship with someone else, and isn’t happy, I’m not going to be happy, but if she is, then I most likely will be (or at least will try to be).  As far as where this relationship is going... Your guess is as good as mine (lol). I think I’ll just have to sit back and trust God on that one. (Hey, what am I saying? I have to trust him for the entire thing.) Through all this though, my love for her is not even flickering... I pray that if it’s not God’s will that we never get back together, that He would take my love for her from me, but if we ever will, I pray that I never get involved with another girl between now and then... I want to be there for her if she’s ever in a time of need.  Oh, btw, I’m meeting Drew tomorrow to talk and pray about the... issue surrounding two families that I love, and want to have good relations restored between.
