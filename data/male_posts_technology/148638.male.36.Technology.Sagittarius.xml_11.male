I'm doing an internal talk at Microsoft Research in Redmond on June 17, and they've been good enough to set up a public event on June 16 in Seattle. I'm going to talk a little about copyright and read some new fiction -- there'll be books on sale, and I'll be happy to sign your stuff for ya. Here are the details:    When : June 16, 7PM  Where : Walker-Ames Room, Kane Hall  More info : Contact  urlLink Kim Ricketts , 206-523-3458   Should be interesting.
