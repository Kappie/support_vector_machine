You always brake everything." when i said "...no...i didnt touch it...i just was printing a paper..." he was like "ommitting things that would incriminate you, again!??!"  le sigh!!!    the drama, oh the DRAMA!!!!  [You know...I wont say anything else to you...Dont get yourself involved with vicious again, but i know saying that is useless...]
