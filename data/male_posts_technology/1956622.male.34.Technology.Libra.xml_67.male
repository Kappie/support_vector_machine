Karissa came away with all kinds of stuff.  She received one of those spinning scepters, a white tiger cup that had her snow cone in it, a hat that had her cotton candy in it and a full tummy and stuff.  Daddy came away with an empty pocketbook.  On the way home she even fell asleep so I am guessing she got up too early and liked the circus.  I came home and cleaned the house anticipating a suprise visit from   SFW   since she is rolling into town today.  Instead all I got was a phone call saying she was coming over tomorrow but she does not know when.  She does not have a rental car as all the places are closed which really means I need to give out some nookie before I can get paid!  I am sure she will come over and tell me what she wants and if I don't give it to her she will take Karissa and leave.  Right now the way it stands she did not get back to her attorney or something because her attorney never corresponded with my attorney so mediation may not take place on Monday which means I will not see her until her contempt hearing on Tuesday!  I have to admit I am a little nervous.  I am worried about the court not providing justice and letting her go scott free!
