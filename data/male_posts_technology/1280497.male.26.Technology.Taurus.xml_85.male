Hummer is a terrible car in my book, and I'm glad to see that people are coming off the high of owning a vehicle that is bigger than a house. I feel pity for people who buy them now, knowing that a) they bought a domestic car, which is enough of a risk; and b) they will likely regret the decision as time goes on. The one exception to this is the avid offroader who really loves taking his/her Hummer into the wilderness. Those people are at least making use of the huge power and military roots that come standard in these monsters.
