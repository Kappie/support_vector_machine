Yep the Bengals just won again and are on what I would consider an unstoppable roll.    I had a good Thanksgiving.  I love stuffing.  This year there was only one meal because Matt had a cross country meet in North Carolina On Saturday.  Still waiting to hear how he placed.  It was good to see family.  Got some good exercise chasing Patrick and Trevor around the neighborhood.    Friday I picked up Ann and Elizabeth fromt eh airport and we headed to the wedding of Danny and Nicole.  It was fun.  The wedding was at Xavier and the reception at a country club north of Cincinnati.  The food was great and the dancing even better.  I had a great time with Ann and then Saturday started book three in the Harry Potter series.  Yeah, I know that they have been out for a bit, but give me a break.
