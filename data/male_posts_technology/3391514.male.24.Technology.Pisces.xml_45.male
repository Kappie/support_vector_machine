Didn't you just have an eye operation that probably prevents you from driving?  I hear you cry.  Correct.  Fortunately, I have a friend who drives.  And likes roleplaying.  I picked up  Rifts: Dinosaur Swamp  - it doesn't look *too* good but I'm an obsessive completist.  I also got seasons 1 and 3 of  Babylon 5  on DVD, as they were in the HMV sale.  Still looking for Season 2 on the cheap, and waiting for Season 4 to come down in price.  And for Season 5 to be released...  Got round to watching  Star Trek: Nemesis  again... a reasonable film, but they could have done a lot more with it.  Also a pity so many scenes were cut.  Not much else happening... I have another opticians appointment tomorrow.
