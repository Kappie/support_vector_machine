Well especially the Gamertag team that monitors them on  urlLink XBOX Live  because they changed my fucking gamertag from  mikeoxlong  to  mikeloxlong .  I know for a damn fact that I put it in correctly.  I double checked because I know this name isn't very popular.  I guess someone at microsoft is retarded enough and found it out.  So to who ever that fucking guy/girl is, FUCK YOU for changing my gamertag.  Bitches!  click  urlLink here  and seach for my gamertag to see my latest stats.  I just started thus the shitty ranking and stuff but whatever, sooner or later I will be up there with the 31337.
