So perhaps a little "Beliefs" section by your's truly...  So here are my beliefs, feel free to write, I don't bite (*too hard*)  I believe myself to be christian, probably in the most liberal sense of the word. I do miss ignorance, but am happily living my hetero single lifestyle. I love in your face statements that'll probably piss people off, cause no matter how true they might be, our society has told us another way. (*example: evolution, we see it everywhere, yet most christians still believe in creation.*) I do dislike some christian pastors, I feel sorry for them really, cause if you want a big congregation you have to speak to the lowest denominator. The problem with this is you don't have a chance to learn much from each sermon and then they ask you for money.  I guess it's just this, I like my friends. I don't think people should judge me as a sinner for saying fuck, or shit, or asshole, or flipping someone off. None of us is better than the other. Isn't that what Christ told us? But then, I feel like I'm a reverse person where I judge people for not saying fuck or shit or asshole. When really, I'm fine if people don't want to say those words, but I don't think they should take offense to shit coming out of my mouth.  I think I'm very open minded. (*too open minded?*) Anyway, I love meeting new people, even if my Schizotypal self isn't:) Well, I gotta go...
