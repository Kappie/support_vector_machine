Fantasy Sports Experience :  I have coached fantasy basketball teams for 4 years, during which I have demonstrated a keen sense for players' hot and cold streaks and an ability to make key trades at opportune times.  During 2 of my 4 years I managed 2+ teams in several different leagues. I have drafted live as well as set up draft lists with top 3 finishes in both. I've been in leagues with anywhere from 8 to 18 teams, and have won championships in leagues of both sizes.      1 Basketball Championship - 10 teams, draft list, Head-to-Head  1 Basketball Championship - 18 teams, draft list, Roto  1 Football Championship - 10 teams, live draft, Head-to-Head  3rd place Basketball - 8 teams, live draft, Heat-to-Head     Best trade:  In 2003-04, I traded Kwame Brown and Caron Butler for Yao Ming.       Preferences:  I prefer Head-to-Head style leagues because they encourage the talking of smack. I also like leagues with lots of teams because they better simulate the importance of role players.      Writing Experience  :  For those who doubt my qualifications as a psuedo-intellectual-English-major-type-blogger, I self published a book of poems - some of which are available at:  urlLink Fanatical Pupil.com . In addition, my mother was in fact an English major, and I blame her for my extensive vocabulary.
