I may crash and burn completely or I may kick ass at this, but whichever way it turns out, I'm learning a new skill.  So that's good.  And I'm working for a new company with completely different philosophy's than what I'm used to.  So that's good too.  I had a heck of a time getting to bed early enough last night.  The original plan was to be up at 6 this morning and off to the gym before work, but when I looked at the clock and saw 1:15 am I thought that might be a bad idea.  So I changed the alarm to 6:45 for that extra bit of sleepypooh.  Didn't help much so far...I can barely keep my eyes open right now.  Man...what happened to my innate ability to run on 3 or 4 hours sleep?  Stupid maturity! >:(  I will write some about the job tonight...how it went and all that.
