Mellanie Nicole Triplett has made up in her mind that she doesn't want to be in a relationship with me anymore!!!   The love is there, emotions were never in question. There was no infidelity or questionable company being kept by either party. So what was the true cause? People can only bump heads only so often. The love that bound us could not supersede the stubborn logic that consumed both our mindsets. Maybe my mentality was too streamlined to be the complete man that not just Mellanie but any woman I spent time with could appreciate. What makes it so bad, after all that time of trying and toiling, I almost got there! I'm nearer to being there now than I may have ever been at any point in my life!!! Almost doesn't count however, especially when it takes two to make a thing go right.  Guess its best to just let it burn... See if love is enough to bring her back my way, and if by then both our lives will be fully prepared to take that journey together. We'll see if i'm destined to become another statistic in her life or the man that will usher her into eternity. I'm still in love and I know that she is too.....but for now...
