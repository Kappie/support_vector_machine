And when the whole movie ended....with no credits whatsoever ..juz Jesus walking out of the cave with his still nail pierced hands...the audience i was watching with ...went speechless..there was a long moment of silence..as tear ran down my face with me still holding on my hands as though i was the thief that acknowledged Jesus crucified next to Him...  Every time a whip lashed across the body . my heart and spirits cried out in anguish..and pain knowingly that that is for my sins ..whom i sometimes i committed it knowingly and yet in that moment...my spirit shouted out in anguish and in pain. When the scourge was upon Jesus, ripping away pieces of Jesus Body...i truly felt the pain and yet i forced myself to watch it ..because it was the truth... my tears was flowing down ....and whatever Jesus felt , i felt because of my spirit man.  Truly a Deep Impacting because Mel Gibson revealed what was truly on the mind of Jesus referring to the bible when He chose to give Himself away to fulfill His Destiny . The actor truly showed true expression which suggested that Jim ..the actor have fasted for days and prayed so that he can potray Jesus in the most real way.  Rudy said to us all ...when we left the house, Today ..Praise God..There are gonna be 10 changed lives right this very moment..and I , if God willing, would like to changed ppl's lives just by inviting them to watch the movie.  And for all Christian out there, a movie that is not mourning about Jesus's death, but a movie celebrating Jesus's death and His victory over sin ...not any other movie..but a movie that will change lives..the moment you watched it.  It would be ideal , if you guys can get an original DVD but in a country like this, pirated one will also do according to your own standing and conscience...don't watch it like you watch other movie...with potato crisp and lot of talking...but just experience the movie as though you are there with silence..and though there are grusome and violence , force yourself to watch it....because it was our sin that Jesus bore thru sufferring and it was also the same cross He bore that save us all...from death and condemnation.        Pray as a group even with non Christians before watching it...worship before hand ..if you like...and watch it .and at the end ...start a discussion over mamak or in cell...because i believe watching the movie alone is not enough ...you need to respond to it..especially non Christians...take the time and effort to challenge them in the faith.  Cell leader...take your time to watch with your cell members , don't watch it alone..because this is something you have to share with your cell members..        Take the Bread as my body and the wine as my blood that I have shed for you...Do this in remembrance of me....
