As well as a listing of events the website is the official home of a campaign to make today a public holiday.    The only reason I'm posting this now is due to the fact that  urlLink Bungers' link to the beeb  no longer has St. George featured on the front page. Presumably St. George's day finishes at 6pm or something.    It looks like we are not alone in wanting to make more of St. Georges day as a  urlLink new survey  reports, partially due to the recent success of the egg chasers. Planning for New Links St George's Day Party 2005 starts here.
