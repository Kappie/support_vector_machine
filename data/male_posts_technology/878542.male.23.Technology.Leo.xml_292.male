It was interesting to watch the audience, largely hard-core democrats from the LA area, hoot and clap and root for their boy.   It was shameless propaganda, which I think most people got. But some haven't, and are laboring under the assumption that either the democrats or republicans are actually reporting anything like facts.   Here is a forum discussion started out with a liberal journalist collecting all the deceit in the film. It's actually surprisingly, more than I caught, which bodes badly for more credulous viewers.   Please dont' trust people whose job it is to convince you of something. that's just not a good idea.
