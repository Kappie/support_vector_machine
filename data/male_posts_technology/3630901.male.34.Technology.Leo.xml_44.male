They'll be picked up by L and kept overnight on Tuesdays and Thursdays and every other weekend, Friday through Sunday.  The'll be back Sunday nights.  We also discussed holidays, briefly, at the mediation.  Elaine said we should have a schedule, but L and I were saying that we'll be flexible.  In general we'll switch off major holiday breaks - xmas and thanksgiving.  Other holidays - whatever day they fall on, who ever has the kids that day, gets the holiday.  Open to negotiation of course.  Birthdays, the same, maybe joint activities, where the other parent is invited for the festivities.  So like I said, running the spreadsheet shows hardship the first year.  Maybe I can push alimony off until the 2nd year, where it will be 1/2, and then when both kids are in public school (free), I'll pay the full amount.  The trade off for this could be she pays no child support -- or it's baked into the alimony.  But I do want a stipulation for college - where she pays 1/2 tuition, fees, and housing.    The good thing about alimony is that if L lives with someone else, the alimony is ended.  I can use the heloc loan as a negotiating tool.  I'm okay with the 55/45 split, especially since a decent chunk of the money will be covered by sale of stocks and xfer of 401k.    So if I can delay alimony, then year 1 will be difficult, but not impossible.  Then year 2 I'll start paying alimony, but day care costs will be halved.  Right?  Or will Ivy go to kindergarten and then have to do some kind of half day day care?  So is it really 3 years out before all kids are free and clear from paid day care?
