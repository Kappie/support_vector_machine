Rap and hip hop (and I don't even know if it's acceptable to lump them together) just never "grabbed" me. And, like any music, it's probably because I didn't take the time to sift through the music to find something I liked.  And, I'm  still open  to enjoying the June mix sent to me.  Consider this for June?  How about making the mixes from black artists?  (Am I right in assuming most hip hop artists are black?) That way it opens up the mix to much more music.  If not, I'll try and get a hip hop mix together...
