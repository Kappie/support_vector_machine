I dunno if it's a damn coincidence with illnesses, injuries, clash of timings (duh ... and I'm not even working permanently yet), plus a whole lot of other shitz, or is it that I'm slacking and feeling just plain lazy. Sure hope it's not the latter though.  Anyway, today I helped carry some buckets of water for some washing. Though my back was OK liao, but apparently it wasn't 'OK' enough. I've just decided to stop training till after the Chinese New Year. Best to ensure a complete recovery to avoid complications. Think that's the best alternative. But I don't really want to miss out Mon's lesson, it being the last one before CNY. I'll probably email Alvin this weekend see if I can pop down to watch and video his class down. Just for the fun of it.
