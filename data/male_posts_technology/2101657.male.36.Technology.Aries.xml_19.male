Thats entirely too cold in my opinion.  With the windchill we got down to -25 to 35 below.  Our old crappy furnace has been working over-time just trying to keep it 62 in the house, when the thermostat's set to 70.    When I got up I went outside and started the car up, so it would be warmed up by the time I had to leave.  I had a wal-mart bag of snacks to take to work with me, along with a 6pack of 24oz Diet Pepsi's.  By the time I got into the car, the pop had gone from room temperature, to fridged.  Was good and cold to drink that's for sure.    Short entry here, it's FRIDAY  (WOOHOOOOO) , and I'm just thinking that it's finally nap time.  Hope everyone has a safe, and WARM weekend!  We're going to hit a balmy 15 above tomorrow.
