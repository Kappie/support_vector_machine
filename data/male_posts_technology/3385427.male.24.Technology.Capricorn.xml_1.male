No recollections on who I really am or where I’ve been. This is what I do know: I know my name. I know I am a captain in the Tryklinian army – whatever that is – and I know that my mission is as follows:  1.   Destroy all enemy units.  2.   Collect 6 diamonds.  3.   Infiltrate the enemy Headquarters. That is all I know. I remember nothing more of this life. I do have minor recollections of my previous lives though. Before this life, I was a captain of the starship Voltor in the “Battle for Tryklinia” and before that, I was a captain during the “Mongor Incident”, the first big war of Tryklinia.  Right now though, I’m running through a forest. Bullets zip past my head and I unwillingly jump over the landmines that are laid out in front of me. I’ve done this a hundred times before. Not scenes like this one but this exact same scene. You don’t believe me? I’ll prove it. Hidden up ahead, behind a log, is a Krojan Warrior. Just watch. A few more jumps and a quick duck and you’ll see.  I jump up over the log and there he is. See? I told you so. But, instead of shooting him, I jump unexpectedly and a bullet from his rifle tears through my chest. Everything goes black.  Now, I’m running through the forest again, dodging the same bullets and jumping over the same landmines. Here comes that log again. This time, I jump over and start firing immediately. The Krojan Warrior flies through the air and vanishes. Ah, he drops a diamond. Now I have all six of them. Up ahead, I can see the headquarters. I run towards it and hurl a grenade. It blasts through the steel shell, leaving a gaping hole. I jump through. Everything goes black again.  When my sight returns, I’m frozen in an uncomfortable victory stance. I don’t bother trying to fight it. I’ve been in this situation many times before. It never lasts too long. I recount my diamonds and my kill ratio and mark my completed objectives with a big “X”.  Black.  Now, I’m inside a room surrounded by steel plates and flashing lights. For no apparent reason, I dive-roll to the left and start firing rapidly.  A Krojan Warrior drops to his knees in front of me and disappears. I run down a corridor and – here it comes - a bullet pierces through my heart. I knew it would. It always does. I’ve never exceeded beyond this point. I’m still trying to make sense of it all. Black again. This time is stays black. Perhaps I’ll do it all again tomorrow…  ”Mom!” the little boy screams, “I hate this game mom!” “What was that, Charles?” his mother asks. “This game. I hate it. It’s too hard. I can’t get past the fourth level,” he replies. “Oh well son, you’ll just have to try again tomorrow. Now pack that thing away. Supper’s ready.”
