Not the individual mind you, but the job. Really. Makes me vomit up bits of internal organs to even think about it. That said, here goes my spleen -      Before I go too far, let me re-verify my statement above, it's not the individual, it's the profession... I know programmers who love Visual Basic, I know people who prefer to eat their salads with salt and pepper, etc. Short explanation - even good people do bad things. It's in our nature. However, I cannot understand the inherent evil that is the HR job.  Now more specifically, I really really dislike the recruiters.  The avg HR joe who takes my call about a question on insurance, dental plans, etc is doing just fine in my book. They serve a need and they do it the way they think best. Fine. But those smug faced, lie spewing recruiter types, well, damn.  If you ever go to a career fair, you'll be surrounded by them, if you go to a college-style interview, you'll meet them. Some companies make you go to meetings filled with them. if you haven't met these types, count yourself lucky, and to try to help you spot them, I've written up some quick tell-tale signs :  Do they smile ALL THE TIME?  I mean, the kind of smile that looks like it was created by having the muscle fiber in their face altered, or maybe it's one of those freaky clear plastic masks, whatever, it's the first warning sign.  Do they talk really loud? are they exuding energy from their very pores? if so, another warning sign.      here's the worst one though - if someone is singing a company song, call it done. Same deal if there is a company chant, company dance, company sexual position, whatever. In fact, if the company has a song or a chant they do at meetings, might want to consider a job move.  I've had my fair share of experiences with the HR Demon. I've had to write a report saying i was sorry (3rd grade anyone?) I've had to do a fucking dance. I've had to watch them cheer and run across the stages telling everyone how wonerful their slave-style job was.  However, one occurence will always stay with me.  I saw one of the college recruiters walking out of work one day. I was slightly behind and to the side of her, so she did not notice me, but I had a good view of her profile. She seemed kinda off for some reason, like she was in a hurry to get out or something. Noticing this, I decided to see what was up.  That bitch wore her widest ass shit-eating grin the whole 1/2 mile walk through the parking lot to her car. She gets in, shuts the door, turns on her air-conditioning.... slumps way down in her seat and just relaxes her facial musclies.  It was the most amazing thing I'd ever seen. The smile gone, she put her blazer in gear and headed home.  I almost felt sorry for her until the next week when she made myself and some other guys play a "team-building exercise game"  Evil bitch
