 I have to be more careful when I'm surfing the web.  I was sitting here absent mindedly eating Jellybeans, and I think I ate too many.  I've begun to belch and bloat  or is it bloat and belch?  and my throat is getting that tight feeling.  Sour  urlLink Jelly Bellys  are worth it though. 

 I guess I didn't do such a great job of watching what I ate today.  I surely didn't eat enough.  I was extremely bored today, and I do have things that I could be doing.  I just didn't have any motivation today. 

 Since this illness began, many changes have overcome my body.  Loss of weight is a major one and everyone notices.  The one that bothers me the most though is my knees.  All this extra time in a chair or curled up on the couch is killing my knees.  My flat feet are likely to cause knee problems anyway, but I'm only 26 and I feel like I have 60 year old knees.  They ache if I sit still to long, and crack and pop whenever I expect them to move.  I don't like it.
