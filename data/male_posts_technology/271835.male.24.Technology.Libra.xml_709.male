Now  you  can experience computing as it once was!  urlLink Wired  reports on the impressive efforts of two German gentlemen that have used Java and other "modern" tools to create a website that emulates a MacSE.   Appropriately named  urlLink WebSE , this site "...allows anyone, on any platform, to run a facsimile of Macintosh System 7, the Mac operating system circa 1990  You can pretend to be Mr. Scott!  Did I mention that you can play Space Invaders on it? Who said there was never any good games on the mac?!!   Link shamelessly plundered from  urlLink insanely-great . Ta!
