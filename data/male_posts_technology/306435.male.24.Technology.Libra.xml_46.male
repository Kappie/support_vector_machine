I have tried to change the look of my web page.  For some reason my page will not load on some computers.  I am not sure why yet.  I think it my be the size of the picture on the first page, but we will soon see.  My work got hit by the goner virus yesterday.  It was kind of cool to catch it early and watch the company react to the news.  At the help desk we stayed pretty calm and informed everyone and for the most part the users were pretty calm.  I think most of them felt stupid for opening an attatchment that had been sent to them 6 times by 6 people  who they don't even know.  Eventually the Lotus Notes servers were shut down becasaue two of the offices we work with are on exchange servers and well if you know what that means then you know we were getting tons of emails.  Things were better today, but remnents of the virus were out there on computers with users that had no clue why their machine was going so slow.  Okay, well I am glad it is December, but even happier about it still being 70 degrees in December.  But as one of my callers, Dave Marr, suggested today (please read in a Scottish accent), "it just means we are goigng to have a bitterly cold February."  Mr. Marr I hope you are not right.  Okay, I am off to bed.  Another week of the late shift.  For those of you keeping track, and I know there are a ton of you keeping track, Ben is quitting and taking a job in Toledo so I am on the late shift until someone else is good enough to stay late.  Okay...good night...
