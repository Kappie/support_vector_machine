I mean, 162 games is way too many, such that any one game of the regular season has almost no importance. In contrast, the playoffs are too short. Not enough teams get to make the playoffs.  Compare that to football. There are 16 games in the NFL regular season. Each game is vitally important, and if you get a team that loses 4 games in a row, it makes it really difficult to make it into the playoffs.  Look at the baseball playoffs for instance. The Boston Red Sox-New York Yankees series is very exciting. People are talking about it. Same with Cubs and Marlins. Ratings galore. This is where baseball makes it money - tickets, television, merchandise...   So if they shortened the season by 1 month (or 2 even), and allowed more teams to make the playoffs, baseball could reduce its expenses and raise its income. It's dollars and cents.
