This book talks about human values, Regrets,Emotions,Marriage  lot more. Had a good feeling after reading this book.  What happened? No blogs for long time. I am preparing for my exam now. Since my project itself taking lot of my time.. It's tough for me to find time to prepare for the exam. But anyway I sent an confirmation mail. But ????.I will be coming to bangalore this thursday to write the exam.       Bangalorians send me your contact numbers to my infosys id. I have to come back to chennai on friday itself. So I think i can meet only kishore  Ram @ infy. I will talk to others over phone. Okay...bye guys..see you..        Sindhu..where are you? It's been so long since you posted anything..  Cheers....Kavitha
