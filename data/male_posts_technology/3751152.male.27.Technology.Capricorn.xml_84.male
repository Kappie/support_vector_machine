I got to see my family, a couple of my friends (including Fire and Trinity!) and even get in a little sun. I left tuesday afternoon for Trail and was planning on staying two weeks. However, those plans got muddled up when I received an employment opportunity (which starts tomorrow) last thursday. This guy wants to to help him fix up his 7 bedroom house - he says it should be for the rest of the summer. The guy is selling the house in september so he wants a good worker to do some grunt work for him. He chose the right guy!  Today I've gone shopping and am getting things ready for my job tomorrow. I bought a water container, a hat to keep the sun off my head, and new shoe laces for my work boots. whoohoo. I'm already to go! Tonight I think I might even take my woman out to see Spiderman 2. I hear it's pretty good! I can't wait to see it.  It is now 2:15pm and I am about to make some cookies! I might also surprise my woman with dinner when she gets off of work. I hope I don't burn the place down - but just incase, I've put the fire department on speed dial (which really wasn't worth the effort, as all I'd have to dial is 911 :P) Wish me luck!
