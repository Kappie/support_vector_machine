I was with him for his final moments.  Today, I continue my never-ending quest of finding a job.  Third time's a charm, right?  I hope so.  I have bills stacking up.    I got a new kitten!  His name is Buddy, and he's an orange and white kitty.  He was born March 25th of this year, and we adopted him from PetSmart, who uses a local organization for adoption.  There were so many cute cats there, but this one really appealed to me.  He is a light colored kitty.. he blends into almost everything in our house.. our cat climbing toy thingy, the carpet, the furniture, curtains, everything!  Anyway, I started a project in May.  I decided to open a BBS where my friends and I could play games online.  Right now, Shiloh and I are trying to take down the Minbar Federation, who is really putting up a fight.
