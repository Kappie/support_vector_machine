I haven't thought it out yet, but if enough of us were interested it would be a cool thing. Participation would  NOT  be mandatory, so don't worry about that, just the people interested. Names would be drawn at random and there would be a spending limit of I guess ten dollars, but if that is too high we could make it five.  Give me your feedback on this people.  Let's make this  Christmas in June  the best  Christmas in June  we've ever had!!!
