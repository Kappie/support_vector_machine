We usually get on the internet at the same time and he gets to post something witty and interesting, and then I read it and can't think of anything to say in response.  How the hell am I suposed to look smart if someone who's more articulate than me always posts something right before I do.  I feel like the most intelligent thing I can say is, "I agree with Nick.  Oh, and I like staplers."  Not that I think that I've really ever had anything interesting to say, but now my illusion is shattered!  It's not fair!
