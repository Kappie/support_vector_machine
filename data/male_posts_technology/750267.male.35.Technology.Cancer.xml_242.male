It's (supposedly) a dark comedy, about a clown who is forced to lead children into the Nazi gas chambers. "The Day The Clown Cried". It should have been called "The Day The Clown Helped The Nazis Murder Dozens Of Children". It has all the markings of a film that could have been something, but has missed the mark so widely. In fact, some are even calling it the worst film ever made -- which is surprising since noone has actually seen it since it was never released.  I have never been a fan of Jerry Lewis' comedy, and I suspect his personality would irritate me so we could never become friends, but now I don't know what to think. The Film Threat article follows my point of view on this fairly closely.  Perhaps the wisest thing Lewis did was destroy the film. If it ever got out, it would ruin him for sure.
