I don't have a good place to keep track of links that I find that would be interesting to read.   Good articles that I find, need a place where I can refer back to them later.   Just a place to ramble on if I feel like it. (Hmm.. I think I'm using this point right now)  A little spot on the web that I can call my own. Now that firekhard.org is no longer around. I might as well startup my own little place.  Maybe I'm also looking for a spot for friends to come and comment. Publish stories, links, etc.  ** Maybe I'll figure out a 6th reason later **    Posts should be informative, usable and ermm.. use the  urlLink FYOS  rule. I'll let some stuff slide ;)
