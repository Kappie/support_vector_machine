Though not Wi-Fi it is as cute it normally used to be. The other news is that I am the only employee of my company in my cadre to carry one such.  Not that they gave me , to put it right I got it from them. yes I borrowed thoughts from Jack Welch and asked my boss " why not  Lap top for me?" Being the fact that I have been sanctioned a PC at my office it became much more difficult  for me to put justify my stand.  Hurray ! at the end of the day my boss gave me his Lap top and said "best Of Luck". I can write a story named "Bala in wonderland". Nothing would make u more happier than an appreciation. I have imagined carrying one after 5 years. Ok I have also kick started my other dream ' fly within India twice in a day at the cost of my company'  God stop me please! stop me please!  Dei Vijay I always have appreciated your efforts to rise up every time you fall. None is 100% in this world it is the ability of winners to rise consistently. I belive you are a winner get going da.   What Kicha, what Bala,what rini, what Manny.... ever body is trying to climb the ladder da. No body is on the top. Just press ur accelerator harder for a month and there you are over taking all of us.  Best of Luck  bala
