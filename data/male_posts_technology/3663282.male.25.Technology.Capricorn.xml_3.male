I would usually wait for one of them to arrive to work, then the both of us will be waiting for the third one to arrive. So, this morning, we were all in the office, getting ready to go, one of us has to put on some makeup first. Anyway, as I was in the gents, my boss came in and asked me whether I've had breakfast, and he asked me to join him for breakfast. I was obviously felt guilty. So I went to see my colleagues to ask them to join us, but they declined. So it was just my boss and I.   During breakfast, we talked about work, naturally. So I'm assuming he did ask me to join him for this purpose. He asked for any updates on what I'm doing. And he informed me of certain things that I wasn't aware of. And in the end, he paid for the meal. Heheheh. Then while we were having breakfast and discussing about work and stuff, I got a call from the office. And it was my immediate boss. Apparently, there was a problem in the office and she needed me to come in as soon as possible. So, I rushed through my 'roti canai' and iced tea, and we sped to the office.  The problem was a serious one. And she needed me to liase with our vendor from Australia. As of now, around 5 hours from her phone call, the problem has been settled. I hope! Thank goodness for vendors. Heheheh. I used to be a vendor in my previous job. And I can tell you, it's sometimes painful if you have a difficult client. So now I try to be pleasant to the vendors. I try. Really I do.  Just today, we had two blackouts! One in the morning and the other one around half an hour ago. It's so annoying, especially when you are busy updating your blog, and chatting at the same time! I mean, when you are busy doing work! Heheheh...    Lunch today was provided by my department, since we had a meeting around lunch time. We ought to have more meetings around lunchtime. Then we wouldn't need to go out and look for food. And the food was suprisingly good. Because I actually thought about having seconds. It was a good meal, and now I'm sleepy.
