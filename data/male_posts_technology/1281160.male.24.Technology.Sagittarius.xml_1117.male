So couldnt check blogs and update it frequently.   Hei guys, Congrats on Manny's and Bala's new ventures! Good going guys.   BTW Bangaloreans, did ramya priya contact any one of u guys? since i wasnt in town, i got a news that she called me up. so if u people have contact no. do pass it on to me! Would love to chat with her!  Had a great time at home, finished reading Anna Karenina at last, and also one more book, a subtle humourous play by Oscar Wilde, "The importance of being Ernest". Also half way thru' "Mahabharatham". Excellent book full of life i can say, but then, its a very brief version by kirubananda vaariar and ya do u guys know any author, who has written Mahabharatham in the most comprehensive way? If so do pass on the info to me, i would like to purchase it and read it once. Or guys like kicha, ram can enquire elders in your family and let me know! Meanwhile, i too would keep my search on.  Got so many other books on shelf and feel like reading them all at one stretch, but adhukkula leave mudinjiruchi. enna panrathu. anyway will finish them off soon too.  ok guys, got some work, so will update later.
