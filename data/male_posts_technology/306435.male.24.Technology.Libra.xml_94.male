The game was just up the street from my Grandma's house.  I got the nod as starting pitcher, mainly because I can get the ball over the plate.  My arm felt good and I cruised through the first two innings with 4 strike outs and no hits.  I got two more K's in the third inning before giving aup a questionable walk on a full count then a 2 run 415 foot shot to center field.  Gave up two more runs the rest of the game and got six more strike outs for a total of 12.  For the first time I was able to spot my fastball on the corner and was able to blow it by a few people.  My team scored one run.  No run support at all.  We lost 4-1 (for those of you who are not paying attention).  I went 0-1 with a strike out with 2 walks and a stolen base.  In the bottom of the sixth a man walked onto outr field and yelled, "I have a permit for 2 o'clock get off the field now or I am calling the cops!"  Ann took a picture of the ensuing yelling match between the coach of the Big Stix who takes care fo the field and the man.  He had a team of little leaguers who were to practice.  We never got to play our second game.  I was glad, while my arm was not hurting )which is a good sign) I knew I was not gong to be able to catch a second game.       Our team looked much better, but I guess when I am trhowing strikes we should look better.  At one point I refused to take the ball from our airhead shortstop because he didn't know how to throw around the horn.  Eventually Darryl explained that the third baseman always throws to the pitcher.  I had fun.  Ann brought Bethy and Elizabeth to the game.  I think they were impressed, but they also saw the argument which further  adds to their stigma of baseball and the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  Oh well...     RYN-O-METER   .333
