Turning, braking, swerving were all manageable at decent speeds. The problem was getting my speed up into the double digits. Being new to the world of clutches and gear-shifting, I had a rough time making the basic transition from 1st to 2nd gear. I found myself half-shifting into neutral everytime. And neutral is a bad bad place to be when trying to throttle up. Of course, I was NEVER able to find neutral when I wanted to. I wonder which genius decided to stick neutral between two other gears? DAMN YOU NEUTRAL!!  As for bikes, both of us rode Honda Nighthawks.   I tried out a Yamaha Virago at the end of Saturday's class, thanks to a minor mishap involving Rachel and her Honda. I found the Virago's crusier-style handle bars very comfortable.   However, I had a hard time generating any speed on it, thanks to my friend, the neutral gear, and so I chose to dump it for the Nighthawk during today's session.  The final session ended with an evaluation test, which involved performing tight U-turns in the form of a figure 8, a swerve, an emergency stop and an accelerated 90+ degree turn. Everyone did ok, and Rachel outscored me! Damn you woman!  Anyway, I'm feeling happy and cheerful now. We still need to take the DMV's multiple choice test before we get real licences. But I'll worry about that in a few days. Right now, I think I'm going to browse through bike listings...    PS: It turns out that the morning sessions can start upto a good 7-8 minutes before the scheduled start time! Happened on both days. Today's session started at around 7:06, going by my watch (scheduled start time being 7:15). So we weren't late last week after all!
