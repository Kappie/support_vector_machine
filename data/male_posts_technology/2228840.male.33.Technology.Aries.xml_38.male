And let's face it, sliced bread is pretty damn cool.  I have discovered...  Drum roll, please ... Caffeinated mints and caffeinated gum! Is that  awesome , or what?!? As if it weren't enough already that this planet is blessed by the goodness of coffee, now I can get my fix in a little candy or simply chew my way to jittery bliss!   Rockstar  (you'll remember him from   urlLink Scenes from the Forklift  ) turned me on to this incredible line of products from   urlLink Penguin  . It turns out that one of his clients also markets some of these wonderful goodies here in Canada. Talk about my lucky break! In truth, I have only tried the  Cinnamon Mints , but I have serious plans to get my hands on the  Chocolate Mints , the  Peppermints , and every flavor of  Energy Gum  I can... Thank goodness the   urlLink Great Decaffeination   is over, eh?  Once I've had the chance to sample the full range that Penguin has to offer (and as soon as I can see straight enough to type again), I promise to post a full review for you to check out...
