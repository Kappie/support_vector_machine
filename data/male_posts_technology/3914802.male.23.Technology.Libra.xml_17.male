Once I saw her on my way home.... it was different in a weird way. Today I think she got arrested. I saw her across Constitution avenue, which is like 6 lanes of separation and a good thing. I walked right by her twice and she can be kind of upsetting. So, all of a sudden she starts walking across the 6 lanes of traffic! Luckily, her crazy is not the type of crazy to ignore the actual cars coming by so she made it across the street ok. She did it like 50 feet from the nearest crosswalk so she was kind of jaywalking I guess. I have seen guys in business suits walk across the traffic before (impatient people), but they do it at the crosswalk... Then, I saw this Explorer/SUV thing come out of nowhere and turn its sirens on and go to where the lady is. She was just yelling on the side of the street she just walked to. Then I crossed the street since the sign was lit. I didn't really want to be on that side anyways. So, the white SUV police and a police cruiser pull up to the side of Constitution Ave right in front of the Department of Labor Building (she seems to come there a lot, I don't know why, but that is where I usually see her), and she continues to yell the stuff she normally yells while walking away from them. Three cops are chasing her, and when I say "chasing" I mean that they are walking (in no hurry) towards her, but she is walking in the other direction. I was a block and a half away by this point... I kind of wanted to see what happened to my crazy lady, but I also wanted to get to work on time. Last I saw the three policemen were escorting her back to the police vehicles. I guess she will be ok. She knew she was in trouble, or else she wouldn't have walked away from those officers. She must have some semblance of regular thought (not all of tha cra-z). I wonder if she just has like real bad   urlLink tourettes   where the brain is thinking "regularly" but the mouth keeps going with random ass crap. I guess she probably wouldn't stay on the side of the street if that was true though, so she must have somethin' else (too?). The constant barrage of talking about rape and her mother being killed or her mother's daughter being killed and once even the KKK, is almost too much weirdness to bear witness to.
