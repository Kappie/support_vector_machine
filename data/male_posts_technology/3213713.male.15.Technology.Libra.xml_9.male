Pata nai kyoun... neend aa hi nhin rhi thi :s. Neways, I still managed to wake up at 11. But I just changed and sat at my pc. I chatted for some time and posted at the forum. Then, at bout 1, mamu came. I sat some while with him. Then, I had a bath and had lunch.  After lunch, I chatted some more and read SPIDER. Then, I think i went to the office and discussed the site. Worked on it for some time. It was raining at that time. Got back after a few hours and sat at my pc. Chatted some more. Looked at some links outta spider. Then, I just lazed around. Had dinner. Watched some TV. Chatted some more. Visited some more links. Had ice cream. Watched TV. Then I installed Studio MX bcz i had to make the sitemap of the site. After installing it, I went to have a bath. Then i read SPIDER. And since 12:30 i think... ive been online. Chatting and posting at lgscentral. And ive been reading posts at neowin too. See... nothing special
