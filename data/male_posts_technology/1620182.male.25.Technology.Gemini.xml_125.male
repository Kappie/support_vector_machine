 Are you kidding me?  How do I get in on this?  Now I really wish that I hadn't held back on all the political crap that goes on in my head.  I should have let the torrent free...Nonetheless, I expect my formal invite in the mail any day now.  How can they pass on a web site as exceptional as this?
 
 On the other hand, this type of event is prime for a terrorist attack.  At least that's what the panicked media tells me.  Of course, if I were invited to this convention, and should I live through it, I will of course use that experience as a way to debunk the otherwise flighty media that is constantly trying to scare the American public into submission.  
 
 I'll go pack my toothbrush...
