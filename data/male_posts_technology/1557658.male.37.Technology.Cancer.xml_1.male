So now I own a 4-plex.   *gulp* I think I'm spending money faster than I'm making it.    So here at work I'm exploring getting the validator package to work in the java Struts framework.  I'm getting zero results.  I'm missing something basic.  So what else is new.  *yawn* Man, I'm tired.  FInally fell asleep at 2 am, woke up at 5 am. ?!?!  whatever. At least I can go home early today and take a nap, since I came in around 6:30 this morning.
