I'm still crap at the game, but thankfully I have a little bit of pace.  It would be handy if I could somehow turn my name into something a little more awe inspring on the pitch. A friend of mine, Naveed, is called Navaldo and then you have the great Wayne Rooney and Roonaldo.  Somehow Keiraaaaaldo doesn't quite inspire the terror I want to see in peoples faces.  Instead it's more of a sympathetic and pitiful look.  Will have to work on the name I think.  We managed to play for the full hour.  Now I must remind you that it is MID summer here.  So what was the weather like?  What else?  It was pissing it down.  For the FULL HOUR.  Of course, when we stopped playing, so did the f*cking rain, but you'd expect it wouldn't you.    After the first half-hour of game play, a friend, Ross, took his water proof jacket off because water was creeping in the neck and sleeves and not being able to escape.  So in effect it was drier if he took the damn coat off.  It was at this point I was wondering if anyone had a convenient Ark anywhere on their person.  Such is british Summer.  It's not nearly as good as last year, but when the sun comes out you make the most of it.  I've been going to the gym in the mornings still.  I've cut 5km jogs down to 28 minutes which is good.  I'll try and extend the length I jog now instead improving my pace as I want to burn the fat more.  However now that I'm fas free, I'm finding my afternoons are much free-er than they used to be.  So I've been going on bike rides and long walks along the river.  So when the sun does come out I find myself literally walking through fields of Gold [sorry Sting for using such a cheesy line].  Just picturesque.  Next time, I'll take my camera and show you what I mean.  I have put up a picture of a night out from the last week.  These are two great friends of mine, Bushra and Phil, both from work who know how to enjoy themselves.    I have forgotten to take my camera out the last couple of weeks hence the lack of photoes.  Apologies.  There are some decent parties coming up this weekend and I hope to get some great shots.  I have also changed the feedback on the website so now anyone whose reading can leave some feedback.  This could backfire so nothing too vicsous or I'll jsut take it straight off :- ).  Otherwise, let me know what's going on out there people!!
