Now the problem is this, as soon as I think a girl could possibly like me, I just freak out. I'll be like, "no, you can't like me", which is just stupid.  I really have no idea why I force people that might be attracted to me away. It's really the stupedest thing I do. The other thing I do is tell the truth, pretty much unconditionally, which causes people to get hurt. It's just all the Bullshit, it's a drag, you know?  Then these girls that I could like, are like totally scared that I might like them. Which I don't understand. It's not like I'm really a scary guy. At least I don't think I am. Maybe, it's that I don't stand out, but then I do have blue hair, maybe it's cause I'm more plump than the next guy.  Really though, are we supposed to change for the ladies? or are we just supposed to find one that we're compatible with?  I know this for certain, "All women are crazy", and  "All men are crazy", it's just finding the craziness that fits together is key. It's finding the someone with the same kind or balancing craziness that's the trouble.
