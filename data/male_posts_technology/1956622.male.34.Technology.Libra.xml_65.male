We went to the galleria today where Karissa and I had the opportunity to check out the wall of water and I purchased a fur covered kitty Pez dispenser for her.    We then came home after about 5 hours at the galleria and Karissa and I swam and played.  I had her help me with the BBQ dinner we made.  Afterward her and Rick baked some cookies and I went out and mowed the lawn.  I finished about the time the outside lights came on and the sun was no more.  I informed Karissa that before we do anything tomorrow she and I will be cleaning her room and she seems fine with that right now.  We will see what happens when tomorrow comes.  I asked Karissa a couple of times today if she wanted to call her Mommy?  To which she kept replying "not right now"  Which is great because it is good to hear her ignoring Mommy for a change.  At least I am making an effort to have Karissa talk to her mommy something I doubt   SFW   does for me!
