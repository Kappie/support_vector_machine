The URL for the Atom feed is:    urlLink http://www.braithwaite-lee.com/weblog/atom.xml   The nice people at Blogger point out that there's a free re-syndication service called  urlLink Feedburner  that can convert the Atom feed into RSS 2.0. Of course, they may change their plans and stop serving feeds at any time, but if you'd like to try it, try:    urlLink http://feeds.feedburner.com/raganwald    If you aggregate blogs, I'd appreciate your feedback and suggestions for improving these feeds. Thanks!
