The problem for me is, I have been told that the Gettogether will held in Coimbatore.  But, now I have been told it will be held in Madurai. Friends, I was on my way to Madurai yesterday(30/12/2003) and I could not go through the blog. Due to this get together, I have also cancelled my personal trip with my mother to Sivakasi on the same day(25/1/2004).   I was not given a fair chance not only in this situation, but in all the aspects of the blog. I was always seen as Hobson's choice in the blog proceedings. I am sorry to say all this, but it is the fact.  I predict the decision making in the group is fully centralized and I had not given a fair chance too.  So I voluntarily took a decision to quit from this group.  "Wish U all again Happy and Prosperous New Year 2004"  I wish all the bloggers in this group all success in all their endeavours.
