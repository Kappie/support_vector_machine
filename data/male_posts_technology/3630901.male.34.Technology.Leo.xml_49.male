I told her that since we're re-financing the heloc, there's no way I can guarantee we'll have the checks available to write to get that money for her.  I also told her they probably want a bank check, and depositing funds from the heloc will take 3 days to clear.  So then she responded that I'll need to sell my stocks so she can get the money.  To which I responded, no way.  I told her to email the mediator about her plans, but she neglected to mention the $19k.  So I replied all and mentioned it for her.  I also offered the alternative funding from her parents (temporary loan).  She was livid that I even mentioned that.  She said that there was no way she was going to ask her parents to help her.  To which I responded that there was no way I was going to sell my stocks.  She said half that money is hers.  And I said, half of it is hers once the divorce is final.  Then she said that I was trying to screw her over regarding the condo.  Like now it's my fault that we don't have the money for her to move out.  I had no idea that she was going to need so much of the down payment so soon.  How would I know that?  Isn't that money supposed to come at the closing?  Maybe not.  Regardless, she didn't get these details (or at least communicate them to me) when she made the initial offer on the condo.  That's not my fault.  My parents tell me don't do her any favors -- don't loan her money out of the heloc.  Dean thinks I should get her out of the house as soon as possible.  Since I want to work things out amicably, I tend to agree with Dean.  I just have to make sure that everything is documented that she's taking money out of our accounts in order to buy a new place.   She also had the nerve to say to me that several weeks ago she talked to me about alimony, and said that she would drop the alimony if I helped her find a condo.  We never had that conversation!  This was the first I heard it.  Frankly, I'm all for helping her find a condo.  And of course, I'm all for not paying alimony.  Nonetheless, I told her that if she sought alimony, I would hire a lawyer and go to court.  i.e. things would get messy.  She seems to be afraid of messy for some reason.  She wants to be buddies with me.  Fuck that.  Once this is over, she will be nothing to me.    This morning she also started to suggest that we solidify our visitation agreement.  So that she has a more concrete schedule.  On her days, she'll get the kids up and take care of everything, and on my days, I'll take care of everything.  That's easy for her to say - she lives in the basement, and the kids are right near me.  Like I'd ever get to sleep in!  Then she also mentioned that this guy that she's seeing, Ozzie, has a visitation agreement where he sees his son on Wednesday and Thurday and every other weekend. She said she wanted her visitation to be in line with his!  I stood my ground wiht Tuesday and Thursday.  I've already modified my life to meet that schedule. Why should I change my schedule so that she can be on the same schedule as the guy of the moment?  Plus, not seeing the kids Wednesday through Sunday would be harder, I think.    Then I also brought up how when she has the kids, they should sleep over at her place, so that I have some free time.  In general, she was in agreement with that, but she had concerns about getting the kids to school on days when she was working.  She offered that maybe she'd have the kids more during the times that she had off.    It's funny how much we're talking and discussing these important matters.  I think she was livid with me about the financing because I was taking a stand and she wasn't used to that.  She's not used to me taking a stand and staying my ground.    She also started to talk about how she wasn't sure how she'd come up with the child support payment, after her mortgage, taxes, common fees.  I just did a quick calculation on etrade.com, where her mortgage would be $930, common charges she said were $170, and taxes $3000/year = $250/month.  That's about $1350/month!  Ye gads.  Regardless of that cost, she needs to pay for half of child care, which is about $750/month.  ($175/week/kid x 2 kids x 4.3 weeks/month) = $1505/month / 2 people = $752/person.  And that's just day care!  But if she's taking the kids overnight, then it seems fair.  Because she will also need to clothe, feed, and house them.  Her finances will definitely be tight, though.  You know what she needs?  A man with a second a income ... wait a second!  So interest rates are coming down.  That's a good thing for everyone.  I suppose I need to re-finance my mortgage, and get her name off of it.  I probably ought to talk to mortgage lawyer to see how it's done.  I think I need to find the original mortgage documentation to get L off the loan, and then I'll need to re-finance.  I'm not sure how that will work, exactly.  One step at a time, I guess.  L just called saying that her realtor said not to worry about the deposit -- that it can wait until after we re-fi the heloc.  ----------------- I just ran some numbers in a loan calculator, and might suggest to L that she only does 20% down or $42k.  Her payment will go up $50/month, but she'll have another $8k cash.  I'm not sure how much our divided settlement will be, so it may be a moot point.
