Unknown News are giving you the chance to predict which   urlLink 'surprise' event is going to happen . The winner (or winners) who predict the event and date that raises George Bush's popularity gets a wallet sized Bill of Rights. Shame that it's useless to us and increasingly more useless for the Americans.
