Even in our daily routines our efforts are more at proving others wrong rather than substantiating why I could be right...   Its simple human psychology... We always tend to feel we know just that little bit more than others and in our enthusiasm to demonstrate our efficacy we forget our good points and start targetting the other person's points should we feel them conflicting... But the ideal way to deal with the situation is to render enough leeway to the other person's ideas too and extrapolate it with our own points and refine an inference...   Its never going to be easy to change what could already have been a "well-thought-out" decision by a customer... It pays to dispense with some of our ego and go down to the lees in making more sense of our points rather than offending his ego by snubbing his views... It does take more effort, time and patience to bring the subject under our sway, but its far more effective than the "blind denial" method...
