I know the few of you who read this do not know of the daily strain I submit myself to (or, in some rare cases, the lack thereof).   5:45am : I still have not gotten used to waking up at this time. Sometimes I wake up at 4:30 and wonder why I wake up at the same time every day.    6:10am-6:20am : I usually drink a cup of orange juice (everyday) and head out to the car which (depending on the weather) is freezing cold with frost on every window. After warming the car up for about 3 minutes, I pull in reverse and always hear the distinct grind of the steering column as it gives way to the previous night's freeze in its joints. I slip the gear into 1st and my car slowly and reluctantly starts another journey towards Woodland Hills.   6:30am : My car is awake now. It changes gears easily but doesn't want to be over-revved beyond the point of 5,000 RPM. Traffic around this time is not too bad...but I remember when I used to traverse this freeway during the 7-8am rush hour. You could almost wish everyone around you stuck in the same 5-10mph would just disappear.    7:00am : I park in the same place I do everyday since I was granted car pool status (even though I don't car pool anymore). The 2nd floor of the parking structure right next to the stairs. People usually park in the car pool spaces with no rideshare tag. Ooooh do the parking attendants get PISSED when they see no rideshare tag on your car. It's sometimes funny to see the red perma-stickers stuck on these idiot's cars who park in the car pool spaces. Those stickers cannot be taken off (without the aid of a hair dryer and REALLY hot water) without leaving some nasty glue residue behind on their window.   7:20am - 7:50am : It is usually quiet around this time in the office. I sit at my desk and comtemplate things such as the new games coming out this month, whether or not I'm going to buy any games, wondering if Liz-Ann is awake, and the most important, when is that first call going to come in. I think the question is, do I even want to answer it...   8:00am : The stampede starts. The herd files in to their cubicles and calls ranging from "...ooh...*embarassed*...I forgot my network password" to "The icon I usually use is not in the same spot as it was yesterday. Please move it to the place it was yesterday!!!"  Now, one would think that if you were hired by a respectable company, you would know about the systems used in this company. It does not take much to comprehend the basics of any computer. Just working with such things day in and day out would get you a knowledge far beyond the cattle that call the helpdesk nearly every day.    9:00am : The "stupid" calls die down a bit and everyone gets into their groove for working. The supervisors/managers make their daily inspections of the groups and chit-chat/bullshit with each other about things that do not relate to work at all. It is of no surprise me when they wonder why productivity isn't so high in the work place.    10:00am : Break time. Usually between 8-9am, there will be one person that will piss you off. Fortunately, after driving the 101 for almost six years now, I've learned the value of patience and just letting things go. People are going to blow off steam on things they don't understand. Am I to blame them for naturally being ignorant? No. I usually take my break with Liz-Ann, but over the past month or so, we have been busy during our breaktimes.    11:00am : This hour is like a void. Nothing really happens. The calls die down and the general population of then entire company shuts up and just works. It is during these hours where I develop for the website (from any hair-brain idea that the group decided to add to the website), web surf (yes I can do that here), or work on my C++ training. I really don't pursue the latter much anymore. I've come to learn that programming is something I may never be able to learn. I've learned bits and pieces, but putting it all together to make something cohesive is something that has eluded me for the past 5 months.   12:00pm - 12:30pm : Nearing lunch time. Liz-Ann always has something for me to eat, even though I never ask for it. The helpdesk usually argues about who wants to go to lunch first around 12:00pm, but I am never part of that argument. I stated that I want to go to lunch at 12:30pm and that's that. No arguments.    1:30pm : The calls start up again, but it's a different animal. They are more calm now than in the morning. Some of the people are even nice. MD Adjusters call about having trouble with DIR/REI and Pathways. Sometimes about printing/camera issues. We have a person that handles all that exclusively, so all the calls go to him without much of our involvement.   2:00pm : It slows down here again. I either find myself working on a special project for another group (that wants it yesterday) or just minding my own business. Unicenter pings out errors from over 500 servers in the company, so there's always something there to look for. Alerts are created for specific groups/technicians to look at these errors and take care of them. Sitting all day long in this chair sort of pisses me off. The chair is inadequate for people who just answer the phone and get up infrequently all day long. At least I try to help out the customer by going to their desk sometimes...but when I'm sitting down, I would like to feel comfortable so I don't get backpain! Unfortunately, managers/supervisors don't care about this until they find out they have to file paperwork for an "on-the-job" injury and worker's compensation comes into play. But I maybe ranting. I'm sure it's much worse in other places.   3:00pm : Another break. As usual, I sometimes go with Liz-Ann to take a walk around the building or just hang out at her desk. This is the hour before I go home, so I wrap up any work that needs to be done (usually calls from people that are still having the same problem) and just hang out until 4pm.   4:00pm : I leave work to brave the traffic ridden 101 freeway. You'd think at 4:00pm there would be no more traffic than there would be at 3:00pm, but nope. It all piles up at 4:00pm. Commuting. This is the single most tiring event of my day because I have to contend with people that are still idiotic and as stupid as people at the company. The only time this ends is when I am at home with people who are fit NEITHER of these descriptions. When I get home, it's like I enter the "anti-stupid" barrier and everything is okay. I also feel like this when I enter Liz-Ann's home as well...or any of my friend's places.   As you can see, this is a long post. It would be even longer if explained every minute detail of my job and exactly what I do. If you wish to know, then I'll post more later...but most of it is really very boring. In the end, I don't hate my job. I like certain parts of it (the fact that I get to work with computers) like working with really nice people who understand that THEY are the ones that called for your help. It is these people that I respect the most out of all the callers. But for the most part, the majority of them are sheep. It's almost unfair to take this elitism stance, but it's true.    5:00pm - 10:00pm : I just play games and try to enjoy myself as best I can before another day starts.
