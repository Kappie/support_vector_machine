    
       One day Baity, you'll have broken down in the middle of nowhere. Your mobile will be flat, you engine seized, your patience waning and your hope fading. Then you'll see the headlights of an approaching car, you'll get out and signal for help, so happy to have human contract. Then you'll wake up in a ditch by the side of the road with the BMW logo imprinted on your forehead because that some smug bank man ran you over.   That, my friend, is karma. :)
