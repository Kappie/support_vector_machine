I'm leaving on saturday with Susan to spend the weekend up in colorodo. It's going to very very nice to be able to get out of town with my girlfriend for a weekend. I just hope I can get all of my homework done before saturday morning since I won't be back until monday afternoon. I'll see If can't get some good updates between now and saturday.
