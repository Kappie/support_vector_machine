On the twenty first day of the fifth month of this fourth year of the new millennium I shall be added to the list of 'the responsible men of the world'; what's worst, I have already started getting nightmares as weird as a marathon shopping spree where at the end Kalpana purchases almost nothing, a marathon roti making session, kids coming in tandem and pissing over my face while I am fast asleep and some more weirdoes which I can't even talk about on this blog.  Out of the three mentioned above the most irritating is of course number one. Its a big pain to shop with Kalpana who, in spite of having a particular taste, would want to look at everything under the sun; what's worst, when my Mom is around to give her company, one feels as miserable as an Ostrich.  Tomorrow is going to be a very hectic day. Papa and Annie would be coming in the evening along with Nana and some more relatives. The  Mainzraat  ( the night where ladies sing and the groom sobs ) is on the 19th and so is the  Devagon  ( the pooja of Lord Ganesha, at least that's what my father wants for my Devagon ). 20th is another big day; my  Yagnopavith  ( the thread ceremony, without which I am not entitled for marriage ) and then the big day of course.  more updates later
