It sounded like she wanted to talk but the cell phone signal prevented that.  I then called Karissa at home and at first the conversation seemed like it was going to be good but I could not get Karissa to talk.  I asked her if she wanted me to just hang up and she said no but she would not talk at all.  I think she was in front of the TV.  I tried to get her excited to talk.  I told her how the circus was coming to Houston...Nothing! I told her I sent her something....Nothing!  I finally had to tell her I was going to hang up and still nothing.  Usually she will give me hugs and kisses and then she hangs up first I could not even get that out of her.  All in all I just felt like the call was a waste of time.  I am not sure why but I really feel guilty about things right now with her.  In fact I feel crappy all over.  I just don't want to go do anything.  Maybe it is because it is Fathers day this weekend and I have never been away from her.  I have always gotten a card from Karissa that was great and this year I can't even hug her.   Being down and pissed off had at least one positive side effect it made me weed the front flower bed.  In fact I am going to try to finish the back yard this weekend as well.  I have nothing better to do and no money to do it with so might as well.  :)
