This place was a forgotten place just waiting to be discovered. It was a place fit for a rouge. Excluded from the world yet very much in touch with humanity. The furniture was very modern and spaced apart. The cheap feel was an expensive endeavor, now covered in white sheets. Not many people have seen this place, and not many people will ever see it. Itcontained a hidden room not even the builder knew of and could only be found by the owner. It was the only room that was used and had not been used for sometime. It opened to a set of steps thatlead to a raised floor. When the lights where on it lit up so bright it would hurt our eyes till they grew accustomed to the room. This room contained forgotten tools used by a type of unknown man that most do not have the desire to become. The shelves made of a Fogged glass and cabinets of a dark wood had a layer of dust waiting to be disturbed. The low hum of cylindrical was the only sound to be heard. These lights specifically designed to be have a second purpose. This purpose was to keep the room out of ear shoot of any electronic listening devices.    There was a man in the corner of this room. He was alone lost in his thoughts. Still hurting from the night before when he was out earning his paycheck. He didn't lead a normal life or spend the wealth the he had earned. He had no plans and was only wondering through life one target at a time. In front of him sat a powerless computer. He waited for the specified time to turn it on and verify that the payment was made. He never really knew who it was that paid him only knowing it was the same person. His benefactor was an agent of sorts that dealt in death. He couldn't guess how many others there were like him only that there had to be others. There were many enemies in this world and many people with money to pay to get rid of those enemies. But now the time had come to power on the machine and verify his funds. He found what he had expected. Tuning the machine off he decided it was time to rest.    The next day he sat down in front of the same computer in the same room and waited. Going through the same ritual that he went through day in and day out. And again it was time. As he logged on he had a new message waiting. Very rarely was there two messages for him 2 days in a row. It seemed though that his employer's faith in him was growing. He opened the message and read it. The message only contained a name and an attachment containing a photograph. This was all if not more information than he needed, but he knew it was just another precaution that had to be taken. There was something different about this person, though. Normally the targets where older and this one was younger. They all seemed to be of a certain class in society, but this person looked to be way below the normal standard. Who was he to judge his targets though, but then this wasn't judgment it was research. The beginning of his research. He knew in only a could hours he would know everything there was to know about this person.    The research on this one did not turn up as much as most of the others. There where only a few minor infractions against the young man in the police database. He owned nothing and had never bought anything on credit. He was however a very highly trained unit of the United States Army. He seemed a formidable foe. Though the picture that he had received did not portray this type of person. This picture portrayed someone closely resembling a drug addict. Of course this could be the case. A lot of these young boys sign up to become highly skilled war units for the glory. It is only when their skills and talents lead them into a combatant role in the real world does the true self surface. Many can not handle the after thoughts of what they have done and turn to anything that can help them escape.    The man sat behind his computer starring at the picture coming to all the correct conclusions. He did not have to justify the killing of this target as some would, but this would become a mercy killing. No one should have to live with ghosts of a past lifetime. Most can't ever move on and eventually kill themselves one way or another. This target looked as though he was well on his way with the needle. That was the only thing that could make a person resemble a skeleton as this target did. It was time to pack for the journey ahead. The equipment would be transported in his car with him. He would drive to the destination and start his surveillance and intel gathering. He would be patient and wait for the right time to strike. Then with ungodly persuasion it would happen and then as if he was never their it would end. He knew then he would find himself back where he sat waiting to tune on the computer to verify payment.    After loading the car's trunk with only the necessary gear he entered the car and sat in the driver's seat. Sitting there he starred ahead at the glass, not looking past the clear surface. He held the keys in hand and was enjoying the dark silence. He looked into the mirrors making sure they were in the correct position knowing they would be. He slipped the seat belt over his chest and into the buckle. He methodically found the Key to the car and slowly slipped it into the ignition feeling each ridge slide past its rocker. The ignition turned the motor over and the car was started. He paused for a moment before opening the center console and pulling out his one and only pair of sunglasses. They were silver frames with mirror tinted lenses. With gloved hands he reached for the door opener and pushed the round button. The light slowly went from only a line of brightness to a flood, and with that he entered the world. This world was not his world, but only one he studied. He knew isocracies of the human race, but felt him self set apart. Not inferior or superior, just set apart. This was the sole reason he decided on this life, and it was the sole reason he was more and more wanting it to end.   The road was comforting and rhythmic to his senses. It gave him time to observe the world as it passed. The young peering at him inquisitive through the back window and the old never moving their eyes off the road in front of them. The only stops that were made where for gas, and these stops where the times he would eat. Normally finding a dinner close to the highway where the people didn't pay him much mind. Only the waitress would talk to him and he could barely make it thought that much interaction. He preferred the stillness of nothing and longed for it most at times like these. This feeling was not something that controlled him, but something he indulged himself in when he could. No he had been in many crowds and could talk his way into anything needed or desired. He was a student of humanity always watching, studying, learning how to better accomplish a desired affect.    When he had arrived at his destination, an old hotel in a bad part of any city, he laid back on the bed with his luggage beside him. Listening to the tenants that most certainly spend most of their life here and the little muffled sounds they or the shows on the television made, he enjoyed the atmosphere. It was far from the cleanliness of his dwelling, but he could appreciate the mood it cast upon him. Letting his mind become the mind of a person that would reside in a place of this nature and enjoying the stillness of the air. He let his eyes close for the first time in a day and a half he felt nothing.
