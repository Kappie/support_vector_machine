Well, I have once again had an upgrade at work...I have now gone from regular heavy good trucks to the 14 tonne water tankers haha! These beasts are a real nightmare to drive as they never want to stop when you brake and I have nearly tipped it already lol! Um...the week has been rather busy, this is because I am going away in about a weeks time and I have way too much to get ready for it. Hopefully all the preparation will be worth it though, usually is. I was hoping to have another trip to Guernsey to say farewell to Jo and Sam before they go to live in the UK, unfortunately it looks like I am not going to be able to go as there really is just too much going on here that I can't get out of, which really sucks!!  So today I woke up, stripped to the bone and lying on top of my bed with the pillows and the sheets all over the floor! Now I wish I could confess that this was because I had found a lovely girlfriend and we had rampant sex...but no! No, it was merely because it was just fucking hot last night!!!! Althought I slept sound. Anyway, I phoned the Toaster and he, his girlfriend and I went to the cinema (lovely and air conditioned haha) to watch Terminator 3:Rise Of The Machines. It was a reasonably good film, lots of shooting, and you even get to see the machines as they first began, but I shall not go into too much detail as I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it! Oh and Pirates Of The Carribean is a cracking film too!! I recommend it to anybody!  Thats about it for now really.....hopefully Toaster will be sorting out a bbq for all of us soon, now that his patio is finished hehe, anyway I'll have more to talk about soon.  Baity signing off.....
