No, no, don't take that the wrong way.  I'm not saying that none of you are interested in what's going on in the world... quite the contrary.  I'm saying, if you're like me, you think CNN is ridiculous.  I have the utmost (UTMOST) pleasure of being able to watch CNN up close and personal everyday in my company's cafe.  Yeah, we call it a cafe.  You wanna fight about it?  Anyway... I remember when I first realised CNN was going down hill:  There we were, my coworkers and I, eating our lunch, mindlessly watching the world pass us by on the big screen television.  When lo, it was annouced before the commercial break that when CNN came back, they'd have a must know story on the events of Brittany Spears' recent breakup.  We all stared at each other in stunned disbelief.  Brittany Spears had broken up?  How could this be?  And in God's name, WHY THE HELL WOULD ANYONE CARE?!  CNN promptly came back on, and as promised, told us how the young lass had decided to call it quits with young Mr. Timberlake.  What a sad, sad state of affairs, when the cable channel which caused me great pain when I was a child because it was "Sooo boring..." had arrived at the nadir of news reporting first made so popular by MTV News.  Now that I was no longer a child, it was catering to just that.  In the days and months since, CNN has continued to tumble down the cable news trash chute at an ever increasing rate.  Recently, during the melee of the sniper attacks, CNN reported that there may have been a connection between the location of the shootings and the Michael's craft stores.  However, in almost the same breath, the asinine reporter announced that the Virigina police had not found any such links and that this was speculation on the part of CNN.  Oh well, great.  That's the kind of right on, investigative reporting I expect from the once leader of cable news.  No, mere facts are not good enough for CNN anymore!  Let's presume to know what's going on before anyone else does.  That way we'll look like we really know that much more about the sniper attacks.  And, at the same time put a few Michael's out of business simply to boost ratings.  American news reporting at its finest.  Oh the days when CNN was boring and simply reported the facts.  How I long for when they were not in everyone's business... when I found out about a war, after it started, not a week before.  Do me a favour, if you need to go "Around the world in thirty minutes..." don't choose CNN as your travel guide.  Watch Fox News or MSNBC.  Peace; out.
