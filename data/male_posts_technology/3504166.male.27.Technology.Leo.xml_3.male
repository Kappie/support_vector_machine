Sunday becomes Monday.  You wonder what your name was. You wonder whether that guy who sang "hello darkness my old friend" meant "hello sleep my old friend".  Still it was great fun, and I spent some serious quality time with A. Something I haven't done for a long time.  Was strange this weekend, it almost felt like I had a girlfriend again, and surprisingly enough this wasn't a bad thing.  Hmm..
