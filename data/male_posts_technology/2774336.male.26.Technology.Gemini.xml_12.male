..and he was off at a run. Well, perhaps it was more of a swagger. Ok, he was sitting. Sitting before his computer keyboard just as any other day of the past year.  

 'Green' is probably not the kind of web log that will win any awards for prose, attract media attention, or even entertain anyone on their lunch break. 'Green' is about me, and more importantly about my problems.  

 You see, for one month - from June to July of 2003 - I went on an amazing and incredibly fulfilling journey to the Nation of Japan, and I brought something back with me. Sure, I packed an extra duffel with me to carry home my clothes while my suitcase was bloated with souvenirs. Yes, I hid some food in my backpack and some foreign money in my belt. The thing that I was unaware of carrying was hiding somewhere between my esophagus and my colon, and it was there to stay, so it seems. 

Since my return from Japan over a year ago (as of the time of this post) I have been terribly ill. I can't say for sure what has been the cause of my illness, although  urlLink Giardia Lambia  is suspect. The problem that has inspired this web log is that it doesn't seem to be getting better.  

 Enter - the power of the internet! With the help of  urlLink Blogger.com  I plan to keep records of my symptoms and hopefully their causes. I'll likely find time to add comments here and there with the hope that anyone unlucky enough to stumble upon this log will find some entertainment. With any luck one of you reading along will recognize something in my story and be able to offer help, or find help with your own situation. So there is the impetus, but what about the name?  

 'Green' is often considered the color of nature and health. Who can look out upon a grassy field during the height of summer and not feel a little more alive? However, 'green' is also the color associated with illness and nausea (at least in American culture). For both reasons, 'Green' is the name of this log.
