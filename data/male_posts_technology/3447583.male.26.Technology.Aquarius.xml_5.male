Something unimaginable has been picturized yet again, and this time it was impossible to bear it.We just saw the first half.   What struck me most about the movie apart from the violence was its intent. Yet again an attempt has been made to highlight an incident and glorify a person instead of the focusing on the message. And that’s understandable. How could the message be conveyed in two hours when two thousand and four years haven’t been enough?  Judas betrays his masters by revealing his location to the priests. When the soldiers come to arrest the master, Christ tells Judas “You have betrayed the son of man”. Now that sentence attracted my attention.    Jesus does not say, “You have betrayed Me” instead he used “son of man” and that’s important. Masters like Jesus don’t identify themselves by their physical bodies. For them “Me” is the soul, the omnipresent spirit and not the gross body or the mind. For them everything is one, themselves, presenting itself in its different manifestations. And since good  bad are part of that omnipresent spirit itself it would have been meaningless for him to say “you have betrayed Me”. There is no way of betraying him, for he is the good and he is the bad. He is the doer and he is the sufferer. So who betrays whom?   Isn’t that the advaita philosophy? One hundred and ten years ago, in 1894 a realized master, Yogawatar Swami Yukteshwar giri had systematically illustrated how there is absolutely no difference in the message conveyed by Jesus and what is conveyed through the Indian scriptures. Though Jesus conveyed the message, few were prepared to understand the hidden meaning in that era. One needs the help of a realized master to understand the meaning conveyed in terms of allegory.    So how does the “Son of man” any different?   “Son of man” is the Ego. From one of the Sanskrit verses explained by swami Yukteshwar:  Chitsakashadanormahatwam tacchitwam, tatrasadhyavasayaha Satwam bhudhihi tatastadwiparitam manah charamayabhimanoahankarastadeva jeevaha   “The Atom under the influence of Chit (universal knowledge) forms the calm state of mind, which when spiritualized is called bhuddhi, intelligence. Its opposite is Manas, Mind, in which lives the Jiva: the self with Ahamkara,Ego, the idea of separate existance”            He explains further: “Chitta, the Heart; Ahamkara, Ego, the son of man. This Atom, Awidya, the Ignorance, being under the influence of Universal Love, Chit, the Holy Spirit becomes spiritualized, like iron filling in a magnetic aura, and possessed of consciousness, the power of feeling, when it is called Mahat, the Heart, Chitta; and being such, the idea of separate existence appears in it, which is called Ahamkara, Ego, the son of man.                     Sri yukteshwar also speaks about the another incident which has been depicted in the movie.  “All creation is governed by law. The principles that operate in the outer universe discoverable by scientists are called natural laws. But there are subtler laws that rule the hidden spiritual planes and the inner realm of consciousness; these principles are knowable through the science of yoga. It is not the physicst but the self realized master who comprehends the true nature of matter. By such knowledge Christ was able to restore a servant’s ear after it had been severed by one of the deciples”.     what is the true nature of matter ?...and more ...coming soon...in part 2!. Till then,take good care of yourself !
