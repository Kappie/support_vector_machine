Didn't hurt at the time, but it did hurt later.     I also had bought a can of fix a flat for my white prizm car and it half inflated my tire, I drove the car around the neighborhood and felt the tire going down, so I went back home.  Will have to fix that later.   Went home and put a bandaid on my hand, then put the windshield wiper blades into the van.  I managed to stab my thumb with a wood chisel and it bleed a lot, finally got that washed off and a tiny little bandage on it that stopped the blood flow instantly.   Drove the Van around the neighborhood and back home.  I also found a good deal on a paper binding system with those plastic rolls with fingers on them for like half price.  So I bound up a bunch of documents, it looks good.  I am going to make use of that a lot as I try to organize a lot of documentation about vnos, the program I work on.  I also copy a lot of magazine articles that I find useful and those can be binded too.
