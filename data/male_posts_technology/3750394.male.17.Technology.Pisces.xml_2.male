I'm not super political, but I do have views on it, I was rooting for the Conservatives, we need a change from the Liberals in this country, and I think the Conservatives could have made that happen.  One thing is for sure though, Paul Martin is going to have one hell of a time trying to pass bills with a minority government. It seems like a small number, but the liberals only have 7.2% (or something close to that) more seats than the conservatives.  Just my $0.02 for the election.  As for what im doing today?, I still have to find something to do, and close, cause I don't have a vehicle today :@.  Maybe i'll try to see if Marci is in town, go for coffee or something, even though I've never driven with her :S:|, lol.  Who knows what I'll do today, gonna have to see.  BTW Corey, good idea for the daily links on ur Blog, haha, there good, especially the HP recall one (thats gonna cost a fortune :S).  I'll probably post later if nothings going on :P.
