But there is one thing that keeps us going and keeps us motivated to continue is FAITH...  i always believed that what ever happens happens for good...so today one may say that his or her situation is full of problems but i believe and have experienced myself also that these problems or situations are there to tell us something...make us learn...make us grow as a person...we should try to make most of them...and move forward...in the end once all of its over one could look back really see that all those experiences have been good for one...  for me its definitely happened that there were times when my career and life were really in doldrums...and there seemed no way forward...but i went through it...learnt about people who are really my friends and who are there for being there...learnt about being practical and what can be done and should be done...so as hindsight i believe that was a learning experience for me...  but the problem is this wisdom still does not help me when i am in the thick of things..when u are stuck u are stuck...its that simple...wat ever u may believe and know can help but u need something else to really fight it out...  To me that is where Faith steps it...Faith is the one that should give one the strength and endurance to stand through test of times...should give one the belief that things will be different one day...should motivate and give hope for a better tomorrow one day...
