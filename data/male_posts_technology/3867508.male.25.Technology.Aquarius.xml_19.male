Flip-flopping   Ok this is just the beginning of my push back at the right wingers out there who accuse Kerry of being a flip-flop on issues. Take a look at this article:     urlLink AlterNet: George W. Bush: Presidential or Pathological?     Now scroll down to about half way through the article (by all means read it in its entirety, but for the point I want to make follow me here). The section I am honing in on, and keep in mind this  is  an editorial written by Arianna Huffington, starts with the sentence: "For those of you who bailed on Psych 101"... Ok anyways I don't want to address every point she makes but please do read. Basically she calls Bush to task for labeling Kerry a flip-flopper even though he has done his fair share of flip-flopping himself. And she brings up a good point,    "Now, God knows, I have no problem with changing your mind- so long as you admit that you have and can explain why." Next,  Drip-dropping.   Drip-dropping with irony! Well ok not really irony, but you will get the point. Here is an extended quote from Paul Sperry with a conservative online "ezine".    "Forget that Bush lied about the reasons for putting our sons and daughters in harm's way in Iraq; and forget that he sent 140,000 troops there with bull's-eyes on their backs, then dared their attackers to bring it on," Sperry wrote. "It was the height of irresponsibility to have done so in the middle of a war on al-Qaida, the real and proven threat to America. Bush diverted those troops and other resources- including intelligence assets, Arabic translators and hundreds of billions of tax dollars- from the hunt for Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaida leaders along the Afghan-Pakistani border. And now they've regrouped and are as threatening as ever. That's inexcusable, and Bush supporters with any intellectual honesty and concern for their own families' safety should be mad as hell about it- and thats coming from someone who voted for Bush."  Now for  fist-frocking  (seriously I have no idea)  No really I thought I would end with a couple of links to a website that I find hilarious! And it really is about time that we can laugh at all this crap sometimes.    urlLink www.whitehouse.org   This site is jam packed with hilarious stories and anecdotes, very well done.    urlLink www.georgewbush.org   This site is related to the previous one, but this site is nearly identical to the official Bush/Cheney 2004 site. The biography sections are particularly hilarious.    Have a good time and seriously take the time to read all the stuff that is on those two sites.  Oh and also  urlLink www.billionairesforbush.com  . Good stuff!  Until next time America!
