We then went shopping for a tie (and decided I would just use one of my dad's instead. - lack of selection).   I went home, took a shower, sat around for an hour or so, had a light snack, and changed into my suit.  My dad then drove me to Gwen's house, where we had a cool conversation with her dad, and occasionally with her mom as she walked through, all the while, vaguely aware of the commotion in other parts of the house as Gwen finished getting ready.  As she came out, my first thought was *man, she looks beautiful*. :) :)  Anyway, we took some pictures there, and had some trouble getting my boutonnière on. :)  And then, *zoom*, down, the highway we went, to the general area of Shenanigan's, and promptly got lost for ten minutes. (as if we weren't already late)   Once we finally got there, we had to walk for a couple minutes to get to the banquet hall.  (Gwen was wearing a rather thin dress, so she was freezing the entire way.)  The masquerade theme was kinda funny, but cool at the same time.  Anyway, we sat down at a table occupied by Missy, Kathleen, and Jalon.  I ordered chicken, and Gwen ordered steak (which turned out to be very rare when she got it - so rare in fact, that she had to send it back to be re-cooked, and half-an-hour later when it arrived again, it was STILL slightly rare).  I would be surprised if at least some of the people that got the steak don't get food poisoning.  Oh well.  The salad was pretty good though.  Later, several more people arrived at our table and royally confused the waiters with all our combined orders. (lol)  After we were done eating we juss walked around for a while, talking to people, and eventually decided to get our pictures taken.  That was an interesting experience - We misunderstood the photographer's question "are you a couple?" to mean 'is there anyone else going to be in this pic', not 'are you dating'.  So, I answered yes, which led to a rather embarrassing situation.  (I'm not going to post what happened, but will tell anyone that asks directly).  Anyway, the rest of the time there was kinda awkward, but still went pretty well.  Then my dad picked us up, and we headed back to my house.  When we got back, we waited around for a couple minutes until Adrian and Melissa came, and then spent a couple hours watching signs.  By the end of the evening, we were all pretty tired, and hyper - an interesting state to be in.  Anyway, they left around 12:25, and I went to bed, and slept for 12 hours. :)
