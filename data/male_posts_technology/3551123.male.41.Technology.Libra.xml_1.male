This made it a bit harder to maneuver his car to the left lane, so for the past week, instead of moving his car to and fro to take advantage of openings in the walls of traffic he faced every morning, he maintained his position in the right lane and dealt with the happenings in that lane without complaint.  His also had to remember not to breathe too deeply, because that brought a sharper version of the pain and also in some circumstances developed into a coughing fit, which of course made the pain even sharper.  He finally made the call last Thursday from his office during his lunch hour after avoiding it for the past three months.  It was just another day at the office, and during his lunchtime ritual he picked up the phone and made the call, just like that, like he was ordering out for pizza.  His heart was hammering as he made the call and was nonspecific in why he was making an appointment.  After he hung up, he felt relief and a bit more positive, which allowed him to have a little hope.  He has had pains similar to this throughout his adult life, especially during more stressful periods where he smoked more cigarettes than usual.  He had not been to the doctors in over ten years, and then it was only for an ingrown toenail that had become so infected that he dared not attempt to perform the grisly operation himself, so he succumbed to the inevitable shot in the big toe and the rest.  When the doctor recommended blood tests and the like since he was pushing forty at the time, he agreed but did not keep any of the appointments and it was all conveniently forgotten.  One of the advantages of managed care was that the doctors were so busy they did not have the time to track down wayward patients who were not interested in following up medical procedures.  But this pained scared him.  He first noticed it three months ago when mowing the yard,  one of his typical Saturday morning chores.  At his age he was accustomed to aches and pains, they were a constant reminder of how old he was getting and how everything now was harder.  But unlike all of the other minor irritations, this one did not get any better.  At first it only reared its head during exertion, but soon was a constant companion.  He began to get worried – had the 30 years of smoking finally caught up with him?  He couldn’t tell his wife – she had been ragging on him to quit smoking for years, and he could not face the disappointment in her eyes if he told her of his condition.  He had been facing it on his own.  He was not ready for major medical issues, for the inevitable decline, for death.  He had so many people counting on him.
