I actually really should not be playing .50/1 by those definitions but thats all there is. One of these days I will get a little self control.  It was a decent night. I placed 3rd and 6th in tourneys. I was down in .50/1. I played a little NL. I am not patient enough for that game. It is losing it's allure. I killed the 2/4 game I was in. Not alot of good hands, but good callers. Ended up $76 or so. So my roll is now slightly over 200. Sweet.  Almost forgot. I only had one good hand in my 6th place tourney finish. It was a tight table. One of my early hands, I am the BB and limp in with K8. The flop is KKK. I checked into $200 of bets. The next round was another $200. They checked around to me and I bet $15. I probably should have bet like $100 since the pot was large.. maybe $50. I did not want people to fold. Oh well. That was the only playable hand. I went out on Q8, flop Q85. Turn 6. River K. Beat by a straight.
