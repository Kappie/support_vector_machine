She said that she could go because she told her mom that I was putting them up at a hotel when they were here.  Well, I know here and she's a terrible liar.  I don't want that shit to blow up in my face and with her dumb ass, anything is possible.  Not to mention that I work 11 hour days now, she wanted me to leave for Iowa at 6 get there by 10, pick them up and drive back here to Chicago so that would mean that we got back to Chicago at 3 AM.  Do things Saturday and drive them back Sunday early morning.  What the fuck?  Next weekend is not going to work either because her friend is getting married.  The weekend after that, he parents are probably doing something and that's also one thing I fucking hate is that I have to go ask if her parents are doing something for me to do shit with my own kid.  Sure I am thankful that they are taking care of him but seriously, that's not their kid and Jenny isn't really a mother.  All I know is the 11th she better not be working and have Bryce ready so I can see him here for the WHOLE weekend.  I hate not having my son around.  I now remember why I broke up with her and why I don't really like her anymore.  I would give up everything if I could have my son.  Right now I could be a fucking janitor and live in a rundown one bedroom apartment for all I care as long as I can support myself and Bryce then it's going to be alright.  I don't even care if he is the only person that I see after a long day of scrubbing toilets or picking up trash.  I don't care if it's just the two of us going to the beach or the zoo or whatever.  I just want Jenny and her family out of the picture but it's turning out that I am slowly being taken out of the picture.  Oh and I bet that the child support that I am paying for Bryce is going towards Jenny's fucking townhouse that she is renting.  Isn't there some sort of legal action that I can take where I get the receipts on whatever the fuck she is spending the money that I work hard for on?  I mean that's fucking child support, i.e. FOR THE CHILD.  She has no job and her room mates are inbred fucking idiots who can't get/keep a job and have no education so how do you think the is able to pay for that crap?  Yeah, probably me.  So, is there something out there that makes it possible for me to take Bryce considering he's not even living with her and I'm paying her fucking child support?  Fuck Fuck Fuck.    I know I made the decision to have unprotected sex and playing my cards on making a baby.  There really isn't much I can do but to just tough it out.
