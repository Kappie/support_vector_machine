Got an email sometime back saying there was a blood donation drive at Selarang camp so I was thinking should I use my personal leave time for this. In the end when I reached Tampines JC, I thought 'what the heck, might as well since I'm still in the east side' so I alighted. Got to Selarang camp and realised there wasn't any mobile blood bank there. ARGH!! wasted my personal transport fare and time. And it was only last night that I saw on the news saying there weren't enough regular blood donars each year. Haiz ... maybe I'll check their website again next time before I do anything like that.  Woohoo ... tomoro on off. Goin Ikea to do some shopping. Hope I dun buy too much coz I still wanna go for the Aikido combined training at BVCC.
