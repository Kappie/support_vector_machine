And lo and behold I run into her there... but she was so uninterested in me, I reckoned, fuck you bitch.   Hey you know what they say though... if you haven't got anything nice to say... get yourself a publisher ;-)  So for the rest of the night I park off and enjoy having a number of frosties.  Still perving over her whenever she was in sight, but otherwise not making too much of a fuss over it. I thought she was drop dead gorgeous last weekend... She still is, but she's a bit of a bitch, and I'm not the only one who thinks this. A number of guys at the pub know about her and reckon the thought of her is ten times better than the reality. After tonight, I'm inclined to agree.  You know what? How can I be such a judgemental prick? I mean I barely know this chick. I don't know her actually. So for me to be so overly judgemental of her is rather idiotic. I mean, seriously... I spose I'll forgive myself for this one outburst at some stage... I have had a few frosties after all :-P  The best thing about tonight is I realized that my friends over here have numbers for my shag two nights ago and the blonde I'm interested in. So, perhaps, tomorrow, depending on how I feel, I may utilize this and actually phone the blondie and see if she would have lunch with me or something :-P  Other than that, I ain't gonna make to much effort to get into her pants... Don't think its worth it. Although, she is fucking gorgeous!! And having a single night with her would be well worth it I reckon. I don't need a relationship with the chick, just a good shag!  So, tomorrow I phone the lovely little shag I had the other night to see if she's keen for another showing... and the incredible drop dead gorgeous blonde...  One can only hope that something happens with one of them :-P Otherwise, I might have to go hunting for talent again... which is not a bad thing... but I'm running out of money to buy drinks, which really sux ass! Anyway, besides the point.  Had a few beers tonight, so this post may seem a bit arb, but hey, I love writing to this thing, even when I'm slightly inebriated ;-)  Till later. Me.
