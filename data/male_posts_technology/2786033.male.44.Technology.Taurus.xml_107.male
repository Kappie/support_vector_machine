We'd all like to hang out downtown at the elite coffee shop all day long, getting rich in the background. Unfortunately, sometime someone has to get off the Friends couch and WORK, otherwise nothing gets done. If there is a theme I hope to write along when talking about left-wing idiots, it's that their vain attempt to be hip supersedes their ability to make logical decisions based on previous results. That said, it's important to also remember the popular saying, "Past performance is no guarantee of future results." Gee, I'm starting to sound like a logical independent.     Newman took off on his fiscal policies, saying, "I think that tax cuts for worried, wealthy thugs like me are borderline criminal," and the notion they produce trickle-down benefits for the poor is "rubbish."   Hillary's income redistribution will work so much better than trickle-down theory, I'm sure. Hey Paul, I know you are a champion of charity, and I applaud you for that. But if that wealth-induced guilt is too much for ya, perhaps what would work much better than the money-sucking government programs who help no one would be a private assistance society (read: Hull House.) Be a Jane Addams philanthropist. Remember, regime change begins at home. (Man, I hate threadbares.)  Update: mmmK,  urlLink someone did this better than me . Goldberg is a decent actress IMO, but she's not funny, as pointed out by Ace Of Spades. But I beat him/her to the HW squares ref (I think).
