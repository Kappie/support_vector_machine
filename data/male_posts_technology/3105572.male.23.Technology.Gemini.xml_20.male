It's how you choose to deal with anger that makes all the difference.  So next time you get really angry will you punch the wall, yell at someone or something, possibly swear, or will you try your hardest to cool down and make the best out of a bad situation.  Always look for the path that Jesus would take.  When he got mad at the Pharasies in this passage ... he healed someone ... he didn't hurt anyone.  We should try to do the same.
