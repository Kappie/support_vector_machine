"Take a real life example, its not that hard to understand the concept !  if you want to describe objects, you can consider yourself as an object under the class of humans...if i am to explain it in detail i`d have to take a short leave from office  let me give a very brief description, based on the class 'Human'   CLASSES  All people you and me can come under the class of humans. example -> HUMAN   OBJECTS  an instance (or a copy) of the human 'class'.. example -> YOU   PROPERTIES  The attributes you have in order to define (express) yourself... example -> your name, your hair color, your skin color, your height...   METHODS  what you can do (in other words 'actions') example -> eat, sleep, speak...  This is the shortest way I can describe objects and classes..."  and I think anyone can take this in a gulp.
