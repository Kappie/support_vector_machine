Perhaps by saying I have reformatted 5 times will make you understand why I have not had the time to blog. I was almost tempted to get the old GT500 back up on the internet by nicking the modem from Veyron. Ah well, Veyron is now fully functional..... I think.   Jono's Blog  Jono's blog is like a cat. It has nine lives. He can start it up NINE times.   Person of the Week  This week, I have a couple as people of the week. Simon and Anne Camp are my people of the week. They have been running a series at C.I.A youth on "Preparing for Intimate Relationships." It's great to see people serving young people by sharing their wisdom with them. They have put so much work into what they are doing, and it really shows.    The Bible  This quote comes from the front of the little Bibles they hand out at university, and is very good.   The Bible contains the mind of God, the state of man, the way of salvation, the doom of sinners, and the happiness of believers. Its doctrines are holy, its precepts are true, and its decisions are immutable. Read it to be wise, believe it to be safe, and practice it to be holy. It contains light to direct you, food to support you, and comfort to cheer you.  It is the traveller's map, the pilgrim’s staff, the pilot’s compass, the soldier’s sword, and the Christian’s charter. Here Paradise is restored, Heaven opened, and the gates of hell disclosed.  Christ is its grand subject, our good the design, and the glory of God its end.  It should fill the memory, rule the heart, and guide the feet. Read it slowly, frequently, and prayerfully. It is a mine of wealth, a paradise of glory, and a river of pleasure. It is given you in life, will be opened at the judgement, and will be remembered forever. It involves the highest responsibility, will reward the greatest labour, and will condemn all who trifle with its sacred contents .   Encouragement  My goal this week, is to be more encouraging to those whom I meet. Encouragement is so important. I encourage you all to encourage your pastors and elders.
