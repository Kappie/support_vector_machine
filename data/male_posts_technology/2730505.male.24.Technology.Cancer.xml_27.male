Well I guess if you guys ever see on the news that Fermi Lab just blew up it was nice knowing ya.  You know the former Network Manager of that place, Roger Fahnstock, was the one who taught me Novell Networks at DeVry.  I am not sure where he went but I guess they're pretty clueless without him at the helm.
