And where do i end up in Amcorp Mall where i am handing up my last document for the graduate training scheme and hopefully i can get it.  I went and get myself a paper and guess what ...the newspaper vendor cheated me of my RM1.20 of my Intech my favourite pullout and usually the rest of the paper doesn't matter.  downloading the latest album and my heart and spirit longs for the Passion : Sacred Revolution album that is coming ....ahh well,. tonight's prayer meeting and leader's meeting will continue to satisfy my inner hunger to worship the Lord .
