However, I no longer believe in it. I believe that we make the love. We can create and destroy the love. There is no 1 person you must find. No predestination, Bill Gates was not predestined for the power he has. He took it.  hmm... sorry, got a little off track. I think that you can love multiple people. There are people that I will forever love, they have taken part of my heart with them. (I think there are 5 girls, but maybe only 4, i forget the exact count and I try not to think of them) I think no matter who you love, there will always be work involved in the relationship sometime or another. I mean you can't be in "love" forever, but you can love someone forever. Do you even understand what I'm saying?  Anyway, Harry potter was awesome, followed the book extremely well. "But I've never even been to Mars"
