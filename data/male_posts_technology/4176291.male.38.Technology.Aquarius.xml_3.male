What if what we believed in so dearly, in this case democracy, turned out to be nothing more than an elaborate hoax? Most, I believe, are naturally unwilling to let go of their grip on hope. It is just as unnatural to let go of your belief in a system or way of life. It is easier to live the fullness of the lie than to face the bleakness of reality. With the lie you have something to believe in. And with the lie, you continue to feed the machine. Just because they tell you that you have democracy does not make it so. Simply putting two names on a ballot does not give you a choice. If both names answer to the same master, was there really a choice? I have not lost all hope. While I no longer believe that the left is better than the right, or that they are even different, I do retain the hope that the American people will pull their collective heads out of their asses, because they have taken democracy for granted for far too long. If you have not read George Orwell's 1984, please do.
