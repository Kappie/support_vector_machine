 I've been getting a little lax with this blog.  Today and yesterday my computer has been off, so I haven't been able to simply walk up to it and enter a post. 

 I'm not even sure what food I've eaten so far today.  I'm tired, and my body is still very sore from training on Wednesday. I need more protein and more water.
