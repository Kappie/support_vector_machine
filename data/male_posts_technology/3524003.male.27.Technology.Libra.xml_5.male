Have been awake for almost 24hrs..hopefully can stay awake for classes later in the afternoon. What a bummer.. attending lessons on a Saturday, and at a time slot at 2pm~5pm.. that sucx!! Taking away my time to spend it with my girlfriend. Have to attend a wedding dinner later too, and I can get to see my girl dress up again. Have to take a picture this time round!!! Going through the links that she has sent me, making the best selection out of all the info that we can lay our hands on.Have to also figure out how to place pics into this website as well, hope is not too difficult for me to figure out...well guys n gals, if u can see pics in the next few days, that, means I have succeded. If not, well, you dun get to see it then
