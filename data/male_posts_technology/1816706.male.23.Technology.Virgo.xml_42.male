It's a 3 bedroom duplex, nothing special, close to work, and close to the highway to my favorite beach.  Yesterday I passed my upgrade exam for my MCSA (Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator) under Windows 2003.  Also, I've been taking some Japanese classes, those have been interesting.  Rest of the time, just been hanging out at the beach, most of the time, Lanaki beach.  It's pretty bad ass.
