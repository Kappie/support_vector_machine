On Monday, my mom took Gwen and me to the library to get some books for a small report due on Tues. on the way back home, we stopped at several animal hospitals to post lost cat signs - one of our two cats has been gone for a week. :(  Afterward, we stopped at Subway to grab some... well subs. (lol) Oh, haha the couple times we had gotten into the car before Subway, my mom kept reminding me to open the door for Gwen... trouble was, I wasn't sure where she wanted to sit, so I opened the wrong door. :) Then, when my mom drove up to the Subway to pick us up, I looked at Gwen and marched up to the door acting all *pompous* and *gentlemen-like*, and the door was locked! (She was still laughing about that at lunch this afternoon. ;)  Youth group was fun last night. Jamie was there! - First time I've seen her in almost a year:)... now if we could only get Bwitty back... (Lol)  o.O Gwen was there too finally :):) I did the overheads for worship, and the laptop kept freezing up! So annoying... 'Ne way, the Senior High youth leaders were gone on vacation, so my small group leader taught. It was basically an open forum for discussing topics that he brought up. After youth group, we stopped at Arbies on the way back home. My mom stayed in the car, and Gwen and I went in to buy milkshakes... dang the guy behind the counter was really tired. :) Interesting experience.  I'm talking to our SBP, Jason at the other end of the room... he's been living a really fast paced schedule  this school year.  Btw, my cable modem is screwed up, so I won't post anything for a little while except from school.
