We talked for a couple of hours, catching up and shit.  It was nice.  I don't know if these feelings are real or just flare ups of just missing someone being there for you.  It actually all started when I found more old shit that we used to write each other.  Old love letters old notes when we were in class.  It was cute.  I sounded like a complete idiot but so did she.  So many letters full of such sappiness.  At one point I couldn't help but bust out laughing out loud because of the ridiculous shit that we used to call each other and write each other.  I also found some of her old art work that I actually kept.  She's an artist.  I don't think that she has made anything new as of late but I kept a lot of her old shit.  I guess she's not with anyone right now.  Her and her ex-boyfriend still live together and I don't know how I feel about that but at least I know that they sleep in separate rooms.  She lost her job and her car is in dire need of repair.  She moved out of the shitty apartment in the middle of a shitty neighborhood and moved to the next town over and now lives in a townhouse with three other people (ex-boyfriend (Jack), best friend and best friend's boyfriend (Courtney and Joe?).  I'm sorry to say but I could really give a rat's ass about the rest of those people.  She's still pretty ghetto.  She still likes to portray herself as some sort of hardass that no one should fuck with but I know her better.  She's still a fucking softie.  There was some light flirtation here and there but no serious getting back together talk.  I really don't know where this is going to go.  I have no idea what her intentions are and frankly, I have no idea what my intentions are/were.  I guess I just missed her.  I don't know, I'm so confused.  On one side I want to be a family.  A real family with Bryce and her.  Do the whole being poor while young thing.  I would really give up my entire social life if I could be happy as a family.  On the other hand, I don't know if she has changed.  If she has grown up.  I don't know if she wants to work for shit now because she didn't.  It was a nasty break up and we were both at fault for that.  We were young back then.  When we fought, hurtful things were said that can never be taken back.  I guess we each held the other person on a higher standard but when that person didn't quite live up to that expectation both parties were equally frustrated with each other.  I don't know what the hell is going on.
