Cochran Jr. who is saying Saddam was tortured during what our government has previously referred to as questioning.  Now while that comes as good news to most everyone who ever had to suffer under this evil bastard it may turn the political tide in his favor. I guess according to Saddam supporters US agents being pushy during questioning and depriving an evil dictator, who has murdered hundreds of thousands of his own people, of sleep is now torture. However, the well documented torture and slaughter of Nick Berg was what -- Free speech?  Somebody please shoot this SOB now and make it look like an accident so we donâ€™t have to go through this farce.
