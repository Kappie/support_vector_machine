On the way back home, I was nodding off while standing on the MRT. Got some weird looks from people too.  Got back and went straight to bed. Slep for over 3 hrs. Got up and redied myself to go back to camp. We had book in by 6pm coz of the Army Half Marathon the next day. They wanted to ensure we had enought water and sleep the day before the run.  On Sun, we all got up around 230am. I was tossing and turning around 0055am. Probably becoz I wasn't used to sleeping in a new environment yet, or becoz I had gone to bed so early (730pm). Took a 5 tonner to Division camp. The 5 tonner is like a truck with little/no suspension system. But becoz of the time, everyone learned to enjoy and sleep on the ride despite the bumps on the road.  We had breakfast in with Division and departed for Kallang Indoor Stadium which happened to be the start and end point.  The competitive runners started at about 0545hrs whilst the non-competitive ones started at 0600hrs. I was in the latter. I paced myself with a fellow campmate, Chan Kai Chong. The pace was comfortable for me and we made it through the first 10km rather easily. After that, Chan started feeling uncomfortable with his ankles and I kept on encouraging him forward. Throughout the whole run I was considering if I should leave him and just proceed on my own instead. But I convinced myself that it was pointless. I think the run meant more if I could see him through the remainder of the run. Towards the last 2km, Chan stopped more than a few times and I had to slow down with him. Partly to make him know that I wasn't goin to leave and that I'd be foregoing my timing if he chose to give up and juz walk.  We both completed the run in 2hrs 35 min, that was just 5 min faster than the timing I had 3 yrs ago. I wasn't exactly satisfied with this but I felt a wee bit consoled that at the very least I did the right thing by completing it with Chan. From another point of view, it was probably Chan who helped me maintain my pace. If I ran alone, I might've overburned myself somewhere in the run and not complete the whole distance. All that's left is to better my timing and test myself again next year.  At least at the end of this event, I know where I stand. There's room for more improvement and I have 12 mths to do it. Ideally I'd like to complete under 2 hrs but let's just take a few mins at a time.
