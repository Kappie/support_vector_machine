Today she wanted to hang up after I told her I was running errands.  I did tell her that a lot of people have told me how they miss her.  She said who daddy and I told her that Rick and Alan and his wife and their kids Jack and Kelsey miss her and she says "are they crying?"   I simply said no they are not crying they just miss having fun with you.  She simply said can I go now.     I asked for hugs and kisses and let her go!  Other then that today was pretty normal.  I did ride my bicycle to work but that was nothing special it was the first time I did it about 8 miles.
