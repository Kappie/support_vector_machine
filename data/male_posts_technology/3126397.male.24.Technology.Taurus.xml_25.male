I start with a packet of fajita seasoning, mix it with some oil and a little water, and then put a sliced up steak in this mixture to soak. Meanwhile I slice up tomatoes, a jalapeño, a big onion and lots of peppers (green, yellow or red).  I start the onion and jalapeño frying first so that their taste will be less strong, and then add the peppers.  Once these have cooked for a bit I add the meat and tomatoes.  It is best to add the meat later so that it doesn't get overcooked.  Finally I put the mushrooms on, and when they look done it is ready to eat!
