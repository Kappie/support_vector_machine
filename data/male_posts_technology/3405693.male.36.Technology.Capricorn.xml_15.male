A huge part of getting the mind into good health includes getting the body into good health.  So I'm going back on a workout regimen.  For years and years I was quite serious about fitness in general, and body building specifically.  I was never aiming to be a competitive muscle head or anything, but I thoroughly enjoyed a good sweat at the gym and pumping a bit of iron.  I hurt my shoulder on an inclined bench press, and just never got back into it again after that.  So now it's time to start that up again.  I'm about 15 pounds overweight right now, and completely weak.  So it's back to a gym mentality for me.  Perhaps yoga too, eventually; Sylvie loves yoga and maybe it's something we can do together.  Of course I got to get a bit of dough before I can do that.  But the Gym rat thing I can do, as I have a membership I've never cancelled.  Today, once I finish this post, I'm going to go start my laundry and then head down to the gym.  I'm going to spend 40 minutes on a cardio machine and then do the little circuit training dealio.  I won't push it too hard, as I don't want to just make myself extremely sore for tomorrow, but I will try and get a good sweat on and maybe move some muscles other than my jaw for a bit.  I will then do a good 20 minute stretch and walk back home.  I'll post on here after about how I did.  Tomorrow, I will do the same thing, and then Wednesday, Thursday I work.  Next Monday I start my new job on Monday, so I'm going to get up early and go to the gym before hand.  And Tuesday and Wednesday.  After that point I will endeavor to go to the gym before work every Monday Tuesday and Wednesday.  I will leave Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday for the time being.  If I can get in that habit for 3 days a week, it can only be a good thing.  We'll see...
