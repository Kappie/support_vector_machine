I told him my idea of a great tattoo I plan on getting.  He agreed and both of us are going to a tattoo parlor soon to get some great tattoos.  Here is what I am going to get, you never see anyone with this. A "three day old shiner (blackeye)"  As the blackeye heals, its turns yellowish, purple, some green, red and of course, black.  I am going to get a perfect "black eye" and also, I want a mole.  The same one "Kitty" has from gunsmoke.  I can make up different stories each time someone asks "hey, where did you get that shiner! Been to any bars lately ?"  I purposed for Mr. P, stitches.  In his case, since he has short hair, stitches circling the top of his head starting at the forehead.  When people ask, he can say he had a brain transplant.  He also wants a bloody nose.  You would be amazed at how people will fall for this...with the state of our educational system and all...  I gotta write some code now...
