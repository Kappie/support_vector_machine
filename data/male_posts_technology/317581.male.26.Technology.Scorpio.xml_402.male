On that note, I tried to go to  urlLink justbecause.com  tonight and was disappointed to see that it was either a) not functioning or b) my silly internet provider was acting up again. Either way, I'd like to see something there. I think it's supposed to be a flower shop, but I'm not sure.  Also, I've been out of work now for about 3 or 4 weeks. I had/have a "on call" job, but they aren't calling. So I'm thinking of giving plasma. They'll give me 125 for 4 visits. that's 2 weeks worth of plasma giving and I get 125 bucks.  That would decrease the need for me to call my parents every few weeks to bail me out. Which I HATE doing. It's not that they don't help me, it just seems that at this point in my life I should have a stable enough income that I shouldn't have to ask my parents for anything..  Anyway, I'm going home for thanksgiving. If you're reading this and would like me to maybe update a little more regularly, you can send me an email  urlLink here   Peace- T
