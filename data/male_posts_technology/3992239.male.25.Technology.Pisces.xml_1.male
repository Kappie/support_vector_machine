What's the deal with Angelo De La Cruz' beheadingand why did President Arroyo do a complete policy turn-around at the risk of loss of face?       urlLink Arroyo defiant over US criticism of Philippine troop pullout      The name "Angelo De La Cruz" resembles the character in Filipino society that represents the average Filipino. Americans have Joe, or Uncle Sam to represent them, we Filipinos have our Juan De la Cruz.    To me, the modern Juan de la Cruz has many stereotypes. There are three that comes to mind:       He is either underemployed or unemployed in his own country despite having a degree.    He is one of the 2,000 Filipinos who leave every day to find work overseasin mainly blue collar jobs to support a family he will not see grow.     He is immigrating his whole family to another country and embracing a different citizenship, cutting his roots and ties from home.     Angelo De la Cruz fits the second stereotype to a T. He represents the one group that has sustained the Philippine economy for the last two decades.   Heis an Overseas-Filipino-Worker (OFW), and there are 8-million of them supporting extended families here in the Philippines.   For Filipinos, real war heroes are OFWs and not soldiers. They represent fathers andmothers, uncles and aunts,sisters andbrothers,sons and daughters. They are not with us but we talk of them on every family occasion, where they are, the hardships they endure, and the familiar"if only I could be in their shoes" spiels.    Mr Angelo De la Cruz is Juan de la Cruz.Try seeing your favorite real-life superhero in chains and at gunpoint, you'll get the picture why the Filipinos connect with his fate while other would see "just" collateral damage. Craven as it may seem, President Arroyo cannot afford it.
