 First -- Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. Howard Stern's Private Parts meets Beautiful Mind. I didn't know what it is about, which is good, that's how i love my movies -- surprising. 
 The second was  urlLink Matchstick Men  whichs was also a good surprise. A little more than an average Hollywood sympathetic con-artist movie. The welcome bonuses include the very charming Alison Lohman, and some great acting by Nicolas Cage, who takes a few hints from  urlLink Monk . Very much a Hollywood movie though, but good fun.
