One of the things I've noticed is that work is getting more and more unbareable. I got about a week and a half left at this point. As such, I've noticed that more and more work has not come my way. Now granted, this isn't necesarrily a bad thing. Slacking off is a skilled artform and it's good to get lots of practice if one intends to master the ways. But damnit if it isn't boring as hell most times. The short-timer in me doesn't want to do what little work I have to do right now and management doesn't want to give me anything that'll take more than a day or so to get done. So I'm stuck cruising websites I've been to a dozen times in the past hour and leaking my thoughts onto this weblog thing. It's almost gotten to the point that I hope something happens at work that'll make the time fly by faster, but it never works out that way, does it? It's like hoping there's a cop nearby to see the idiot cutting you off doing 90 mph in a residential area but can only seem to catch one eyeing you as you go 1 mph over the speed limit and on go the lights and up goes your insurance rates. I got a feeling god was a stand-up comic in another life and is playing out all his/her/it's jokes now and is (literally) rofl'ing all the time at our expense.  Oh yeah, before I forget. I didn't have to go to NY for work so that's a good thing. And all the rain stopped after everyone started complaining that "It's raining too much". Only bad part is that I got stuck covering the shift for the person who did go to NY (late shift). Not a bad trade off. Would rather get home late than fight traffic getting to the train station, people on the train, people at Penn Station in NY, people on the streets of NY, techs who resent me in our buildings in NY, users who want everything fixed "NOW!!!", and then doing it all in reverse at the end of the day.  Subnote #5539 - Just got an email from the CIO about some people in my department who have "officially" been promoted. And from what I'm told by my direct supervisor, the positions they got promoted to were magically created for them since they didn't exist before the announcement was made. Now. The thing that's funny about this is related to the promise they made me to promote me after relocating here last year. 'member how I said they shafted me on that? Well, the big reason why they said "We're not able to promote you at this time." was that there was no actual position where I wanted to be moved to. But somehow or another, they apparently found 3-4 new positions just lying around for these people to move into. Maybe I should open up my own shop so I can promote myself whenever I feel like it.
