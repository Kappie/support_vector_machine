The most hyped author of the last decade, JK Rowling, beats all her contemporaries with four placings. Her hero's original outing, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, did the best, at number 13.  There are four Jane Austen books listed, three in the top 10, and Austen also achieved a unique literary twinning, sharing 23rd place for Sense and Sensibility with Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones's Diary.  Virginia Woolf and George Eliot each have three books on the list, and Iris Murdoch two.
