Link to resource for the posts from:      Grady Booch  Software architecture, software engineering, and Renaissance Jazz Grady has served as architect and architectural mentor for numerous complex software-intensive systems around the world in just about every domain imaginable. Grady is the author of six best-selling books and has published several hundred articles on software engineering, including papers published in the early '80s that originated the term and practice of object-oriented design. At random times, the laws of physics do not apply to him. He is not dead yet.      Simon Johnston  Service Oriented Architecture and Business-Level Tooling  Simon works in the CTO organization of Rational Software and is responsible for the business-level tooling strategy. Simon has undertaken a number of standards-related activities for both Rational Software and now IBM in the area of XML (W3C Schema working group), Web Services (RosettaNet architecture team) and Modeling (OMG UML and OCL teams). Simon has also written articles on the subjects of business modeling, software modeling and SOA and is interested to see where and when these threads will combine.      Michael O'Connell  Supporting development on demand: Open, cross-platform standards Michael O'Connell is the founding Editor-in-chief and editorial director of IBM's developerWorks site, which launched in 1999. Before joining developerWorks, he served as founding Editor-in-chief of IDG's JavaWorld and a founding editor of SunWorld Online -- two of the industry's first successful Web-based technology magazines. He's been a computer journalist since 1991.      James Snell  The Practical Application of Emerging Technologies James Snell is a member of the IBM Emerging Technologies Group focusing on the architecture and prototyping of pre-emerging software technologies and standards. He is currently a member of the Emerging Technologies Toolkit development team and has made significant direct and indirect contributions to nearly every aspect of IBM's Web services and Service Oriented Architecture strategy as well as serving as a strong advocate for the practical application of key emerging technologies within and across IBM's own lines of business.      Doug Tidwell  A technology evangelist's job: To compellingly trivialize the complex. Doug Tidwell works for IBM's University Relations group, where he is actually paid to give away education and software to students and professors around the world. He's also the content coordinator for IBM's Speed-Start Web Services events, coming soon to a continent near you. A living testament to the power of inertia, he has been with IBM since 1989. He lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina with his wife, cooking teacher Sheri Castle, and their nine-year old daughter Lily. He is the author of XSLT and a co-author of Programming Web Services with SOAP, both of which make great gifts for your friends and loved ones.
