Why did I suddenly think of her?  Because of the Presidential Elections.  She always said that she was going to be the first Female President of the United States.  She said the only thing that would stop her is if some other woman got voted in before she became of legal age.  I believed her.  If I ever find out that she is running, I'm going to vote for her.  I don't even know what party she is associated with.  But back in the 7th grade, I believed her.  I believed that she really would be President some day.  She was smart.  She had personality.  She had a a good heart.  That most of all is what I want in a president.  Smart and good-hearted.  Bush doesn't have either one.  If she still has those qualities, I would still vote for her.  In all actuallity, she probably doesn't want to be President anymore.  No doubt age and experience have left her jaded to the concept of Politics.  Changing the world is probably not on her agenda.  She may even have a kid or two by now that take up her entire life.  But if she ever ran, I would vote for her.  I've never voted before, and I don't plan to vote this year, but for her, I would.  Because I believe that she would be a good president.  Thats all.
