Good to see him back on his paws so quickly...  I also got some antibiotics to help with this damn cough... don't know what it'll do about next weeks operation.  Today has therefore been spent tired and worried, and lately, utterly paranoid.  Mainly regarding this new virus doing the rounds, but Pc use in general.  I need a better Os, or something.  I got round to watching the rest of the first  Visionaries  DVD.  I have to say I'm impressed.  The series had a reasonable storyline with a tiny bit of continuity, and interesting characters.  Well, the bad guys were interesting, as they possessed personality traits... the good guys are all alike.  I also watched a documentary about bionic limbs.  Freaky, but the science is evolving.  I only hope they can develop it more in my lifetime.  The "bionic eye" was truely freaky... as it necessitated implants in the brain.  Ouch!
