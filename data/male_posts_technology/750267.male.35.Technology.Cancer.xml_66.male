My favorite TV clip from the past couple of days, the scene of three or four Iraqis pushing a cart full of stolen goods past American troops at a checkpoint of some sort, waving at the troops in joyful happiness... and the troops waving back. Yes, the sweet taste of freedom... being able to steal whatever you can carry, and burn whatever you cannot.  The saddest thing I saw was a scene of the empty Iraqi Museum, which used to contain artifacts from 5,000 years of human civilization. Heartbreaking. That treasure didn't just belong to Saddam Hussein. It didn't just belong to the Iraqi people. The treasure in that museum belongs to the whole world. A quote from CNN... "Here we see some ancient pottery that survived 5,000 years... until yesterday." Ugh.  Anyways, I'm tired of thinking about it.
