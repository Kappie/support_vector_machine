I e-mailed back with my arguments and they chose not to respond to them.  Supporting the construction of Israel's security wall is a step in the wrong direction if there is ever to be peace between the Israeli and Palestinian people. The wall violates international and humanitarian law and has already been condemned by the United Nations. The path of the wall goes beyond Israel's borders, cutting off the most fertile land from the Palestinian farmers. This has robbed them of their Livelihood and ability to take care of their families. They are forced to go through security checkpoints if they are even granted the documents to do so, which in many cases they have not been given to the farmers that need them. Even with the documents they are forced to wait for hours before they are even let through and may end up not gaining access at all. The precepts of democracy demand that we condemn land expropriations, home demolitions, illegal arrests, beatings, torture and the continued Israeli defiance of UN resolutions, the flouting of the Geneva Convention; and decades of legal and social discrimination against the Arab population. The UN and World Bank have issued reports about the rampant malnourishment and the epidemic of anemia in the territories caused by the strangling of Palestinian society by the Israeli Occupation Forces.
