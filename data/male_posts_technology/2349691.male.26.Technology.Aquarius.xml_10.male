The first time the issue was discussed was when the  Patriot  came back after a 3 month stay in his "homeland". He threw a party, as usual, in our house. The party was well attended, again, as usual. The  Wild M an, the  Patriot  (of course), the  Bike-Push , the  Perpetual Whiner ,  District Committee ,  Fear Factor , all attended. The  Bike-Push  argued with great effort, the futility of attending friends' marriages (in general). The reason laid down was, the married guys no longer come to our bachelor dens etc. Seemed like a lame reason to me. Dunno. The arguments got heated and finally I requested a vote. Everybody except Bike-Push voted an emphatic "Yes, I will attend the marriage".  The day fast approaching,  Perpetual Whiner , telephoned me saying he will not be able to attend. Same was the case with  Distict Committee . To cut a long story short, the final head count came down to 4. Fear Factor, Patriot, Wild Man and I.  Wild Man  suggested travelling by his car and we agreed.  The day dawned and the  Patriot  who had made such big noises against Bike-push on the day of the argument started balking. The reason : (Brace yourself) His girlfriend told him not to go.  Heart-broken at the fact that our dear friend, ditched us for a girl and more heart-broken at the fact that, we didn't have a girlfriend like that (so that we could have ditched him some time in the future), the three of us,  Wild Man ,  Fear Factor  and I, set off to see the last bachelor day of a dear friend.
