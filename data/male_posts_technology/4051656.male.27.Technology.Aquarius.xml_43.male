They're saying that there may be some microbial life evidenced by the way the surface reacted when the landers' airbags retracted.    Why the soil reacted in such a manner remains obscure, McKay admits. "But one possibility is that this is the fossilized remains of a biological mat of some sort," he speculated. The mat would be made up of bacterial parts and pieces.  That claim can't be proven at this point, McKay said. "That's one reason you have to go get samples to be sure."   Not little green men, but still really exciting.
