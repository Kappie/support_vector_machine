It is run off the same software as  urlLink Slashdot  (called  urlLink Slash , created by the Slashdot kids), but looks much better.  The design is truly meaningless since the content is what keeps me coming back day to day.  Instead of the pure tech content of Slashdot, it seems more like a intelligent and logical version of  Salon .  The topics are just broad enough.  My only hope is that more people find this great site and use the comment system.
