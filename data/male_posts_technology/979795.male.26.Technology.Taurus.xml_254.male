For today, will be settling stuff in Uni and taking a day trip out to Chester (where's dat? no idea).  Past week of tour was quite crappy.  Went Leeds coz my dad had to meet a business associate. It was damn paiseh when my dad actually asked them if they may have a job for me. Wah lao ... seriously leh, dun wann do IT job liao and they're like forcing me towards that direction. But heng lah, they dun sound too negative at all towards a career with the Police Force. Think when I get back I can apply immediately for real by going down to the recruitment office personally.  I hr drive away is York. Quite nice. We stayed there overnight. My dad was quite pissed with the Hostel. Actually went into a bit of tantrum for a bit. Can't stand it. Argh!!  Next day went down to Edinburgh. Wasn't bad. Went Glasgow as well. Spent 3 days in Scotland. Quite nice. they got a lot of nice museums which were free and they were actually really interesting.  Went down south to the Lake district. The worst day here! Mom insisted on diverting here and there to see this and that and we had to drive in the country roads when it got quite dark. Considering there's more daytime in summer, you can tell it was already about 10+ when we lost daylight. Kept telling her we won't be able to get to the accoms with enough light to spare but she wouldn't listen. She seems to be on this marathon where she juz want to hit the entrance of this or that spot, take fotos of the entrance (coz she dun wanna pay entry fee and go in) and ciao off to th next place. Wah lao!!! Dad didn't help either. He's basically the type who expects standards in things but coz of the cheap and budget rate my mom is able/willing to fork out, we dun see or do much. So he's always complaining about things like staying in Hostel lah, no privacy lah, low class lah ete etc. I mean c'mon man, we're in a hostel dorm, if u wan that kind of standard, jolly well check into a hotel if you can afford it lor. ARGH!!!  There's actually a lot of things to do and see in Lake District area. It's a national park but they dun suit the older folks like them. And they refuse to go for walks and treks coz they feel they 'can't take it even thought those are simple ones. Argh!!! I can't go do any water sports coz of bad weather and budget. Argh!!!  Damn weather was poor since Tues too! Argh!!  Yesterday must be the best day. We were leaving Lake District area and we stopped at this cheap factory outlet spot. The moment my mom stepped out her shoes broke. Heng heng we found a Clarks factory outlet. Went in and bought 6 pairs for £89 (think is about S$200+). Was damn worth for 6 pairs. There was Buy 1 get 1 free, buy 1 get 2nd for £12, buy 1 get 2nd for £5, and some other shoes which were going cheap. Plus, the range was a lot more than I expected. I got myself 2 pair, my dad got 1 pair, my mom/sis got 2-3 pairs since they sometimes shared shoes. I suspect this may be the highest point of my trip liao. Well, unless my housemate Annie is able to pop by next week for a visit, then that'd probably be the highest point of my trips. But then again, with my folks around ... I think I'll still be in a sian mood. Siaaaanz ... argh!!
