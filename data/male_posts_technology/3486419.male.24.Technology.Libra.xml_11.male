Mozilla Firefox  -Sweet!  2. Netscape 7.1  - Sweet!  3.I.E 6  - All Screwed up, haywired!garang gabok!Senggek!Apa?  I tried to edit the html both in IE, and in firefox and netscape, only IE poses the problem. Again i would like to highlight the _dominance_  of dear _M$_ in the browser industry. Watching Jerry Springer now, walau.Very happening...Woaaaah!GOing to resume studying later.  That's it.
