I know that girls in general have this reputation of getting all emotional and think that their boyfriends "should be able to tell/know what is bothering them" or whatever. Is that what you mean by crazy? I think it's just that you just don't understand how we think. Or maybe you do understand how we think and you think it is "crazy." I know a guy (I won't mention any names, and no, it's not you Tim or Cahlen) that discounts anything I say when I'm a little upset because he thinks I'm making too big a deal out of such an unimportant issue... most often he asks if it's "that time of the month," as if that could discount the validity of what I'm saying to him. I have no idea whether or not any of this is making any sense to you who happen to be reading this blogg. Maybe I am just crazy. Or maybe it's just time to go to bed.
