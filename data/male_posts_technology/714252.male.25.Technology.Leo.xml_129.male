I have taken 4 pain killers in the last half hour but still my head feels like it is stuck in a vice and someone is squeezing..  Last night was great fun though.. Bubbles missed the Raga! HeHeHe.. Caught up with a mate I haven't heard from in MONTHS and got to get my funky groove thing on at last!  Will write more when the pounding subsides (I am a heavy typist and the sound is KILLING me)
