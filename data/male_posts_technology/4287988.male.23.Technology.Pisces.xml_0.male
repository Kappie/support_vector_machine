I don't really plan on anybody reading this but who knows. All right seeing as how nobody knows me and this is my first posting I guess I should give you a little background infor on my self. Well to start I am engaged to a beautiful girl named Jaime. We are engaged to be married on June 18th of 2005 and when we are married I will have two step-kids, Jimmie who is 6 and Lexeigh who is 3 who I treat like they we're my own kids. I work for the wonderful ISP earthlink as a technical support agent. Pretty much when someone has something wrong with their computer they call me up and I get it working again. When I'm not working there I am running my own home based business right now. If anybody is even interested click this link to visit the website for my business  urlLink CompRenovations . I just started that so if anybody sees anything on there that needs to be changed or added let me know by sending me an email  urlLink here . Any ways, what else is there to tell about me? I just moved into a new house that we're renting. Jimmie is getting ready to start school. We enrolled him into a private school thats in the neighborhood. I don't know much about it though, I left that up to Jaime. Other than that theres not much left to tell except all the new drama thats in my life. I despise drama to let most of you know but it seems to find me lately. Take for instance the biggest drama in my life, Jaime's ex-husband. People this man has gotten away with stuff every single father would love to get away with. He sees the kids every other weekend, only pays $200 child support for two kids and thats total not per kid, and got Jaime's old car since we got her a new kia. I mean I know guys that would kill for this and yet he still complains about helping out with the kids. Then theres some other little drama but I try and stay out of that. My biggest problem though is Jaime's cell phone. I have never in my life been jealous of a cell phone until Jill, Jaime's friend, came into my life. I find myself constantly fighting for attention with this phone. Jill works with Jaime but still sees it necessary to call every half hour to talk with her. I know, I know, I sound like a big baby but I can't help it. Anyways I'm going to sign off for now and next time I post something I hope to have some neat stuff for you guys to look at.
