I have found creative ways to make myself look busy but there are only so many hours a person can spend at  urlLink Slashdot  and  urlLink fark .    Well, today was given an actual assignment.  It is something simple (rebulid a laptop), but is it  actual work .  Now that I have gotten a taste of doing actual work, I don't want to go back to having to kill time.  I would rather coat my ass in honey and sit down on a seething pile of fire ants;  I would rather swallow a towel;  I would rather pound nails into my dick.
