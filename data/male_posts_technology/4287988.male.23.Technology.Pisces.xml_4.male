Well after I got that done and a little bit of shopping done I went home and Jaime was home getting ready for tonight.  Well I told her I couldn't stay out that late cause the night before I didn't go to bed until 2:30am and had to get up for work at 5:00am and since I had taken somebody elses hours at work I couldn't stay out late again.  Well we came to the agreement that I would lay down and take a nap so if I did stay out late I wasn't so tired.  Well that didn't work either.  I fell asleep and woke up about 20 min. later to the dog barking at Jill, Jill's phone beeping, and Jaime blow drying her hair.  Anyways then I find out that Jill is over cause despite the fact that we don't have the money Jaime was going to get new shoes and Jill was going with her cause it was buy 1 get 1/2 off day.  Now for those of you that don't know me let me explain something.  I trust my fiance and never have a problem with her going to do whatever but I do NOT trust Jill.  Jill is single and I think that she treats Jaime like shes single.  She doesn't actually try to set Jaime up with other guys but she introduces her to all these single guys who are out to get a piece and they end up some how getting her phone number, not all guys just a select few... aka Will, and calling all the damn time.  Then you guys wonder why I hate Jaimes phone so much.  Well because of all this instead of staying home and taking my nap I went with them.  That was a mistake too.  I forgot how long it takes a woman to buy a pair of shoes.  By the time we finished it was time to get ready to go out.  Now pay attention people cause this is where it gets really interesting.  We got ready and picked up Jill from her house and then went to the bar.  Now even though I work there every once in a while I can't stand the place.  Its just not for me anymore.  When I was single it was one thing but a bar is not a place for a taken man/woman.  This is where some of my anger comes from.  You see just about every week we go some guy is hitting on my fiance and doesn't care that she is going to be married soon.  Well today that didn't happen but for some reason Jaime was getting upset every time I came around.  So I went out to the lobby of the hotel the bar belongs too.  Well it was pretty much like that the whole night and Jaime was in a mean and nasty mood.  I hate when she gets like that cause I'm not a mean person.  Well I kept my distance and then the real drama showed up.  Jill was crying because her kids were with her husband and he wouldn't let her talk to them so she was crying and upset and making a big scene.  See this is why its hard for me to fight for Jaime's attention with Jill.  Well since she was so upset she didn't stay the night as planned and we dropped her off at her house.  YEAH! I mean I hope things get better Jill.  Now heres the kicker.  Remember how my license is suspended well because Jaime and Jill like to drink till they can't drive guess who the DD is.  You got it, ME!  That was pretty much it after that I went home and passed out so I could get another three hours of sleep before I went into work.
