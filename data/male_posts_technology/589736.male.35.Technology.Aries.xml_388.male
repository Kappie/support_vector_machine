My guilty pleasures: Beastmaster, Charmed, Columbo, Hunter, In the Heat of the Night, Iron Chef, Kung Fu: The Legend Continues, Law  Order, The Lost World, Magnum PI, Matlock, Murder She Wrote, NYPD Blue, Simon  Simon, Walker Texas Ranger, and Witchblade. And Good Eats and Nero Wolfe, which I think are NOT guilty pleasures. I just really like them.
