Seat 1: asharooky ( $227)  Seat 2: Harley50 ( $106)  Seat 3: SirFWALGMan ( $98)  Seat 4: gordini ( $113)  Seat 5: crownjoolz ( $283)  Seat 6: eagle97 ( $177.50)    BTW - Put ashrooky on your list. He is not a bad player, but he does not respect a flush or straight on the board.    asharooky posts small blind (2)  Harley50 posts big blind (5)  ** Dealing down cards **  Dealt to SirFWALGMan [ Th, Qc ]  SirFWALGMan calls (5)  gordini calls (5)  eagle97 calls (5)  asharooky raises (8) to 10  Harley50 calls (5)  SirFWALGMan calls (5)  gordini calls (5)  eagle97 calls (5)  ** Dealing Flop ** : [ 7d, 8h, Qd ]    Ok. Not a bad flop for me. Got high pair. Ass-Rookie flopped a set.    asharooky bets (5)  Harley50 calls (5)  SirFWALGMan calls (5)  gordini calls (5)  eagle97 calls (5)  ** Dealing Turn ** : [ 9h ]    Ok. Straight possible. I guess I will bet. Probably kind of on a tilt.    asharooky bets (10)  Harley50 calls (10)  SirFWALGMan calls (10)  gordini calls (10)  eagle97 raises (20) to 20  asharooky raises (20) to 30  Harley50 folds.  SirFWALGMan calls (20)  gordini calls (20)  eagle97 raises (20) to 40  asharooky calls (10)  SirFWALGMan calls (10)  gordini calls (10)    ** Dealing River ** : [ 6c ]    Ok. The pot was REALLY huge and I figured I would see the river card. I *SHOULD* have never called the raises, but the money in the pot is aewsome. So I hit the runner-runner straight on the river. Now here is where the rest of the people made mistakes. BTW- I am scared of the higher straight, but I am commited now.    SirFWALGMan checks.  gordini checks.  eagle97 bets (10)  asharooky folds.  SirFWALGMan calls (10)  gordini calls (10)    ** Summary **Main Pot: $273 Rake: $2Board: [ 7d 8h Qd 9h 6c ]    SirFWALGMan balance $306, bet $65, collected $273, net +$208 [ Th Qc ]  [ a straight, six to ten -- Th,9h,8h,7d,6c ]    I have done this twice to people btw. Mostly when on tilt. I USUALLY play better than this. Anyway, sharing my shame, but my bankroll is up to $950 or so. Ya!   By the way does anyone know what You XXXXXing XXXX XXX XXXXX means?
