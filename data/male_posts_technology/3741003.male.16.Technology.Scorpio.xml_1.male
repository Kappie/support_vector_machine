Well, I'm trying to fix her computer, but it's beginning to look _-*BAD*-_ and I don't know if I can handle it. Reformatting sounds good....but drivers are nowhere to be found...kind of scares me. But anyhow...we went inside to watch the movie, and I ended up giving her a back and foot massage, which was fine. I thoroughly enjoy the time we spend together. It makes me happy that she cares about me.   Well it's late, I'd better be heading off to the dreamworld. Closed eyelids are an open portal.
