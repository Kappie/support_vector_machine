The city's official death rate has increased by 35 percent in the last five years. It reached 19 per 1000 in 2002, largely due to an increase in AIDS-related deaths in young adults. "This year we will bury about 20,000 people. In 2010, unless someone develops a cure for AIDS, we expect that figure to be 70,000," says Alan Buff, who is responsible for cemeteries at City Parks.
