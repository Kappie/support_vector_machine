Mark Twain   Goals  For those of you who don't know me, and couldn't tell I wasn't serious in my last post......I think goals/resolutions are a wonderful idea. Getting around to them is another thing. However when you've got Dad on your back like I did, they better be forthcoming. So I have come up with my list of goals for 2004.   My English teacher once wrote on an essay of mine "Say more with less". It was a great help. More delving, less froth. Less width more depth. Well that is a maxim that can be transferred from my writing to my life. Do less, but do it better. So this year I am cutting all the things I have been burdened with in the past year. I am refocusing on where I think God has called me, and I will put the time that I have gained (by cutting out other activities) doing a better job of the things I am doing.  Here is my goal list for 2004:-  Spiritual ·	I will read through a minimum of 12 good solid Christian books this year. ·	I will aim to read and study a book of the Bible per month. ·	Every month on the last day of the month I will crack open the old prayer box. Intellectual ·	I will aim to get a good understanding of Excel. Work ·	Work my hardest to God’s glory, not for men.  ·	I would like heaps of opportunities to share my faith, and I want to take the opportunities I get. Physical ·	At least once per week I will go for a walk of at least 30 minutes. Financial ·	I aim to add $x to my term deposit savings account. ·	I will keep an expenditure record to insure I stick to my financial plan for 2004. C.I.A. ·	This year I want to see the C.I.A touch team set up along with T’s and weekly practices. ·	Continue the relationship focus of C.I.A, but get to deeper levels with the young guys ·	I want to see C.I.A become a more servant focused group. ·	I want to see friends of the young people beginning to attend regularly. ·	This year I want to encourage young people to attend evening church. ·	To find two young people and begin to train them up for leadership. Other ·	I will continue writing my personal journal.   All attempted relying on God's grace.
