Maybe she feels the best way to deal with it is to ignore it.  Maybe she is right, and I am making too much out of it.    What if I did the same thing?  I had a weak moment and took off in a rush to calm myself down.  Did I hurt anyone?  (actually, yes, hurt her feelings very badly, and maybe hurt our relationship as well).  Did I do something crazy or foolish or mean?  (foolish yea, crazy maybe, mean - up for interpretation.)   Is it possible to allow myself to just let that moment go, like burning toast or spilling milk?  It was 'The Beast' in control, not the real me.  But I think the reality is, the real me has to deal with the fallout caused by the Beast.  I think it is not a simple as "forget about it, move on" when it affects other people, my family.    I am reading a book from Anne Sheffield, about how the family of the depressed person is affected.  I started reading it to get a sense of Anne's perspective, what she might be thinking dealing with me.  Maybe I will try to get her to read it.  Also, I think she needs to have a session or two with the therapist, with or without me, whether she likes it or not.    Related to this, I had a talk with Nikki tonight.  She was being very nice.  She senses things are not right, just like Dan.  Anyway, a few days ago I had written her a letter she could understand about me problems.  I think it went well, I hope it helps her understand better.  (See next post for letter.)    Anyway, I am in a better mood, partly due to feeling useful at work, also because I have worn out the depressive side for a few days.  I don't have any self-pity left for now.  After watching the movie yesterday, I am going to be more decisive, and be a bad-ass if I need to be (okay, maybe just look at people when I talk to them).  When there is a situation, I will ask myself, What Would Bourne Do?  WWBD.    Someone just came into my office without knocking.  WWBD?  Smash his face with my coffee mug, keep everyone back with a gun, steal his car and race down Broadway, leaving destruction in my wake.  Everything will be better tomorrow.  OK, maybe that is not the best policy for now.
