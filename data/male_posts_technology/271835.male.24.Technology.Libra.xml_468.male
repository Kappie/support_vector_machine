They say they will be revealing the truth between March 16 th  and April 3 rd .     They are doing this via a series of questions. Amongst their clues are the fact there was a similar episode of  urlLink Law and Order  (script written by  urlLink this ?), a  urlLink Siskel  Ebert  (WTF!?) review of the case apparently came up with a 3 thumbs down for murder and  urlLink Courtney Love 's latest album not selling because Nirvana fans aren't buying it.     The last clue is of course ignoring totally the fact that the stuff she does is crap! That and the  urlLink increasingly   urlLink erratic   urlLink behaviour  means no one is interested in Courtney Love anymore which is presumably the reason her behaviour is getting ever more bizarre  urlLink even going so far as to accuse  rocker  urlLink Ted Nugent  of paedophilia. Of course she may be telling the truth about this but the strange way she revealed it included 'phoning the  urlLink Howard Stern  show, then going in and spilling the beans.
