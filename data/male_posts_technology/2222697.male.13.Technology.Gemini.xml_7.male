I just got back from Able electronics and after getting a computer that has alot of stuff i want, it was over priced at 841$$ and i only have 1000 and i need a camera. Gasp....I know what to do! i will buy all my accesories before the comp. That will work and i will have a set price....geez im smart. ok well thats what im trying to find out, because im going to put lights inside and you know that costs a whole wheelbarrow of grain to pay fer dat there. HEY EVERYONE SHELBY IS IN LOVE WITH HARRISON!!!!! i only did that because she told me not to. Hehe im going to get yelled at....
