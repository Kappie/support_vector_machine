Arguing over what happened (or did not happen) 30 years ago is just personal attacks.   The last time I saw such vitriolic hatred (and I think Johnathan, as a neutral observer would agree) of a political figure was the late '90s with the Republicans hating Clinton.  I've got to tell you, it does not do much good.  It doesn't even make you feel good in the long run.  That does not make me ask the question of Ben and Mir (and any other Bush haters), what is it that makes you hate him personally?  And now as I type this, I just heard on Rush of a potential bombshell against Kerry that is being reported on the Drudge report.  Something about recent infidelity.  I have no other information, but, even if it is true, so what?  As long as he did not lie about in the course of federal/state/local investigation, it is between him and his wife.  I saw Edwards on the today show, and even though he did not let the ANG issue totally die, he did say that this election needs to be about much more than attendance records.  Hallelujah!  Now if BOTH sides will let that happen, we might get to have civil discussions about our disagreements on the issues (taxes, spending, education, defense, etc.)
