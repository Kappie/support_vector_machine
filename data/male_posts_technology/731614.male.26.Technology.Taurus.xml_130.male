The care tag says that it should be in indirect light, with moderately moist soil, in a warm home.  Let's see if I can manage to keep this one alive. Or will it go to plant heaven where my other plants go in winter? Only time will tell.  And if you look close enough, you'll see that that is our wonderous zonk board, working.  This way when it's down, at least we'll have photo proof that it does work on occasion.  Fill fill fill. Sometimes using left align is a pain.
