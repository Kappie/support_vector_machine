That sorta helps cheer life up. O, and I drove my car home from Melissa's house yesterday after helping her and Danie with a movie for spanish. ...That was a mistake. Er, no, not helping them, driving... My hand was all messed up again afterward, so today I got a ride with Adri. May be a couple days yet before I can drive again.
