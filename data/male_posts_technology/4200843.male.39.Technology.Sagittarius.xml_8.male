Not too sure what I should tell you all really, it's not going to be a diary into my life, but I may choose to leave something that's none of your business once in a while.  Today my wife (Ann) and daughter (Alex) flew off to Portugal for the week leaving me home alone. I'll have to do things that I normally just don't do, like feed the rabbits, not that I care if they die, but Alex would be gutted.  So tonight I'm off out to see I, Robot, may even leave a post about that tomorrow.  My mate leaves head office next week and last Friday they had a party day and he had his head painted like a tiger. I thought he looked like a gay tiger, you decide :) (mental note: get some smileys)
