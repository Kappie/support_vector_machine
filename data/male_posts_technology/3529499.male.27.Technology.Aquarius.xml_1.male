I tend to forget the name of this movie EVERY time I tell someone about it. "I just saw... that movie with Tom Cruise." is all that comes out! Even in this post, I had to go back and fill in the name.  The movie was pretty good, though I missed the ending. I figured that I had time to run to the bathroom and get back before the climactic moment, but as I returned, the action had ceased and the movie ended. It did have some great moments and lots of action. I enjoyed it and as soon as a bootleg becomes available, I'm catching the ending!
