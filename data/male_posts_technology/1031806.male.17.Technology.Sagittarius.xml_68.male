Hahahaha  I think that's kind of funny, cause I haven't the slightest recollection of it.  ...Whatever...  Oh, also my dad blew up at my tonight, for reasons as of yet unknown, and wouldn't let me go to youth group.  He's been doing ALOT of stuff like that lately.  I might go into more detail in a later post, but I see no real reason right now.  Brady (my friend that went blind last Sunday) is doing really well, all things considered.  He is a strong Christian, and I am really thankful that he has not become too discouraged or depressed (at least as far as I can tell).  Well, God’s plans are many times not our own, and we just have to trust Him to work out everything for the best in all of this.  Feeling: Tired, Annoyed, and Mad at my runny nose  ;)
