They aren't exactly what one would refer to as "guns" at this point, I mean, there certainly are no "peaks" as of yet, but what I did see certainly gives me hope for the future.  I couldn't help but roll up the sleeves to my t-shirt today and flexed them every now and then. I kept craning my head to try to get a side view (yes I realize standing in front of the mirror would have made that task easier, but I was pretty much sacked out on the couch all day watching Stephen King's The Stand on dvd and didn't feel much like getting up).  I also kept flexing for Babalu, my domestic (cat) partner; however he remains unimpressed. I think he's just still envious over the lack of posable thumbs.  On the lighter side of the news, I was chatting up with a 29 year old gentleman this evening and he was digging me. He wanted to meet me in person tonight. Except things went awry when I disclosed my present weight; 310 according to my scale this morning, which brings the total loss to 80 pounds since April. Only 60 more to go until Jose Fuentes, my personal trainer, will start to really build me a better, more muscular body. I am not the least bit upset over the turn of events with this younger fellow; he was cute, but it's always an iffy sell until I present all information. It did confirm two of my theories however: 1) Men are scum and shallow (which I admit I am too, I mean, and I am ashamed to say this, I wouldn't be interested in a 310 pound man). And 2) I have such a great, witty, fun personality. I know I was charming the pants off him until.....well, you know...   The Disclosure        Just a few more months and this whole ugliness will be behind me.     You can do it   All you need is a hand   We can do it   Mama is gonna see to it      Curtin up!   Light the lights!   You've got nothing to hit    But the heights!   Blow a kiss   Take a bow   And nothings gonna stop us   Till we're through!      Honey, Everything's comin' up roses!   For me, and for You!
