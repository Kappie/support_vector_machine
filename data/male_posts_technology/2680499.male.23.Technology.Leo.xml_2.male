There was no electricity but I still see ppl coming to do their routines. So, I just joined them. Well, lucky enough the electric came to live 30 minutes after. But unlucky enough, it was raining heavily outside. After the gym I had to drive home. But with the sweat I can't switch on the air-con. So I had to drive with my windows closed and without air-con. Along the way, the screen was getting foggy. And I hardly see what's outside. By the time I saw there's a passenger walking, my car had splashed water to him. Poor guys!!  I've been driving all the way until the high way that leads to my house then I remembered there is a selection that I can turn the blower to my screen. So I did. But that was one unlucky day. Even the high way can get trapped into traffic jam. It was 10 minutes to 7, and I had to rush home to get myself ready ~ coz my friend invited me to go watch the chronicle of riddicks. But with that jam, I was afraid I cannot make it. But luckily, I still managed to get home before 7.30. BTW, I had to said that I hate those assholes that drives off the track and tries to get ahead of the traffic. They are the ones that cause more jam.  8.30 pm. My friend came to fetch me. And we went straight to the cinema. Once, meeting each other, there were about 7 of us, we were ready to go into the cinema. Opinions about the movie:  "Mmmm... I think it is quite OK. More actions, just like Vin Diesel's style. Not quite clear about the story line, but they said there is the first part "Pitch Black" that I need to watch to be able to understand what's going on. Overall is OK. I like the actions though"  After movie, I went back and flipping the channels. Last nite the discovery channel is nice. It was about the spontaneous human combustion. Creepy!! then 12.30 my brother finally is back. And we chat for a while then I went to pass out for the nite.  Now thinking of my life, it seems a little boring. I think I need to add some flavour to my life. Maybe I need to be bad or playful. Well I'll think about this. Or maybe I'll be the party goer everynite. God knows.
