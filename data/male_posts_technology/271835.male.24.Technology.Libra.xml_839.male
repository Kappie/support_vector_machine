Corinne Maier, a senior economist at Electricit√© de France, wrote a book about  urlLink The Art and the Importance of Doing the Least Possible at the Workplace  and now her employer is taking disciplinary action. Too bloomin' right I say. The nerve of some people. Of course NewLinkers are highly efficient work motivated multi-tasking individuals who can create linkage for our readers perusal whilst simultaneously debugging 10,000,000 lines of badly commented code. Probably.
