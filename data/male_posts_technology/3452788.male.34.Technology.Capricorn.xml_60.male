Within the last year, she has been sad because she wishes GG could come back to see her.  Talking to her the other day, I think she feels bad because she does not really have any actual first-hand memories of GG, she only knows him from stories and from going to the funeral.  She said that she didn't want to hear stories from Anne or her parents, or see a video of his 80th b-day party, because it would still not be her memory.  She says sometimes that GG gets to see the tops of all the redwoods, or that he is talking to her in the wind (when the wind blows hard, he is reminding her she did something wrong), or that he gets to fly over everything.  She says this very matter-of-fact, not like a fantasy, which strikes me as un-childlike, almost a native-american manner of rememberance.  I felt so sad for her the other night, I had no way to help her feel better - a very powerless feeling.  I think she will grow out of it, but I also wonder if this will affect her notions of death and beyond.  Sometimes she acts 10 or more, sometimes she acts 4.  The average is her actual age, 7.
