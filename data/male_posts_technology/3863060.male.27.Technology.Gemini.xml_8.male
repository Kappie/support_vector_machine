I woke up at 6:00, again, still can't sleep on weekends...  Left home at about 7:00 and found my first cache in Maidenhead 45 minutes later, good going by all accounts.  My next statistical mission is to get into the top 50 of UK geocachers, am currently 60th so not too far to go, need to find 235 to get there (at the moment I have found 228, that includes todays finds)  Anyways... worked my way north, into Buckinghamshire, the first 10 where "same old same old" caches in the usual setting, in lovely old forests or large meadows, which then brought me to a lovely village called Turville, which to my surprise is where they filmed an episode of "Midsomer Murders" and is the location of one of the vicar's house in "Vicar of Dibley", and most importantly is also the home of the Windmill in "Chitty Bang Bang", which is the home of the professor and his children, did take pictures which i will upload in due course. So I was suitably impressed.  Found 13 in total today was absolutely Knackered as there where quite a steep hills.  Bought the "Franz Ferdinand" CD which is quite good, been listening to it all day while driving between caches. Do recommend, if you like the likes of "Blur", that is...  Signing off for now...
