The bottom-line result of this is that instead of spending the requisite "quality time" with her, I'm back in front of the XBox.  On to the meat of it.  So I fire up the XBox and notice that a friend is online.  He's new to the XBox and new to XBL.  He is in PGR2 and idle, so I create a game and invite him.  And sit.  And sit.  I give him a generous five minutes, but he's still idle.  Screw this, I want to play!  Blinx: The Time Sweeper.  I bought this one after good reviews and recommendations.  I have played quite a lot of Voodoo Vince, so I figured this would be in the same vein.  Alas, it did not live up to my expectations.  At this point, I expect that this is one title that I will be reserving for the kids.  Put away after 30 minutes.  Dead or Alive 3 (DOA3).  This is one that I have wanted to get into, but I'm not good at combos, so I wind up doing a lot of button mashing.  But I decided to give it a try.  After all, I'm pretty far into the DOA Volleyball game. I like Lei Fang, so I do a little bit of training with her, trying to get the hang of some combos, with limited success.   What the hell, I will try Story mode. The first couple of fights were easy, but it becomes a bit challenging after that.  Hmm, I will have to remember to figure out how to do counter-attacks and reversals.  After a few losses and perseverance, I get to this Omega character.  Who the hell is he?  He's mean! After his eventual defeat, I get a nice cutscene and then back to the menu.   Oh!  I beat it!   After a bit more research, I see that there is now a theater section and I can view Lei Fang's movie whenever I want. I did the Story mode for Hitomi and Kasumi and prepared for bed.  Nope, it's still not out of my system yet.  So I did the Story mode for Tina as well.  OK, that's half of the girls, and 4 out of 16.  I will try to do another 4 tomorrow.  Personal notes: I like Lei Fang's closed moves.  Hitomi has a very nice kick, and Kasumi punches well.  Tina is just all over the place; too open, especially her kick.  I will have to do some more experimenting and learn their styles (strengths, weaknesses) a bit better.
