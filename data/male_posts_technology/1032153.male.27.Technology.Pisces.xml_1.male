I really want to look at what I said yesterday in a bit more depth, and clearing up any doubts as to what I was saying. I also want to define the word legalism, as I use it, and as I have seen others use it. There is an interesting contrast.   Isn't it surprising how definitions can make such a difference in arguments and discussions? One can label someone else a racist, and they may not be one according to one person's definition, but are according to another's.   Interesting, but I cannot dwell on this at present.  Cherio.
