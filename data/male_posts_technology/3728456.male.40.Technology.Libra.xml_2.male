Easily create installations that will run on Linux using a dedicated          point-and-click interface       2. Compact Project Type for smallest footprint       3. Instantly Notify Users of Updates       4. Easily mark files that will always need to be overwritten at installation time      5. Mobile Device Support    urlLink Newsforge  has an interview with Bob Corrigan, the product manager for InstallShield X, and Gerold Franke, InstallShield public relations, regarding their push into the Linux world.  One of the issues they've identified is the indivudual or corporation who are moving towards Linux and want an easy way to install software without having to get down and dirty with the install process.  I think this is an important step in Linux making a move into mainstream use where users are focused on using the applications which can be used with Linux and not having users focus on specific installation processes.
