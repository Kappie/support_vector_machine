They appear to be perpetually optimistic, and I usually see them strolling around wearing big goofy smiles, always seeming to be have some degree of concern and interest in how I'm doing.  I give them a smile and say "hello", which somehow becomes an invitation for them to engage me in a brief dialog.  They ask how things are going, and I, in as nice a way as possible, complete the exchange.  I smile, walk away, and wonder.  And so the day goes in a series of these seemingly meaningless yet somehow necessary sets of interactions.  Some people are genuinely happy, truly concerned, and to all ends just  good  people.  They find good in most everything.  But can a person really be happy all the time?  Perhaps everyone should be ruffled by something from time to time.  At least it forces some degree of consideration.  It might even  urlLink be beneficial for everyone in the long run .
