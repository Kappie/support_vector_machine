I found the quote so cool that it was at the bottom of my blog.  "A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until a majority of voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse out of the public treasury." --  Alexander Tyler, Scottish historian, 1770   Being that I'm a reading nut, I wanted to buy the book that contained the quote.  After a search of all the usual suspects (Amazon, Google, Library of Congress) for "Cycle of Democracy" or "Fall of the Athenian Republic", I could NOT find the book (though I did find  other books are attributed to Alexander Tytler).  The inability to find this book caused me to grow suspicious.  A HUGE number of websites cite this quote (including one from a Congressman from Wisconsin), but I could NOT find the book.  Strange eh?  I was really bummed out because I REALLY wanted to read it.  Well, in the course of my research into finding the book I discovered that the quote itself appears to be invalid (thus the removal from the bottom of my page).  I could NOT verify the existence of the book or that the quote was correctly attributed to Tyler (Tytler).  I did a search to see if the quote was misattributed to Tytler, and the sites I found all attributed the quote to him.  In fact, the quote or book allegedly containing the quote is never mentioned in his  urlLink bio.   Further research yielded a couple more sites (Snopes being one) that state that the quote is likely fictitious.  They can be found at  urlLink Snopes  and  urlLink here .  The quote would have been especially prescient if it was true to the time (1770) that it was attributed to the author. However, since it appears to be a manufactured product of the 20th century, it loses its impact. Because of this fact and that I cannot perpetuate the lie, I removed it from my page.  Though I enjoy research, I don't always enjoy the results...
