Universities are a fount of knowledge. Some come to drink, some just to gargle.   On RWH : You hit the nail on the head when you said that planning alone is not going to solve any problems. Execution is the other part (reference: our Principles of Management class).  I had read an interesting article in the Sunday edition of Hindu a few years back. I don't know if it is available online. I hope, in addition to Rajesh's reference, you have the time to visit   urlLink this link . It is wonderfully written with lots and lots of examples and diagrams.   As you had said, everyone is forced to invest in a rainwater harvesting system without undestanding why it is required or how it should be implemented. I have never seen anything in the media in the recent past highlighting how RWh is to be implemented. All I had seen is our CM delivering a monologue on the benefits and reprecussions if you don't install RWH.   Now every house has a RWH, but will it function as intended is to be seen in the days to come.  I have also posted another post in  urlLink "Quod scripsi, scripsi"  for your perusal. I may not be updating it daily, but I'll inform you if I update it.
