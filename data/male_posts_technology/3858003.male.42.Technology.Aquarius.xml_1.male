The Garcia-Goldberg family.  In October 2003, my partner, Will, and I were blessed with the birth of a little boy that we adopted - his name is Shai Garrett Garcia-Goldberg, our son.  His birthmother Bekci, lived with us for the last month of her pregnancy and together we formed a unique bond via the process of Open Adoption.  Our little boy, has brought much wonder and blessedness into our lives.  We describe the feeling that being a family brings as a deep, rich, lush swamp - hence the name of our "blog": SwampLog.
