My sister in law was married last Friday and some of her new husbands relatives came over to my in-laws to stay a few nights after the wedding. The night they came up, I met them at the local grocery store so I could escort them through Purgatory (which is the name of the road out to my in-laws). Since this is country, getting lost is easier than preparing a 4 course meal.  So I lead these people to the in-laws (who by-the-way are almost completely surrounded by fields). When they got out of their cars everyone looked up. It was a picture perfect crystal clear starry night. They were all in awe at the number of stars they could see and stood around gawking for about 10 minutes. These people are all from Long Island, New Jersey and other locals in and near New York City.  After witnessing this little spectacle, I have made a point to notice all those things which I took for granted before. I may be far away from the luxuries most people take for granted, but I think I'm closer to those things others never notice. Reading Isaac Asimov/Robert Silverberg's  "Nightfall" , made this feeling even more apparent.
