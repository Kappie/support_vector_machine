A short look at the number of  urlLink religions in the world   will baffle the mind. So many religions, so many views...  Add to this mixture, a large heapful of  urlLink mythologies , you get a totally confusing volatile potion.   But after understanding many mythologies, it is possible to point out several similarities between the mythologies, be it a greek, egyptian or matabele. So all I can understand is that there has been a common origin for the beliefs. The question is where?  Africa  (as scientists say),  Ancient Persia  (according to Judeo, Christian, Islamic and Hindu myths),  Mediterranean  (Greek, Egyptian, Atlantis). That's one question for which no one has been able to give a correct answer.  But as George Bernard Shaw said, "  There is only one religion, though there are a hundred versions of it.  "
