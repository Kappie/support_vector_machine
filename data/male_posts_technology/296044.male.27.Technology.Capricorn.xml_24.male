I've been reading about "cool" fashions in Berlin, talking to a coworker who is out of the office (via instant messenger), and reading Bergdorf Goodman ads.  Oh, and I read a NASA article about life on other planets.  So my mind is mush right now, but I've decided I have one goal for next week:  I am getting a Hoxton Fin.  Yup.  See ya.  [stay tuned.  Monday I begin a research project.]
