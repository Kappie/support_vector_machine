We had a nice time here when bala also joined us during his visit for this CP interview.  We were kidding ganja and really ganja was so happy that day when he was almost confirmed in CP but he was not ready to outburst and show his excitements before us. I inferred  that from him and bala too…and we both started pulling his legs and were kidding.  We had a drink that night and While we were having our drink we had it by hiding it from ganja using a towel…(namma tamil padathula ellam mariyathaikkaga thunda vachi marachikittu kudippanga illa….antha maathiri…ha ha…sice ganja is no longer the same old ganja and now he has become the STS (Sales Territory Supervisor) of CP, he deserves this mariyathai…ha ha ha.)   And then, valli, kavitha ennai emathitta….Le’Meridien polamnnu sollittu, Kerela Shansikku kooti poitta…ofcourse athuvum nalla hotel thaan…but when compared to Le’Meridien…it’s a small one…but naan nalla thaan saapitten…over’a saapittathula…vaanthi vara alavukku aayiduchu….ha ha ha…  apram athu epdi…niraya pasangalukku mudi kotti asingama aayiducha….hmmmm…neram…  Ok cute boys and (not so) cute (MS ITM) girls…nothing more to pen.  C u later.  Mahen.
