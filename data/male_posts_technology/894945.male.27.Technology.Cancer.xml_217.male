Unfortunatly I was then attacked by a blonde bunny boiler (if you speak to me again i'm going to post your name on here, we were never 'an item' and frankly, you scare me. So fuck off..  ok?) anyway, had a few more drinks and laughs then headed down to Q Bar to play my set with the Dapper Crew. It was a quiet night, apparently some loser called Boy George was playing in Follies and he stole my dancing girls. I ended up with some buddies from work and Danger in the Zebra. I think with distressed people with our experimental dancing techniques.  A few weeks ago at the Splash, we stripped one of our friends naked and made him do a couple of laps. Below are the photos from that night. Let's play,   "Spot the naked guy!" (TM)      In the queue.. too early and sober for nakedness yet...   Catty cat cat and the schoolgirls. Good name for a band.   In summary, breasts are great. John Grist, news at ten, the Watersplosh.   Wazzzzzzzzzzzzup!   I'm doing a survey on barmaids underwear for the site. Any chance you could...? No.. fuck off? ok.. sorry.   Bounce in the mosh pit. No naked guy though...    There we go!! Who is that masked man??
