At the same time, the Christian faith has become delusional, over-identifying itself with society as a whole.  A Christian revolution must live in tension with human societies and cultures.  We want to see an authentic Christian expression in every culture on this planet – in fact we are called to make it so.  But there must never be a moment when we perceive Christianity as equal to the culture itself.  When we begin to see being a Christian and being American as indistinguishable, we lose the transforming essence of our faith.  The ultimate goal of American Christianity should not be to make us good citizens but to make us revolutionaries in the cause of Jesus Christ." - McManus
