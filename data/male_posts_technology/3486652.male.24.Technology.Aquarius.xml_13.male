The Information, Communications and Technology (ICT) program was crafted by the government of Thailand to assist low-income earners to be able to afford their own PCs.   While first declining to participate in ITC, Microsoft has since shifted its tactics and offered up pricing incentives, a stripped down version of Windows XP Home and a specialized version of Office XP.   A Microsoft spokesperson commented on the company's participation in ICT saying, "We look forward to seeing how this product will be received by Thai citizens, and the impact it will have on their efforts to enable access to technology."
