A couple went together with no problem. The others were however were made by somebody who could not measure out the location of screwholes correctly, and thus took a bit more effort to put together.  Anyways, a few hours and sore thumbs later, I have 5 7 foot tall dvd racks completely full...and I need at least four more..so looks like another trip to IKEA.  Yes..I have way too many DVDs and cds.  I still have DVDs that have not been opened up. For all I know, they could be empty cases.  I sometimes wonder when I will have time to watch them all.  Sometimes, I think I am just saving things up for when I go into retirement. However, I am always buying more every weekend it seems!  Some sort of addiction I imagine.  The way I am going it will only be a matter of time before all of my white walls are completely covered with racks of cds and DVDs.  Boy, is it going to not be fun when I move..
