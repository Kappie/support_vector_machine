If the content doesn't connect, you won't like the film.  In that sense, it seems likely that you prefer either filmed essays or escapist tales.  There's nothing wrong with this; it's just seems to be how you relate to the arts.  That said, I suspect that Lost in Translation did not get you because the content wasn't engaging.  Because without the content, I feel there is plenty of evidence throughout that it is still a strong example of storytelling, character exploration, and filmcraft.  It seems to me that you approach the arts as a seeker -- a seeker of either ideas or entertainment -- rather than as an aesthete.  There is nothing invalid about approaching a work solely as a seeker; but the more personal the quest, the more limited the experience.  As for myself, the film connected profoundly with me, both personally and aesthetically.  I suspect that the film's content did not resonate with any aspect of your own personal search, and was promptly (and validly, for you) dismissed in all remaining categories.
