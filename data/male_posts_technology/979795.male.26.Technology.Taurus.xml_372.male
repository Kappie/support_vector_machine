But I got a reply from her saying that I was "doing a great job". So encouraging but also hope that I can do better.  Met up with Robin today. Like I was telling Daphne, coz on several occasions when I tried to meet with Robin, a lot of things would go wrong, I was kinda expecting the same thing to happen today. Things were ok lah, he was there waiting already when I got to Dhoby Ghaut MRT. The evening and dinner was quite uneventful. We couldn't quite agree on a movie so we juz settled for makan instead. He'd already seen 2 of the 3 shows I was hoping to catch. Oh well... I had to admit, things were quite boring over dinner coz I didn't really know what to say and all that lah. But after dinner we went Kinokuniya at Taka and browsed through some books for awhile. After that we went to grab coffee (well, tea for him lah) at Coffee Bean. There we had a good chat about family, life, philosophy of living, etc. Basically a superficial start in the evening ended with a good chat at night.  When I got home, I realised Zatoichi was still showing at Cineleisure... only there in fact. Gotta catch it latest this weekend before they stop showing it. Wasted though, could've caught it tonight.  Oh yar 1 more thing, traded in my Samsung T100 for the new Samsung E700. Quite cool lor. Didn't think I'd like it but I really do. Need to take good care of it. My new toy ... hehe ;P
