Actually i met up wif her last nite wif her frens and one fren of my for dinner lah. Although we didnt tok much thru out the nite but it was a relief to see that she looked better than a week ago. Was realli tired lah and this morning have to go to Ngee ann poly to set up things for Mon's notebook distribution. So sian...cos usually sat morning can sleep til late late one. but anyway, i woke her up this morning for her checkup....she supposed to go for medical checkup but when i called her at ard 12 plus, she said she never go for the checkup and i asked if she coming for my performance later and she said see how lor....KNS....waste my effort to wake her up but i dun mind....hehe.....then rush down to Muchuan to practice for the performance....expecting that she wont turn up.....and in the midst of practicing, my gan jie karen sms me and said she couldnt make it and apologised. Bit disappointed lor but have to understand that something impt might have cropped up lah. so no prob.  this time my performance was at Apollo centre muchuan. Partnered wif ah du and my fellow course mate called jenix. Jenix is a very good guitar player....upon hearing that we will be performing together, she asked me for the song list i'm goin to sing for today one week in advance and she listened to the songs and practice them. she's very good and we practiced on last tuesday...everything went smooth.  then ah du told me he can onli help us play for the first hour and the rest of it we have to manage it by ourself. we r a bit worried that we cannot managed lah haha. and jus as ah du is leaving for his class (he teaches), i asked him to help me play one song, Tian Tian Xiang Ni, and dedicated it to her even when she not there. i didnt mention her name which everyone asking me to say, i jus said that i'm singing this for the owner of Gou xiong brand alarm clock.....haha onli she knows wat this means.....anyway we had a short break after ah du left and went on to perform after. And as we were performing, my sec sch frens starts coming in....realli happy to see them....and after them, she came wif kk and vive. I was so surprised......in fact very very surprised and she is wearing her pink dress and she looked so good. i'm so happy at that moment that word cant describe my esctasy. After i saw her, i did my best in all the songs i sang and Fwah.....happy til dun know wat to say.... after a while, a tan guy called jian hua came on stage suddenly....i thot who he is and he turned out to be a muchuan singer who sings on sunday nites. and ah du never mentioned anything.....hai wo sia dao. anyway the fact that she came for my performance realli made my day. And i did feel that i improved a bit since my first performance lor. Verry Verry happy though can be better if my gan jie turned up and SHE complete her checkup wif negative results. Still this is the happiest day of my life.....and also mus mention ang hock beng who came last min...realli super last min...but at least he came lah haha....ok shared my happy day and my performance ended well....and for those whose present on my performance, any feedback how i can improve?? Pls leave behind ur comments in my shoutbox or friendster...thanks...  cheers, Teddy
