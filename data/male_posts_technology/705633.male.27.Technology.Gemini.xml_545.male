I feel like i am trapped inside a packet of pork scratchings which have been left in a microwave for a year.   I went out for a lad's lunch at the weekend, started at the Tenby and then food at the Salty Dog (nice eye-candy), down to the Old Courthouse for a few jugs of PIMMs then back into town at THE bar. I was rather pissed and feeling like I had too much sun so I did a Captain Oates at about 8pm. I am thinking about having a bit of a BBQ while it's still summer.. let me know if you're interested peeps!   My girlfriend found this little fella while doing some shopping online... thought i'd share it with you.     Ahh!! The ph34r! run away from corset gimp man! run!
