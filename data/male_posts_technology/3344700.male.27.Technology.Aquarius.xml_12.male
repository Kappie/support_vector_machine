This was asked in an interview question to my friend..I read a nice example article at Microsoft to achieve this using Microsoft Office Web Component (OWC) XMLSS (XML SpreadSheet)..very interesting...    urlLink Use ASP to Build Spreadsheet XML for Client-Side Display   This is very useful and interesting to learn..
