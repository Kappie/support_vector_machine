At least 2 hrs of Biblical Evangelism training and it is now. 5:07 AM. Icannot understand as of yet if I am tired. However I know for sure that I am excited to bring the Gospel of Jesus Christ to people. I have realized that in my pain and in my sorrow and in my situations I too have forgotten the Great Commission. I believe that I am called to be an evangalist. I do believe that despite my inequites and my situations that I have been called for this nobel thing. The word of God calls it a Nobel task. And the word of God also Calls ALL saint (those set apart) to be those who spread the Gospel. I do not think I am special. However as a Soldier in training I know my Sword is dull. My helmet could use some shining. By belt sometimes lets my briches fall down and my chest plate my need to be reordered via EBAY. Not that I am not in shape but who can be ready? It is a large world? Many problems? Many issues? How can I do this. After listening I have realized that YES it is a great task. However the task is not mine. It is my Lord and Saviors. I have been given the opportunity to be a part of it. If he is all knowing? All powerful? What do I have to loose. I am most defintly on the winning team. If I win in one thing. Let it be obedience. For Obedience is better than Sacrafice. If I am to win in anything I know that the sure way to win no matter what is to be on the team that makes and created the rules. Father God where to now? Still training but never too late to get my feet wet.
