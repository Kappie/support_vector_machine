Have we met? Have we passed each other on the street? Do I know your name? Do you know mine? I think of these things tonight, as with every night. I sit here waiting, hoping, dreaming of you. There are times when I wonder if you exist. Times when I think you're an illusion. A shimmering glimpse of what life should be like. A happy life with you at my side. To share the ups and downs. To rely on you as much as you rely on me. Thats tonight.  Tomorrow Tomorrow I will cry. Because I will wake up and you're not here. There'll be no scent of you on my pillow. Noone to give a morning kiss. I'll go through my day wondering why tomorrow has to come, why couldn't the night last forever. Even if I were dreaming at night it would be of you, and we would be together. But tomorrow brings new pain. New realizations. Am I waiting in vain? Do dreams really come true?   Tonight Please don't end. Tonight I have you. We are together. Even if I dream, don't let me wake.  Tomorrow I woke. My dream ended. I'll live. I always do. Nothing can stop me. As long as I have tonight
