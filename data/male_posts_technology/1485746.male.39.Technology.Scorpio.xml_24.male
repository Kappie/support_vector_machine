The Wife started speaking to me again, I went to my mom's house for July 4th, and there were several household chores that had backed up a bit.  I did play for a few hours, though, off and on.  Mostly  Ghost Recon ; ISuperGeek had expressed an interest in playing, and I had not played a single mission yet.  I played through the first mission once.  Lost the second mission a couple of times.  More later.
