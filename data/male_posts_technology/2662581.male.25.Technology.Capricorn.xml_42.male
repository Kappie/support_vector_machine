Today, Don writes:   My question is this: Do I really need to install XP service pack 2? My 2 computers sit behind a Netgear router. I have Zone Alarm on one and Norton Firewall on the other. Both run Norton AntiVirus on an XP Pro install. I’ve read the SP2 preamble and I really can’t see any added value in applying this upgrade. Whaddaya think? Thanks!  Well Don, if you want to run Windows XP and you want it to be as secure as it can possibly be, then, yes, you need it. Let me explain why. Microsoft has put together a bunch of patches, updates, and other needed goodies for Windows XP users. While I have not really studied a whole bunch on what it does to a PC after installation (Problems, bugs, etc.), I imagine it will be a similar install to what we got with SP1.  Some things to make sure to do:   Create a system restore point. While I am sure that it will install fine, this never hurts.  If it prompts you with the option to archive old system files, go ahead and do it. Along with the system restore point, this can come in handy if something goes horribly wrong with the update to SP2.  Good luck!
