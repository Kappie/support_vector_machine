Any cat. I picked Stubbys.  * Upon discovering that your precious digitized audio clips are noisy beyond recognition, do not waste other people's time inquiring about sampling rates. The problem, most likely, is that you haven't set your recording device to line-in, but have left it set to microphone instead. The "noise", therefore, is a result of your microphone picking up every squeak and whisper made in the room, in addition to recording what is being played through your PC's speakers. Yes, that is exactly why your cat's howls are now part of your digitized audio.   Blame a cat. Any cat. I picked Stubbys.  * As a general rule, do not tinker with audio at 3 in the morning. Not around cats in any case. Bad things happen. Heck, don't even stay up until 3. Try catching some sleep sometime. I hear it works out quite well for the rest of the world. Then again, I shouldn't be listening to the voices in my head.
