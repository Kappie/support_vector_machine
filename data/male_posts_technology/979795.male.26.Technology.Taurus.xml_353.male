After the whole thing I walked to the busstop wif 4 students from Pillars and found out that they paid mat fees monthly instead of every 3 mths like the CCs. Hmm I'm now considering taking additional training from there as well. Oh just a note, I did help a bit as uke during the demo but I think my ukemi was stiff and awkward. Well, there's always a first lah. Fun though, but I wouldn't want to really try again till I can take more decent ukemi and apply proper atemi.  Another reason why I felt really happy was because I met my sec 3+4 form teacher, Ms Lim, Well technically she's Mrs XXX now I think but I didn't remember to clarify this. Anyway I was giving out Aikido phamplets when lo and behold, this lady (she didn't change much even after giving birth) walked past, refusing my phamplet at the same time (HUMPH!). Anyway, my first instinct was to call out "Ms Lim! Ms Lim!". She didn't turn her head but I noted that the name did make her turn her eyeballs in my direction. So I called out again and kinda waved at her "Ms Lim from Buona Vista Sec?!" That kinda got her attention haha. Well, she couldn't remember my name lah of coz since I hadn't seen her after my Os (she was posted out soon after I graduated). Updated her my past 3 years and told her wat I'm currently working as. Apparently she's now with Tampines Sec (or was it Primary??). OK lah, at least not too diff to find out if I need to look for her again. Anyway, this kinda reminded me of my Sec 1+2 form teacher, Mr Lim. I think someday I gotta call up MOE to see if they can help me out liao.  Oh, saw the huge blackish bruise on Eileen's arm and it was horrible. I'd imagine it feels worse than it seemed lor.
