Anyone who knows me can confirm that i'm really not a morning person, so it was with great reluctancy that I conceded morning would be the best time to get my work out.  Anyway, I'm now about three weeks into it and I'm feeling like a new man.  There's a slight problem with getting to work at the momebt, i.e., going to the gym makes me super late into the office and I then have to work till 8pm. But at least it's nice and quiet at that time of day:)  I'm expecting to have '6 pack abs' by August ...      c@lifestyle
