I had a few stops before I got home and this was much to my advantage.  It was hot today and taking my time getting home helped tremendously to allow the temperature to cool some before I ran.  I took off about 6:15p.m. and went straight up Victory Parkway.  I made it just north of Xavier before I had to turn around.  I only went 4 miles and felt great for the most part.  I was a little tired and it showed on my way back as some of the hills of Victory truly were a victory to overcome (in the Rocky sense).  The bruthas in the 'hood were a little confused by a white man dancing around on the street like an idiot though so I got back to running.  :)  I continued to learn tonight that it is more than helpful for me to start with a shorter stride than my normal pace stride.  This allows me to start slower and warmup my muscles more before I break into full stride near the end.  I was able to start slow tonight and finish fast which is my goal of any run I do so that was pretty cool.  I was also able to run past Cincy cops without getting shot at as well, yet another benefit!  For a final thought tonight, I unfortunately had a song going through my head that I am neither proud of nor able to share with you now due to the lyrical content.  Cursed 107.1 and their vulgar lyrics!  Either way, have a great week!  Training for NYC starts next week!
