It seems like it's been taking really slow to update and I might have found a reason why, Blogger seems to be updating straight to www.your-blog-ID.blogspot.com first.  What I did was update my links on my blogpage, my links on my homepage  my commenting facility (enetation). Hope this helps everyone. Oh yea, and remember to update your link to this page too :P I suspect this the reason why the no. of comments displayed don't seem to registering properly either. Updating enetation on your blog address might solve it. I'm still testing it now.
