I love grocery shopping - I'm not afraid to admit it, I guess I love any form of spending money - but yeah, theres' always been a strange appeal to grocery shopping. There are conditions to this claim, however. Read on...  Busy supermarkets are horrible. I hate crowds of people at the best of times when I'm trying to -do- something, shopping etc.. like st lukes at xmas time - absolute shit. Supermarkets are the same, but worse, because stupid 'left it to the last minute' people, are so erratic with their trolleys.. either erratic or just plain stupid. It shouldnt take a lot of thought to be able to navigate a trolley around a supermarket, it really shouldnt.. but in the defense of people that cant, trolleys do sometimes play up, and the grocery store does stick silly display stands up in the most congested places just to fuck with your mind. Assholes. Ram that fucker down - how happy are they with their placement now Dr Ropata? Exactly! revenge is yours... which brings me to comment on things that ammuse me while I'm shopping. My favourite is Yoink n Sploink. Huh? Yoink n Sploink my good friend is a game you too can play next time you're at the grocery store. It is a game broken up into two parts, we'll start with Sploink... To score a point, you merely 'sploink' or put an item of undesiredness ie sardines in tomato sauce, or pickled trotters into an unsuspecting persons trolley, without them noticing. This scores you one point, if you can do it, without them noticing. You get a bonus point if theres a comedic value to what you've done, such as weight watchers items in a fat persons trolley, or tampons in the trolley of a guy that looks like he'd never met a real life female face to face. Trust me, this is more fun in groups, at a 24hr supermarket. Maybe if you've got a digital camera and are brave enough, you could document your game, if you do I'll put it online for ya - maybe we can make it a competition. Hmm I'll work out a prize. Ok.. the other part of Yoink n Sploink, is 'Yoink'.. as the name implies, it is very similiar to sploink, except you take something random -out- of the unsuspecting persons trolley.. the more vital, the better a yoink it is. Things such as toilet paper are my favourite.. imagine Mr Husband getting home after being all stressed from his wife - sure he'll forget something, and an argument ensues about 'did you remember xyz?' he swears he did, but just cant find it. That'd get you bonus points. Anyway.. I look forward to hearing any stories of things you manage to think up - there are probably a hundred variations I havent thought of.  And the post title? express lane? well.. I wanna know why express lanes always go slower because of some mental retard infront of me, than a standard line? is that just murphies law? Motherfucks.  Peace out.
