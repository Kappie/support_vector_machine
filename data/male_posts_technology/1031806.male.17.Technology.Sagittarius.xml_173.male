(lol)  I was taking care of her dog Rascal (a beautiful white, Golden Retriever) all week while they were away (‘cept the last two days when her brother who’s in college was back in town). Two weeks ago, next Tuesday, I was at her house for a couple hours while they were showing me everything I needed to do. (btw, that was the day that she gave me a haircut)  For some reason they wanted to take the entire ride down to the Los Angels area (16 hour drive) in one day, so they planned to start out at 2 am. I called her at 1:30 to wake her if she wasn’t already up, but she had woken a couple minutes before I called.   I went to sleep and woke up around 8, before church Rascal seemed fine so I didn’t worry about her until later. After church, I went with Goody’s family over to a park near their house for a family reunion thingy (no I’m not part of their family… technically – lol). It was so stinking hot…I left their after an hour or so and went to the other side of town to another park where my dad’s small group (formerly also my mom’s) was having a picnic. Josh M, Jesh, Josiah and Emily were there, and we talked for a while. I got the opportunity to try out phone’s new AIM compatibility – it’s ok, but IT WON’T SIGN OFF WHEN YOU WANT IT TO!!! – Annoying since it seems to interfere with calls and other operations. Josh, Jesh, Josiah and I stayed a while after everyone else left then went to Josh’s house. On the way to Josh’s I stopped at Gwen’s house to take care of Rascal for a while and was rather stunned to see her (Rascal, not Gwen) hanging around outside the front door… At first I thought that I’d been extremely negligent and not locked the gate (which I know I check before I left), so I put her back into the yard and started the other direction to go check the mail. When Rascal suddenly appeared beside me again, I decided that I could not have been stupid enough to mistake the gate being locked twice, so I started to think about it for a minute and almost immediately I noticed the sizable hole in the fence and the corresponding hole that she dug in the ground under it. After much phone conversation, we determined that I shouldn’t board up the fence, only fill up the hole and that I should leave Rascal in the house during the day, not outside in the back yard. Because of this, I spent around an hour extra with her every evening just to keep her company.  Remember back in my June 22nd post, when I talked about how much of an impact Gwen has had on my life, and that I’ve never told her? Well I was planning to spend a considerable amount of time every day that she was gone, writing a letter which I would leave for her, explaining all of it. I had set it as a pretty high priority in my mind - that’s why I think it was by God’s hand that I did not write it… It was so important to me that I do, but whenever I would sit down and start to write, I would get sidetracked or not be able to concentrate or something. Weird. Oh well, I guess I’ll just have to trust Him and see what He will work through all this.  O, I wrote Gwen that email back when she was on the Canada trip (my July 8th post), and I was right (haha), she didn’t check her email for almost two months. :-D ‘Ne way, here’s her reply:    armaan, you were right about my e-mail habits. i thank you for the prayer and tell your  friends thank you for me too. tell them to keep praying that what happened on  the trip would have a lasting affect on their lives. stay happy gwen   So people who were praying, be ye thanked. :)  Oh, another thing, I sent her a backward survey a long time ago and she just sent it back to me. One of the questions was “do you love me?” she answered “as a friend and a brother in Christ”. When I sent it back to her, I thought about it for a while and wrote “I care about you in a way, not necessarily romantic, but still special.” It made sense to me at the time, but now as I look back on it, I find myself more leaning toward the word romantic as a describer again. Hmm… I dunno
