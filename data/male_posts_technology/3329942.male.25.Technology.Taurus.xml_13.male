Bain in 'The digits of moon' wrote  In the begining, when Twashtri (The Divine Artificer) came to the creation of woman he found that he exhausted his materials in the making of man and no solid elements were left.  In this dilemma, after profound meditation he did as follows;     He took the rotundity of moon, and the curves ofthe creepers, and the clinging of tendrils, and the trembling of grass, and the slenderness of the reed, and the bloom of flowers, and the lightness of leaves, and the tapering of elephant's trunk, and the glances of deer, and the clustering of rows of bees, and the joyous gaiety of sunbeams, and the weeping of clouds, and the fickleness of the winds, and the timidity of the hare, and the vanity of peacock, and the softness of parrot's bosoms, and the hardness of adamant, and sweetness of honey, and the cruelity of tiger, and the warm glow of fire, and the coldness of snow, and the chattering of jays, and cooing of kokila, hypocracy of crane, and fidelity of chakravaka, and than compounded all these together, he made woman and gave it to man.     not a easy recepie for God even !!
