I told Anne I wanted the same cake for my birthday party.  She said "you never want a birthday party, you hate birthdays, you never want anyone to make a big deal about it."  Touche. Fine, then I want a big huge party this year, and everyone I have ever known is invited (except the old bitch, assuming her possessed earthly form still haunts the earth).  I will invite people from high school, college, Goldville, wherever.  In fact, everyone who reads this blog is invited.  See you in the Redwoods next year.  Listening to:  urlLink Ray Wilson , Change, Cry if You Want To.  Scottish singer/songwriter, most famous for being the last singer of Genesis, post-Phil Collins.  VERY good musician and writer.
