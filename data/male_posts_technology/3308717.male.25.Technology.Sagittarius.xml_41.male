Tool in general has always been one of my favorite bands. I believe nothing more needs to be said about this subject since it is obvious that I have covered all there is to be said. =)  If you haven't figured it out by now, it is in fact Friday. I will only be working a half-day today as I have a doctors appointment later on and I needed to get a few things done while I was at it. I've got a real craving for sushi right now, and quite possibly a bottle of sake could accompany the meal to result in a well rounded meal and a warm fuzzy mood.  I've noticed a few new people have actually stopped by. Not only have they stopped by, but they actually posted. Aren't I the popular one? Ok, so maybe I'm not *that* popular, but hey, it gets me through the day.  Sorry I don't really have news right now. I've been busy at work and just didn't have time this morning before I came in to the office. Speaking of the office, we are trying to decide which language we should migrate to when we do our big systems re-write. So far it looks like the majority are leaning to C#. The other main choice was VB.Net. I think either would be fine honestly. The languages in the .Net framework all compile down to basically the same thing so there really isn't much in the way of performance. Several quarks have been pointed out to me in VB.Net that I never noticed. I would probably ellaborate on it however, I don't see why most of the people reading this would even care. =p  My Comp class is almost finished. Summer A session is being a real bastard. We've had 1k word essays due each week. I have one small essay due tuesday discussing opposition to my argumentive research paper. I need to follow that with a rough draft of my paper on Thursday and then turn in my final the following Tuesday. That thursday we receive the papers back and take the final exam. So I am almost done... *phew*.  I'll see about digging up some interesting news, in the meantime, consider joining me and many others at the  urlLink Warped Tour  in Tampa, July 30. Their list is showing 161 bands on the roster. Mmmm music.    -intX    modifying the immutable since 1978.
