What is it about Gordy? He's the man. My roommate doesn't like him. I can forgive her for that.  Maybe.   So once I had a dream that I was this dragon. The king and his daughter were riding out from his castle into the snowy forest, but he didn't know that he was in danger.  I knew, but I was trapped in the dungeon with the king's son. We had been captured and chained to the walls. The king and the princess were captured by the evil men, and the princess was dropped into the lake with a ball and chain. Somehow, I broke my chains, and crashed through the glass wall of the dungeon that overlooked the lake. I dove in after the princess.... I can't remember if I ever came out.
