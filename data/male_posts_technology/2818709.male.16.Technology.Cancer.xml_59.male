The world of self-destructive tendencies, either through actual physical destructiveness or emotional breakdowns that you keep bottled up inside, thus hurting yourself. You feel that life is nothing but pain, and you see red in everything with the memories of the blood you have bled(literally or figuratively) for your hurting. You live in a hidden land that few will ever understand or see in you, because you keep it to yourself and only let a few rare people into the truth of your reality. Er...I don't condone my own actions, so I really don't know what else to say. Of course, you could also just REALLY like blood....or you might be homicidal, not suicidal. ^_^;    urlLink   Where do you belong?(ANIME IMAGES)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I guess those results are right.
