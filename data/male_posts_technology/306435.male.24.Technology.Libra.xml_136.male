My machine was not infected, but a good portion of the machines on my works network were and they all called on Monday.  Ahhhhh!  The rest of the week hasn't been so bad.  It starting to get a little warmer around here and the NKABL is starting to pick up.  I have a solid seven players lined up and two more on the ropes.  There is a manager meeting on Sunday that will give us a little better idea on where we stand.    Song of the week:  "Hang Down Your Head Tom Dooley" by the Kingston Trio
