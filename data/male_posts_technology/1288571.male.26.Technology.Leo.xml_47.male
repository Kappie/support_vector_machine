Now, after I installed it, it was a little overwhelming because theres just so much to do. Thing about the chat community in There is that they're all extremely friendly and helpful. If you have a question, just ask someone.. they're all willing to help and no one is a jerk. I've never experienced that anywhere on the internet before. Ever.  I didn't REALLY start having fun though until I convinced  urlLink NTUser  (a member of the A.D. forum) to join up.  Someone in There had lent me a dune buggy, so I let NTUser drive and I rode shotgun. Let me tell you, stay away fromt his guy if he's driving in your town! LOL He was going off jumps and running over people. It was so damn funny that I was laughing so hard I almost peed my pants.  This chat program is definately worth checking out. Head on over to  urlLink There.com  to sign up and download the client. Be warned though, the download is 100+mb and you need a broadband connection to join in on the fun.  If you DO join up, add Northstar (thats me! Spyder was taken) and NTUser to your buddy list :)
