The group picture is bad enough but the individual pictures and bios below are the real horrors.    I had long thought that role players were worse than boardgamers but maybe that is not the case, at least at the extremes.  But don't worry if the name  Steve Jackson  makes you think of  urlLink this  or  urlLink this  rather than  urlLink this  you are likely safe from this fate.  I, on the other hand, should be very wary.
