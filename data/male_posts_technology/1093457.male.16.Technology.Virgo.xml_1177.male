Feedback from yesterdays english from Paul and Lisa etc.. hasn't been too good. Ahh.   I went shopping yesterday in Croydon with James. It was a good giggle that. I manged to out eat him and his McFlurry. He couldn't hack it. Loser. Lol. Joking, joking. I got what I needed to get and so did James so I'm all set for Vday. Silly me, I was about to write on here what I had got for Paul until I remembered he reads this sometimes so phew, close one!  Good luck with exams today folks!!
