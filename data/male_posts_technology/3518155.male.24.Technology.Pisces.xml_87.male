This one's louder than the  urlLink Supro Chicago 51  I currently have. MUCH louder. I can finally play with some pride, dignity and honor.  The Prowler sounded great when I tested it out at  urlLink Dave Barrett's  earlier today. Good tone. Great volume. Good condition. So I bought it.   Peavey doesn't manufacture this model anymore but I did manage to find a  urlLink PDF manual  on their site. That's gonna be weekend reading material.  I dragged the amp over to practice with the Red, White  Blues later in the evening, and for the first time ever, I could actually hear myself! And all it was cranked up to was 3! I can't wait to  urlLink crank this baby all the way up to 11 ..!
