I only  wish  it was pills or booze or cutting, or something that might lead to an intervention with Dr. Drew and my very own stand out episode of this show, but I'm afraid this is far too serious for that.   The thing is, I can't stop watching  urlLink My So-Called Life .  Is there a support group for this?  Because I think I'm beginning to regress and show symptoms of teenage angst and I swear for five minutes today I wondered if  urlLink Jordan Catalano  would notice me if I dyed my hair  red  Crimson Glow.   Please, this is my cry for help.     urlLink      urlLink Which My So-Called Life Character Are You?  Find out @  urlLink She's Crafty
