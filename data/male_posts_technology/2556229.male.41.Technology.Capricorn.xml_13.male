If you can't control the amount of food you place into your mouth you do not have an illness. You are not sick. You have a character flaw. Its not that big a deal. Pardon my pun. We all have them. I have a very bad temper. I can be smug. I have been known to abuse.. let say 'my poisons.' Combine that flaw with the other two and you have a pretty wicked combination. Well you get the point.. Enough about me for now. Lets get back to fat people.  I came across this  urlLink ABCNews.com  article today about "Fat-acceptance Activists" and was surprised to agree with their basic premise that being fat is not a decease. Where we part ways is that it is OK to let yourself be fat. They claim that you can be healthy at any weight. That's a lark and they know it. Among fat people one may be healthier that the other but generally speaking being overweight is unhealthy. If you have a medical condition that causes you to be fat that is one thing. Get the condition treated and then lose the weight. But if you are just fat because you eat too much then accept the fact that you have a character flaw and deal with it. Just because two thirds of American adults are fat doesn't make it OK. Being fat leads to disease at an alarming rate and is preventable. Stop stuffing your face and exercise.  The article cites the annual cost of obesity related healthcare at $100 Billion. CNN has an  urlLink article  that has the number at $75 billion with the public paying about $39 billion of the through Medicare and Medicaid. That is $175.00 per person. So when you do your taxes next year just think about $175.00 is going to treat someone's diabetes because they couldn't put down a cheeseburger. That is a lot of money to cover something that is preventable. We have had a collective conniption fit over cigarette smoking, seatbelts, drunk driving etc.. What about obesity? Are we so afraid to offend somebody that we refuse to help them save their own life?  Now I'm for helping people as much as the next Liberal but I think we can help fat people in more constructive ways. Saying "your fat and that's OK" is not going to get it. I'm not saying we should be rude to fat people or discriminate in any way, but we need to let them know that being fat is a sign of their own personal weakness and they should be ashamed of it. Fat people should have to pay for that seat next to them on an airplane that one of their wings is rolling into. You should not have the right to some jobs because you are fat. I think there should be weight standards for Police and Fireman. Too bad. Encouraging something that is unhealthy by making special provisions for it is nothing more than enabling the weak willed to feed their character flaw.  Now back to me, its always about me isn't it? For Christmas 1999 I was blessed with a pair of really cool pants, size 38/30. When I tried them on I could barely get them buttoned. I went back down stairs and someone suggested that we exchange them for bigger ones. I thought it for a second and felt my gut drop, literally. How had I let this happen? I spent 13 years in the military and was in good shape when I got out 3 years earlier. I got on a scale and realized I was 5'10" - 221 pounds. Long story short, I dropped 30 pounds in about 2 months just by not stuffing my face with snacks all evening in front of the TV and doing some moderate exercise. 30 pounds with very little effort. When I turned 40 in 2002 I was hovering right around 185, which is still over weight for someone my height. But the weight wasn't what got me motivated. I didn't like the way my body presented itself. My wife would never say anything, but I felt like I needed a little tuning before its too late. I was working at a place that had a gym in the building. So I started working out and changed the way relate to food. I keep a diary of everything I eat. I don't really diet. I just know how much food I can eat based on my activity level and how much I need to limit myself to to lose weight. Not rocket science, just math. Now my weight hovers between 165 and 170 and I wear size 32 pants. I can walk 10 miles in 2 hours, I'm pretty strong with a fairly well defined upper body. I'm in pretty good shape. I've been as low as 159, but that too skinny for me. So dropping and keeping 50 plus pounds off for over four years is possible without too much effort. But there is effort and you have to stop stuffing your pie hole.  My own story is the real reason I have very little sympathy for fat people. Sorry, that's just the way it is. I don't consider myself anything special when it comes to dealing with my own character flaws. Lord knows I could have handled the other ones better. So when you are at dinner with a fat person don't be afraid to suggest a low calorie menu item. Invite them on that hike with you. Invite them to your gym. They'll thank you for it and you will be doing your duty as a good American to bring down the cost of healthcare for all of us.  PUT THE CHIPS DOWN!
