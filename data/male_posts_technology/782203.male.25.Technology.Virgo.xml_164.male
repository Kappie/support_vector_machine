Not sure which color would be best cos i dun have any of those browsers so if you are one of them then suggestions will be very much appreciated!   Oh ya a reminder : Making your scrollbars the exact same color as the background so that it is invisible is a big NO NO. It is not fun trying to figure out where the damm scrollbars are when you are trying to scoll a page. Not everyone has mouse with wheels ok. I seen some blogs like that , annoying as hell. Almost as annoying as those which loads music and force you to listen to it when you visit the website.
