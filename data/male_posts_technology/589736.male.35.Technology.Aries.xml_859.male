Not to mention that the main actress has a face that just makes me want to punch her.  So no, okay, you're right.  I didn't see it.   Call me close-minded. You're probably right.  But I also never saw half the Corey movies, which were all the rage at the time, and I don't really feel as though I've missed anything. Maybe I'll see it one day, but I doubt it will change my life.  Plus, with my impending nuptuals, I don't want to see a wacky "everything's going awry" wedding movie.  My own family is mental enough as it is.
