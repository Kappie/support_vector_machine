I stand by my assertion that the media is exceedingly biased, and towards the left.  Why do I think that?      Well, to begin with, 90% of journalists in the US have voted Democrat in the last 4 or 5 presidential elections, which proves nothing, but sure adds context to the discussion. Also, 4 of the top 5 newspapers are decidedly liberal in their editorials. And, no, I don't think that the media lies to the public, as much as they filter all news through their ideology before giving it to the American people. The media provides the information that supports their world view, even if it means not providing context or ignoring things that contradict their ideology. A perfect example of this is the debate going on about 'Bush lying'. There is no reason to go into this, as I think it has been beaten to death in other threads. Or you can look at the way that the current deficit is portrayed in the media - largest in history, without context of what actually causes the deficit to be that large (social programs) or that it is not as large a percent of the total budget or GDP as deficits were under Jimmy Carter in the 1970's. Look at how the media portrays the tax cuts as benefitting only the 'rich'. They never point out that high income is very different than high wealth. Wealth is how you measure 'rich', not income. They also never mention that after every major tax cut, total tax receipts increased because of the benefits to the economy. They talk about how much less the 'rich' pay as a percentage of their income, but not the fact that the 'rich' pay an ever increasing percentage of the total tax receipts, even with a tax cut. Look at gun control. The media continually repeats that the United States has a much higher murder rate than some countries with more restrictive gun control laws. But the media remains silent about the fact that there are other countries, such as Russia, which have more restrictive gun control laws than ours but have far higher murder rates than the United States. Or that there are countries that have higher rates of gun ownership, such as Switzerland, and have a fraction of our murder rate. The members of the media have obviously made a decision that restrictive gun control laws are desirable, which they have every right to do. It is when they try to make up other people's minds by filtering out information to the public that their opinion become a bias in doing their job. Or, look at abortion. the pro-choice media prefers the term "fetus" to the more disturbing "unborn." Stories in the media are never told from a pro-life standpoint. The rights of a father in making an abortion decision are never discussed. In the early 90's, the liberal Los Angeles Times admitted abortion media bias:   "Most major newspapers support abortion rights on their editorial pages, and two major media studies have shown that 80 percent to 90 percent of U.S. journalists personally favor abortion rights. Moreover, some reporters participated in a big abortion rights march in Washington ... and the American Newspaper Guild, the union that represents news and editorial employees at many major papers, has officially endorsed 'freedom of choice in abortion decisions.'...        Responsible journalists do try to be fair, and many charges of bias in abortion coverage are not valid. But careful examination of stories published and broadcast reveals scores of examples, large and small, that can only be characterized as unfair to the opponents of abortion, either in content, tone, choice of language or prominence of play." What about homelessness? The Wall Street Journal's OpinionJournal.com, after George W. Bush's election, began publishing the "Homelessness Rediscovery Watch." Why? When Republicans assume power, the media seems to suddenly rediscover homelessness. The Media Research Center tracked interest in homelessness during the latter part of the Clinton administration. From a MRC report:       "Homelessness -- one of the media's favorite tools to portray the alleged downside of Ronald Reagan's '80s prosperity -- was a more serious national problem during Bill Clinton's 1990s. ... Patrick Markee of the Coalition for the Homeless admitted ... 'Definitely, we saw more homelessness in the 1990s than we did in the 1980s.' But we saw far less homelessness on TV sets during the Clinton years. "During the first Bush administration," according to the Media Research Center, "morning and evening newscasts on ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN ran an average of 53 stories on homelessness annually, compared to less than 17 per year during the Clinton administration. ... The expanding homeless population was out of sight during the Clinton years but just three short weeks after George W. Bush assumed office, ABC won the race to be the first network to rediscover the homeless. On Sunday, Feb. 11, 2001, "World News Tonight Sunday" anchor Carole Simpson intoned: 'Homelessness, which is estimated to affect from two and a half to three and a half million people, is again on the rise.'"   I assume that most people who become journalists do so to 'make a difference'. And 'making a difference' is what the liberal vision is all about. Both are groups of people that have a vision of an idealized society, which is both noble and impossibly unrealistic. You also encounter this mindset of an idealized world among the intelligentsia and acedemic elite, so these natural tendencies are reinforced along the way. Reporters try to encapsulate a 'problem' in the form of a single example that can be aired on the news. The difficulty with that approach is that sometimes the 'problem' doesn't exist in the manner portrayed or is so unbelievably complex it can't be solved. But that doesn't stop our intrepid do-gooders from trying to 'make a difference'. Now, I don't find fault in the majority of reporters. They are trying to do a job they believe in, and should be commended. However, when they cross a line and try to 'make a difference' by framing a story a certain way, or try to pass judgement on a situation they are singularly unqualified to discuss, it is a serious problem. Plus, they worry about making their stories 'accessible to the audience'. Which means dumbing down the subject matter and making it palatable. For example, when reading about homeless people in the media, they always seem to interview the nuclear family of father out of work, mother worried about her two kids that have fallen on hard times. They never seem to interview the junkies or mentally ill people, even though 90% of homeless people got there because of either mental illness or poor life choices. The reality is that people with the the 'noble vision' desire to change the world, based on the wisdom of the few. And they naturally drift towards those professions that allow them to do that, regardless of all of the evidence that contradicts the plausibility of that vision.
