As a part of the war on terrorism, and as an effort to bring peace to the world, the USA wanted to disarm Saddam Hussien of the weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  Given the aggression shown by Saddam Hussien in 1991 by invading Kuwait, and the resolution 687 passed in the UN, and the defiance of Saddam in refusing to comply with the UN weapons inspectors, it seemed the logical thing to do.  However, after President Bush identified Iraq as a threat to american security in the axis of evil in his state of the union address in 2002, efforts had gained a momenutm to disarm Saddam or face serious consequences. Consequently a new resolution 1441 was passed by UN security council giving Saddam a last chance to comply.  Hans Blix and Mohammad elBaradei were the chief UN weapons inspectors and their efforts were bearing fruits. Disarming is a not an overnight process. It takes time. Even the nuclear disarmament agreement between USA and the then USSR was slated to take 10 years.  Granted that Saddam Hussien was given enough time to disarm since 1991, then why were the inspections stopped in 1998? Was he not a threat then? Or did America felt secure then?  What America wants to do may be correct, but the way they are carrying it out is certainly not correct. Also it raises questions about the genuineness of American concern over Iraq's alleged WMD. We all know all this is about controlling Iraqi oil, which has huge oil reserves. But according to me, it goes beyond Iraqi oil. America wants world domination, and wants to be the supreme leader of the world.  It tried to do that economically. But it found that its economy very fragile and finicky. Also the emerging economies in Asia like India and China are much more stronger and cheaper. The labour is much more cheaper with better quality. So that attempt was unsuccessful. Now US is trying to gain world domination by force. US' military might is undenialy the strongest in the world. But does that give US the right to bully its ways down opponents throat? What better is US then, than the back alley bully?  Bush has openly stated that he wants to restructure the middle east. Who has given US or more specifically, Bush the authority to do so? And for what? To serve American interests better? Not surprisingly the arab leaders are angry and afraid at the same time at the american intentions.  The war against Iraq was totally unnecessary. America wanted bin Laden. It was not able to find him out. It was a failure of the celebrated American intelligence agencies. So now they want to cover up their failures by diverting the attention to Iraq.  If Iraq has WMD in biological and chemical form, then what else can we call the American Nuclear arsenal? A child's toy? Can we ever forget the Hiroshima - Nagasaki holocaust??  I know that this piece may look ragged with no connections between pieces. But I have written down the thoughts as they came to mind.  I only hope that the War on terrorism should not become the  WAR TO TERRORISE  by the US...  Please feel free to send me your comments.
