Got some 2 used combats, 2 for £10, not bad and today I will hopefully get the camo jacket to go with it (£5) so I'm happy. I got to ride on a tank yesterday which was so much fun. The track was all bumpy and dirty and we were whizzing along I tells ya! That was my second tank ride so far, its worth it. I am eyeing up a job with tanks, the great beasts of a armored vechile!  Jackie comes back today or tomorrow. Not sure which but I'll be soooooooo happy when she comes on msn. I'll be all grinning and cheering.
