I have heard of alcoholics or dug addicts having a brief moment where the logical mind makes one final, intense push for the person’s attention, the so-called “moment of clarity”. I definitely can relate to that from a depression standpoint. No matter how miserable or messed up the Beast has made you feel, there are moments where your logical mind forces you to look at everything about yourself and your world, good, bad, and in between, with a non-judgmental eye. Intervention from friends, loved ones, or even just caring strangers willing to help another human being, is very helpful, but sometimes the realization must come from within. If you can recognize this and honestly appreciate the good parts of life, no matter how briefly, I think it gives strength to carry on, to struggle though the darkness, and hope for recovery.  My heart hurts with the realization that there are many who cannot or will not see the good and gain strength. I think I have gained more compassion for people who seemingly have nothing to live for, but they probably do. It is just hidden too deep for them to see, shrouded in a fog of mental illness or addiction, and it is even more difficult for anyone else to see.
