       
      I’m so fucked up, so crazy right now.  Everyone stay away from me.  I started to run away, I almost made it, and then I came back.  I was doing so good for a couple of days, too.  How fast things change.  More than anything else, I guess I just feel ashamed and stupid.  What do I think this is going to accomplish??  Pain suffering, heartache for everyone, not just me.  ------------------  Nikki was pushing me again.  Every bedtime I get so mad at her, because she will not listen and not just do things.  She has to screw around with animal noises, being slow, stalling, whining, complaining, refusing, ignoring.  Last night she did the same thing, but it went too far.  I was trying, pleading with her to just brush teeth and go to bed, so I could have a few minutes alone, so I could quietly rest.  I told her, “Please do this simple thing so no one gets mad, nobody cries, nobody gets in trouble.”  She would not do it and would not answer.  “Please don’t make me get angry at you, I don’t want to yell.”  Again, just looking at me, mot moving, not responding.  Getting impatient now, I say “Why are you doing this?  Do you want a problem, do you want yelling and crying, do you want me to be mad?”  She just looks at me, now with a twinge of defiance in her eye.    I am losing control inside, and I am ready to start breaking things.  I start repeating “Go do it, NOW”, louder each time, until I am yelling as loud as I can.  She looks away for a second, and I slam a book on the table inches from her, scaring her into motion.  She runs to the hallway outside the bathroom and kneels on all fours like another fucking animal impression, while I follow her to keep her moving.  Yelling again “GET UP NOW”, I nudge her with my foot.  Then I have the urge to kick her hard.  Mentally I feel myself swinging my foot forcefully into her ribs, feeling her small bones cracking against my foot, hearing her scream in a sudden mixture of shock, pain, and fear, kicking her again in the butt hard enough to break her hip bone and my foot at he same time...  I am blurring the line between reality and dark, hateful fantasy.  I have to stop, I have to control this mad urge.  I manage to force my foot to remain pinned on the floor, and I yell at her, “I am so mad right now I want to kick you and hurt you.”  She yelled something equally childish to me, then runs into her room.  [no, I did not do anything to physically harm her]  A minute later, she comes out in to the living room and says to me, “I hate you, I want you to die, I want to hurt you, I want to stick a sharp knife in your head,” then runs back to her room.  This hurts so bad, but I have to tell her something.  I follow her and get almost face to face, and very quietly say:  “There is nothing you can say to me or do to me that will hurt me worse than I hurt myself.  I want to hurt myself all the time.  I say bad things to myself ALL THE TIME, worse things than anything you can think of.  I want bad stuff to happen to me, and I think about it ALL THE TIME.  I hurt myself worse than anyone else ever can.”  This was too much for her, and she turns away and lays on the bed, crying quietly, then louder as I leave the room.  I am sitting, hating myself and the beast within me.  I think about stabbing myself repeatedly in the arms and hands with a knife or maybe an icepick.  I think about the pistol upstairs, grateful there is no ammunition in the house.  I think about taking a bat and destroying everything in the house until I cannot pick up my arms.  I briefly think about wanting to hurt my little girl, and I start crying.  Soon the sadness disappears, the tears dry, and there is nothing left but hate and loathing for myself, for the Old Bitch, for the Beast.  Anne comes home and immediately senses a problem.  “What’s going on?”   I say nothing for several minutes, a long, heavy, oppressive pause as I am mentally testing various explanations for my latest downward spiral.  Finally, I say “OK, do you really want to know?”, almost in a challenging tone.  “Should I?”, she asks.  “Yes, you should.”  “I had to struggle to keep from hurting my child tonight.  It was all I could do to keep from kicking the crap out of her, hard enough to break bones, hard enough to need to take her to the hospital.  That would have got your attention, huh?”  Thinking about further ramifications, I say “that would have got lots of people’s attention...  or, what if you were at home, you tried to stop me, and I take a swing at you instead?  Or, what about me wondering if taking half a bottle of antidepressants would give me a heart attack or a coma?  Or what about the urges I get to fling myself over the cliff driving on the highway just to find out what it is like to fly?  Or, what about the fact that it is a good thing there is no ammo in the house for the gun?  Or what about the urge to simply destroy everything we own, tv, windows, stuff, just break it all?  How about that I think you and the kids are better off without me, that I need to get away before I hurt someone else?”  I finally run out of words.  Through this outburst, I am not really looking at her, I don’t have to, but I glance over to confirm her shock and surprise at me.    “I’ll bet you’re sorry you asked, huh?”  I let that thought sit there as I go into the bathroom, leaving her in shock on the couch.  When I return, she has gone upstairs to cry on the bed.  I stood for a few minutes, debating what to do.  Finally, without really thinking and without saying a word, I grab my keys and wallet and rush out the door with a slam, get in the car, and drive off before Anne can react and try to stop me.  Well, now what, I think as I start driving toward the highway.  I am filled with a hundred conflicting destinations, thoughts rational and otherwise, and an overbearing self-ridicule.  A part of me is trying to be detached and logical about it, but I’m not listening: “Where the hell are you going to go?  What will you do when you get there?  Won’t it be worse every mile you go?  What about tomorrow?  What about the next day?  Doesn’t it get harder every day you don’t return? You are being irrational, melodramatic, impulsive, out of control.”  I am just driving, through town, aimlessly north on the freeway, the lines leading me onward, 20 miles without even changing lanes, oblivious to the few cars on the road.  This road goes for 500 miles, I was thinking, without having to turn off.  There is a sense of escape conflicting with the guilt I feel with every mile.  As I pass Trinidad, the last lights I will see for a while, I get a sense that I am have reached a decision point, a threshold between a do-over and for-real.  As the last lights fade, the logical part of me checks the gas gauge out of habit and experience... and the rest of me grudgingly accepts that I can’t run anywhere without more gas.  I flip a u-turn across the divide and go back to Trinidad.  While getting gas, I go inside the mini mart for coffee.  The guy says “have a good night, man.”  Yeah, it has started off so well this far, I think, driving away... but I don’t get back on the freeway as I intended, instead continuing on the old road parallel to the freeway, leading south, toward home.  I am driving somewhat aimlessly, but I realize at his point that I cannot run any further away.  I make my way back to town indirectly on side roads, passing our old house where Dan was a baby 11 years ago, passing the street to Anne’s parents’ house, passing my office, then turning around and sitting in the office parking lot for a few minutes.  I’m aware that my presence in this neighborhood well past midnight might attract police attention, which I don’t want right now, so I park in the shadows and turn off the lights.  Then I pick up my phone, 2 hours after running away.  Anne answers on the second ring.  “I’m sorry I am such an idiot, such a fucking failure to you”, I said.  “I was waiting to get a call from the hospital or the police”, she says without accusing, but it still hurts me.  “I don’t want to kill myself, that’s too easy ... I just want to hurt and punish myself.”  Pause.  “I’m sorry I can’t control this or handle this mess any better.  I guess I’m being childish, running away.”  Longer pause.  “Do you want me to come home?”  “Yes,” she says, and starts crying.    So I head home, through the fog, the grey blanket shrouding everything and everyone, most of all my heart.  I think about trying to put Humpty Dumpty back together, and I wonder if we have been irreparably damaged, despite my return.  I return to a dark house, and go upstairs where she is waiting awake in bed.  I undress and get in without either of us saying a word and without touching each other.  After a few minutes, she finally turns toward me, and we hold each other, somewhat guardedly at first, not quite a full embrace, more from relief than anything else, no hint of passion.  I feel the sadness and the hurt coming from her (can she feel mine?), but I can’t say or do anything.  Finally we simply let each other go, and it took about an hour to fall asleep.
