Written by an Italian from Boston, Massachusetts -- it's a wonderful world we live in.  All the best redneck songs gotta start with one four-letter four-syllable word, you know what that is?    Thats hard work...  Whaae haeeee heeelll llllllll.... I.  Had.  To pawn, the gun.  To buy the bullets."    I was introduced to this stylistic anomoly by my good buddy Baka (a.k.a. Josh)  I heard on local radio station WABB that Mike West was going to be at "Guy's Gumbo Shack" tonight, although as their broadcast area is the Mobile/Pensecola area primarily, I'm not exactly sure where Guy's Gumbo Shack is.  I think I'll Google it!  Update:  urlLink GUY'S GUMBO SHACK  (251) 928-4100 2 S CHURCH STREET FAIRHOPE, AL 36532  Thats just a few blocks from my house...I wonder if I'll go?  Update 2 :  Called Guy's, and Mike West is indeed playing tonight, at about 9pm.  Decesions decesions.  Do I go and have a good listen, or hermit myself within' a game?
