We jumped on to the front of stage and started dancing (well, almost) and jumping and howling. I can still feel the vibration in my bones. Then a DJ started playing remixes after remixes and it was an electrifying environment with smoke and disco lights. And for once, nobody reminded themself of their gender.   After all the weekend merriment am looking forward to this friday when I'll be starting my week-long vacation covering rini's marriage in Madurai to spending until the next weekend in Chennai.
