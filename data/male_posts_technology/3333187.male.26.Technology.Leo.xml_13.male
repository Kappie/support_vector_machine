So I finger I may try the following..  1 )Gather a bunch of Mir-cats and train them in the mystical arts of accounting. Then rule the financial market.  2 )Go the deepest darkest parts of the Peruvian Jungle, find a hoard of Spider monkeys and try to be excepted by there group. Then take controller and take over the jungle.  3 )Gather crazed Blind Tibetan Monks. Drop them into the Dublin swear system and tell them there on a journey to find the fabled soft rock of POO-TIG.   4 )Go the Australian outback. Strip naked, covering yourself in strawberry jam and run around screaming "I LOVE BEING REBORN". See if one of two things happen. a) You are arrested for indecent conduct. b) You die of exposure!  5 )Stand on the Dublin Mountains with a copy of "Paul Merton's - Mass hypnosis for dummies". Hypnotise all men of Dublin in thinking Red is Green and Green is Red. Sit back at a major traffic light junction and watch the chaos!!   Can anyone tell it's a quiet day in work!
