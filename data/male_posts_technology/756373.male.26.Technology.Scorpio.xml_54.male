I live with my folks still. Yup, 24, still living with the folks, how pathetic , I hear you cry. No matter, think what you will, personally, I prefer to try and save as much money wherever I can - freedom is overrated, having money is not. Anyway, back to the topic : one of the parental units left for a week to Washington DC, and I must say, it's refreshing. Much as I love my folks, it's good to have a "breather" from it all. Possibly a reason for never having been involved in a meaningful relationship, is that I just can't stand people, I detest "maintenance". Well, that's it. Not much else to say today. Bought a new case for my PC which I intend to install tonight in blissful silence without demands for  whatever  being rained down upon me.  Sweet lonesome bliss.
