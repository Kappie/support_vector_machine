They are skiing and I’m snowboarding. I have been a few times before, French Alps, New Zealand and Bulgaria. Bulgaria rocks - loads of really cheap beer (a pitcher for the equivalent of about 30 pence.. get pissed on a fiver, yes please!) and miles of bootleg CD's and knock-off clothes.  New Zealand was fun as well, until I fell off a chair lift. I had just lifted the safety barrier and I was perching one butt-cheek off the side, when I lost my balance and fell about 15 feet onto the deck, landing with a nasty "oomph!" sound. A sympathetic ski instructor helped me up.  Also on the same trip we got all three emergency services out during a drinking binge. Myself and the guys I was travelling with bought a shed load of booze and started drinking with some Japanese in the hostel. That's the great thing about drinking games, it breaks down cultural barriers.  So several bottles of spirits later, we hit the streets and try and walk up about 100 yards to a club. However most of us our now completely steaming, and one guy (from Kent, I think his name was Paul) has passed out on the pavement. Not good. So this passing police car pulls over and they an ambulance. Eventually the paramedics arrive and take Paul down the hospital. The cops are thinking about arresting us but I persuade them not to and say I’ll take everyone back to the hostel. I look around and one of the Japanese has slid into the front seat of the ambulance and is about the turn the sirens on. Sweet Jesus.  I go to bed and in the morning I found out somebody pulled the fire alarm for a laugh and got the fire service out as well. Hat trick! :P
