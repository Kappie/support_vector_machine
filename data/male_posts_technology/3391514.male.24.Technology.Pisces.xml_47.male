The test campaign was my old Alien Powers game from quite some time ago - a space game with incompetent captains, ships that don't work and bizarre alien races.  Combat was difficult.  For one, my presently poor eyesight made reading the rules I had written tricky.  This was compounded by the poor lighting conditions of the roleplaying area.  Further hampered by PC incompetence, the test served to highlight two things:  (1) Combat is very slow if you don't know the rules (2) There are two states if you get hit - intact or dead  Some revision needs to made, methinks.  In addition, some more  Fallout 2  was played... I'm beginning to like the game, although I constantly wish I'd made slightly different character choices... like CHA 7 and END 6 instead of CHA 8 and END 5, no 'Finesse' and 'Scout' Perks, and so on.  I've also discovered a better way of taking my eyedrops that minimises discomfort.  Note "minimises" - its still bloody uncomfortable.  No updates on the PBeM either.
