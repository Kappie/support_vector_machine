 I think I might prefer this device over the Tablet PC, because it uses the power of my desktop machine. I need a beefed up desktop for gaming. You are tied to your desktop and your home via Wi-Fi, but that is where I would use it anyway. I still haven't figured out if I can use it as a  second monitor , then pick it up, and use it around the house. I can't imagine not being able to do this, but it would be the perfect scenario. Also, I imagine it doesn't have the cool Tablet PC software as well, so I am not sure about inputting information, or is it just primarily meant to be a "read-only" type of device. I'll have to do some more investigation before I decide. Check out more info on  urlLink Viewsonic's Smart Displays  at their  web site.
