It's even better if they look cool and cost a lot, which means they're quality after all ;)  Most of the time the honeymoon with these new wonders is rather short lived.  They get used and abused daily for a few short weeks, then they are relegated to the garage, closet, or Goodwill.  Because of this I've become a bit jaded about the whole thing.  I tend to drewl over things for a while but almost never buying.  I just picture the poor things fate, locked away in some dark corner covered with dust, never to live up to it's full potential.  My view of toys changed however when I bought a  urlLink 2004 Yamaha Vino Classic .  It was red, chrome, cute, and absolutely ridiculous.  And I rode it everywhere.  It was, at the time, the best toy I ever bought.  My wife liked it to. In fact, most days it was a fight over who got to ride it that day.  Parking being what parking is at almost all Universities she normally won the fight.  See, one of the best things about a scooter, other than the insanely cheap insurance and 65mpg, is that it normally can be parked at the bike racks.  This is, of course, ends up being much closer than she could park otherwise.  The disputes lasted for several months.  After a while I just couldn't take it any more, this was my ball, and I didn't want to share!  So I made the fateful decision to visit  urlLink New Urban Transport .  A company her in Albuquerque specializing in higher end scooters.  When I walk in the doors I found the toy that would forever steal my heart.  It healed the pain from all my previous man-machine relationships gone bad.  It was  urlLink silver and shiny , with big wheels and nice curves.  I had to have it.  Needless to say it went home with me that day, and we havn't been apart much since. I can tell you it's a joy to ride, goes a good bit faster than my other bike and seats two.  The wife and I run around town on it all the time and laugh a secret laugh together whenever we pull up next to a 28 foot family assault vehicle.  If anyone has any interest in a scooter I highly suggest you find a local dealer and give one a spin.  You may agree that itâ€™s the best toy ever.
