Basically, just watch five movies and rate them and MS will send you a free, not-for-resale, copy of VB.NET 2003. This worked out good for me since i have VB.Net but not the 2003 version.  So whatta ya say, even if you don't program go do it and get a copy and learn yourself something.   -intX    a free-for-all, fuck 'em all!
