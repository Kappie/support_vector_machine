I don't know what else to say because I can't seem to remember what happened (I am barely awake right now). I have a new computer consulting job today in the neighborhood for the first time. It has been a week since Maggie died. The house still seems empty without her. In GarageBand, I have 10 cool songs that I will be selling on my own album. My iTunes library went from a little over 600 songs to over 900 songs now! I'm not sure what the weekend will be like, but i'll try to tell you as soon as I find out. Thanks!
