For those of you not geeky enough to be following this corner of the news (how did you get here?), SCO is suing IBM claiming that IBM shared SCO's intellectual property inappropriately.  As always, there are miles and miles of details I could go into about this.  However, I'm lazy.  The short version is that SCO doesn't seem to have a case.  Some people have expressed the opinion that SCO only began litigations to inflate their stock price.  Well, the other shoe has dropped on SCO.    urlLink  IBM has filed a countersuit . If this  was  an attempt to boost  urlLink l=on"> SCO's stock price , it would seem to be failing.
