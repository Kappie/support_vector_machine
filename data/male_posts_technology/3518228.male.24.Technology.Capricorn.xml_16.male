The visual effects were really nothing short of amazing. The  urlLink Battle of Pelennor Fields  was... wow.  just wow.  The  urlLink Dead  were very, very well done.  Doesn't  urlLink Orlando Bloom  ever get tired of being in movies where he sails on a ship crewed by the damned?  Oh, and  urlLink Shelob  is very cool.  The plot follows the books fairly well.  They add a few things, none of which were terribly offensive.  They left out the Scouring of the Shire.  This annoys me, as the Scouring of the Shire expresses Tolkien's belief that isolationism isn't a viable policy for international relations.  They modified the Pyre of  urlLink  Denathor  a little, but I like the change they made.  The  urlLink  palantiri  aren't really mentioned much at all.  The romance between  urlLink  Faramir  and  urlLink Eowyn  was glossed over.  Oh, but other than that :-)  Did I mention wow?
