Yahoo's attempts to block Trillian have proved futile (there's already a patch out to fix it) and their excuse for doing so is so unbearably lame, I can't believe they used it!  They said they are trying to block third party IM programs to keep SPIM (Unwanted IM messages - i.e. SPAM for IM) down.  This is complete bullcrap as the anyone who uses IM can testify that SPIM is a minor problem (unless you're on ICQ) to say the least.  I don't think I've received a SPIM on Yahoo for the better part of the past year, and I'm on IM  constantly .
