The art of discovering temperament and other characteristic    qualities  of the mind from the outward appearance, especially    by the features of the face.    2.  The  face  or facial features, especially when regarded as    indicating character.    3. The general appearance or aspect of a thing.  I've been doing physiognomy for years without even knowing it.. Know I just need to practice pronouncing it..
