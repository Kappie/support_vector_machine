My sister said Seaward left the one on his door up and I think Mr Weston found his one amusing. It was fun while it lasted. I got an email from Mr Bennett because I sent him some of the ball pics as he wasn't there. He wante dto know what Helen was doing in one of the pictures and I quote him when he says: "what is helen doing with her face in the limo?". I couldn't stop laughing at that. Anywho, yes. Got up about 20 mins ago. I have German second lesson then I'll be over to collect Jackie for lunch and revision. I have already have 2 texts from Doe and a phonecall from Jenny which didn't get far because her battery ran out. Brilliant. See you all later!
