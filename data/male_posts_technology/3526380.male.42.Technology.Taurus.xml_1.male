But it has been getting progressively harder and harder to keep going back into the breach each day.  Like most people, I don’t mind working and keeping busy.  In fact, I am generally happier and more satisfied with work if I am busy rather than bored with nothing to do.  But I hate being faced with nothing but a never-ending series of problems with no solutions.   I don’t mind tackling problems and finding creative solutions, but nothing will take the fight out of person faster than giving them problems with no solutions.  Or putting the solutions outside of their reach.  That is the quickest way to completely demotivate a workforce.  So I went for a walk about mid morning.  Nothing much.  Just went for a walk around the sidewalks around my office “campus” (question: is the word “campus” meant to make us feel better?  I mean, who are they kidding?  Its not like there are guys throwing frizzbees and pretty coeds lazing under trees reading books).  I’ve found myself taking these walks more and more lately.  I reach a point where I am in my office and start feeling the pressure bearing down to the point where I almost can’t breathe.  Usually it is a result of getting berated on some conference call or emails demanding solutions which are not in my power to provide.   So I go for a walk.  In my fantasy, I am running away for good.  I imagine what it would be like to start walking away and never come back.  But I do come back.  I have to come back.  In fact, usually my cell phone starts ringing if I am gone more than 5 minutes.  Ringing with people demanding solutions to problems where no solutions exist.       Recently, I was talking with my father about careers, etc, over a couple of beers.  My father is 70 years old and still still the smartest man I have ever met, no matter how old he or I get.   I pointed to my empty beer bottle and asked him, “barring an accident or abuse which would break the glass, how long would you expect this bottle to last if it is used properly?”   My dad replied, “I don’t know, several hundred years if no one breaks it.”   Then I asked, “How long do you think it would last if I used it to hammer nails?”   He replied, “Not very long, I imagine.”     People are like that in their careers.  If they are utilized to do what they are well suited for, they will last a long time without breaking.  But if they are utilized for something they are not suited for, they will eventually break.
