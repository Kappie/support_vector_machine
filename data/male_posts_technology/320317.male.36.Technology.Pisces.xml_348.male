When everything goes well, the product can redefine a market or even create an entirely new one, to the benefit of its manufacturer and its consumers. When the product doesn't click with its audience the costs can be staggering. How do you ensure that your new product doesn't flop? One effective method is to conduct a requirements definition phase before developing a new product."

 OK ... don't most firms already do this? Most projects I have worked on have had this done in the beginning stages of the product. The only issues I have experienced are clients who don't take the time to figure out what their customers or users really want rather than building something they think they may want, which in a lot of cases can be completely different things.
