But I am astounded to hear that Srini has been buying you a lot of dresses. I have to talk to him about that. If he says that you always take a lot of time to get ready to go out somewhere, it is his mistake ;-). He buys you a lot of dresses and then he complains you take a lot of time to choose a dress and get ready.  BTW  I'll send my story this weekend. I don't have it at office.   Kicha, where are the answers for the quiz that you had sent. I am eager to know the answers that the others had sent. Mail it soon.  I guess you all have been enjoying a lot of holidays at your respective concerns. I have over 60 days off for me, 52 sundays + 10 cl. Poor me!  Bye,  Jax. visit  urlLink this .
