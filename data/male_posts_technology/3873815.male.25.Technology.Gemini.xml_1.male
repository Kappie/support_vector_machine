I can talk to a complete asshole stranger across the world and tell him why his head is so attracted to his own rectum after the comment "But she's only a woman so her comment doesn't count!" and chat to a friend who i've not seen in almost 20 months (as he's in china) and even drop a few e-mails to a mate traveling across europe.  Imagine this upotia, this communication hevan.  What could possoble ruin it?  Try talking to someone in the same town as you using the same technologies as you would communicate to people around the globe, and you hit a bloody brick wall.  This is the weeks litany of hate, "Fucking Phones!"  I sent 16 sms messages to a pretty good mate of mine, sent him 3 e-mails and 5 message minders.  Result, he got 1 of them that i know about (received a delivery note) and no reply.  Sent 6 sms messages and an e-mail to another friend asking where we were meeting, result, we all stayed at home waiting for contact.  The broadband is working and the mobile is on, so why can no-body be reached?  The answere came as rather a shock.  Appartently, the sms service in my town is prone to outages during and after storms.  We had a storm about a fortnight ago, and they still havent sorted it?  So what about the e-mails? Due to technical difficulties by my e-mail provider, messages will be held in a que until the server has been upgraded.  Expected to be finnished on the 21st july. Thats over a fortnight away, and they started the work with out informing anyone.  Inspired internet management.  So what about the home phone option, surely someone would have answered? Nope! I've rang various people over the last week, and there all busy. doing something/one else and can't come to the phone, or are not there.  And yet i can get in contact with someone on the other side of the planet.  Does this make sence?  Personally, i'm a little pissed with all this, and the future loks to be even worse.  Contract renual time is coming up on mobiles soon and thats when numbers usually change too.  Ever get that deep dark sence of forboding?
