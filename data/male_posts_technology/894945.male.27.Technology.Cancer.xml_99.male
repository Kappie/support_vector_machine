Baity launched the ball about 10 foot up in the air by accident, and it landed in the next lane, almost going straight through the floor. The manager gave us a disapproving look but didn't say anything. I was going to head into town afterwards but the atmosphere there was crap, everyone seemed in a really shitty mood and gagging for a fight.   One girl I used to work with was in the taxi queue at the same time as me, and the bloke behind me put his burger carton into the bin and returned to his place. She shouted at him that he was pushing in, calling him every name under the sun. She hadn't noticed me and I said.. "Hey, it's me... Adam" and she said "Uhh, Adam.. hi" I motioned to the poor sod she was screaming at, "This guy wasn't pushing in.. he was just put his rubbish in the bin" and she said "Well FUCK YOU ADAM!" Charming.. it's amazing what alcohol does to some people. I really am going off town now. I'd much rather stay in with a bottle of wine and a DVD, or go out for a nice meal instead. Dear lord, I am getting old...  I even did some gardening today, how scary is that? I'm turning part of the garden into a Japanese theme, with a Buddha and a water feature. It'll be great for chilling out and meditating under our big apple tree.  Crap link of the day -  urlLink see how fast you can type.
