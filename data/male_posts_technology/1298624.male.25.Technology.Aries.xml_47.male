Maybe it's when you're younger as well, but I highly doubt that...since energy is expended probably two to three times the amount of grown adults (depending on the amount of exertion you put your body through each day). Either way, the more rest you get, the better off you'll be during the day.  Conversely, the same could be said for the opposite. If you get too much sleep, but no activity whatsoever, then your body starts to slow down. Your immune system becomes lazy and weak. You must be wondering why I'm talking about all this. Well, for the first time, I will be doing a graveyard shift here at the help desk. It's going to be interesting, seeing as I will be the only one here from 9 pm - 6 am. I also find it curious that they shut off the fan and air conditioning units after 9 pm. I wonder why. People are still working in the building. It should be a concern that life support systems in every building have to be on for these people. I've been warned that it gets sort of warm in the 5th floor. I'm guessing it'll be no warmer than my room on a hot mid-day Saturday with just the fans running.   So it'll be a full day tomorrow (Thursday). 7:00am to 4:00pm (I can then go to Liz-Ann's house, take a nap and eat....I'll probably need to take a shower too...since I can't stand not taking one everyday). Then I come back to do a 9:00pm - 6:00am shift. I do get an hour break between 6:00 am to 7:00 am. Then, I do my regular friday shift of 7:00am - 12:00pm. After that, I will proceed to sleep 16 hours.   I've thinking whether or not I should go to the LAN party. I could go back home...get some rest and then head over. I don't know, I'm still thinking about it. I don't want to push myself too far. I know for a fact Liz-Ann and my mom wouldn't agree to it. But we'll see how I feel.   I just checked shi.com and they have ONE of my configured laptops in stock. I'm just wondering if it'll be shipped out to me. It better...cause I'm getting sick and tired of waiting. I have so many things that I need the laptop for...I really hope they send this one out to me (or at least, they will get more in stock so they will finally release the backorder on the item).  Warcraft III is starting to suck. I can't even create a goddamn custom game anymore within Battlenet.
