The sad part is that people really don’t realize that it’s happening.  At least they don’t understand the extent of the damage to our industry that has already occurred.  There are thousands and thousands of people working for US software industries in this one small city alone.  The worst part is going to be when people realize that there’s nothing they can do about it.
 
 If you think the economic disparity in the US is bad, you should see this place.  I haven’t had the time to explore really, but just driving from my hotel to the office shows the highs and lows of living in India.  There are so many people in this city who live in rubble.  I mean, this is the filthiest of filthy as far as living standards are concerned.  These people live in huts that are basically a blanket hung over a wire.  And right next to these shanty towns are some of the nicest houses…houses that would go for millions of dollars in the US.  It’s amazing.  The paradox is almost comical.  These people live in absolute squalor.  Their front yards are just piles of dirt and broken stone, yet they spend a large part of the day sweeping their front porch.  It’s really sad.
 
 But really, it’s this type of disparity that is the ultimate driving force behind the Indian take-over of the US software industry.  I was watching the news last night when a major executive was explaining the reasons why he has outsource several thousand computer jobs to India.  His primary reason was not cost, he said.  The primary reason was talent.  Yeah, right.  The primary reason is cost.  Don’t get me wrong.  These people have loads of talent, but consider how they live – what they see around them everyday.  There are billions of people in this country.  If you are going to be one of the people who is not living in a shanty barely able to find enough food, you’d better work hard and you’d better be good at what you do.  What else can motivate you more?  Sure, they’re only getting paid $10, $12K a year, but that’s way more than you need to get by here.
 
 What drives the average US software person?  Money.  The software industry was a cash cow five years ago.  Companies could not find enough people.  Which do you think is going to drive a person to be better?  Cash, or survival?  There’s nothing more motivating than knowing you might die if you don’t succeed.  America stands no chance, and should just start moving toward re-training itself in newer technologies that cannot be so easily shipped off-shore.  It’s their only chance.
