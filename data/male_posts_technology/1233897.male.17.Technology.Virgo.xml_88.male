Consequentially, I was really annoyed when I failed to wake up at my alarm’s designated sounding point (9:30), but rather woke up at 11:45.  I got up, jumped in the shower, grabbed a piece of toast, and walked, in the rain, down to Andy’s house.  I got there, spent an hour talking to his dad and him about all their high priced computer paraphernalia, and started playing computer games with him (on 2 of his 9 computers upstairs).  We switched over to XBOX when Gwen arrived, and continued on it until half an hour before they left for work at 3:45 (they both work at the same grocery store).   I then walked up to Bwitty’s house, and talked to her step-dad for a little while before heading further up to our house (Bwitty and/or Jamie were not home).  I made myself some lunch, sat around, and cleaned up the house for around an hour, before heading back down again to see if they were home yet (the time frame her dad had advised). Alas, they weren’t, so I gave up for the day and headed back.    People from my bible study started to trickle in around 6:45, and everyone had arrived by 7:15.  We spent around 1½ hours playing XBOX, eating pizza, and talking, and spent around an hour on studying the Bible. (lol)  I think we need to rethink our priorities when attending this study.  Anyway, everyone was gone by 10:20, and my mom and dad drove me back down to Andy’s house (he and Gwen had just gotten home from work at 10:00, but sadly, she had to stay home).  He, his dad and I talked more about computers, then played XBOX together.  It was fun.  My parents picked me up at 12:25, and here I am, at my computer, right now   Listening to: El Shaddai - Holy Spirit Medley Feeling: joyful, exuberant, eyes heavy (dumb contacts)
