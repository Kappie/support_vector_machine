We have 2 window units - the one in our living room (that also gets the kitchen, bathroom, and hallway) is blowing warm air. The one in our bedroom still works OK, but it' pretty much does the bedroom only, and doesn't help much.  Time to call the landlord again.  Sad thing is we had it recharged like a week ago.  may be time for a new unit (yay).  I'd love it if she just put in central air, that'd make me smile, but I think there's about as much chance of that happening as there is a chance of me becoming a millionaire.  In which case I wouldn't be renting this little house anyways ;)  So the game dev is VERY near completion, we hoped to have code complete this weekend, doesn't look like that will happen, but demo-level code is complete on my end at least until the lead programmer gets his stuff in, and then I'll be able to finish off my last bit of demo-flagged code (hopefully that'll happen tonight).  I still have more stuff to finish before the game is done, but it's definitely the end now.  If what's left on my plate is all that's left, then I think I can finish it before school starts - which would be good since I won't have much time once school hits.  Oh - father-in-law may have hooked me up with a new contract now too.  Some company that needs a database mgmt system to track their inventory or something.  Apparently they've been managing the whole thing with a spreadsheet so far, and it's getting to be too big (HAHA, imagine that!)  so sounds like a simple database insert/update/delete form is all that is needed.  Heck, if they have access, and it's only one user, I won't even bother to make a full program, just do it with Access forms in an afternoon ;)  They were paying a PC tech like $300 to install/setup a PC so they must not be too scared to pay for their tech. This makes me smile.  might make a decent wage off of this one.  later all Phil.
