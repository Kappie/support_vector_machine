Or something that has to just happen... Can you turn love on and off? Is there a switch that says I could love this person or no?  What about growing pains? Are there things to learn from the growing pains? Is there a magic key for becoming the right person? Or are all relationships a work in progress, a commitment to find equal ground? When love fails what is left? A friend, a past love? Do you press on or call it quits? Is there a silver lining?  I'm going to bed, I have work tomorrow, Peace- Tim
