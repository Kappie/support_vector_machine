Halo 2 should be out November 9th, and Fable should be here September 13th.  There are other games I am interested in (Sudeki, Jade Empire, Starcraft: Ghost, Operation Flashpoint, DOA Ultimate, Leisure Suit Larry, Conker, et al), but these are two that I am willing to pay full price for.  For Halo 2, I want the Limited Edition version.  For Fable, the bonus disc.  For most games, I am content to wait until they are available as Used, or until they drop in price a bit.  For example, I would like to have Full Spectrum Warrior, Ninja Gaiden, Pandora Tomorrow, Rainbow Six 3, and a few others.  I have enough games to play for now that I can wait until the price drops a bit.
