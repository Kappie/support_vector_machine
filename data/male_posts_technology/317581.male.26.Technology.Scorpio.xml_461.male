I don't understand cruel people. But the real question, I guess, is "Do I understand myself?"  I have been given a disease that will eventually destroy my body. I've inherited it from my father. I will pass it on to my children. My base root self needs to procreate and I would like to have an heir. I've watched my father disintegrate before my eyes. He will die like Johnny Cash, but hopefully not to soon.  I wish I had a love of my life. I am a HOPELESS romantic. I know I could be a good lover. Now all I need to do, is invest a little more time in a lady's life.  Well, I'm off to Oregon, Peace-
