PErhaps not quite so much as Bon Jovi, but after such a wicked concert anything would be hard to follow! And Nicki, I had a fab day with yo u and Helen and Tom, was a good group to go with, and I have a big bruise on my back from when u knocked me over taking my shoe off! But I had fun. Meatloaf was really good, I can live happily ever after now I've seen him do the full version of "Bat out of Hell" live, I felt a bit lonely tho cos nobody else knew all the words (well, apart form the old fogies!) but hey, I had fUN! I am very burnt though, and it is rather painful. My back is all prickly and so are my shoulders, and my face is quite a strange pinkish colour! Not a good look, especailly when wearing a red t-shirt, but I suppose it's my own fault really. Anyway! Yay! Probably come back alter.
