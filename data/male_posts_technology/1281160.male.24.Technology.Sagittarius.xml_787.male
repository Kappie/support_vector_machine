And ya friends i want to know who are ur favourite writers and what are ur favourite books.   Voracious readers like Jax, Sindhu, Valli, Kicha, Ram can post some reviews of their own on what they read recently on blog na. All r busy with tight schedules i believe.  Btw, i am going for a two day pilgrimage tour to Tanjore and Kumbakonam. I will be back on monday. Those are places rich in temples in and around the city. i think we will have a nice time, visiting and imbibing some beautiful sculptures in us.  bye for now!
