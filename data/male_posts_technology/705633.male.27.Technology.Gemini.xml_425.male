Its currently sitting at home on my sideboard, I have yet to actually get home to see it, but I think my sister is a bit jealous, as she wanted to open my card. Problem is, who would send me a valentines card? Who even cares that much about me? The last time I had anything for valentines was a tube of KY from my (now) Ex and a note she left me. He, he. I had fun that night. (I also got some leather handcuffs that year as well. Brilliant! Don’t chaff like the metal ones do…) Or is it someone winding me up? Hell, who cares, Gristy‘s got an admirer, Gristy‘s got an admirer, Baity hasn’t! , Baity hasn’t!
