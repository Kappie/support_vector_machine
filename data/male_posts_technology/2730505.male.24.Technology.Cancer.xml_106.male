What the fuck is your GOD DAMN Issue?  I told you a week in advance so that you can tell YOUR mother, who ultimately takes care of Bryce because you are too busy smoking your fucking pot and being lazy doing nothing else but be a fucking bum, to not go anywhere because I wanted to take Bryce to the zoo.  I wanted to take him to the fucking zoo even if that entailed being around you and having to interact with you.    You know what, I envy people who can cleanly break all ties with and not have to deal with their ex-significant others.  I don't have that.  I don't want to deal with you anymore.  You always continue to let me down and let my plans down.  There was ample time for you to tell your mom that I was coming to town.  There was ample time for you to have him ready for that one day that I was going to be there.  There were only a few things that you had to do so that it was possible for me to take my own damn son somewhere so that I can be a dad to him.  You can't even do that.  You even had the fucking nerve to be upset with me because I was upset that I couldn't take Bryce.  Don't try to pin this shit on me bitch.  Don't tell me that I didn't tell you early enough so that your mother could know.  There was a week.  A whole fucking week.  Seven days.  One hundred and sixty eight hours.  Ten thousand and eighty minutes.  I gave you at least that much to tell your mother.  You couldn't even offer the idea of just leaving Bryce at home with his grandfather while your mom and sister went out and bought her prom dress.  At least take him for the day.  I was up at 10 waiting for your call.  I called before going to lunch but you didn't answer the phone.  You could've at least told them that you were taking Bryce so that I can see him.  You couldn't even do that for me.  That's seems so simple to everyone except you.  There's always something that magically appears and fucks up everything that I try to do.  I mean really.  The time before this, there was a fucking "misunderstanding" (more like you didn't tell them) about when I was going to be in town that they went out of town.  Hell even before that, you couldn't take a fucking week off so that I can take Bryce out to Florida.  Shit I was even paying for you so that I could at least take Bryce and have him see my family.  I was going to pay for you and I told you about that plan three months in advance.  you never did ask to take it off from work.  You never did once ask at your job to see if you can work more hours before or after to make up for the lost time.  Not the slightest effort.  I expected more but I guess that was expecting way too much from you.  Just too much.  A simple phone call after I called last weekend to your mother would have sufficed.  Just to let her know that I was going to be in town.  A call on Friday night to let me know that you did talk to your mother about the plans.  A call in the morning to let me know that he was going to be available.  A call after noon after I called you Saturday afternoon to let me know what is going on with Bryce.  If you also picked up your fucking phone once in a while that would also be great.  You fucking bitch.  You can't even help me out here?
