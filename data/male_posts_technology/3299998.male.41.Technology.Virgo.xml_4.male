Although an old article it is still very relevant and I don't think much has changed since when it was written (Oct 1998).   I find his writings to be well researched and enlightening.  His perspectives are easy to relate to. He often phrases his statements as questions so although he makes his bias clear he leaves you room to make your own conclusions.  I recommend anyone with interests in agriculture or the environment to read this article as it is easy to read and entertaining.
