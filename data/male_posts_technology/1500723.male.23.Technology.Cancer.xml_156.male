They are not simple SMTP servers. But do we use more than SMTP or Pop features from them..  The expansion of simple messaging has headed in many other directions. Most notably, Microsoft, IBM and Novell have each built comprehensive 'groupware' – online collaboration systems – that use messaging as the basis for robust environments designed to facilitate communication between employees.  Instead of simply passing messages, groupware systems allow for the creation of customised data views and interactive database applications that combine input from many people. Because they're designed for many users, such systems make the digitisation of many business processes – for example, the processing of an annual leave form – relatively simple because it can be automatically passed between necessary signatories along a predefined route.  This makes groupware a sort of publish and subscribe model, where users subscribe to specific information streams and are given access to that information as it's published by other interested parties. Since everybody in a groupware system is accessing the same central information, they can work in groups around that information.  That's the biggest difference between groupware and standard messaging, a point-to-point model where the work is the information. But it's a powerful differentiator that makes groupware a real consideration if the employees in your company frequently work on projects in teams. Major groupware systems now also support instant messaging, allowing group members to seamlessly find each other and communicate no matter where they happen to be.  Messages are digitally signed to identify their sender's identity – meaning that all messages sent within the system can, with a high degree of certainty, be accepted to have come from the person from whom they're said to have come. If this type of authentication is important to your business, you'll definitely want to step up from messaging to one of the more sophisticated groupware packages
