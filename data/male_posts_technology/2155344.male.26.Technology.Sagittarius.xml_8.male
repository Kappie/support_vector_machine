Its not as sunny. We might go out for hiking and do something fun.  AG is feeling better this morning.  Mom Dad, I got your comments. heheh..cool. Thanks so much for your wishes. My sb trip is confirmed. Good thing is i'm not driving. I'm flying to sb on Thursday morning and coming back Friday. =) We'll talk to you tomorrow night.
