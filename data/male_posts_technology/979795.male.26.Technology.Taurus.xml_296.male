We had a good chat and I was really happy to hear that she's got herself attached just recently. Can tell that she's beaming the whole night from the conversation about her new beau... haha. Think it's about time and she definitely deserves it.  Was thinking back since the day I knew Lynette back in 2000. I remembered it was still in NS, prior to our departure to UK. I got no idea how, but we had chatted on mIRC and then ICQ. Somehow or rather we met in UK after that. The person I knew then was really quite temperamental. Most of us would be 'afraid' of offending her somehow. But now, she's really quite different. She's a good friend and she has controlled her temper a lot. Her willingness to go out of the way to help a friend and standing by her principles are just some well noted points of her strong character. She deserves everything that life has given her because she's worked hard for it. A good listener whenever anyone of us needed a ear to grumble to. Hah :P  After this long good talk, I rushed down to Siglap for Aikido. Today's class was good. It incorporated soft feeling techniques (morote dori ikkyo and nikkyo waza, if I got them right) and some jo equivalents as well. I could actually feel the techniques working. I managed to co-ordinate myself for some techniques to blend wif my uke. Kokyuho was done with Bridgette (spelling??), I noted she has a very strong way of doing kokyuho. Very good and effective. She's able to 'feel' the strength I'm exerting out and divert them to move me around, I'd say, pretty effectively to a certain extent. But I can't do it well. So much I can learn from a sec sch kid. Puts me to shame man. Haha ... Still, it was a good night.
