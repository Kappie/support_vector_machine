Die!) was being a bastard. As you can imagine, this has all of us in a state of wild excitement. We've just canceled Kaia's farewell dinner (sob, sob) so we can stay home and remain glued to our screens.   We love you and will keep you updated on this world first as news breaks.   Over and out.  P.S. Aren't you glad I told you to support Rangers? Watched the highlights last night on  urlLink SBS  and was thrilled!  P.P.S. Did you get my postcard? :)
