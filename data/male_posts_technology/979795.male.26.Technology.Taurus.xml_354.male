I'm quite pissed with myself actually because I didn't manage to get good shots using Eileen's digital cam. Most, if not all, were way too blurry and fuzzy. And to make things worse during Sensei's certificate presentation I didn't manage to snap the photos fast enough either. Haiz ... I should've spent more time using it before the actual presentation. Either that or I should've used the videocam to record down the whole sequence. In any case, I messed up.  Anyway I tried liao lah. Can't do anything about it now.
