I must admit that I started reading the book to hear mainly about Shandril Shessair's, main character, infamous ability of slinging spellfire, an extremely rare ability to throw raw magic as flames to harm and heal and also absorbs spell affects thrown at her.  Needless to say even in her vast inexperience she is an extremely dangerous person capable of slaying dragons, men, and mountains alike.    It is a very atypical Forgotten Realms novel since the main character, for more than half of the book, is a snot-nosed weakling incapable of defending herself against the dangers of the wild, much less the Zhents, the Followers of Bane, and the Cult of the Dragon, not to mention any mage of note coming after her in a repetitious folly of certain and the last second save of a Knight of Myth Drannor.  All of that aside it is a very good book capable of holding your attention as each page turns to see how powerful and dangerous this spellfire really is.  Overall a good book.
