Where's the beef?  Let's start by looking at the large, successful open source projects. I can count them on two hands: - Linux - Mozilla web browser - Apache - jBoss - Open Office - MySQL  Of the above list, four of them are good enough that they easily be used in place of expensive competitors (Linux, Mozilla, Apache, and jBoss). If I needed a Unix server, I would definitely go with Linux. But not for desktops, of course. But I'll still give it a passing grade for it's server usage.  The other two OSS projects (Open Office and MySQL) are good for some things but not for others. So they only get partial credit for being successful.  Every other open source software application in the known universe is either a niche success (ie: I don't consider a 'spam filter' or a 'notepad-replacement' a large enough project to count), or an outright failure.   So why does a web-site like Slashdot fall over itself to declare proprietary software "dead" after the business failure of ONE vendor? Open source projects "fail" all the time, as more than 100,000 projects on sourceforge are currently inactive. Other than the six noted exceptions above, why should MY company rely exclusively on any open-source project instead of buying an off-the-shelf package? When you compare having access to a tech support call-center to having access to the source code, business owners will choose tech support 999 times out of 1000.  Maybe I'm like Bill Gates --- I can see the appeal of OSS for the anti-Microsoft crowd (like Cringely and Slashdot), but I don't see the appeal for 97.9% of the rest of the population (according to recent Windows usage statistics).   How is the OSS model better than closed source model? Noone has been able to convince me yet - both have their pros and cons - and Cringely's article does little to clarify the argument.
