So it's Friday night - what are we going to do? - as usual we're a little indecisive - not a problem. Start rounding up the troops - and eventually something good is bound to happen.  A couple of friends - 8 or so "Brother's of the Cult" finally end up going to Moxies Bar and Grill. Damn drink specials! 710mL bottles of Corona and Heineken for $6.55 - that's insane. If this isn't trouble in a bottle, I dunno what is!  She said she didn't know me - she said I was sweet... but anyways...  I managed to finish half of one of the Heineken's - and I was gooned. I think the waitress laced it with something - she wanted me - baaaaaaaaaaaad - little did she know - that all she had to do was ask. But anyways - I manage to finish off 3 of the tall ones... and I could still walk. Then the leader of the cult gets me involved in some cult like activities in the parking lot. I played the fly on the wall for a bit - the wall was a window though - I think the girls inside dug the fly.  And now we're off to a party - at a very nice house - large back yard - that a bunch of Christians are hosting - Christians are fun people!  I go inside the house - to the kitchen. This beautiful girl spots me... pipes up - "Hi, how are you?" Completely blown away by her forwardness - she must be drawn to my new muscular physique - that's the only reason she'd be talking to me - of course - score. Little did I know that she was just bait - to the biggest Christian Venus fly trap ever! So I start talking to her - and she asks me "Who are you? Who are you hear with?" Oh I'm here with Justin - who knows Matt... little did I know that they were unsure of who Justin was. All of a sudden I'm meeting the rest of the people in the kitchen - somehow they're all family members - who'd have thought! Even mom was there - "Oh and this is Mom - why don't you go say Hi" Naturally drawn to the older types - I start telling her about the last time I was at her house - and she asks "Oh were you at the party where the chair came through the kitchen window?" PAUSE Hmmmmmmm - No, I don't remember that happening. You had a chair thrown through your window? That's crazy - but you know - kids these days eh - get a little wild at times. Anyways, at this point I've had enough fun talking to the old goat - so I make my way towards the door to go find my gang again. I'm stopped at the door - by one of the "family members" who looks nothing like the rest of the family. "Hey" he says, "I'm so and so" - I'm like yeah we just met - 5 minutes ago... he's like oh yeah - so who are you? I'm Shaun - I know Justin who know's Matt who's house this is - your brother I'm assuming. Wow this is turning into a game of 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon. He's like - who's Justin... I'm like - Justin - knows Matt - are you even listening to me? You're not going to win the game if you don't pay attention. He's like you better come with me. I'm completely shocked at how difficult for them this is to understand. He wants me to go talk to mama again... I'm now rushed into a back room where Mama is waiting for me. The room is basically filled by this huge bed - mama is standing beside it. Could this be some weird kind of cult initiation - a "Christian taking" as it were - little did they know I've already be taken by many Christians, so this would be nothing new. However, now I'm slightly frightened due to the fact that I'm now surrounded by two Christians next to a large bed - they just keep questioning me as to who Justin is - they need to find out who he is before they'll feel comfortable with me in their house - why not just ask me to leave - now I'm trapped until they find out who he is - I can't leave!!! They're like buddy you stay here - mama is going to go and find Justin... I'm finally reunited with my buddies - and Justin is nowhere to be found. Great - now we're all trapped!! Thank god there's no bonfire going - I'd have been burned for being an outsider. 15-20 minutes pass and mama never comes back... we decide to make a run for it - leave... the Christian guard is now gone. We find Justin and he's like "What did you do?"  Nothing! I did nothing... I just walked into the Kitchen and was taken aback at how friendly they were - the new me - trying new things thought I'd try talking to new people! Little did I know they were just policing the party - bunch of crazy Christians - you shouldn't open your doors to guests and then torture them!   Never again!
