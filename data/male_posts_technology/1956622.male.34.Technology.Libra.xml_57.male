Now she is being O'so nice!  No doubt trying to manipulate me.  Karissa and I talked about her going to the library and she was planning on checking out books and playing on the computer and apparently she had a friend from across the street with her.  We talked about silly stuff.  Karissa told me how she wanted to have a ladybug cake and a spiderman cake.  I told her that much cake in a little girl her size might make her do silly things :)  I told her how grandma sent a present to her and stuff but again she did not seem all that excited about the notion of coming to daddy's house.  I just want to hear her be excited like she is when she tells me about other things she is doing.  So after about 15 minutes the need to hang up and stuff overtook her and she hung up.  I had very little sleep today about 4 hours but then I went and got a haircut and ran some badly needed errands.  I also worked on the homework and stuff trying to get it all done before I leave to get Karissa.  Now all I have to do is pack for the trip.
