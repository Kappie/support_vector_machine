They should all be in chronological order.   urlLink Lisa and Gwen running out toward the rock, as the rest of us go back.   urlLink Chris and Adam running to grab Andrew's frisbee.   urlLink The first chapel on Thursday.   urlLink Josiah growling "hi".   urlLink Ali sticking her tongue out.   urlLink Butters running to scare Gwen.   urlLink Trevor finding multiple ways to climb down off the rock.   urlLink Trevor running up the rock with the “micro-log”.   urlLink Josh throwing the “micro-log”.   urlLink People playing football in the sand a half-mile away, back at camp.   urlLink ”I *heart* Perry Mason” drawn in the sand by some seniors   urlLink Trevor dodging dirt clods hurled off the rock at him.   urlLink Gwen and Danielle walking away from us on the beach; Gwen carrying my jacket (lol).   urlLink Looking at the beach football game from the point that I got the picture of Danielle and Gwen from.   urlLink Pat, Sarah and other people playing mini-golf.   urlLink Trevor getting all excited before we set things on fire.   urlLink Butters in the forground, and an amazing shot of a storm cloud and rain in the background.    urlLink Butters and his “layman’s flamthrower”.    urlLink Trevor fueling the fire.   urlLink The crosses on the hill overlooking camp Wi-Ne-Ma.    urlLink The flag flying above the cafeteria.   urlLink The big sand dune.   urlLink Gwen sticking her tongue full of ice cream out at the camera.
