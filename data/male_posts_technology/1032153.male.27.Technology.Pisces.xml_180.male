I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right. We're more popular than Jesus now; I don't know which will go first-rock 'n' roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.    How sadly mistaken he was! God's kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. It was before the Beatles were thought of, and will be after they are thought of no more.
