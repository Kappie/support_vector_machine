She called the house twice and somehow I was not around to get her call and of course no message.  I feel bad because I call her everyday and today she called me back wanting to talk to me and was let down.  I know she will get over it and it is the way of the world but I really look forward to my talks with Karissa and I was not here to get her call.    Of course I left calls on the cell phone   SFW   called me on today (a number she never gave me) and of course she never got my message.  When I called the hotel room Karissa was asleep.  Now I know it is 8:45 PM but considering that Karissa has called me almost every night after 9:30 it must of caught up to her.  Naturally Karissa is a mile away and I still cannot see her thanks to   SFW  's demand that I leave them alone and I can be with her on my approved visitation.  I know I have every right to see my daughter but I am opting to avoid a domestic relations issue until the court can decide the issue.  I just feel like I may have let Karissa down.  Logically I know that does not make sense but emotionally that is how I feel. Today I finished my paper for this week and next week so that I can be free to spend time with Karissa.      SFW   must have made a payment for the vehicle as I am now getting phone calls from household again.  Man I hate dealing with those people.  I should not have to if   SFW   was making the payments.  I can only guess with $165 a week at the Hotel, gas, food, and payments for the car that she has found a way to bring in some income on the side (or on her back).  I also called Jeremey today and although I did not get to talk to him left a message that there was a meteor shower that he should be able to see tonight.  Anyway I will try Karissa tomorrow and with any luck I will talk to her tomorrow.    SFW   just hung up after she said smugly "she tried to call you three times"
