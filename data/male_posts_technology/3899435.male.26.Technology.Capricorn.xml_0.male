I have always thought that putting your thoughts into words helps streamline you thoughts. There are lots of people whose minds are filled with lots of thoughts. It is highly important that those people streamline their thoughts through some method like meditation, writings, etc. These people are generallys absentminded, opinionated, etc. If you mind is able to stick to one particular thought for longer period of time thats what people call as concentration. It all depends on how you can keep your mind empty. I have also heard the fishing helps keep you mind calm ;-)  I think this is more than enough for a first blog. If I were to continue writing this blog, may I want to talk about some of the things like "the system", information growth and the infinite knowledge to deal with, capitalism and its so called success, manufacturing consent by Chomsky and generally thoughts and life as such.   Have a good one.
