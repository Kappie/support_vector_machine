Good film, Johnny English, kept a smile on my face for the whole time, very good. Atkinson as good as ever, I don't think I've seen him in a new film or movie for ages? I also bought a little book for all you guys to write in on the last day of term - getting excited now, year 11s almost over! Nothing going on much in my life really. This looks quite interesting, somebody is going to turn the whole Who Wants To Be A Millionaire thing with the cheater into a movie  urlLink Millionaire scam to become film  - should be interesting.
