I just saw the final 20 minutes of the program with a long, crappy Trish heal promo and the main event that was... Kane VS. Eugene. WTF !!!!  Man, did I get a strong feeling this show sucked big tine. I am currently reading the forum posts at a wrestling site and it looks like everybody said that yesterday's show was a mess. Looks like I was lucky, especially considering that The Day After Tomorrow ended up being a pretty good and entertaining movie.   I will talk a little about what I saw and know about the show, but before I do, I would like to comment on the current rumored Great American Bash PPV Card. Apparently, this will be a Smackdown only PPV. Just read carefully, stop and think about it for a sec...  (here we go !!!)   WWE Championship Bull Rope Match Eddie Guerrero vs. JBL in a Bullrope Match for the WWE Title   Handicap Match The Undertaker vs. The Dudley Boys   United States Championship John Cena vs. Booker T for the WWE U.S. Title   Flag Match Rob Van Dam vs. Rene Dupree   Rey Mysterio vs. Mark Jindrak   WWE Tag Team Championship Rico  Charlie Haas vs. Chavo Guerrero  Chavo Classic   Kenzo Suzuki vs. TBA   Divas Beach Competition Dawn and Sable vs. Torrie and Miss Jackie (sub for Sable would be Jacqueline)    (okay, where back)  Did you have time to reflect on this card? Yep, you guessed it. SUCKS !!! Judgment Day part deux !!!! Okay, boy and girls, let's reflect on the low buy rates Judgment Day had...  Still, I'm probably being too harsh, considering that this is a better card that Judgment Day (but not by much).  Now, let's look at this card in detail.   The WWE Championship Bull Rope Match has some potential, since it's a gimmick match and could very well work. I'm pretty sure Bradshaw and Eddie can pull this one off, but it has to be something spectacular and, please, Eddie... be very carefully with those blade jobs cause you could actually die from that.   The Undertaker vs. The Dudley Boys is a Handicap Match? Oh, I hope this is just a rumor and not reality. What type of feud is this? And weren't RVD and Rey Mysterio feuding with the Dudleys?  The Undertaker is too overrated. Granted, that Hell in a Cell match that he had with Brock a few months ago (or was it a year ago, not sure) was pretty good. I am sure that the Undertaker can pull off a few good to decent matches, but against the Dudley Boys in a Handicap Match? Boring!  John Cena vs. Booker T for the WWE U.S. Title... first of all, what is a "U.S. Title" and how does it differ from the "WWE Championship"? The answer is that it's a less prestigious title. A consolation price. A paper title. Something to use in a storyline when you have little or no imagination to write a decent plot for key wrestlers. Booker T should win this title letting John Cena to move on the greener pastures feuding with Eddie Guerrero for the WWE championship. Heck, not that I want Booker T to win a worthless title, but if he looses, what the hell is he going to do? Retire, Mr. T. Retire.   Rob Van Dam vs. Rene Dupree... wasn't Rene Dupruee feuding with John Cena? Last I heard, this feud could have lasted one more month. That was quick! Still, this could be a good match if worker right. Could help either man.  Rey Mysterio vs. Mark Jindrak... Okay, this match might be good. In fact, could actually be an interesting opener. I like Mark Jindrak. I think he has some potential. Still, isn't Mark Jindrak a little too green for someone like Rey?  Rico  Charlie Haas vs. Chavo Guerrero  Chavo Classic for the WWE Tag Team Championship. Chavo Classic isn't exacly Eddie Guerrero. Also, Rico is a good wrestler and is being wasted in a dumb gimmick that is holding him back. Poor Charlie Hass... he probably misses Shelton so much. Still, this will probably be an entertaining match, but I believe that they could put out a much better match if they were all given freedom to cut loose and wrestle.   Okay Kenzo Suzuki against a "to be announced" opponent. One word for you... Mordecai. Hey, where is he anyway? I hope this wasn't another failed experiment on the WWE's part.  Divas Beach Competition... T n A (no, I don't mean the other wrestling federation). Yay !!!  Doesn't sounds like a PPV you would order, right? Maybe let someone else buy it and watch it with him. RAW's Bad Blood PPV sounds much better. A little more about that in a while. Now, onto RAW...  Like I said, I didn't watch the whole show. Just the last few minutes. Watched the Trish promo which went too long. She and Tomko had taken over the Jericho's  Highlight Reel. Now, sure, Trish makes a better heel, than a face, but I have this thing against promos that last more than three minutes and have redundant information (*cough* *cough* HHH *cough*).   Oh, I read we were treated to a long HHH promo in the show. Damn, I feel so broken up and bitter about missing that... NOT !!!!!   Anyway, Jericho comes out for an @$$ whipping... his. So, we have Tomko and Jericho for Bad Blood.  Then, the main event which, btw, I actually taught it was going to be the Highlight Reel cause it was taking so long. The main event was Kane VS Eugene and, boy, was this such a wrong thing to do on the WWE's part. Kane is feuding with everyone and their sister right now. Kane overload. Please, stop, WWE. You've done so much to ruin this character in the fan's eyes. No more.  Hell, I read Kain didn't even interact with Lita on this show. Now, wasn't the preview of the RAW show yesterday indicating something big was going to happen in this storyline with Kain and Lita? April fools !!! April fools !!! ...erm... Wait a sec? Doh !!! It's not april !!!   Now Kane goes after Eugene. Why? This hurts them both. Eugene is over with his stupid gimmick. Feed him some "lesser" wrestlers. Have him actually get involve with a feud that last a month at least. The coach? Please! Garrison Cade looks like an idea candidate, except that he is an up and comming star that could actually never live down the fact that he lost to a character with Eugene's gimmick.  I can tell you that the person who plays Eugene is very talented and has a lot of potential, but the gimmick is holding his back. He can't wrestle with his full ability cause he has to look retarded and confused in the ring.   On the other hand, when Eugene "gets mad", which is something that gets a big pop from the fans, we see a lot of potential in the gimmick. Reminds me a little of when Hulk Hogan gets bashed around and gets pumped and the crowd goes wild.   Still, this hurts both characters. Kane can't afford to lose cause it will damage his reputation (what's left of it). Eugene can't loose cause then the gimmick goes to hell and fans loose interest. What do you do? Quick DQ ending on the main event. Yay !!!  Benoir comes in for the save after Kane gets disqualified and starts betting up on Eugene. Afterwards Eugene and Benoir hug. Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww  Again, thank God I went to see Day After Tomorrow and I didn't see the rest of this show.   Okay, I read that we had a very good La Resistance VS. Edge and Benoir match, in which the tag titles changed hands. Now, what I dislike about this is that I don't like thrown together tag teams. Edge and Benoir were a thrown together tag team. They should have lost the tags weeks ago, but kept them for God knows what reason. In fact, the fact that they had the titles, but were feuding against other people in single competition proved to be a distraction. Now, they loose the titles for no apparent reason cause there isn't a single worthy tag team in RAW except the guys who won the titles. Who is going to feud with them? Hurricane and SHIT for the hundredth time?  Moving on, Randy Orton VS Shelton is what I hear was a pretty good match. Some interference to make way for their match at Bad Blood, which I think is the match that is going to put these guys on the map (even taught Randy Orton's last match with Mick Foley probably did that already).  Victoria VS. Jazz... I love Victoria, but I see that she came out with that silly jiggle she calls dancing. People hate it WWE !!! Please make her a psycho bitch again. She needs to have personality so that people will rout for her.  Also, Matt Hardy fought someone, but it was just an excuse to see Matt and Lita kiss. No kane. Boring. No more to say here.   SO, that was the show. No wait! There was also a long HHH promo. Weeeeeeeeee !!! And no Shawn Michales. What a great way to promote their hell in the cell match.   Taking into account all this, I will give the show a - D. Since I didn't see the complete show I found it fair to deliver this grade instead of a - F. I'm a just man.   Well, before I sign off, let's look at the current Bad Blood card:   Hell in a Cell Match - Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H   I think that these guys have chemistry. Been working together for a long time. And, make no mistake about this, they will make each other look like a million bucks. Not to mention they are probably going to break each other in half. I expect a good match from this pairing.  Heck, these guys can probably do a bra and panties match (which is one of the only gimmick matches they have yet to do) and deliver an excellent match (even taught it would probably be the most brutal and bloody    On a sad note, originally it was taught that HHH was going to loose this one cause he had to go make a movie or something, but according to reports Shawn Michaels is expected to take some time off following the Bad Blood PPV. This is because his wife is about to give birth to their second child.  Congratulations to Shawn Michaels.   So expect HHH to win and hold out till Summer Slam when Shawn Michaels returns to challenge him again for the hundredth time.    Chris Benoit vs. Kane  So sad. Kane has been discredited so much. I am not looking forward to this match, even though they are probably going to step up this match in the same way JBL and Eddie Guerrero did for their match at Bad Blood. I know Kane can do better than what he has been doing. Win or loose, I hope Kane shows everyone why he used to be a big hit as the big, red machine.   Tyson Tomko vs Jericho  Oh Lord, please don't turn this match into a handicap match (If I hear this has become a Jericho vs. Tomko  Trish match, I am going to puke).   Shelton Benjamin vs. Randy Orton  Like I said above, this is their time to shine.    Edge vs. Batista  I have a gut feeling that this match will help Batista if done right. Edge has had a lot of good RAW matches to get his street credibility as an "A" class wrestler again (his first match since returning from the injury against Kane did shit for him. Very lame match). This match should see these two put up a good show, but if you are expecting Batista to win (yeah, right), don't hold your breath.  Victoria vs. Gale Kim  I really want this match to deliver cause I like these two. I think that they can pull off a good match if they have their hearts and minds focused. Hell, they have the potential to show people that women aren't just for T n A (again, I'm not referring to the rival wrestling company). But, please, Victoria, no more dancing.   There is probably going to be another match announced. Probably Eugene vs. Coach (or preferably Garrison Cade). Maybe we will be treated to another Hurricane and SHIT vs. La Resistance match. Yuck.   sadly, nothing for Matt Hardy except. Damn, who did this guy piss off backstage?  Well, that's it for me. Gotta go back to work. I expect to watch the whole show next Monday. Hopefully, it will be a better show now that we are near the Bad Blood PPV.  Oh, and I will leave you with the following question... What the fuck happen to Tajiri?
