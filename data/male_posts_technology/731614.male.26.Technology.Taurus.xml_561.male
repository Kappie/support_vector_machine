Anything I need to be filled in on from my lack of attention on the zonk board?  Other news... In class today we watch a thrilling video called "The Secret Life of the Brain" but that is not the point.  The point is that PBS used the words...."the mothers sweet milk", and i almost vomited.  THE END
