So much so that it is called as the golden ratio. It has been said that almost all the things in the universe and the world are governed by the golden ratio or the golder proportion.  A classic example that mathematicians quote is of the rose petals. It is said that the angle between the rose petals and the bud of the flower is very close to the golden ratio. Some examples of the movements of the universe and galaxies are also widely discussed.  Contrary to popular belief, that mathametics and science are for people with very little or no sense of art, scientists and mathematicians have shown great applications or the ratio in art and ergonomics. Mathematically, a line if divided in two parts, with the ratio between the parts of the line equal to the golden ratio, then the ratio between the whole line and the larger part is also equal to the golden ratio.    GOLDEN RECTANGLE   A rectangle for which the ratio of the larger side (length) to the smaller side (breadth) is equal to the golden ratio, is very pleasing for the eye. The rectangle is called as  Golden rectangle . It is very well known that Leonardo da Vinci was a scientist, mathematician, as well as artist. His best know works,  Monalisa , and  The Last Supper  have got instances of the golden rectangles. It is said the the face of the Monalisa fits exactly in a golden rectangle. However, there are doubts and multiple opinions about the placement and the orientation of the rectangle over the face.  Many more examples can be quoted for the golden ratio. Examples of a golden triangle are also very widely discussed.    VAST SUBJECT   Mathematicians have written lots of books on this subject of the golden ratio. It would be very brave and foolish to claim that this article covers all the aspects of the Golden Ratio. My intent on writing this piece was to just serve as a primer and stir interest in the readers for this subject.  If anyone has more information or contrary to what I have mentioned, please let me know. Also if anyone has got more information and references to this, please feel free to contact me. This by no means is the end of the article. I intend to reasearch further and throw more light on this in my future postings.  You can mail me at  mukul_d@india.com
