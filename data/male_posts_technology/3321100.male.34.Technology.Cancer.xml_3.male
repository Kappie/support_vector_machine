In fact a lot of my friend are as romantic as a 200 kg Pink Pig. In each legend, there is a part of true, so perhabs we are romantic. One things I'm sure, it's that I'm really a romantic guy, but it was so hard sometimes... Pooor boy Bouhouhouuu. Sometimes I think it was more easy If like my dear father I had a lot of other women in my life. But it's physically impossible (at this time) I can't do something like this. So many guy make love with other woman than their wife... I don't know how they do that (Juju you don't understant me on this point)... I'had tried last year, it's impossible for me, I can't do this, perhabs it's because I 'm not able to hurt someone, in particulary my wife... But one things is sure, for me it's more dangerous and difficult (and hard to live) to fall in love to an other woman. And if I can control my sexual pulsion, I haven't found how to control my heart.  Perhabs I'm not a so Open-Mind guy ???  Look at this, it's a perfect picture of the real wolkam ;)
