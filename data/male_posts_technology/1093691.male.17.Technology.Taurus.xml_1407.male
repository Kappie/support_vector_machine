Hope your plans for the day are full of sleep and rest or in Pauls case working but getting lots of dosh!!!! :p I am offt o bluewater today, kinda annoyed I had to get up early. Ate out last night and will be eating out today so I'm gonna be fat on Monday. I am pondering buying some kind of excerise thingy. I like rowing machines but too expensive for me. Um what else. Oh yea blue fans are really bitchy. I made a post on the official blue forum to say I was selling some blue singles etc.. an dthey are all replying going 'omg how can you sell them i'd treasure them forever'. I'm like helloooooooooooo I am trying to help some of you out here! Idiots.    If you could spend a month doing whatever you want, going whereever you want where would you go and why and what would you do?
