I didn't know na ang camp gale sa Caliraya would be a National Youth Camp, all along I thought it would be a Church Worker's Retreat, anyway, I'm getting more excited cos this will be my first time to attend a National Youth Camp. :D  Gemsy, thanks gid for helping me kagina ha! Cge, kit-anay man ta dugay sa Yuppie Cell Group cos I'm going with Ahia! hehe :)
