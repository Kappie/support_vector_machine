I tried to register my name as an email address (not my full name of course) and I was prompted to create a username with six or more characters. This prompted me to become extremely sad as I was expecting to have edgar@gmail.com as an email address. Oh well.   urlLink La Pucelle Tactics  will be mine very soon. I have not even dented Disgaea and now I'm diving headfirst into another strategy RPG. Not a very wise thing to do, but I figure that if I could pass one level per day, I could make some progress into Disgaea. I heard you have to pull in some serious time to level up characters, but I feel confident that I can pass the game. It's a good thing La Pucelle includes a way to level up faster for more fast paced gameplay. While I would like to spend 100+ hours levelling up my characters, I'm pretty sure I have something better to do.   The  urlLink Star Destroyer  is still in construction. Tis another thing that I should be investing time into completing (being that it cost me $300). The question after finishing this behemoth would be the destination and/or resting home of such a large LEGO structure.  Linky Linky. I seem to like linking things. I had an extreme impulse to purchase  urlLink Super Puzzle Fighters  for my Gameboy Advance SP. After much deliberation though, I figured I'd stick to Alex's Puyo Pop for my puzzle game fixes. I may end up changing my mind though.  Aack! More phone calls! More later...
