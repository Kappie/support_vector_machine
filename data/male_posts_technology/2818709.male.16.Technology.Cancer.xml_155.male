And the girls would spend $300 on a customer service call. to find out that they really do have a virus, and it IS going to erase their hard drive. They just wasted $300 on a service call. With no real service.  **Update**  I was told to say to change that generalization. So. Here.  1 or 2 girls would know that it was spam. IE: Dani/Diana. Maybe devin. Depending on how much caffiene/sugar she had.
