As for the rest, I had to go to school to get my report card (shitty, but o well), and was surprised to see that I got recommended for ELA 30-1 (YAY!) which means I officially got into all the academic courses for Gr. 12., and after that went with Phil to pick up his dog from somewhere, lol.  What am I doing for the rest of the day?, well going to chill with Staci and fix her computer and then work on her blogger page, so that should be lots of fun.  Eric
