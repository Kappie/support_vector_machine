It's been A God Factor month...where the whole month....I have not stop thinking about God...i see God in everything that i do and yeah...and not just on God's blessing...but the annointing He have poured over our live and also His Power. The same power that flowed within Jesus when He Arose from the Dead ....flows now within us ...enabling us to serve Him with the gifts endowned to us and to live a life of breakthroughs.  I thank God for all the successes and even failures in my life and if you asked me what is my greatest achievement in life? i would tell you 2 things....that is I get to know JEsus...and guess the second one...  I have failed in every aspect of my life...from studies...all the way to life itself....and in that Failure ..God chooses to bring the best out of me...making God the author of my life.. really..serious... Every aspect of my life, if not the grace of God...i would not have tasted success...joy and happiness..  God have brought friends into my life....good lifelong friends...like Andrew Yeow, James Chew, Wai Nyan, tjer-hann , Melissa Lim and good cell group like SImply United and Pure Joy ....good church ...SIBKL.... and I can't name them all...but it's okay...cause i know at the end of my life...i get to see them anyway in a huge concert that goes for eternity....in Heaven.  E03 , a life changing , a turning point in my life....that have refreshens me, taught me and enabled me to use the gifts that God have promised to bring life to others.....God have to come so that i may have life and life abundantly...  Oh yeah...for those who have not known...i have been blessed with a job in EA Consultancy Asia Pacific as a HelpDesk and Network Specialist, one of the more pretigious company in the SAP industry...an enterprise software ....not through the interviews i attended, not through Jobstreet....yes those that i have mentioned have contributed a part of it...but ultimately it is in the hands of God that decide whether i get the job.  So i want to encourage those who are waiting for a job....don't start waiting for God to do the impossible... you have to take the first step in looking for a job, start enquiring about it from your friends, do some homework about the company u are applying....of course start it out with a prayer...ask God specifically on what type of job u wanted...shift based or office hours...things like that... Start to score an interview by taking the time to write out a resume and reading on materials pertaining to attend an interview... Remember ...write an impressive resume...but also be honest about it ...when interview...bring a good working attitude..like humility and willingness to learn ... It is not your qualification that will earn you the job...it is the attitude that will help you secure that job,  Don't be ashamed of telling your future employer that you are a christian. The fact you have a strong belief system concretes your attitude and character. that you have integrity in what you are doing..if given the chance...telll your future employer what did you do in church.   All in All...God is in Control! Praise God
