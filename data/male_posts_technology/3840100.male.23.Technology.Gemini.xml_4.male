Currently Rick is studying the music for the group and so far he says things are going great. The group would be classified as alternative rock, but Rick sees more in the group than that.   "I love the music. I have a great time playing the songs with the guys and I see a lot of potential in what we are doing. We all are very serious about music and doing something great with it in our lives. I have been wanting to finally grow as a bass player and I think that this is the perfect opportunity to make some progress. I am very psyched to get back out there with my friend Kris Bok. We used to have a blast back in the days of Substitute and finally we can reunite, but for something much more serious this time. I am very great full to have this chance to work with Third Rail and I thank them all for inviting me in to the band. We will be playing within the next two months so stay tuned. This time it's for real. These guys don't mess around" -Rick   Rick recently has promised himself that he would make music his top priority in his life again. He has been back and forth from his life as a musician many times in the last couple of years, but now has a chance to focus and really get involved with it again. Rick said he was going to take pictures, but not everyone could make it to the practice tonight. Hopefully we can start seeing some of the action!!  -PF
