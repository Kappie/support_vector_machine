So we are down to one computer with the internet and it is a wireless one (sometimes in sometimes out).  And to top it off the router itself is being testy, so I need to see if Comcast will send me a new one. From what I hear the stuff I need is not too expensive, but it is just a pain in the butt especially at finals time.  Anyway, sorry about the rant, but I just needed to complain.
