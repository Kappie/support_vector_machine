This is good, I suppose, for all those out-of-work American tech workers. This means that 130,000 foreign workers (from India, China, and other places) will have to go home at the end of the year, and those jobs need to be filled. It might also be good for us Canadian workers, as we can easily get a NAFTA visa to work in the U.S. (and there is no limit on those).
