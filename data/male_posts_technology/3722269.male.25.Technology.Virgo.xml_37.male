Friday, was such a day, and as I often do I toddled out to wag the chin, have a brew and shoot the shit.. We started talking about the fight for life.. and drifted across to talking about Tawera Nikau and his fight, well maybe that should be 'fight', dont get me wrong I'm supportive of the good this fulla is doing, fronting up and helping those less fortunate in and around his home town of huntly - and lets face it, huntly is more sux than even rotorua, so there's bound to be lots of unfortunates. The fight was referred to several times as an 'exhibition match' well no, I disagree - exhibition means something to watch, this was two friends patting each other on the padded head gear before hugging and walking off. Honestly, it was that 'viscious'... ahh well.. this didnt get us laughing... we started talking about prosthetic or fake limbs.. and there's a new zealand chick that 0wns at the special olympics with her special springy replacement leg (it might be legs, I forget) but the thing doesnt look like a leg, its designed specifically for running, and is made of spring steel, in the shape of a.. well I guess as StrongBad would say, consumate Vee... interestingly, this chick runs as quickly, if not more quickly than a 'normally' abled person. What other personal modifications are acceptable or allowed at the special olympics? and ok, with I Robot freshly in my mind, I'm wondering, how long before biomechanical limbs start emerging onto special olympic start lines? Imagine if you will, special olympic athletes with hydraulic motorized legs, out sprinting the normal athletes by way of bio-enhancement. It's an interesting train of thought.. but we didnt stop there, the mind soon wandered in typical 'having a beer fashion' to swimming.. what if bio-lung boy didnt need to breath for the 20 minute overarm race? that'd be interesting to watch.. how long before mechanical legs for swimming become , like their springed counterpart, more of an aid than a hinderance.. and we have jet propelled freaks sconning all the records under the sun, with the help of their part-robotness. Ph33r. But did we stop there with our postulation? oh no! of course not. I suggested maybe Squash player with arm missing, has a detachable arm for normal use, that he switches in true 'hot swappable' fashion, for an actual racket, hard mounted into his arm. Bob liked this idea, and we contemplated decathletes with an accessory backpack that'd make computer game characters blush, with different attachments for each of the ten sports or things they will encounter. How long before we have what is effectively a half cyborg rugby team literally crushing a 'natural' team, or tearing them limb from limb when some synaptic controller malfunctions or gets the latest blaster worm? Disturbing? maybe.. funny? definately.. In all honesty tho, athletes are getting faster, fitter, stronger and as such, are hurting each other more.. its not that modern rugby players are 'soft' so much as, the fact that the hits are harder, the opponents stronger, and the impact that much more damaging. That said, Robinson should harden the fuck up, because without him, who in the all blacks is gunna start the 'biffo' that I so love to see in a match? Gah. I'm gutted. Wuss! *shakes fist* Tail end of being sick and I'm eating like a motherfucker, I wouldnt be at all suprised if this weekend costs me 5kg of progress.. but hey.. I know I can do it now, and I start the gym on monday, we'll have a lean mean fighting machine in no time at all. Maybe you should all start fearing the speedo pr0n already :) Peace out, nig-GAZ!
