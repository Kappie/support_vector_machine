Are you a person who thinks of others only when you want them or do you nurture and maintain healthy relationship with others on a regular basis?  I am sure that you would have come across people who contact  - rather renew their contact with you!  - only when they want some thing from you?  What did you think about them?   This is how you will project yourself with them when you do the same thing.  Your emotional bondage with others will decide how much they value your association. Make it a habit to get genuinely interested in others. The best way to do this is to greet people on their birth day and wedding days. Avoid the `ritualistic' New Year cards. You know and they know that in many cases it is the `flavour of the month'. Make it a practice to make a no agenda telephone call at a time you have nothing to ask for from the other person. If your friends have a special occasion, make it a practice to call on them. If you come across an information which you feel will be useful to some one, send the same with a small note?  Building a positive image is difficult!
