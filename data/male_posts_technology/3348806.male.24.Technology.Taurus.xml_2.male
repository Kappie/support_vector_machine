The School supports a broad range of research activities in fine art, theatre design and related fields including performance and audio arts, and increasingly in the emerging areas of creative practice in new technology and interactive network arts. The School was the first art institution in the UK to connect to the Internet 2-3 network. This high-speed link enables full-scale, real-time artistic experimentation, with sufficient bandwidth for the interactive transmission of television-quality images and sound to long-distance correspondents. This is the beginning of a permanent network for artistic, educational and cultural experimentation that will have a major impact on the evolution of this important new means of communication.  Wimbledon School of Art launched the first broadband, experimental interactive network in May of 2002, linking initially to Ryerson University in Toronto and Le Fresnoy post-graduate centre in Lille, France, with other international partnerships subsequently being developed. The School is actively involved in the development of the MARCEL digital interactive network to extend the concept of artistic exploration of high bandwidth networks made possible through advances in video, computer and telecommunications technology. Collaborative on-line projects are organised to bring the visual and performing arts into a new interactive network space for artistic experimentation, encouraging the synthesis of the performing arts with the plastic arts.  Wimbledon School of Art is one of the artistic partners in ALTERNE, and has a team of researchers dedicated to the development of tools for experimentation and use in the network space. Once these tools have been developed, the School also is able to provide a testing ground in a dynamic and changing creative environment with staff and students exploring new means of communication and interactivity in creative practice and research. Wimbledon School of Art is also working on the dissemination platform for the development of virtual story-telling scenarios, exploring the possibility for interactive and mediated network narratives.
