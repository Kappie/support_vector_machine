I got up at 6:50, decided to fool myself into thinking I had enough time to take a shower, which I took. then got ready from school, rushed out the door, got my sister to her school just barely on time, and amazingly got to school... no, wait, I was late. School was normal funny weird *blahness* until 1:00 when David Kelly, AT, Zooha, Lenny, Tyler and I all randomly left class early, spent 20 minutes trying to figure out which car(s) everyone was going in, and got on the road, heading toward a Engineering expo / banquet downtown. Holy crap, that ride was crazy... David Kelly drove his own car and everyone else piled into mine. We had decided ahead of time that we were going to be following Kelly, but judging by his driving, that was the last thing he wanted (LOL). Everyone in my car kept screaming and yelling and being generally distracting. The ambient noise levels in my car increased exponentially in parallel with the level of irrationality of David Kelly's driving techniques. In any event, we got there safely.   Apon arrival at the Double Tree Hotel (accross from the Lloyd Center), we discovered that the event was reschedualled to start at 2:45 instead of 2:00 (Darn it, we could have taken the MAX like we wanted to to begin with.) Anyway, after having fun in the glass elevators jacking multiple snack bags from the stash, Lenny and Tyler boarded one bus to go tour Freightliner, and the rest of us boarded the other to go to PSU.   Once we go there, the 60 or so of us all broke off into smaller groups. Zooha and I were fortunate enough to get into the group with like, 7 people. The first place we stopped at was the  STAR Siesmic Lab , the centerpiece of which is a 10' x 10'  Seismic Shake Table . Now this table has got to be one of the sweetest things I've seen in a very long time... it weighs 6? tons, can handle loads of well over 10 tons, and is powered by twin 60 gpm hydralic pumps which give it 3 Gs of acceleration over its travel range of 6 inches. It's amazing (and a little unsettling) looking down into the lab and watching a 13 thousand pound table suddely vibrate 6 inches either direction, more than 5 times a second. Saying you can feel the entire building shake would be an understatment.   The next lab we went to showcased an inverted pendulum, a computer operated device that balances a pendulum upside-down. It was pretty cool; the only method it has to balance it is using a motor to move a cart back and forth along a horizontal track, much like how an inkjet printer works, only a huge amount more precise. It’s interesting, if you knock the pendulum off balance or spin it around, the cart spans back and forth, constantly adjusting until its back up, balanced again. It’s so precise in fact, that it never stopped moving while we were in the room. The professor that was displaying it said that sometimes when he was in the room alone with the door closed, the pendulum would come to a point where it wasn’t moving at all, but then the only thing he had to do was blowing softly at it from across the room to knock it ever so slightly off balance and start it back up again.  After that we toured the spatial design / rapid prototyping labs and finally went outside to check out the  mini baja car  that four graduates had built for their senior project and had entered into a national competition and won first place with. Finally, past 5:00 everyone got back into the bus and headed back to the Double Tree. Once we got back, we perused around the expo for a while. A lot of northwestern engineering colleges were there: OSU (go Beaves’!), OIT, PSU, and many others. I talked to someone at length about an experiment involving micro-gravity that was going to taken up to be studied by way of NASA. (We saw this and head a bit about it back at PSU too). Oh, PSU currently has two other student experiments being tested on the international space station.  AT and David knew ahead of time who their hosts were, so they sat with them for the banquet, but the rest of us didn’t know we needed to know beforehand, so we got adopted into another group (all but Zoo, who went with David). One of the engineers whom we were sitting with does accident reconstruction and a TON of other things. He makes about $250 an hour doing reconstruction work. o.O The other one was an engineer at Freightliner who told us some interesting storied about test-driving though Minnesota (I think…) earlier this year to catch the -20 degree weather.   Dinner was good, but not as good as the to-die-for potatoes and steak at last week’s banquet (or at least that’s what Lenny said). After dinner they introduced the head table and started into the presentations, most of which were about renewable energy etc. The last one was incredibly boring for the first half hour, but then the speaker played a sweet movie about an array of 80 staggeringly  huge  windmills (I’m talking 300’ tall towers, 240’ diameter blade radius) off the coast of Norway (I think...).   Anyway, once that was over, it was getting close to 9:20 and we needed to leave, so by use of ASL, we all communicated to each other across the banquet hall that we were all thinking the same thing and made a hasty exit while they were answering question. (I feel bad, in our rush to get out quickly, Lenny, Tyler and I forgot to thank / say goodbye to our host.)   Holy crap, the drive home was CRAZY. First, it was raining like never before and the vast majority of the time I couldn’t see any type of lane makings. Second, everyone was making massive amounts of noise, and third, my brakes weren’t working properly (I’m getting them replaced tomorrow... *checks his watch* make that later today.) Once we hit Canyon road again, we started blasting techno and everyone in the backseat lost their sanity. I wish I had a video camera with me… AT was making up his own beats and random odd sounds, Tyler was trying to rock the car with his erratic motions and Zoo started screaming and doing other things. ... Yeah that was prolly the best part of the trip. :)  Once I dropped everyone off at their cars at the high school (at 10:10) I came home (carefully, bad brakes remember?) and here I am now, typing this.
