It was cold, and raining, and I was standing in it, moving ladders, and a Weider weight bench into the back of a friends pickup truck.  Spent probably 30-45 minutes doing this.  Well....I ended up staying home wednesday from work not feeling well.  Thrusday wasn't bad. Friday was not fun, I felt run-down, coughing, sneezing, aching, I sound like a Ny-Quil ad yet?  So the flu really kicked in on me Friday night.  I spent most of yesterday, w/o a shred of energy, but I still managed to pull up the box with our Christmas Tree, and 3 boxs of ornamints from our basement. That about ran my batteries totally down.  About 8:30, my head was throbbing and pounding from a migraine the flu was giving me.  I think that a can of soup that I had earlier in the evening was a bit off, and I got a little food poisoning from it, as it wasn't too long before I was in the bathroom praying to the toilet diety. It's amazing how sometimes just throwing up can make you feel better.    Today has been alot better.  I have some more energy, though my body still aches from the flu.  Well, this along is running me down, so I'm going to stop for now, will post again in a day or two.
