I just needed to take issue with a few things: "that [terrorisms] root causes lie in poverty and state failure"  WRONG. It was common belief before (and apparently after) 9/11 that terrorists were poor folk with no hope left in life. What else could explain their decision to give up life just to hurt someone else? They must not have had much to live for. Quaint, but untrue. The profiles of the 9/11 hijackers are more chillingly close to middle-class than most people expected. See, it's not a life of poverty and a belief that you can have nothing more that drives people to commit such horrible acts. Turns out that it is plain old middle-class guilt. The same motivation that drives vapid young white college girls to turn vegan and "bi-curious"--they want to show just how devoted they are to their ideology. They want to show just how much they care about the ethics of their class. They want to be fanatics to show that they are more devoted than anyone elase. That, and they are too stupid to realize that they are being used.  So let's get off the poor of the planet--they are too busy trying to eek out a living to get all caught up in radical theology. The rise of terrorism has coinsided with the rise of the middle class in the Middle East--Franz Fanon be damned.    Then this: "[Kerry] refuses to support the Central American Free Trade Agreement because he says it has inadequate labor protections, even though there are real labor protections in the deal and even though the best protection for workers is the economic growth to which free trade contributes."  What?! Are you saying that sweat shops won't exist as long as goods are being sold and companies are making profits? What world is that in? Oh yeah--the US! Funny how having labor laws and worker's rights (ok, not many, but better than El Salvadore!) with government oversight spreads out the value of economic growth. I'm no socialist, but let's not pretend that the invisible hand of free markets is anything other than Greed (with a capital "G"). It's sure as hell not God!  I'm all for free trade (even as I watch my fellow computer folk loose their jobs to India) but don't think that those cheap clothes at Wal Mart come... well... cheap. They can afford to pay the Chineese worker 5 dollars a week because they don't have roads to maintain, sewage to clean, workplace saftey, or worker's comp. Send the jobs overseas, but level the playing field by forcing the other countries to raise the level of human rights to the same (low) level of our own country.  So waffle if you want to, but it's not between two good candidates, it's between a purely evil one and a mostly evil one. If you don't know which is which, then move to fucking Georgia, don a white pointy-hood, and get fat on pig parts while lamenting the days of slaves and plantations and leeches as good medicine.
