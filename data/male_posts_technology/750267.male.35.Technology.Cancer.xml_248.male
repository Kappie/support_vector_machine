Fox News, of course, is trying to play the race angle for maximum ratings effect. But the sad fact is that Mr. Jones was clearly fighting the police, was high on cocaine and PCP, and could easily have harmed these officers if he had a chance to get close to them.  The people of Cincinnati should just accept that Mr. Jones got what he was looking for, and get back to normal. I can't believe the leader of the NAACP standing up for him though. The police were so clearly in the right on this -- it's not even close.
