I understand and empathize with that, but at the same time cannot bring myself to condone the casual acceptance of loose theory that surrounds the concept of love. It's like a song by Joe Eisenbrahm: "Is love until I die just love until I change my mind?" Love forever and always has not just lost its meaning. It never had it in the first place.  I'm a Christian, so I'm going to quote the bible. If you don't believe this stuff then skip this paragraph but Christian or not I'm guessing you'll agree. The bible says: "there is no greater love than this; that a man give his life for his friends." I want to avoid tangents but still I should point out that the quote does not necessitate death, only sacrifice of one's life- which could be time, energy, or money. The point is, love is characterized not by words, but by action. Your significant other can tell you "I love you" a million times, but if you notice that they're starting to gaze at other men/women and they haven't done anything special for you in a while, doubt is inevitable.  So if love- and you must understand that I speak of love in the generic sense, not necessarily romantic love- is characterized by action, what is the most accurate measure? To ask the question: what would you DO for them? From there, the logic is elementary.  I would die for any of my friends in a heartbeat. I'd like to think, though obviously I've never been put to the test, that I would die for a common man on the street that I'd never met. Sacrifice is a key aspect in how I express my love. So here's the clincher: what more is there to give? I would give up anything for my friends, and there's simply nothing more to sacrifice for a girl. I can give more of my time, or more of my energy, but the bottom line is that the difference is quantitative, not qualitative.  I believe strongly in the love of friendship. I also believe that the 'romantic love' that everybody is so enraptured by is simply an array of different components that people have massed together over the years: friendship, attraction, and a mutually exclusive commitment. I include friendship because it incorporates the necessities of a relationship, like respect, trust, sincerity, etc. Attraction is necessary because otherwise.. well, you see what I mean. The commitment is what really sets it apart. A mutually exclusive commitment says, "You are first and foremost mine, as I am first and foremost yours." And here's the kicker: since dating and courting don't inherently indicate any sort of permanence, the ONLY place 'romantic love' can in ANY way occur is INSIDE THE CONTEXT OF MARRIAGE. That's somewhat irrelevant but all the same I thought it worth mentioning.  Some of you sentimentalists (I don't mean that as a derogatory statement since I'm one too) are bound to think, love can't be 'defined,' love is a feeling that____ you fill in the blank. I disagree strongly. The whole 'indescribable' clich√© is really an excuse to avoid looking into difficult emotions. Humans aren't all that complicated, and I can see no reason why love should be this hovering complexity that some view it as.  I'll be interested in what people have to say about this one.
