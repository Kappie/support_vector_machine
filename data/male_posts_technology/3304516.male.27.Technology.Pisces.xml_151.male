Now we have bloody first person shooter video games.  Remember taking a trip to the beach and slpashing in the waves? Now we have indoor wave pools in the city.  Remember when you wanted to see a new movie you had to go to the theater? Now we can download the movie off the internet, sometimes before the movie even gets to the theater. Remeber when you could go to the movies for $5.00? Now it costs over $25.00 for two people, not including popcorn and drinks. Remember when gas cost under 50 cents? Now we're lucky if it's under $1.
