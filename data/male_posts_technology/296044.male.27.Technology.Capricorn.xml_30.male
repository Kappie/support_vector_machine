As stated in a previous blog, Ive applied for an apartment in Old Towne East; a rather lovely up and coming area, that I would very much like to live in. Not only is the apartment itself physically in great condition and aesthetically pleasing, but it is near a few of my good friends.                But oh no, even though I applied for the apartment last FRIDAY, they STILL have not processed my application.                 Yes, yes, the woman (well call her Tina Bo Bina for now), said as of yesterday, I was out yesterday [Monday] so I havent gotten to your application yet. Just give me a little time. Well work something out. But its been twenty-four hours since I spoke with her. Isnt that enough time to electronically process my application?! You can Google me for free and in less time!                Tina Bo Bina seems like a very nice person to be honest, and yes, she did sound a bit under the weather yesterday so maybe shes working slower. But for Petes sake lady, give my application to someone else to handle if youre so backed up. I do know at least two other people work in that office: some woman who answers the phone as though she lived on a plantation in Jawjah, with the sense of urgency of a snail; and gentleman named Scott who originally showed me the apartment. Scott is quite an astute fellow too, and seemed eager to get the apartment rented. In fact, from comments theyve all made, they ALL sound eager to get this thing rented ASAP. I believe when I first inquired about the apartment Ms. Jawjah stated, Oh yes we have a 1 bedroom, and its got your name on it! It was the fastest thing Ive heard her say yet.                Yall stay tuned now, ya hear?
