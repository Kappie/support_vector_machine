Taiia is supposed to be an unknown god to the Characters of Nefarnomicon, a forgotten legend that only the Dragons keep. So with it being unknown that she is in fact a god, and the creator of the entire world, the humans fear of their sun growing into a cold blue orb is less than what it should. But I intend to reveal to the player characters little further than midway into the campaign of this fact, and that the sun goddess Taiia is dying, her energies being stolen by a powerful shadowmancy spell. A curse that can only be lifted once the proper incantation is found and dispelled. That incantation is written inside the Nefarnomicon. I'm pretty sure the book itself should create a ton more adventure sidelines once it's in the players hands, but I'm certainly not going to just give it to them. That would be folly. but that's my current note for today. I think it'll go over particularly well in game. I'm really aiming for this to be a captivating world full of incredible and fascinating things.
