The plot was a little more inventive than most, although just as silly and filled with people doing things that made me think "Why the hell did they do  that ?" The biggest detriment to the movie was the lack of sympathetic characters. Also funny is the fact that the evil web site was actually feardotcom.com. - 2.5 out of 5 stars
