Skipping and Running  Since the  urlLink fibromyalgia  took over, I can't say I've missed running (which I think I haven't really done since a touch football game in 1981), but now that I've thought about it, I *do* rather miss skipping...   2. Coke or Pepsi  I spent the first 29-or-so years of my life drinking Pepsi, but I'd have to say I've fully converted to Coke over the last 15 years of marriage...   3. Rock or Hip Hop  Rock, easily -- for me, at least 98% of all rap (or products containing rap, such as hip hop, etc.) is crap... [see also  urlLink Sturgeon's Law ]   4. Laptop or Desktop  I've not had much experience with laptops, but I can't see where I'd be much into them (of course, I am fully prepared to eat those words if and when I ever decide to enter the current millennium and  get  one...)   5. Cold Weather or Hot Weather  Hot weather -- I have not been referred to as " urlLink a cold-hearted snake " *entirely* without reason...   6. Swimming or Bicycling  Since I never learned how to swim, this answer seems relatively obvious...   7. Chocolate or Vanilla  ...gee,  everything  has to be one or the other? Milk, ice cream, power drinks...? (sigh) Fine, then -- chocolate (under protest)...   8. Day or Night  Night -- what *is* that  urlLink mass of incandescent gas  in the sky?...   9. Looks or Brains  For me or in a partner or both? Well, in the spirit of #7, I'll say brains for both, but it's another awfully wobbly decision that could fall the other way in the morrow...   10. Cable, DSL, or Dial-Up  Never had DSL (unless it's at work, which I  urlLink know nothing  about), so between cable and dial-up... well, I'd like to know who picks dial-up, so I know who to keep a safe distance from...
