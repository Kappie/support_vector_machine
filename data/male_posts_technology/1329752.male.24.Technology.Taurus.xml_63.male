(it's free. hehe) after some discussions it turned out that my boss have been infected by what we call the BSD syndrome (initial state of paranoia. hehe). he also like teejz idea of eliminating ms office here in the office using open office instead. (hehe)   thanks pare.  we've got 2 vacant ip's left and I'll be practicing those things he taught me for the whole week. nothing unusual happened aside from that. always busy (busy nga ba?) or just trying to keep busy rather. just like what somebody always say's:  "same ol same ol parin..."   i woke up this morning with a numeric message on my phone. still can't figure out what does that mean. I think I'm beginning to be completely dense. haayy... kung alam mo lang pare ko... kung alam mo lang...  right time right place, not now not tomorrow not today... someday pare. someday...  alis nako. d2 na si boss.
