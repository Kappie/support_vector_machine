It lasted for a few hours and then we went to Circuit City for a free copy of Rainbow Six 3 if you bought three months of XBOX Live.  So we did.  Hell Yeah, time to sharpen some skillz and dominate online (except for when there's fucking LAG with our cable modem, that sucks.  Gamer Tag: mikeoxlong)  Saturday we went to Mark's graduation party.  It was fun.  Again, as with a lot of social events with my friends, I was the only brown kid there but it was still fun.  Mark and Dave's family was friendly and the food was good.  Didn't have a lot of beer there since I am still hurting from the gout.  After that we went and closed down North Beach.  It got wierd after that.  Sunday was laundry day as well as home cooked meal day.  MMMmmm, sinagang, it was good.  Weekend was fun.  Next weekend is memorial day weekend so that should be fun as well.  Have a great week friends, family and random people.  I will make sure to put a more meaningful entry in the future.  For now, you get this BS.
