Recent speculation around the motivation in the Sun settlement and other settlements has revealed a possible new strategy.  This may also be considered innovative by Redmond however, the application is not.  The use of Patents to eliminate the use of open source code in the corporate environment appears to be the strategy they are laying out. Retroactively applying for patents on existing patents, the old embrace and extend with a legal twist, attempts to lock out any non-licensed software from interacting with any licensed Microsoft software operating in a client corporation.   Legal technicalities aside, the money used in a court of law in this fashion will only seek to "embrace and extend" the threat and effect of Microsoft "innovations" in the marketplace. The solution that Microsoft has suggested is that don't run any non-licensed software in the corporation.
