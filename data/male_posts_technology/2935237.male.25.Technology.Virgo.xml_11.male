If you wakeup from your sleep on your way home, you may find an African American to your left, a Chinese blocking the sight of a Jew sitting across. A Scottish in deep conversation with a Jamaican, a Pakistani catching up on sleep and an Indian, lost in himself, within. They are all New Yorkers! Together but not united! This city has a lot of energy - both negative and positive.  Its nights are brighter than the days. Your mornings start in a crowd on a train whose faces suck all the energy out of you. You feel it is the end of the day even before it has started. Chances are that you are not alone but you are lonely. If there is anything you want on this earth, you will mostly likely find here. You can find musicians on the train and performers on the street. Every street and avenue is famous for its rareness. Broadway for is its performances and 28th for its cuisines, 8th Ave for hookers, Time Square for its timelessness and Wall street for being a wall that is street!  It is neither an empire nor a state but it has the Empire State within.  This city holds the gold of all the nations of the world underneath itself. And besides all this you may be lucky to find some peace of mind also!  It is the eye of the world. Yes it is the big apple!
