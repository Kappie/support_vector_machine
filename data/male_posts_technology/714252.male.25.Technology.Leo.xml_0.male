Then me and sis went to The Capital for a drink. Bubbles turned up after getting his first pay check and (literaly) forced drink into us.. GAH.. I had shots and tequila beer (I'd never heard of it before either) and normal beer and all kindsa things.. Next thing I know we are in The Pod dancing to da funky hip hop sounds..  Did I mention my head hurts now?  WELL IT DOES
