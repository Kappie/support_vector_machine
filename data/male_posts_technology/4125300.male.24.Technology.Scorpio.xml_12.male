By the time we were done with our run, it had pretty much cleared up.  After a shower, we headed to get some food and spend some quality time on the beach.  Enjoyed my time on the beach and in the ocean immensely.  No waves, but c'est la vie.   AD got out of work, and met us at the beach around 5:45.  We had dinner at a tasty little restaraunt about a block from the beach, then headed to AD's place to rest and recover before the revelry at night.   Later went to a club in Ft. Lauderdale called the Voodoo Lounge.   Was a lot of fun.    Dj. Cato Calin was spinning.  I was pretty impressed.  He is no Oakenfold, but for a random night in a club, he was way better then expected.  KA had an absolute blast, and I was happy to hear it.  Stayed in club til some time after 3 -- way past my bedtime,  got some tasty empanadas at a small grille about a block away.   Any comments on South Beach would not be complete without a comment on all of the beautiful women around her.  So thats it.  I wouldn't trade CW for any of them, but they are still fun to watch.   Liked D.J., didn't like prices.  $5 for bottled water!  Didn't like security either.  Speaking of people I didn't like...  Some guy sitting down on a bench... just randomly made eye contact with him, and his reponse is something like "want some of this? Come on!" -- ooohh you big testosterone filled he-man.  I'm so  scared  of you, I'm going to  ignore  you, and walk away.  Idiot.   Oh yea, the guy who talked shit to us while I was running.  If you are going to talk shit to someone that is running, you should at least have the common courtesy to let that runner  run your ass into the ground,  ok?  I honestly would have put in 10 miles just to see you dying, out of breath and cramped up.  Yes, I'm a bit competitive ;)  Tonite should be the real deal.  South beach.
