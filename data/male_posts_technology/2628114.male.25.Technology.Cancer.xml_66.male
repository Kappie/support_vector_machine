It was a great morning to start considering I was able to get up and out the door before the sun and humidity began to melt smaller cars and slow-moving, old people.  I took off initially down through Twin Lakes park and Eden park.  I wound around to Gilbert and up into the 'hood.  Gilbert was no small task considering it was uphill for at least 1/2 mile.  I then turned into the bowels of the 'hood, past Heather's old dive of an apartment and criss-crossed the streets for another 15 minutes.  I fully expected to have most of the streets to myself considering the time but some streets were still riddled with the crack fiends stumbling home with their 40's and the "bruthas".  With that said, anyone who needs their fix at 6:45 in the morning is welcome to come running with me.  :)  I probably went just over 3 miles.  The first 10 minutes, as with any morning run, were the hardest since my legs still felt like concrete and my mind still had not figured out what the heck I was doing up that early and especially why I was running.  Beyond that, the miles seemed to melt away like some poor old man who couldn't get out of the sun fast enough.    As for a final thought today, something that will probably carry me the course of this training. "Show me Your grace and let it flow down from the cross where You showed me You loved me."  Have a great week!
