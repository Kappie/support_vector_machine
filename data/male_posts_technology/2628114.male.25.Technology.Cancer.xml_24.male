I ran a 40 today beginning in the hilly treachery of Eden Park and extending to the hillier (that's a word) treacherier (so is that) of Mt. Adams.  I fought my way through the hills and ice mines of the sidewalks to complete my run today.  My muscles were still a little sore from the hammering they received on the backpacking trip this past weekend but everything felt great besides that.  I felt a little tension in my knee in the beginning, but it soon passed as my legs warmed up.  I felt so good by the end of the run, I could have continued for another 40 without much of a problem (maybe?).  I love running for a few reasons, but one main thing is that I never cease learning things on my runs.  Here are a few things I learned today on my run.  I learned that the wind will fight me no matter the direction I run.  I also learned that ice is a harder surface on which to run than asphalt (ouch my ankles!).  Wheee!  I love running!
