The reason I am thinking of joining the army is because I really feel like I take my freedom for granted and that I must pay my dues to help protect our country. Another reason I feel like joining is because I have always liked the idea of war and the strategies involved and I subliminally desire to be disciplined.      I realize this could be a decision that could put me in the grave at a young age but its always going to be on my mind. It is not like this is a final decision I have made because there are so many things in the technology field that I could really see myself excelling in such as a electrician, graphic designer, website designer, advertising multimedia, marketing, and since I've started working out firemen and police officer(and yes the soldier again) have come to mind. To summarize my talent or the type of person I am I would say that I am a very creative and technical person who takes risks to achieve greatness. On the other hand I can be unorginized, lazy, and paranoid about how economy will fall, world will end and things like that   For now I think ill just keep my mind on graduating with a good GPA.  Its late, Been great, write to you tomorrow mate.
