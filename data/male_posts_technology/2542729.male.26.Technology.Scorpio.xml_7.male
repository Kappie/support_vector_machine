Everything I loved about the guard has been singed somewhat and it makes me sick to think that i'll be spending a year n a half around these people. Convoy was terrible, not surprisingly. We departed in two basic increments...16 minimum vehicles a piece. Cats got separated...vehicles broek downon the side of the road...including a BRAND NEW WRECKER!!! What kinda stuff is that??? One guy even ran out of fuel...I thought that was...special. Then one guy turned off on an exit believing he was following the rest of the crew ahead, only to find that he was seeing things. Yep, you guessed it...it was your nerdy neighborhood Spiderman lol. I was sleepy shoot...I dont care. I got down there okay, that's all that was important. Another vehicle had transmission issues so it was only travelling bout 30 miles an hour before it gave out. Man we did a great job of PMCS (preventive maintenance, checks  services...standard military stuff). When we got there...well, to back up a little bit...I was in the 2nd increment and we left not long before 9:00..and we were supposed to be out around 8:30. Anyways, when we got there, it was a little before 7:00...had just enough time to eat chow n get unwined. My main bag and my laptop were both on the back of one of the hummers that broke down so I had to wait to get my locker joint organized properly. It just sucked all the way around...  My particular train of folks...we were the last ones to arrive...of ALL the companies in our battalion. 5 companies and we were the absolute last people to arrive. *sigh* Anyways, the barracks were basically just like basic training...except hotter  in a far more remote area (I trained @ Ft. Jackson conveniently located beside Columbia) It is an interesting Fort I will say. Incredible land mass...home of the infantry...hoooah!!! I'm so freakin' tired of that word...we say it 3 million times a day.  Well folks, that's basically day one. Day two was a blur...all I remember is we were thru by lunch. But Day three....
