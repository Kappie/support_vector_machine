Anywho..   urlLink American Idol   is on tonite! Yea, some of you are thinking "yea so? that show is so L4M3!!".. well, I dunno. I guess I'm turning into some sort of American Idol crack whore because I can't seem to go a week without missing the damn show.  Won't be home? No problem! TAPE IT!!!!  It's supposed to be 2 hours long tonite too.  WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!  I need help.
