Also was able to edit its color scheme not sure if this one is any better(comments please)And also I think I need to reduce the font size of my posts what you guys say? Ok so day ended up with one good news  urlLink Maria Sharapova  won :D (also I got my salary, its party time ;)), Although I couldn’t watch the match. I was in office waiting for my friend to get done with his work  so I could get ride for home, finally did at 8:30. But I managed to check live score on Wimbledon’s official site. It was a goooood match shouldn’t have missed but am used to miss good things in life. Anyhow time to sleep now, I am sure I will be having a nasty headache in morning God help me!!!!  Damn KESC voltage is fluctuating and my PC’s UPS isn’t working either.  PS: Because of the new comments box your old comments are missing I will try to put those in new system, till then have fun with this one. Its 5:00 AM now
