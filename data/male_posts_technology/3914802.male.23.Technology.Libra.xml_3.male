There are tons of people out there just like me (yeah)! I like the night life, and I am more active when it is past noon. As a tech contractor I don't think there are too many opportunities that have you working the "2nd shift" which is like 11am to 7:30pm. I guess some network admins could probably do that if the servers at the workplace need to be monitored all of the time. When I would write computer code during undergrad, I would write it starting at... like 8 o clock. This is when my mind was focused. Then I could figure out algorithms and format my code with ease! Then I graduated, and found that there were pretty much no tech jobs out there for recent graduates with 4 year degrees in computer science. I applied to the major defense contractors and everything. Even had an interview with Lockheed Martin (or was it Northrop Grumman??). But no...    So, then I partied for a while and celebrated that living at(my parent's)home was free, since I had money saved from my college job I could go out and buy some booze for a while... Then I had to buckle down and absolutely find a job! And I worked hard, and I found a job... as a delivery driver... for little caesars. The pizza was delicious, but I could have been better off not knowing how much grease was in my food. My manager (T), was a bitch, but I guess she kept the business running due to her husband. T was the most unreasonable person when she was angry. And she demanded nothing less than the best from her army of teenagers. Of course, I was 21 and would rather take it easy with little responsibilities. I didn't want to work on the weekends so I could go see my (now ex) girlfriend (She was great, but another whole post could be dedicated to her). Neither the other drivers or T could understand why I wouldn't want to work on the busy time where you made more money (dumbasses). It wasn't about the money for me... it was about sustaining my drinking habit. As long as I had enough to live off of then I didn't care! I even once got yelled at for wearing a stripey shirt underneath my work shirt, because it was too flashy! So, I decidedly quit from there. Put in my two weeks notice, and then took notice as the bitch didn't schedule me for two.. more.. weeks. Then I got this nice job with the help of my sister. I used to work 9am to 5:30pm but that was too late. I need to work from 9am to 3:30pm that would be ideal... but unfortunately I don't see that happening.   Guess I will just stick with the coffee...
