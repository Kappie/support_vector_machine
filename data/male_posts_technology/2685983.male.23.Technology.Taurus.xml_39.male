I'm pretty much into seeing anything that isn't just guitar/drums/bass these days. I got home at 2:30 last night. They played "Man in Me" by Bob Dylan (made infamous by The Big Lebowski) and, of course, The Minutemen's "Corona". The singer, Joey (I think), noted that Mike Watt will be coming here in a couple days so doing another cover would be alright. He said he used to work for SST in the 80s and Watt would phone and just say "WATT FOR GINN". Pretty funny.  Opening was the "Five Star Acoustic Duo" they were really good but played twice as long as an opening act should.  So yeah I'm pretty excited about the DOS show. Manitoba on Sunday should be swell as well.  I ran into James from The Pinch after the show. He says that they'll be playing at Lydia's the day before Georgestock and opening for White Cowbell Oklahoma as THE LITTLE WEINERS, a Ween cover band.  I also told him about the soundman problem for The Odeon show and he says that he would be able to do it. Sweet. I hope that works out. The show must go on.
