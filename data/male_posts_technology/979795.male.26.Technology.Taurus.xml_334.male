Goodness, I've been on MC since 22nd Nov. Everything still looks blurry and unfocused for my right eye though. Hope it'll recover with time instead of becoming too permanent (?!).  Think I'll still go back for duty on 13th Dec. Friends have been covering for me last mth, feeling a bit guilty. Anyway it's not guard duty so should be quite light. Doubt I'll need to 'see' anything that clearly. But think parents are gonna make noise again if I go back if I'm covered by MC then.  Prob resume Aikido this Tues onwards. Time to put in more effort in my Japanese too. Realised missing one class last week made me really rusty. Had a lot of trouble remembering the vocab everyone was using. Oh well, gambatte!  Oh yar, my friend's church booked a whole cinema for LOTR on the 21st. Actually wanted to get the old housemates together for this. But coz of some having other commitments and the grading date/time kinda clashed, so I had to rearrange. Probably just meet up for a meal or something instead.  I'm still waiting ernestly for some kind of response from the Police. They're taking so damn long. This thing is just nagging on my mind now.  Oh yea, I registered some courses through the ePrep programme for NSFs. Quite interesting lor. NSFs are given 300 credits => $300 to apply for some of those eLearning courses. We juz need to pay abt 10%. Signed up for a series of continuous Java programming courses and one on Information Privacy. Can't wait for the materials to be sent over. Prob stop Japanese after Dec and do some self revision while I continue with this ePrep courses for the next few mths. Best thing is that all these are OTOT (own time own target). I just need to schedule my free time at home regularly to make sure I get some work done.  Oh well, time for new year resolutions :P ... Looking forward to 2004 where I'm prob gonna embark on a whole new phase of my life.
