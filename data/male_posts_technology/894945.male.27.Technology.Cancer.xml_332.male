The time for relentless social drinking is nearly come to a close (although I am sure that it may continue regardless!), all the presents have been unwrapped and placed at the back of deep cupboards, people are removing those metal bungs from their chimneys, Santa's (he's not real you know) one night of exercise is complete and he can continue to do fuck all and eat pies!!, the children are talking about next Xmas, parents are looking to next Xmas is disdain!..............  Yup it's going to be a new year before we know it, and we will all be reflecting back on this year and thinking of how it all passed so quickly! Remembering all those cool, funny, good, bad moments that have taken place over the last 365 days. Funny thing is that it only seems like yesterday that we were thinking the same thing about 2001!!! Is the time really flying away that fast?!  Anyway, how does one gauge how good a year has been?   a) On how many holidays you have had, b) On how much money you have made, c) On how much cool music has been released, d) On how many new friends you have made, e) On relationships that have taken place (or not), f) On how good/bad the Splash has been, g)............the list could continue!!!  Well I'm going to be judging my year by all those things and a whole lot more! Whilst it is hard to remember everything that has happened this year there are many things that come to mind.... I have been in and finished a long term relationship, and that has taught me many things which have made a difference in my life, such as how to be a better person, and also how to deal with situations that may once have been hard to deal with. Once again my year of saving money to go travelling away from this bloody island has proved fruitless due to buying new cars and drinking too much! I have had some great holidays this year, such as going away and aquiring my skydiving qualifications, and when I went away with a load of mates to England to a big roleplaying event, when the Toaster Files crew went to Guernsey for Toaster's 23rd, going on holiday with my best mate was good too! During the year I have met some really great people (especially the girls at 'Shut It' and their mates)  and also been reunited with friends of old.  Another Lord Of The Rings film has come out. The Splash has been ok, although it continues to play less and less old music, rather adopting alot of new poppy shit that has hit the music industry! I have completed my apprenticeship and am now fully qualified, hence my wage has dramatically improved.  Well I could go on but I don't want to give all my life details away! Suffice to say that taking all the good and bad things into account, my year has proved to be pretty damn cool!! A big thanks goes out to all my mates that have been there for me when I broke up with Dannii, helped me out when my car blew up lol, that shared all those great holidays with me, Custard for coming and experiencing the out of this world feeling of jumping out of planes!!!, Princess Kate and her flat mate Franki for some cool nights out, Liane and Andy for being so cool, everybody that made it to my 21st bash and made it the best birthday I have ever had!  I hope that all our readers out there have enjoyed the crap that we here at the Toaster Files have posted over the past year and that you all continue to read it! Also guys, try and post stuff on our message board as thats what it is there for, especially all our friends that have gone away or live in Canada (says with a giggle and a wink). The one thing that I try and remember is that this year hasn't just been about how good it has been for me, but I also try and think about all the things that have occured in the world over the past year. In Jersey it is all too easy to forget that there is a world out there!   Anyway, I have made my head hurt with all this thinking lark (hehehe) it's time for me to sign off....  Just remember.... 'Always keep your face to the sunshine, and the shadows will all soon fall behind you'
