I mailed the original message in from my office e-mail account, which runs under Microsoft Outlook. It appeared here in a different typeface than the rest of the messages. When I opened the editor to see why: it was obvious: My little 12 word message was  buried  in a screenful of HTML and other odd markup.  Memo to self: Be sure to check 'plain text' when emailing to this blog.
