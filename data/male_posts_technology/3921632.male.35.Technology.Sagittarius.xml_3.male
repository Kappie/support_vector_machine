(Well, technically, I think it's called Freedom Park, but I've been calling it Collins Park for a couple decades now, and you can't teach an old dog new tricks.) Here are a few snapshots we took. The fireworks came out pretty well for not having the camera on a tripod. I'll be curious to see if any of these links actually work.   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic
