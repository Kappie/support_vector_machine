"MSNBC is a little more liberal than FAUX", I thought, so I watched the coverage of Chris Matthews roll out conservative nay-sayers of every sort to trash every good thing anyone said. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not in love with the Kerry-Edwards ticket. I'll support them of course, but I'm a liberal-liberal, not a conservative-liberal. I have to use terminology like this, because the ultra-conservative pundits working for the Repubs can't see any middle ground anywhere and are busy painting moderate to conservative Dems as some type of "Old Europe" communists.

But I digress...while watching all of the circus entertainment after the Al Sharpton speech, my body went numb and started to sweat profusely, I couldn't breathe. At first I thought I was having some sort of massive panic attack. Just then, a powerful force that felt as old as humanity took control of my body. I felt my hand move over to the remote and begin to push buttons all on it's own. Instead of my head spinning around and spitting pea soup, a strange thing happened. My hand switched the channel to CSPAN. I was awash with the enormity of it all as the mysterious force returned control of my body to me, materialized in front of me in the form of Lady Liberty, spoke three simple words, "Think for yourself!", then vanished. Okay, okay. Maybe  some  of that didn't really happen  exactly  that way, but I had to get your attention somehow! The point of all of this is that I really don't like some bobble-headed talking doll telling me how I'm going to react to someone's speech. Some  real , intelligent political commentary might have been nice, but only during the dance party, not during a speech that someone else thinks is not important enough for me to hear. Even though CSPAN is not really independent television I guess it's the closest thing we have for now, and they covered the convention pretty much in it's entirety with no commercial interruptions, and direct from the pundit free zone. If you're as concerned about the state of the media as I am, check out the Washington Monthly article written by Ted Turner at  urlLink http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0407.turner.html (yeah, yeah, I'm not a fan of Ted either, but he does have some substantive things to say). Then run, don't crawl over to Media Matters for America at  urlLink http://mediamatters.org/  and join in the activist network. Together we CAN make a difference!
