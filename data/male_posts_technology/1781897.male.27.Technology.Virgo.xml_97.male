The cause of the fire is unknown, but one possibility is spontaneous crap combustion. Fire crews are unable to travel on the 3-acre island of shit, for fear of sinking in. As one fire fighter put it, "If they went down we'd never find them."   To the dude who decided to fight  merde  with  merde :  BEATDOWN . To the dairy farmer who built a 3-acre merde  resevoir:  BEATDOWN .
