Loads of young, nubile, good looking chicks, mostly heading back to Uni unfortunately. We knocked back a few wobbly monkeys and played nice with the ra-ra crowd, who were actually cool..  ("i'm in a society at Oxford University!" - Sophie "Is that like the Brownies?" - Me)  and then we got a ride out to the Watersplosh. The highlight was of the evening was seeing Bobby doing a few laps of the coaches with nothing but a sock covering his modesty. Nice one bruva..  If I see another Burberry baseball cap i'm going to beat the wearer to death with a shoe. Just say no!   Live webcam feed from Liberation Square:
