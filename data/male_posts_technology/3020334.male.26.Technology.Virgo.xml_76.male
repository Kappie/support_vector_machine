I think both of them worth your time to watch and think about.   We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented.   By the way, if you would like to experience the environment in Truman Show, you may rent a house for days/weeks in  urlLink Seaside Floria  (Ultra expensive >_  ( urlLink Some notes  for the Truman Show)  -- Just my two cents
