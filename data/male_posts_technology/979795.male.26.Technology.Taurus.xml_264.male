Err anyway, the week was quite uneventful. 1st day itself was the day reservists had to report to camp for a 1mth exercise, so naturally my precence was a low priority to my AS1 (manpower officer in charge). The interview and briefing was a quick one. Saw some of the old regulars who were still there. But it's quite sad, 2 of them are just waiting for the SAF to discharge them. All because they didn't pass their IPPT (hence no promotion coming). I guess some people didn't see fitness being such a serious aspect of their job feequirement when they signed on. It's not uncommon among many of the regulars I've seen, and I'm sure they won't be the last.  I wasn't sure where I'm attached to so I basically reported to 2 'bosses' when I can. The SSG in charge of workshop and the brigade RSM. Currently I'm attached to the RSM at least for the duration for the month long exercise as his PA (personal assistant). He treats me quite well. 2 other guys have been temporarily attached to him prior to my arrival, Neo and William. Both nice friendly blokes. Neo is an MOE local scholar and William is a poly-grad from TP. Both are quite a funny combination during office hours. It seems like the RSM will be trying to retain me for the duration of my NS under his office but it's still too early to say if that's going to happen. I wouldn't know anyway, I'm just a foot-soldier. But I do hope that a good balance of work load is possible in office and workshop. I seriously want to try driving an M113 again.  Tues was my first liferun in camp. It was an internal run by my own unit instead of a sister unit conducting it. Was a good slow pace for 4.5km.  Wed work has basically started.  Thurs was another life run, this time we joined our sister unit in camp for 5km. Being an infantry unit, the level of cohesiveness and spirit they have is simply admirable. They were actually cheering all the way.  Fri things were quite busy, even for Thurs we extended our hours a bit beyond office hours but not by much.  Sat was an outcamp run from Pasir Ris camp to Pasir Ris park. Originally I was just supposed to run 10km, but I met an officer I was attached under when I had just passed out from BMT a few years ago. He remembered my face but not much besides that. As I talked to him I kindly of went past the route I wanted to take and had to go for the 15km distance instead. My timing was an atrocious 2hr 2 min. But that included a lot of walking in between and I suffered quite a few cramps on both my calves. But considering that it was only my 3rd run and 1st long distance for a long time, it may still be acceptable. I hope I'll be able to improve before the Army Half Marathon on 14th Sep Sun. Didn't managed to get much work done today but will need to do some stuff from home to prepare for Mon.  Sigh ... NS life.
