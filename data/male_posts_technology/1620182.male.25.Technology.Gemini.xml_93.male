 1 cup of oatmeal (Raisin Date  Walnut variety) + 1/2 cup skim milk
 2 cups coffee + 1 Equal packet + 1/4 cup skim milk
 1 sandwich with:
    - 1 slice turkey breast
    - 1 slice harvarti cheese
    - Yellow mustard
 1 banana
 1 20 oz Lemon-Lime Gatorade
 
 All in all, not too bad by my standards.  Now I just need to keep this up for the rest of my life.  Watching "Super Size Me" can be a life changing event.  Evidently, subsisting on  urlLink McDonald's food  alone can kill an adult male in little more than 30 days.  Go figure.  Don't believe me?  Check out the  urlLink film by Morgen Spurlock.
