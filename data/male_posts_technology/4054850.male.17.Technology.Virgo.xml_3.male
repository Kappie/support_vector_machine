Anyway, Im back in school and still have nothing to do. My job search isnt doing much better. I wanna get my xB but with my job situation the way it is, its not gonna happen. It would be nice if this place I applied to called me back and said hey you got the job. That would be so nice. Anyway Im gonna go for now so Ill post something again when I get around to it. Peace
