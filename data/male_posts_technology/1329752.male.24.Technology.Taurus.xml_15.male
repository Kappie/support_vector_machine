"What can I do? To make you feel secure. Remove all your doubts, so that you'll know for sure that you're the apple of my eye girl... fulfillment of my dreams. Time, will show the value of just what you mean to me. More precious than silver, more precious than diamond rings or anything that I can give you. It wouldn't mean a thing, if you didn't have my love beside you there to guide you through. Well it is good to know you do... I know just how you feel, but this time love's for real. In time it will reveal that special love that's deep inside of us... will all reveal in time..."    (B. DeBarge/El DeBarge) - Time Will Reveal
