They don't hurt.  I never even noticed them.  I certainly don't feel any wiser with my wisdom teeth, nor do I feel I'll lose any wisdom after having them extracted.  But, the dentist, in all his wisdom, feels I need to have all four of them removed.  The extraction reccomendation stems from an x-ray (actually 3 years of x-rays) which shows ONE wisdom tooth growing sideways toward the front of my mouth.  Fine!  Go ahead and chisel that one out (oops, sorry, extract that one - wouldn't want to be to blunt about the subject).  But what's his logic for removing the three other teeth that even HE says are "in no danger?"  "Might as well, we're going in anyway."  I guess that makes sense.  Hell I've got what 28 more?  What's four teeth?  Hey!  I have an idea, why not extract all my teeth?  I mean, my Grandparents have false teeth as do many over 60.  If I'm gonna lose them anyway, "might as well, we're going in anyway."  I'll be under general anesthetic, call in the doctor to remove my appendix, I don't need it (apparently) anyway.  Might as well get a head start on my organ donation too, and take a kidney (only need one).    Three teeth, co-existing with the other teeth in perfect harmony are now at the mercy of the greatest in all medical opinions - "Might as well, we're going in anyway."  Oh well, at least I get some good drugs!
