A longtime poster at GoneGold.com and author of the 'Night Call', his ramblings about everything from games to vacations to his son Eli were darn near the highlight of the day for me. He also seems like the kind of guy I can sit out in the backyard and have a beer and BBQ with. Maybe if he ever sees this he'll invite me. I hope my random writings are as humorous, witty and entertaining as Bill's.  So, what's with the fishy thing? Jimmy the Fish is my screen name at the San Jose Sharks Fanhome  urlLink messageboard . It sounds vaguely mob-ish and fits in with the aquatic nature of Sharks and fish and all that. It's a lot more creative than calling myself Sharkie or god forbid, my real name. Out of all spectator sports, hockey is my favorite, and the Sharks are my team.
