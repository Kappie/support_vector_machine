As you have probably heard it's not huge inside, maybe slightly bigger than Follies, with the centre as a white oval shaped dance floor. The music is ok, commercial dancy stuff with a bit R thrown in.  The only issues I have with the place is:  Denim is not the work of the devil. If you think that a £20 pair of cargo pants look better than £100 jeans then you have issues, as long as you look smart and clean then you should be able to get in. I understand that all branches of Liquid are like this though, so I doubt this will change.  Why seal off the dance floor till eleven? If you're only open till two then that's just bollocks. You should be able to go dance when you first get into the club, not herded like sheep through a gate when they decide it's party time.
