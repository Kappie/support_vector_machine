But once again, here I am. My desk needs to be cleaned. I think I need to take my "APU" home. It's the big machine gun robot they used in the 3rd installment of the matrix movies. I got it at KB Toys for about 10 bucks a couple of months ago and it's been here on my desk ever since. I'll have to take some pics of my desk and post them on here sometime. That way you can see where I am at when I write on this thing. Well I guess I'm at a loss of words today, guess it's just to early to think. Guess I'll put some lyrics from a song I love. Reminds me of some familiar things. Well hope everyone is doing well, be safe. Adios.   sweetness follows   readying to bury your father and your mother what did you think when you lost another I used to wonder why did you bother distanced from one blind to the other  listen here my sister and my brother  what would you care if you lost the other I always wonder why did we bother distanced from one deaf to the other   oh oh but sweetness follows   It’s these little things they can pull you under  live your life filled with joy and wonder  I always knew this altogether thunder  was lost in our little lives   It’s these little things they can pull you under  live your life filled with joy and thunder  yeah, yeah, we were altogether  lost in our little lives   oh oh ah oh oh ohoh but sweetness follows
