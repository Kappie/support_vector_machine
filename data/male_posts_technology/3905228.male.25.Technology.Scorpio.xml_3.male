I can't promise you that tomorrow  will be perfect or that life will be easy.  I can promise you my ever lasting devotion, my loyalty, my respect, and  my unconditional love for a lifetime.  I can promise that I'll always be there for you, to listen and to hold your hand,and  I'll always do my best to make you happy, and make you feel loved.  I can promise that I'll see you through any crisis, and hope with you, dream with you, build with you, and always cheer you on and encourage you.  I can promise that I'll share my dreams my world, and every aspect of my life with you.  I'll willingly be your protector, your advisor, your counselor, your friend, your family, your everything.  And I believe that's what love is truly all about.
