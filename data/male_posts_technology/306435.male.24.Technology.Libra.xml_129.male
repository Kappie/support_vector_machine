The good news is the standings came out and we are no longer in last place.    In other news Kristin Hill is getting married this weekend.  Saturday in fact.  i will be heading back to Louisville for that one.  It should be interesting to see some old faces at the wedding.  Speaking of old faces I spoke to Whitney Blaine on IM this week.  She seems to be doing well.  She is in school and working as a nanny.  Ann left for Portland this morning.  K$ and Elizabeth went to her house last night and our occompaning her out west.  It should be a fun trip.  I already miss her.  It is weird...I missed having her in town and now I miss just IMing with her.  It will be a long year, but my letter writing should improve.  Tom is gone for the weekend and Justin too.  it is amazing how all my friends leave at the same time.  Justin is going to Wapak or Iowa, I am not sure.  Tom is house sitting for his dad.  Mr. Greaves is biking up to Sturgis.  Other than all that there is not too much goin on.
