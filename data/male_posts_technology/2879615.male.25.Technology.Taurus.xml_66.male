He was seen climbing up rocks and trees and crouching for about 20 minutes before stumbling through the wilderness and falling into Ashley, Walt, and the ice block.  He was peeing. He got up, brushed his shoulders off, and walked away missing just one pant leg. Bill you're the man.  Did I ever tell you tequila is my favorite liquor, that shit is ruthless and the ice block unforgiving.  But I showed that shit whose boss for a few hours, before it came back to haunt me at 7am when i was puking off my deck in my underwear. Luckily kimbo was there to watch me puke and smoke a bowl with me as she was leaving, haha sooooo fucked up still.  Having a fiery hot Paul Choe pissed off is not a good thing.  However, he was able to be contained along with drunken capitol and nyerlin by me to ultimatley save the lives of both Mike D. (Ben's boy) and my actual brother Greg.  Doing Fun stuff with Ashley and Holzmann will never let you down especially when that shit is free. He must have felt pretty close to us cause my man got to see more of us later on that night hahaha. GREAT PARTY  Oh did you think i wouldn't give shouts to Luke and Ben those mother fuckers will hook up with anything that is warm and wet.
