This might take a couple posts to get through because it needs a lot of details. It is a complicated story. Unlike the dog confession, nobody in my life really knows this whole story - not my wife, not my former boss, not anyone except you. If I tell the story right, you might be able to see the first glimpses of the underwater part of the rotting iceberg that is me.  I should start this story about two and a half years ago. I was sitting in a conference room at work, where our team would gather to use our collective brainpower to solve as many of our old clients' issues in a day as possible. Plus, having the group together was fun sometimes, even when we were working our asses off. Anyway, on that day at lunch time, one of my co-workers and I, I'll call her   KL    _ ,  were sitting around talking - everybody else had left, and I got a phone call. I talked for a few minutes - didn't say much as I recall. After the phone call,     KL_    and I continued talking but she could tell I was upset - or maybe just a little distracted - and asked about the call. It was my wife, I told her, telling me that she got a job offer back in her hometown. Which to   KL_   didn't sound like such a big deal. Right away, I knew we would end up moving there. I always told my wife we would. I also knew there weren't really any logistical obstacles to it happening. So that day I knew my life, my career, would make a radical change. I wasn't opposed to the idea, but it took quite awhile to wrap my mind around it -- I was settled in, secure with my job though not entirely happy (I'll get back to that), had all the friends I needed or had time for, two kids and another on the way ... you get the idea. The moving thing was out-of-the-blue, but I'm a person who likes change (read escape) so after a little while and with very little convincing needed from    A_    (my wife), the move was on.   Now, as the wheels of change began to turn, and as I correctly guessed, most of the obstacles to my moving back to   A_'s    hometown melted away fairly quickly.    A_   was I think a little amazed at my willingness to go. But I am the world's greatest husband and I would do  anything  to make her happy. Yeah  right . As is usually the case when I do nice things, I had an ulterior motive.    You see, my job had been a love/hate relationship for quite awhile. At the time, I had seniority, and was the technical guru in a very small area of expertise. Plus I was involved in the customer service side of things, so I dealt with the worst sorts of problems. Very high stress job, much job satisfaction when things went well. Very low lows when things were going badly. I'd been doing the same job for about 3 years. This was about twice as long as anyone else I knew lasted doing it without leaving one way or another. So ... when the opportunity came along to get away, I saw it as a good thing, and I siezed my ticket to a graceful exit. But then, something happened that surprised me. When I told my boss that I wanted to quit, he suggested I continue to work for him, but remotely. In other words, I could be stay-at-home dad. At the time, I couldn't believe my good fortune. This was going to be great. I move away, but keep contact with my old team (most of whom are/were good friends), I don't feel like I'm abandoning them, plus I get to spend more time with my two (soon to be 3) kids. All in all, it sounded like a win-win situation. Except the problem of me hating my job  was never solved . At the time, I was too happy to consider this minor detail.  So ... after about a month, I'm living in a nice little rural town of about ten-thousand friendly people, in a great big house, working remotely from home, spending all the time I want with my kids. Making my own hours. My wife was working a job she liked and making pleny of money. Who could ask for a better set up?
