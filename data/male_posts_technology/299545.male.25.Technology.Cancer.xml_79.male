In addition to our professor,  urlLink John Broderick , who is a sitting Associate Justice on the NH Supreme Court, the following people were there:   urlLink Norman Veasey : the current Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court (a state in which 60% of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated, making it very important for subject of the class)  urlLink Robert Fiske : a lawyer at Davis Polk in NYC. He was the special prosecutor for the Whitewater case, the US Attorney in charge of organized crime in NYC, and has been part of most every important corporate criminal case in the past decades.  urlLink David McLaughlin : former Dartmouth President, and current chairman of the Red Cross.  urlLink Gregory Lau : a director at General Motors  urlLink Steven McAuliffe : Federal District Court Judge in NH  It was an amazingly interesting night, both at dinner and during the class period afterwards where they each of them spoke for a while. I have a feeling I won't be in such a high powered room for a long long time.
