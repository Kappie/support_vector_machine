Time passes slowly as it reaches around 11++a.m Somebody knocked on the door  tada! Piano has arrived, it looks so nice, so elegant  Honey was eagerly playing with it the moment it was being setup. Tidied the whole bedroom eventually  have the piano moved in... Honey was so excited the whole day that she sms her friend to share the joy...
