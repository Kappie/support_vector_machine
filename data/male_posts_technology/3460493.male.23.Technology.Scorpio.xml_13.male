From my graduation, to going to the beach, to buying a new car, it was the best couple of days I've spent in a very, very long time. So it should be normal that I think today officially sucks!  The day after my graduation, I went to the beach with my brother, his wife and my girlfriend. We went to a beach so secluded that we were there for more than 5 hours and no one else appeared! It rocked having a beach all to ourselves. That beach is next to a summer house that I went to when I was in high school. The parents of a schoolmate rented the house for the weekend, and I spent an entire day there. It was probably one of the best days in my high school life. So going there again brought back some good memories. I don't have too many good memories, but whenever they come back, it's fun to remember those times!  I also got a new car! A Toyota Corolla 2004, to be precise. I needed a ride, because I was using my mom's car to get here to work, while she was using my sister's car. That was five months ago, so I had to do something! I didn't have any credit at all, which meant being rejected by every car dealer in my area. I checked the last one out, before going in and settling for an older car. That dealer treated me very nice, mostly because a sale for them would mean $$$ in commisions! They checked out my credit, and gave me a chance. So now I have a new toy!  It was a great week, hopefully I'll have another week soon as good as this one. One can only hope for it. Hope everyone's having a great day. See you all later!
