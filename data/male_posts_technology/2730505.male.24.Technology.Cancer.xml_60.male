I have only moved to go live by myself once and that was back when I was a freshman at MSU (I guess you can count that as two because I did go back for my sophomore year).  I really don't know what to expect since this is a different setting from when I was in college.  I have a real job now and I didn't have a job when I was in college.  I can buy beer now compared to the very young age of 17 when I first got to college, heck I couldn't even buy smokes!  I will be moving in with people that I know compared to the two different room mates that I had at State.  I have to pay for everything now compared to nothing before.  I guess I need this.  I know that I won't be at my parents forever and I really don't want to be there forever.  It feels like it's time to leave the security of the parents house and be on my own, somewhat.  This is also a great deal, $200 a month plus other stuff that will be split three ways.  That's pretty good.  All in all I think it's going to cost $300 to live there.  That includes rent, utilities and groceries.  My room is small.  It's like the office room of a two bedroom apartment.  Dimensions are 9x12 with no windows.  Instead of a window I have a sliding glass door.  I can pretty much get my little car through the glass door way if the glass doors aren't there.  I really don't have a lock on my door but I'm not worried about that.  I can fit my futon in there as well as my closet.  I can have my own TV in there and it's going to fit in just fine.  I just need a computer table for the laptop and that's probably the only thing I will be buying in terms of furniture for the room.  I don't exactly know what "things" I will be putting up on the walls but I know it can't be bare.  Good thing there are already cooking wear and dishes there as well as their furniture for the apartment.  I got a couple of shelves that we could probably use somewhere in the apartment, just not sure where.  The parental units have given me some linen to start out with so that's cool.  Besides that big furniture stuff I just gotta bring clothes, shoes, old bills, some sort of decoration, computer books, and that's pretty much it.  So in review, I will be bringing my futon, closet, TV stand w/ TV, shelving units, computer, clothes, old bills, decorative elements, linen, bath room stuff, computer books.  I don't know what else to bring.  I also gotta figure out how long it's going to take me to get to work now, I think I might have added an extra 15 minutes to my drive or shaved off 10 minutes depending on which way I would take to work.  Would it be more economical to buy an IPASS and take the expressway or drive around in the burbs for an extra 15 minutes.  I don't know, that's another thing I gotta figure out.  Oh yeah, I gotta change a change of address as well.  Yeah, my room is going to be cozy.  Not huge but it's going to be enough, I figure, there's the damn living room if I wanted to hang chill or something, bedroom would probably be reserved for alone time, sleeping, or "extra curricular" activities.  I suppose since I am living with other people the process of asking for permission to have people sleep over from out of town would have to be addressed if they sleep in the living room.  The food issue I guess is BYO.  Sharing is permitted as long as you ask and replenish what has been depleted.  I will probably be the one who is going to be cooking.  I don't mind as long as they buy the food and shit.  Made plans with Meghan so that she could be down here to help me move.  Parents would probably let me borrow the truck and actually I can bring all the furniture and a lot of little things in one trip.  It should be able to fit in the Expo.  I think I could even move in in one day.  It would take a few hours before and after to take shit out and arrange everything.  It's do-able.   I know there will probably be issues with living with other people but I think it will be quickly resolved since it has been established that any problems should be immediately taken cared of before it becomes a bigger issue.  I like that, it's not girly and catty and bitchy.  Yeah, this should be an experience.  I feel like a little kid standing on the edge of the deep end of the pool wanting to jump in.  Determined but scared at the same time.   Here's the floor plan.  I will be moving into the den.  Not a bad space at all.
