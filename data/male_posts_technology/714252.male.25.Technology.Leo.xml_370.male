Category Unknown  You don't fit into any of the above categories, so perhaps before you get angry or confused, check what other religion(s) you scored the highest on. For example, you might be a Christian-Pagan, or a Discordian-Wiccan. Just use a bit of logic. However, according to this test, you're simply 100% YOU. You don't fit into any of the world's boxes.  It's funny, my breakdown was: Fundamentalist Christian (You scored 0) Holy Roller (You scored 0)  Average Christian (You scored 0)  True Christian (You scored 0)  Modern Satanist (You scored 0)  Theistic/Traditional Satanist (You scored 0)  Luciferian (You scored 0)  Devil Worshipper (You scored 0)  Atheist (You scored 2)  Agnostic (You scored 3)  New Aged/Wiccan (You scored 1)  Pagan/Occultist (You scored 0)  Discordian (You scored 0)  Category Unknown (You scored 4)   But I wouldn't define myself as an atheist at all, I have very definite belief that there is some form of God and I agree with a lot of what the different religions say but when it comes down to it I find that there is no "organised" religion out there that matches my belief.  Anyway that is enough of that.
