Saturday  - Day started in a rather Lethargic mode,by the time Ireached my  place -my dad had pressed the panick button due to the delay in my arrival, then called him andinformed that I' ve arrived safe.  Elder sis called me and announced the plans for KMU is dropped, thenhad to rush to drop  my younger sis and pay a visit to doc and also for ticket arrangements, in the night hired and watched Around the Word in 80 days and Okkadu. Had a major fun time with my neice, who of late has become a major movie buff - budding prospect - hahaha    Sunday - morning rushed to get my tickets and got he medical bills from the doc and returned back and then again wandered to buy the vegetables and hired simhadri.  then had a chat with Dad. Mom was wondering abt prospects for me which I promptly shut then and there.  Then she was wondering abt the younger sis,elder sis and my younger neice.then it started to rain heavily, somehow left for the station, luckily younger niece was sleeping otherwise it would have been a mayhem.  Again in the train had annoying co passengers swtiching off the lights, etc, somehow managed and completed the novel "Da vinci Code", what a superb thriller it was.    Monday  - Train got delayed , arrived late to the office, luckily had informed abt the train scheduel prior. Somehow managed to c the day thru- throughout the day was feeling damn tired and left home early.Mom rang to knwo abt my arrival.    Tuesday  - It was a fine start reached office early, had a head start and was fully occupied in work, it was a fine day, made up my mind that I'll manage from now on to be here in office at the same time,  hopefully I can repeat the same on wednesday.
