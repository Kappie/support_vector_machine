I told her that Jeremey's nickname was bull frog just like her nickname was Rissa Roo she thought that was funny and stopped the conversation just to point out that Jeremey's name was bull frog.  I even went so far as to sing the Jeremiah was a bullfrog song to her. She thought that was silly too.  Karissa and I talked about what she did today and what was going on.  As usual Karissa told me nothing.  I have a feeling that Lisa is out looking for work or hanging out with her boyfriend and the kids are at home watching Karissa.  I talked to Jeremey asked him how he was doing.  Told him I still wanted to talk to him and that I was not ignoring him but I was not supposed to talk to him and he said OK.  I am still waiting for the thunder I am sure will be coming.    :)
