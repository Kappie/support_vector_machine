Besides being ultra small the Qualia 016 is full of technology and comes with a suit-case full of accessories. For instance, in order to eliminate the blur caused by tiny movements of the hand, the 016 takes up to 4 pictures in very rapid succession and then combines them into one image. The Sony Qualia is hand assembled and only available in very low numbers.  Japanese Gadget Exporter Dynamism is selling it for $4,780.00 on special order.
