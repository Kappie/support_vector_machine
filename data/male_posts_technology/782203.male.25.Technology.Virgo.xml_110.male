I think need to do back strengthening exercises or something; or maybe i'm just getting old : ( After that came back to my place where he was playing Championship Manager on my PC for like god knows how long while I got so bored I even fell asleep.  Just watched Living with Lydia couple minutes ago; the whole plot of the episode was ripped off Look Who's Talking , you know the movie with the baby that talks; it was really awful. Oh the American Music Awards is on now i go watch liao !
