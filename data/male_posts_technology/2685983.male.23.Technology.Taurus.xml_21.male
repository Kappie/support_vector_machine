We're investigating driving, bussing, and flying options  3. I forget what number 3 is  3. Oh yeah. I'm a total dork but this week was a good one for comics. I'll write some reviews as soon as I'm not so tired  4. I just got two new DVDs Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season One and Bob Dylan: Don't Look Back. Curb is awesome. Haven't watched Dylan yet.  5. The  urlLink threeohsix.org  benefit show is tomorrow. Should be good (or at least nice to meet a few people in person).  p.s. tomorrow is Friday. Time to get shitfaced ;)
