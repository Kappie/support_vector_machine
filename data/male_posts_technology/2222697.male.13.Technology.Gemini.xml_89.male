It was probably one of the most boring 3 hours of my life, it took about 3 seconds for every kid to get his diploma... all of this added up to about half an hour.  I actually started playing ct again, I paused for a while to get away from the rpg's. I bought Breath of fire II but I am going to return it. It already formatted my cartidge the first day, that is why I hate to play some old games.  I got a lot of money today, some relatives stopped by for a graduation party for Allen. My GREAT grandmother gave me five dollars, she is about half my height though. I have to write all of these people thank you notes.  I have been talking with a bunch of realatives from both sides of the family until now...when I finnaly get the chance to post.  -all for now
