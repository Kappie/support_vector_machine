Mom and Dad said they are going to finish half the backyard including the pool then start doing the inside, like getting the wood floors finished and redoing the tile in the bathrooms and kitchen. Then painting and redoing Meryl and their rooms. I think my mom will be pulling up the carpet in their bedroom and putting in woodfloors. Then after they finish that they will finish the back part of the backyard and fix up the cute doll house in the back. I'm really happy my parents are doing this now. It's easier since they don't have the restaurant anymore. That was simply impssobile to get anything done. That's when everything went kapoots!! Anyways... I have to straighten up the house and then do some personal grooming cause I smell!! :) I love you, Edgar!! Talk to you soon!!  Oh, don't forget tomorrow we will watch T3, maybe eat sushi and then I would like to go to Northridge mall. I want to see if they have any shirts that I saw at Topanga mall. They didn't have any sizes. Okie dokes!! I love you. Bye bye!!
