Then it suddernly dawned on me ... they were both  folk  albums.  Gosh-darn it, is simple burn smart enough to know I shouldn't be listening to that folky shite.  What else could it be.!?  Oh, I later found out, the battery was nearly flat on my minidisc player, so it was crapping out during the transfer.  HEY, but I like the      X    Error 504 - Your MiniDisc Player Detected Folk Music     explaination better.
