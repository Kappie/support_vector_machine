They will legitimately do a better job of what barcodes do, as well as reduce theft.  But the added observation power they give to anyone with a RFID Reader is concerning at best.  "You" can be tracked by RFID-tagged clothes or other consumer items you carry around.  Where you go, what you do, what you buy, what you pick up but decide not to buy, ...    Not trivial stuff.  And it is coming.  One of the biggest drivers: Walmart.
