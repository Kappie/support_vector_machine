I don't know if I would go that far, but I am sure it was used before Microsoft was ever thought of.   Quoting   urlLink Microsoft Receives Patent For Double-Click   Could mere humans have thought up the concept of clicking twice!   The summary of the patent in fluffed-up-fancy-shmancy-english terms is:  Quoting   urlLink United States Patent: 6,727,830   A method and system are provided for extending the functionality of application buttons on a limited resource computing device. Alternative application functions are launched based on the length of time an application button is pressed. A default function for an application is launched if the button is pressed for a short, i.e., normal, period of time. An alternative function of the application is launched if the button is pressed for a long, (e.g., at least one second), period of time. Still another function can be launched if the application button is pressed multiple times within a short period of time, e.g., double click.   Ironically, the FTC is  urlLink planing to examine the patent application process  to avoid patent abusers and "patent trolls"
