I am very happy for him and Liz, and simultaneously very discomfited by the association of age this brings up. I am not that old yet.  Great fun this week watching Kasparov battle the top computer chess program again. The final battle will be on Tuesday. watch at  urlLink x3dchess  website here. Good chess commentary on the match archives too.  Interesting things happening in the Go world too, as you can see at  urlLink Gobase.org . The male and female holders of the Honinbo title are getting married! and Japan lost the first Internet Japan-China match. Get on IGS, for good internet play, certainly better than I can handle.   on the IRC side, we at #immortal on irc.lucifer.com got to talk to a guest speaker today, Mike Treder, the Executive Director of the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology. Mr. Treder was very gracious in answering questions and exploring interesting ideas. the log should be available on the main page of the Imminst.org  urlLink website . It was very interesting, and quite a lot of fun. The CRN publication to read is the new nanofactory feasibility study at  urlLink  jetpress .   er, ah, and, yeah.  I'm doing okay. In an interesting side note, I started taking Strattera a few days ago, some subjective difference, we'll see how a month or two of trials go, and I'll submit a more detailed report then.   Oh, and everybody is required to go to the library and get the book "Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the way we make things" or you can just buy it  urlLink here .
