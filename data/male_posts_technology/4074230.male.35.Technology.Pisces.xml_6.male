The local party has a serious shortage of precinct captains, and with my inherent fear of what will happen if GWB has four more years to plunder the countryside, I volunteered and went out and put some blisters on my feet, attempting to spread some of the hope I garnered from the Democratic Convention.  Some of my neighbors were staunch Republicans; just as I had suspected. You can pretty much tell who those people are in my neighborhood by a cursory inspection of their homes. My neighborhood is one of those, in the first throes of historical reconstruction. Those whose homes have already undergone refurbishing are pretty much conservative.  The poor are pretty much firm Democrats, with some exceptions! The exceptions are the Religious Right. This is pretty much a mystery to me. If Jesus had been born thirty-three years ago, I'm certain he'd be branded as an extreme leftist by the conservative pundits today. I'm also just as sure that the televangelists would crucify him (they'd probably nail him tighter to the cross than the Roman soldiers did two-thousand years ago; just to make sure he never rose from the dead). In short the money-changers have returned to the temple.  More to the point however, I walked up to the home of one of one of my neighbors who I knew was a disabled veteran (and not very well off I might add). I was not prepared for the reception I received. As soon as he saw my Kerry shirt, I was bombasted with a long line of expletives, followed by: "Are you for Kerry? I won't vote for Kerry, he ain't no Christian. Bush, now he's a Christian. No I won't be votin' for Kerry. I'll be votin' for Bush, he's a Christian!  I didn't even try to change his mind in the least. I've run up against this mindset before, (in fact I was reminded of how Jesus himself felt when people were so willingly blinded by false belief). They believe what they're told by the likes of Limbaugh, Hannity, O'Reilly, Robertson, Falwell, and on and on and on.....oh yeah, let's not forget the pastor of the local [insert brand name here] fundamental bible believin' church.  Now before I start getting a bunch of flaming hatemail, let me explain that I have no axe to grind with Christians as such (some of my best friends are Christians...), what I don't get is how someone could call themselves Christian and still back the Bush-Cheney ticket. Neither one seems to me to be very much like Christ at all, yet the very meaning of the word Christian is "little christ".  Seeing as how the bible very explicily states; "by their fruits ye shall know them", I'd like to invite you to compare Bush-Cheney's actions with Jesus' teachings in the following article by Ernest Partridge, entitled:          "What would Jesus Do?"
