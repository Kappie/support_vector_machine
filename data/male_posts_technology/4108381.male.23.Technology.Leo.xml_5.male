Nothing much, but I think she wants me to start taking medicine to balance out my chemicals. I'd probably start taking them but I always forget to. I haven't breathed through my nose in months because allergy pills are so damn hard to remember.  I talked to  urlLink Jamie O  last night. She's a quirky, fun girl to be around, plus she's a pretty kickass writer. If I ever get my own talk show she is promised a job. We talked about Teri and how she might have issues she needs to work through and I know that Jamie is right. She commented on everything I commented on two months ago when Teri left. I should add Smart to Jamie's list of personality facets.  I told Teri that I thought she had issues that she needed help working out. Her response was that I was the clinically depressed one. She refused to see a counselor because she wants to revert back to the angst filled teenager who scrawled bad poetry everywhere.  That's what this al boils down to. Teri felt that she could never be a poet with me. I think that in two years I was the subject of only one positive poem and several negative ones. She says I stifled that part of her with television and constant noise. Whatever. I don't hate her passions. I still revert to poetry every once in a while because it's so basic and clean.  I have to work a 17 hour day today. It sucks. If your in Indy tonight come to Howl at the Moon and ask for Bruce the Aloha guy.
