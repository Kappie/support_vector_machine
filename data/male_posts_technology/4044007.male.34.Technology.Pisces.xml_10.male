So what do we know about our two candidates and where they stand on womens issues? After a lot of digging this is what I came up with. To me it seems like George wants to model today's women after the oppressed women in the middle-east.  Bush: 1) Wants to ban abortion. Sabotaging Policies that Protect Womens Health and Reproductive Rights 2) Rolling Back Policies That Guarantee Equal Opportunity for Women at Work 3) Backtracking on Policies That Guarantee Equal Opportunity for Girls and Women at School 4) Shortchanging Child Care and Other Supports Women Need to Maintain Self-Sufficiency 5) Starving Programs Women Need to Pay for Tax Cuts for the Wealthy 6) Weakening Efforts to Combat Violence Against Women and Help Its Victims  An excellent report can be found at: http://www.nwlc.org/pdf/AdminRecordOnWomen2004.pdf   Kerry: 1) "Clearly, this White House is more interested in appealing to its electoral base than it is in protecting women's health." 2) Voted repeatedly against the Partial Birth Abortion Ban 3) Will greatly expand after-school programs to serve 3.5 million children and fund a historic increase in the Child Care Tax Credit to meet the needs of overstretched parents. 4) Believe that we must make equal pay for equal work a reality, not a slogan. 5) Was an original co-sponsor of the Women's Health Equity Act, which ensures women's access to the highest quality and most advanced health care available. 6) Title IX has helped extend opportunity in education and athletics to millions of girls and women. John Kerry and John Edwards will defend Title IX and work to expand college opportunities for women.
