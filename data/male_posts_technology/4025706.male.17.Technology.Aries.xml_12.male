Eye of the beholder fool!  Okay there is a saying that appears on the website that says Seek the truth, behold the truth, reveal the truth. For this is the law...blah blah. In phase two of the game reveal was completely gone from the accounts so I believe that in the first period the name of the game was reveal, in the second behold and lastly SEEK.  It makes SOME sense I dunno whaddya think? See you in period three.    A RECAP FROM THE FIRST PERIOD:    Okay basically the website  urlLink www.ilovebees.com  came up and people are like going "Whoa...dude....I'm seeing things....whhhooaaa my hands are soo....BIG....and my cape...soo....FLASHY" Anyways after the inital....SHOCK AND AWE!!!!!!! (MOABS FALLING FROM THE SKY!) died down people started saying "whoa, Dana is sexy" and then "Dude! there are hidden messages!"    So with all the messages logged and all the hidden texts revealed the question became...."huh?"  You can check out the progress of the people I'm working with at  urlLink http://elgamer.blogspot.com/  and Elgamer's website at  urlLink http://xbox-reformed.com/elgamer/index2.html   Basically we have come to the conclusions that the Operator who is behind the MAYDAY texts is the Queen and the Widow refers to the spiders and is reassembling (whatever that may mean) the queen.  There is not much said, other than in passing, about the pious flea and the sleeping princess.   I am going to do something rather dangerous and relate the Manticore to HALO.  I don't want to do that because we may jump to too many conclusions and in the end we'll be saying OMG OMG DANA IS THE MONITOR REBORN!  But anyways, I believe that the enchantment and the manticore refers to the flood.  Seeing has how a manticore has the head of a man, the body of a lion and the tail of a serpent?  And the manticore is not the only one there are others many others.  I offer you this as evidence.     "At the gates of the Inner Keep all the guards were dead but one, who when the palace was blasted by enchantment had not died, but had been witched into the form of a hideous Manticore. The Widow said, "I am the servant of your Queen, and I have walked up out of Hell to prepare this keep for her return. Let me pass."  But the Manticore did not know her, and still he barred the way. So the Widow drew her knife and slew the Manticore and the way was open. She walked through the empty corridors of the Keep searching for her Queen, past the bodies of her servants and subjects that lay dead or enchanted. "   His body has been transformed but his head and possibly his mind has not?....I'll let the HALO fanboys figure it out.  A NICE INTERMISSION AND A WEBSITE CRASH  Okay with PHASE1 complete we are in a fresh new period.  New texts so many new texts and new images and new texts and new theories....written in new texts woohoo!  We have a whole new cadre of people ONI Techs, Captains, Lieutenants, Midshipmen, Melissas (not the virus...though possibly), and more bees....OH GOD THEY ARE IN MY HAIR.   The new story I presume is again narrated by our dear lady operator and she just talks about repairs and revenge and stuff like that...you know all the sugar and spice and everything nice girls talk about?  heh.  There is also new text embedded in a series of images called "killer" as well as a whole swath of links go read the story at elgamer's website and bugger off.    HORSES FROM ITHICA    Just something I noticed. Oh and melissa is greek for HONEY BEE....GASP!    "A man thatseemed noble, classical and pure. A sailor with Odysseus. "     "Capt Greene: ...Even leaving aside our particular mission, there's the issue of letting them know we've broken their codes. If we bug out and scramble home to warn HQ about Troy,"     "Capt. Greene: I am not privy to strategic conversations at that level. But if we run home and present the decrypt, we put them in a tricky situation. If they act, they risk letting the enemy know we have a toehold in their C-and-C."     These are two excerpts that we know of.   The former comes from the killer-embedded messge decrypt.  The latter two come from the general phase 2 story. I noticed two similarities between Troy and Odysseus, namely Odysseus was one of the commanders in the trojan war and I think he was also the one who envisioned the trojan horse.
