Um Custard came out of hospital on his birthday which I am sure was much to his relief, although it is going to be a while until he can come out and play! Toaster seems to be absorbed by his new girly who seems to be illuding the rest of us (maybe we are too young for conversation or something). Danger doesn't have a great deal of contact with us so I can't really say much about his doings other than to say hope your feeling better mate. Grist continues to play with his little toy soldier in his underground bunker. Dougal seems to be settled into his new home, throwing bbq's that none of us know about asides Toaster. Kirk is settling nicely into the disfunctionate family and continues to be an inspiration to all hot blooded males who go out on the pull. Psycho has spent the last few months working as a pimp in Green St. I have been renewing friendships with old friend, making new mates and been pissed off at my computer because it only work two times out of every ten that I try to use it!!!  Other related business includes....  Lyndsey from Gaia's Web over in Guernsey is over on holiday and we might get to say hello if she gets time.  Decided to grow my hair again! Lets see how far I get this time!! I managed to pile the work truck into a Jurats car last week, DOH!!! Splash reamins the best nightclub in the island...town still SUCKS!!!! I am thinking of starting a new column named 'Baity's something or other', this being a section where I tell of my favourite likes and dislikes of the week etc. I was also thinking that we should run an 'Eye Wars' contest, but more to come on that as it develops.  A big hello to Liane, who appears to be all alone on the Shut It site, I'll have a big chat with ya next time I see you online. Right its 23:06ish and time for beddybyes! Got to get up for work at 5 these days!! Baity signing off......
