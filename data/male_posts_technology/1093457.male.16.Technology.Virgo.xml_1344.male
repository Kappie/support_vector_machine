It looks like i will be made to re-take that next year, (whats the chances of me getting A-C)  Anyway, whish you all luck with all your exams, anyone like me needs all the luck they can get their hands on. Talking of what you can get your hands on, anyone see the  10:30 ITV news    Croydon high school , which is litrally a stone throw away from my house was on there, as well as  john ruskin college  and  other selsdon schools , because a load of kids in this area have stolen exam papers before the exams, piles of papers have been found on the streets of selsdon, and where was i during all this sudden media attention in the selsdon area, IN KENLEY !!!!!!
