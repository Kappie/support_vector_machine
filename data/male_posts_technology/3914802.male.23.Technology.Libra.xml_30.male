First off, some people had signs up for glomps. ?- I have no idea what a glomp is and I was very confused by this. And it kind of made me pissed off that these people were confusing me, since I am supposed to be reasonably intelligent. I guess I will send an e-mail to the people of Otakon and ask em what is up.                  Friday I was there by myself and figured I would wander around for a while. I wanted to watch the Anime Music Videos since I thought they weren't going to be playing them that often, but I was wrong! They played it like 10 or 12 times so I could have just watched it the next day with my friends and not be seeing it for the 2nd time.  I went to the "otaku-rave" (one word?) and saw lots of interesting dancing, although I can't talk since I didn't dance myself. It wasn't that the music wasn't good, it was pretty awesome. I just felt a bit weird dancing without people that I knew there. Didn't want to be just dancing "by myself" I suppose, that and most of the people there were under 20.  So.. I went to a discussion on adult entertainment instead. They discussed lots of interesting differences between American and Japanese porn.  Like the fact that pretty much all of Japanese porn is legally bound to blur out actual penetration. They showed clips and everything! The bukkake film that they showed was hilarious. Right before the guys with blurred penises got to jerk off (I think they might just be blurred while jerking off at this point) on this girl this one guy from off camera ran up and spooged right at her. She was not prepared at all and she jumped up as the guy jizzed on her and the guy next to her. They must have rewound that clip 20 times. They also discussed "rape" videos and rope bondage and hentai and all of the other kooky stuff that originated in Japan. It was very informative. Especially when they said that Asian people have smaller penises than the American guys in porn. At least this gave me a good thought to have for the rest of the night and a little bit right now "my penis is big compared to Asian penis" hooray for me. After the panel I went back to J and E's apartment and wondered how E's girlfriend... whose name also starts with an E was doing. Because E and E2 were at the emergency room since E2 was having stomach problems. Turns out it was some kind of cyst and it was causing her troubles. I decided to have beer to celebrate her being alright later.                  I saw some interesting anime. This one called  urlLink Risky Safety  was pretty interesting even though they showed us episodes starting at the 9th one. This, made it very confusing. There was a little witch guy (risky) with a scythe and sometimes turned into a little angel (safety) and they were friends with this girl and then it changed to this other girl... WTF, anyways, the episodes were only 10 minutes long which made them... kind of annoying with the previews for the next episode happening twice before you saw it. I was also hung over on Saturday and Sunday since I went out drinking at my friends' place after "the con". I only had four hours of sleep friday night and was pretty dehydrated. Sunday, I didn't go back to Otakon because it was raining pretty hard out and I was wholly unmotivated mostly because my camera ran out of battery power (that piece of crap). I got to see my cousin at the convention as well. He went to drink with me Saturday night. I got him to do a flaming shot which I didn't partake in since 151 doesn't really seem that appealing. Although fire is appealing, very sensual, just not when I know that the 151 "tastes like burning". Good times, although there were so many  urlLink Inuyashas  there I had wondered if maybe I was supposed to go as him too but just forgot. I picked up some MegaTokyo manga and got the hell outta there. After watching Zatoichi: the blind swordsman first tho. And I must say that if you love samurai and cool fight scenes then you should watch this movie. enough for now :-P I am always making really long posts, and no-one is likely to read them, so what do I care (but I guess I should get back to work).
