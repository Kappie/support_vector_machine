Regardless of the diminishing global barbaric and violent behaviour in the world, people in society have never been angrier in history. Of course this results in indirect or direct acts of violence, but i prefer to see the world as a violent pacifist, rather than seeing a world of violent pacifist. The reason is simple, usually the violence of a pacifist will never be as equal nor greater than  the peace of a violent person...besides the latter one is just a ticking bomb waiting to be awaken. This being said, let me tell you a little story.  During the last week, i have been allocated a lot of free time from my new position at work. Hence, giving me the opportunity, to travel a bit. I decided to go with some friends to visit anotehr friend in Toronto. So as we went on in our journey, i still had a lot of spare time to my own and was able to have a time of reflection. It came to my mind that i must be one of the angriest person alive. I came to that conclusion after enumerating all of the time i demonstrated some kind of anger manifestation. As a result, it was an endless and bottomless pit of events that occured. But mostly, what happened during the trip made me realized that as i gazed through the stars at night.  Now, there are many types of angry people out there, but the most dangerous ones are the silent ones...so just to avoid being a happy member of that group, i, once and a while, try to express my anger.  Well let's just start with the driving experience to toronto...oh don't get me started with this(see Need For Speed Posting), to add to this, well have you ever had the impression that people giving you direction seems to take in account that whatever they tell you, seems to be comingout from one ear and going out by the other. but in reality, you actually hear them, know the way and chose to ignore them, so you then angrily show that you have acknowledge their saying and of course that usually doesn't come out as friendly as you would want it to be.  If that wasn't enough to tick you off, well there's a couple of situation where for some unknown reason, whenever you want something, there will always be some retard if not stupid, that will do everything in their powers(of course unconsiously) in order for you to failed at getting what you want. Let me tell you what happened in a little town named Cooksville, located in the suburb region of Toronto. As we drove back from the beach, we stopped at a Tim Hortons for directions, and a snack. So as i decided to take a mokaccino, i had a sudden urge for a strawberry chocolate tarts...you know like the one's in the commercials. so as i start to take in my order, here is what happened: Tim Horton Cashier(THC): Hi, can I take your order? Me: Yeah, i'll take a mokaccino, and a chocolate-strawberry tart THC: ok, anything else me: no.. as she prepares my mokaccino, another THC comes in and asks for the next person's command. she then puts in a white container and the THC that took my order came and gave me the mokaccino. THC: here you go. me looking suspiciously: Oh,sorry but i had ordered a tart too THC: yeah it's right here in the container. me: oh, sorry! i didn't know it was from me THC: oh it's ok. so as i walked anxioulsy towards my seat in a ogrely fashion, ready to devoure my tart, i opened the white conent, only to realize that it was a regular tart and not something i had ordered. so i went back to the counter. me: excuse me, i had ordered a chocolate tart, but this is a regular tart. the same THC that served me: oh, it's cause we don't have anymore before i could say anything, she went on. THC: wait let me check something THC: Hey Mac, do we have any more chocolate tart(outloud) Mac: nope, we don't have anymore. THC: sorry we don't have anymore.(smiles innocently) So i stood there, very dissapointed, wondering why would she have serve me a regular tart, when she knew there were not any more left, or if she didn't know, why wouldshe just lie to me and pretend nothing hapened...Did she think that a regular strawberry tart would pass unnoticed from my ogrely appetite for a chocolate tart. Well as angry as i was, I then realized that it was just a tart..nothing more..so i walked off and said it's ok.  As i stood in the car seat, wondering again and getting so angry about that THC for about 15min, i then decided to release my anger in my appetite for the regular strawberry tart. As I unleashed hell upon the tart, with my berserk and ogrely manners, i slapped down the tart in my face in a fashionable way as any good barbarian or norsemen would do in the glory times of vikings.   Only that night, have i realized that the anger in me was very strong, yet it was only for a tart...hinting me that i must be a very angry person to get so upset for such a little thing. ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRHGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH condemne that THC to the bottomless pit of hell for lying about that chocolate tart!!! well this posting is not as good as the one i had initially written, but the damn session on my laptop had expired and i had lots everything. hence lost the pure essence of anger and sarcasm i had initially put; yet i never learn and continue to directly write in the session box, instead of using temporarily notepad...*orc-ish grunt
