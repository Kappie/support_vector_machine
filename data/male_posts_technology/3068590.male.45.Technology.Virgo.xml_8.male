The years of stable prices has created the opportunity for an extremely efficient market economy. An efficiency that is realized on a global basis. The ability of the market to respond is truly remarkable, and required. There are a number of challenges ahead, and it seems that Mr. Greenspan has prepared us well for this future.   On Tuesday in his testimony to the Senate, Mr. Greenspan noted the level of sophistication that the market was using to hedge their risks and leverage the assets under management. And when you think of the changes in the means and methods of financial instruments, the analytical tools and understanding, not at the higher academic levels, but contained with the common public understanding, its no wonder that the market looks very rosy to Mr. Greenspan.
