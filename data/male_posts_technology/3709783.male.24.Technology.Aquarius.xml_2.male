Who knew Tuesday nights were two dollar pints of Micros and gloris Wednesday spelled two dollar pints of goose and bells. What a relaxing way to spend after work laundry time.  Looking forward to a company boat cruise tomorrow night. Joel is soo happy it won't be super hot and humid, my back sweats alot. Either way, it is going to cool tomorrow night or the free bar on the boat is air conditioned; I am going to have a blast. Even more cool, Sasha has the pleasure of attending. Joel is thrilled to be able to show such a wonderful woman off. =)  How do you spell cheese tortellini? However it goes I had it today. Peace out to teh hommies
