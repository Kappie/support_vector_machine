Lambert, the Sheepish Lion   I remember this as being one of my many favorites during those oh so special Disney previews. You know the ones we underprivileged kids would only get to watch when the Disney channel was trying to coax more people to subscribe to their station? They would broadcast their shows on basic cable for a week once every six months.... just long enough to get kids hooked on their shows. Then those same children would drive their parents insane by begging and pleading until they caved and ordered the damn channel just to stop all the whimpering and complaining.    It never worked with my parents. You'd think they had iron will or something.
