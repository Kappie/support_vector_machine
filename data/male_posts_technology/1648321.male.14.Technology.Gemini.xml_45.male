       
      Okay, just a few days ago (on Saturday), I got a MIDI-USB converter (for those who have NO clue what I am talking about, I'll explain). I couldn't get the MIDI to work within GarageBand until two nights ago (help from Robert over IM). What MIDI stands for is Musical Instrument Digital Interface. MIDI is better than regular audio because it has much higher sound quality, it takes up less space, you can use almost any instrument in the world with it, it is REALLY easy to modify the notes you play wrong on (on the computer in GB). Anyway, I am sorry that I haven't update by blog with REAL news lately. I'll try to get back into the schedule, but I've been pretty busy. ;-)
