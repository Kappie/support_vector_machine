We all got into teams of 5, our team was me, Helen, Pennie, Shelly and Ashley's girlfriend Stacy. We lost. But we had fun! I have two nice bruises on the inside of my knees now from where I kept hitting the steering wheel, painful but worth it! I drive like a man apparently. Hehe. You know, instead of going around the corners nice and slowly I rip around. Well, I try to. Lol. I didn't crash! Woo!
