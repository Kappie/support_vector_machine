That and the fact that this room has what I thought were "unfirewalled" connections to the internet.  I was almost right.  I'm able to use some applications like AIM which I wouldn't ordinarily be able to access, but I'm still blocked from some websites that I want, such as  urlLink Hello BloggerBot .  Again, bummer.
 
 I  have  had the opportunity to review some of the new "advanced" features that are now provided by our friends at  urlLink Blogger , which have remained as yet untapped.  For one, Blogger now provides real comments.  No more of this external comments crap.  This is good for two reasons (well, three reasons).  First, the site will load faster since it's not depending on external JavaScript files.  Second, the site will come up if said external JavaScript files are unavailable.  And third, your comments will no longer be stored in some shady external database for all the world to read.  You may now resume telling me how sexy I am and whatnot.
 
 A second feature I have now found is the fact that you can now subscribe to a syndicated XML feed of this site.  Simply point your news reader at the URL below and you will receive updates as they occur.  Cool stuff.

 So thanks be to  urlLink Google , which has completely transformed my blogging (among other  urlLink things ).  May they never start charging for all this cool technology.
