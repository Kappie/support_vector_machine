After a successful install, IIS will work as normal, except when a JSP or servlet is encountered, it will pass it along to Tomcat, which will process and send the results back to IIS.  Setting up the redirector is quite not trivial, this installer tool can really simplify your work.  [Resource-Type: Download/Weblink, Category: J2EE, XRating: 4.5]
