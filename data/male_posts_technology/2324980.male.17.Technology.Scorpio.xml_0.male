And I'm shooting the next person who tells me I have "an interesting way of viewing things.” I would rather have somebody say 'you're wrong and this is why' than 'I'm not sure if I agree but I guess your opinion makes sense from your point of view.” It's like it completely contradicts society to be 'right' or ‘wrong’… and all we have left is the grays and maybes.  A society as a whole has retreated into a shell of protection known as euphemism, and that shell protects us from learning anything. Want to live on the edge? Does your life lack excitement? That feeling will stay no matter what you do, until you have the courage to tell the world, 'no, you're wrong.’ And then prove it. So when I finish this article, tell me I'm wrong. Or tell me I'm right and you agree and you feel the same rage at political correctness that permeates our world, but don't tell me my opinion is a good one and has its merits.  Here's an encouragement to any who feel that they've lived life in a box too long. Start seeing absolutes. People these days have learned only to memorize, and not to think. Think for yourself, and you'll go somewhere. That's what makes somebody an individual.  That's all. Hope it wasn't too angsty.  Dan
