That's it...I need to make myself a routine in which I will stick too everyday (cept for the weekends) =p Umm...lets see..I have to wake up SUPER early in the morning (at about 5)..go to school to teach Maganda Tsai A+, then I have to go to work from 11 to 5, get home...and do housework for about an hour..then Im free at 7 o'clock and brokeass tired...LoL! Who would have thought that this is the "real world"...? Certainly not me..now...seeing Kathy everyday is real...but other  than that, work sucks, and I've neever had this much time be consumed like this...I'm looking forward to making a routine however, cause if I do the same things everyday like...work out..and impress my mom by doing house chores...I'll be able to BEAST school next year much much much more easily! Woo Wooo! So I guess Im pumped...The other day Freddie (one of my bosses) surprized me by getting me a 24 pack of Dew and sticking it in the fridge...now I can freely take a dew whenever I need it (yes need)...cause I must preserve the special green beverage to stay awake every day...Tis a blessing...WOO! Welp...Chris came over the other day and checked out the Mitsubishi...he said it kicks...and that Im a lucky bastard...and he's jelious...and Im not gonna even brag about it...cause I feel like a rich little white kid...but I'm not in the inside...and I want to continue being modest..and not flaunt...cause my ass "WILL" get robbed one day if I do...or ever did..lol! welp...crazy crazy day yesterday..went to work...failed to get to school to teach Kathy...I feel like I totally let her down..but I don't think its a biggy...my mom was on percasets and couldnt drive...and well..she was really pissy and stuff...just part of getting your FACE ripped off and having to go get plastic surgery...hmm...welp, I managed to clean my room half way yesterday...I put up banners on the slanted walls cause Chris i s a damn genius, and I moved all my furniture in place...soooo all I have to do now is just move all the shit that's on the floor onto the shleves and stuff! ^_^ Welp...gotta jet..see yah laters!
