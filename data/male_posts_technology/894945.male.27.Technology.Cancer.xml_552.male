I posted for the first time at home in a while and discovered that the new layout that dosent allow me to see the post button unless I move half the page frames about isnt the standard format and only relates to my works access to Blogger. If you change it, Can I still post? Can we still keep the archives? Anyway. Drink! Booze! Baitys Birds! We Miss you Mr T!  Anyway, A little something one of the dealers at work sent me (no not a drug dealer!) A photo of Hurricane Isabella     Why are hurricanes called after women? is it because they are warm and wet when they arrive and take your car and house with them when they leave?  And one that had me in stitches recently: René Descartes once walked into a bar. The barman said 'Like a drink?'. Ren replied 'I think not'. And promptly disappeared in a puff of logic.
