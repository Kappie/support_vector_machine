For DC, we did: - Capitol (outside only) - Air and Space (they did planetarium and IMAX) - White House (outside only) - Monument (outside only) - Vietnam Wall - Lincoln - Korean - WW II - Scuplture Garden - Dinner at Union Station - Thunder Grill  Whew.  Yeah.  It was fun though and perfect weather.  The new WWII is incredible.
