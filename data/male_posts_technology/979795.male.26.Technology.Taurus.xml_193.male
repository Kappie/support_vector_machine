But a lot of them I felt really unfamilar with. I might have seen them before but I'm really not too sure. Sensei Pauline was emphasing the need to move the centre around in the techniques. Of coz there were the fine technicalities of hand motion, feet work, etc as well.  It was an interesting way to drill in techniques coz she started with simple gyaku and ai hamni iriminage variations, before advancing on to morote, ryote and katate dori variations. I think my centering has improved slightly (but not a lot). I realised I need to be thinking less when I'm practising. Kinda juz empty my mind so that I can move accordingly.  I hope I can remember what I've learnt last 2 days and use them effectively next week. She might be bringing down some videos. If I can find out how my firewire connector of DV recorder works properly I'll probably make some copies for reference.  I was just thinking of my rock climbing experience few weeks back. I realised that the really good rock climbers have very very very stable and strong centering when they are climbing. Me, I only use my hands and legs. Basically I'm using muscle power which kind of just make it so much tougher and strenous to finish a climb. But they are all able to do it almost effortlessly. Same as Aikido, timing  confidence come in as well. Some handholds which are just too far away, they time themselves nicely to 'hop' a little to reach it. They also move their centre close to the wall before they stretch their limbs to reach a hand/foothold. Really really good. I'd like to try to 'experience' a little Aikido during a climb but I'm not good enough. I'm tryint to relate rock climbing to what I'm suppose to feel in Aikido. Sometimes, a change of environment seems to bring out other stuff in a different light. It seems to provide a different angle for you to 'see the light'.  Another area I'm trying to Aiki-sync is swimming. But I'm having a bit of difficulty. I think I'm thinking and concentrating too much. That's why I can't seemt to relate them. But if I don't think at all, I'm not able to 'see' the link. I just hope I can 'feel' it someday. Really love swimming. Woohoo.  O yea, was just at the  urlLink British Aikikai  website. I saw the site list Sensei Pauline as a 5th dan. Hmm ... I didn't hear that from my senior John. Might just ask them about it. Mabbe she got it last year while I was in Singapore or something.  Anyway, time for my lecture. Gotta run.
