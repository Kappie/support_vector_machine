I finished along with all of my training partners (at least those who registered). I will be updating anyone who I haven't talked to yet, but mostly my update is to say one thing today: THANK YOU  THANK YOU  THANK YOU!  To my training partners: All of you helped me through the training period as I went from no running to a marathon in 5 short months.  All of you offered such a wonderful motivation for long runs and helped me to keep going throughout the numerous injuries and hard training.  The marathon was a cinch with friends like you with whom I could laugh and talk and annoy other runners all the way through the marathon.  :)  All of you also helped to awaken the running spirit in me as I realized that running is something I greatly enjoy and, in part, something I was made to do.  Thank you!  To my family: You offered a such an encouragement throughout these past months and it was such an overwhelming joy to see you along the course and after the race.  Even for those of you who couldn't come or who I didn't see, your encouragement still helped me through some of the toughest miles running thus far.  Thank you for the words of the encouragement, for the signs, for standing out in horrible weather just to watch me run by, for dinners, for driving down from Chicago, and for continuing to support me throughout the whole training process and marathon.  Thank you!  To my friends: Thank you for your words of wisdom and encouragement.  Thank you also for those who also came down to stand in horrible weather or even had a desire to come down and stand in horrible weather to watch me run by and/or congratulate me at the finish.  All of you have been very helpful to me as I prepared for this marathon.  Thank you!  To everyone who has stuck with me through my many numerous updates, thank you, even if you didn't read them at all.  The updates provided an accountability to me to continue pressing on through injuries, amazingly bad weather, laziness, etc.  For those who are interested in seeing my progress since January, all my updates (minus the thought for the day) are posted on my weblog at http://spiderwoebrun.blogspot.com  It was all worth it in the end as I pushed through more miles than I have ever run to truly understand what a marathon experience is.  Thank you all for being a part of that experience in one form or another.  For a brief update of the actual marathon for those who are curious, I will gladly share now. The weather of the day started and stayed horrible in the standard sense, but it was perfect temperature for running and the rain didn't matter at all.  We got to the start line about 10 minutes ahead of time but only to find that we started basically at the back of the pack.  This didn't matter as we made up ground throughout the marathon.  I ran with Consuelo while Lisa and Natalie (the bandit!) broke off from us for a little while.  The first 6 miles went by with ease and we began our ascent into Eden Park and Walnut Hills.  The hills weren't nearly as bad as I remember on previous runs and we talked all the way up the hills, said hi to the family, and kept right on going.  Consuelo and I caught up with Lisa and The Bandit just before mile 9 and we all mostly stuck together through mile 15.  From mile 9, the miles went by faster than I can ever remember and it wasn't until mile 18 that I really even started noticing them.  The course was gorgeous, and in spite of the weather, I cannot believe the amount of spectators that were out to cheer.  Around mile 18, our talking and jokes and laughing slowed a little as we entered into the hardest section of the marathon.  We all stayed together (or at least within 50 yards of one another) through mile 21 when Natalie broke off from us and we found some other friends running.  The family magically appeared just after mile 21 which was awesome and helped me through the next mile or so.  By the time I reached mile 23, I was reaching that running "wall" some may have heard of and I had to stop to walk through the water stop.  I picked right back up after a minute but had to stop again at mile 24 for water and to walk again.  I could easily consider miles 23  24 the hardest of my life thus far as the spectators were strangely absent, the miles felt like 15, and each incline felt like Everest.  By the time I reached mile 25, I had recovered enough to know I could run into the finish and the family magically appeared just after that again which gave me the adrenaline I needed to power through the last mile.  Coming into the final mile is impossible to explain to anyone who hasn't experienced it.  After such a long run, to see the family and crowds all cheering for the runners, it was one of the most emotional points of the whole race.  If I would not have been so excited about finishing, I would have wept for all those who came out just to cheer.  Coming into the finish was absolutely glorious because I was still running, could have kept running, and wanted to weep for joy.  Thank you all again for everything.  For those family and friends who are runners, I look forward to running with you in about 6 months after I recover.  For everyone else, I will talk to you soon.  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you!
