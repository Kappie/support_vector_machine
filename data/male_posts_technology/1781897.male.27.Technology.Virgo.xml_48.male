This has been a watering hole of this group of people for God knows how long...and ya know what.....I just can't figure out why they even go there!  While there this weekend standing out on the back patio.....quickly approaching death because everyone and their mom is smoking cigs.....chain style......I gasp for some fresh air and some suds.....our little party is abruptly interrupted by some bouncer asshole (who did't even look 21) who informed us that wearing our hats backwards made us gang related.....now ..... i'm sure this asshole had no idea he was talking to an accountant and a engineer (the most dangerous of gangstas) otherwise he'd have shown a lil more respect....the best part...my accountant Jwumpy friend was all fired up and Jack n Coke so he got lippy...was great to see.....we left.  A side note...not only do these assholes tell you how to wear a hat, they make you take a fucken pass to get to and from the bathroom.....I plan on never going there again......until next time.
