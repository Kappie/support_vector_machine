Music, is free. Not free like money-wise, but free like open-source software. Sure, you paid money for the amplifiers and recording booths, but just because YOU (the band) think that you actually have a band doesn't mean you can go around putting a price tag on somthing that you can just do. Music isn't about making money, ask any band director that. Music is about having fun, it's about dedication to what you do, to all the people you can make happy just because you have a great voice, and you're really great at playing guitar. If the RIAA wants to bitch about music, here's what I see happening in the near future:  Scene: Beej walking to Kelly's to drop off her new ripped CD. He is whistling one of the songs that is ON the CD.  Beej: Whistle, whistle whistle... (Rustling is heard from behind the bushes, man jumps out with a gun) Man: FREEZE! THAT SONG YOU ARE WHISTLING IS COPYRIGHT 2005 BY THE RECORDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA! YOU ARE IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF BOTH THE "FREE MUSIC SUCKS" LAW AND THE USA "PATRIOT ACT!" Beej: Wha? Man: SHUT UP, YOU TERRORIST!  See? WE HAVE TO KEEP MUSIC FREE.
