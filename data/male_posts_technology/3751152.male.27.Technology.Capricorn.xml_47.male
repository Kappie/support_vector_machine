I even took culinary classes in college to learn how to cook better.  On the same note I love health and fitness. I run about 30-35 miles a week, I lift weights an hour a day and I do strenuous stretching three times a day.  On a third note I hate doctors and I hate going to the doctor. I've well known as someone who gives doctors and nurses a hard time and I'm generally difficult to perform the simplist checkup.  So needless to say last week I'm in the doctor's office and the nurse (god bless her) is getting a usual earful from me about why she's doing this and I'm paying the doctor when all he does it come in and give me a pat on the shoulder before telling me to come back in six months. She smiles because she knows I really give him a hard time about doing the things mentioned above and getting paid large sums for this.  Anyway, I step on the scale and it reads 246, around 15 pounds above my weight. 15 Pounds!...Well the scale must surely be broken and I'm not level the office until I get a second reading from another scale...Hmm 246 again...I go to one of the supermarket scales and it's 246...Sonofabitch...246 pounds...Well I don't feel any different, I don't look any different and my clothes fit the same...So what the fuck?  Well apparently I'm getting older and my eating habits are that of Corey at 24 instead of Corey at (soon to be) 29. So I was told to research my eating routine for the last 10 years and examine how much it changed.  Most people don't have a documented eating routine from 10 or more years but doc knows that I used to play college football (actually I got a scholarship for playing college football and flamed out with a knee problem) and I saved my eating plan from that and actually reduced my food intake based on that chart about six years ago.  So for the end of part one, I'm going to give you my eating schedule when I was 18 years old at the University of Tennessee, where I was on scholarship to play football. Now the football program had a group of nutrition and health workers to keep us on our schedule six days a week (Sunday was an official junk food day)...The food intake is borderline scary but be reminded that it was made for me to gain about25-30 pounds and get from my high school weight of about 215 to the weight of a football linebacker...So here was Corey's daily schedule as taken from my file (I'd scan it but my scanner ain't cooperating)   6:30 a.m. Voluntary Cardio workout  7:10 a.m. Weight training  8:00 a.m. Breakfast (Mushroom omelet of 6 eggs (4 eggs whites, two full eggs) side of potatoes or grits, two slices of wheat toast, one glass OJ, one glass skim milk, and as much water as he wants; Three days a week I had mushroom, three days a week I had a cheese omelet and a side of turkey bacon).  9:00 a.m. I think I had a class...or an angioplasm...  10:00 a.m. Mid-Morning snack (Oatmeal with banana, strawberries, brown sugar, and milk).  11:00 a.m. Probably had a class...or went to the bathroom.  12:30 p.m. Mandatory cardio workout (yay, running in 95 degree Tennessee heat)  1:00 p.m. Lunch (Two sandwiches [usually turkey, tunaor roast beef for me] and two bowls of fruit and at least two glasses of water)  2:00 p.m. Probably had a class [My class schedule ended at about 3 every day]  3:15 p.m. Specialized health shake (Usually some blueberry, banana, honey mix with too much protein powder)  3:30 p.m. Practice  6:30 p.m. Dinner(Two grilled chicken breasts (or a big steak/prime rib if I was lucky), two baked potatos, two vegetables, some sort of bread. At least two glasses of water and a glass of icea tea: On two days I'd usually have a heavy dose of pasta and salad).   9:00 p.m. Late Evening snack (Usually a couple bowls of fruit)  Okay that was what I was forced at 18...In Part 2, I'll tell you about my necessary diet and my high cholesterol (SURPRISE!)
