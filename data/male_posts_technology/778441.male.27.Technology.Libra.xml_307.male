This is to announce a temporary suspension of blogging on this weblog   For the next few days, I'll be located at a new place on the web, carrying out my blogging activities as usual. This is the result of my being one of the beta testers for  urlLink TypePad . So, while this blog remains static until further notice, I shall be actively blogging on the brand new TypePad blogging system.  My new temporary address is   urlLink http://optimystic.typepad.com    So please head over there to catch me blogging and continue to leave your valuable comments and opinions!
