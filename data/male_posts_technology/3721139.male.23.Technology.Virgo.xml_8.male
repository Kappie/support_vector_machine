Oh well, it'll heal.    Despite my shoulders, Wednesday at the wall kicked ass, just a bunch of old farts like me indulging our addictions.  A great community.  I ran into Ashley and Jamie who I haven't seen since last fall. And I on-sighted a 5.9, which felt great. I think I'll be back up to climbing 5.10 in a few weeks.  Then maybe I'll pull out the lead ropes and start that quest again.  And if I do end up moving to Raleigh, I'll have all of that at my vertical disposal.    Anything else going on? Well, I met a couple really cool girls, and I've been talking to each of them pretty much every night this week, hence the lack of updates.  It's been a whole lot of fun, that's for sure.    Oh, last thing before I go to lunch, I was invited to go climbing at Enchanted Rock on August 13-15.  I'm going to do a couple of multi-pitch routes.  I've never done multi-pitch before; I'm really excited, but a bit nervous.  It's entirely possible that I could fall and die.  Hooray for danger.
