I just hope for more good times. Time to seat down and think of more ways to earn more money. As I need them more and fast! Wahaha! Ain't I greedy. Hmmm at least I know now I am earning a bit more than what I used to have which is good. To earn way more what i have is to work hard and smart.   First pot of gold...first pot of gold where are you? Today I met a couple of cute woman at work....damn the people from China is getting more and more pretty for the ladies! Woohoo! Wonder how is my buddy? She is flying to HK for her training flight. Must be fun I guess. And Looking forward for weekend. Should I rest on Saturday for mahjong session? I think I should...Shouldn't I?  Hey Fellows Check this URL out very nice scenery of JAPAN!
