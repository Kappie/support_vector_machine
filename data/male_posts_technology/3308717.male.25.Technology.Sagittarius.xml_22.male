I've decided to finish off my degree after taking a short "break" 5 years ago... Oh well, it will be good to get back into it. I think I will go for my CS degree, I was originally going for an AA but quickly realized that it was not something I wanted to waste my time on when I could be working. I don't regret it, I got a good start on my career even without college.  On to a different subject, I am working on a .Net application. It is basically just a image viewer/thumbnail browser. The big deal with it is its built in search functionality and print queueing. I would carefully estimate that I have about 70% of the core programming done. After I finish that up I'll move on to some hardcore testing and kicking the crap out of it. I have one tester lined up, a photographer who has gotten into the digital imaging scene and the, what I call, photo-on-demand market. That is what this application is aimed for.  Well, I'm off to raise some hell.    -intX   What?
