I know it was a dry winter and all, but this raining 3 times a day thing is preposterous.  And you're such a tease.  When it's not raining it's all blue skies and comfortable climes.  In fact, usually it's like that  when  it's raining.
  
They have a  urlLink saying  for that type of behavior.  The devil is beating his wife in hell with a skillet.  
  
Not a pretty phrase, is it, Spring.
  
Get your deal together.
