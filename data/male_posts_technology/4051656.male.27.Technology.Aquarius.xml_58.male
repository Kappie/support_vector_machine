To me and probably a lot of feminists, this should spell the end for the Miss America pageant. Without the talent portion, this contest is solely about looks. A beauty pageant. I'm not going to rehash all the old arguements about why beauty pageants are bad, but I'm definitely going to be paying attention to the feminist community following this decision. I bet we start to hear cries of "cease and desist" from them soon.
