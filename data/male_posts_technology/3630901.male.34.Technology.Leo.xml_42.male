There is an article that you should give to L to read and discuss with you.   It describes her behavior to a T.  And it puts what she is doing into perspective with other things going on in her life.   Let me know what you think of it.   Love, Mom xoxoxo ------------------------------------------------ Date: Sun, 11 Jul 2004 05:19:47 -0700 (PDT) From: me To: Mom Subject:  re: Newsweek Article  I don't get newsweek anymore, but a friend of mine forwarded me the link to the article, and even though at first it was initially painful, I did read it on Friday.  I was going to send you the link.  At this point, I'm not going to show her the article.  Frankly, I don't really want to discuss it with her.  I agree that lots of stuff in the article fit her exactly.  The problem is that I can't trust her again, and even if I could, she doesn't want to do anything to try to regain my trust.  In the past 8 weeks she's gone on about 15 dates.  I've gone on a few dates myself.  I was on a kayaking trip yesterday, but the camping trip turned into a wash.  I spoke to an older couple while we ate lunch, asking how long they'd been married (just 2 years).  They had each gone through divorce, and she was talking about the resiliency of kids.  That kids see their ultimate role models, their parents, and however the parents are, the kids often reflect that.  So they see that mom and dad broke up because their relationship didn't work out, but that they still stayed friendly toward each other and worked together to build good households for their children.  They'll see that mom and dad then moved on to find mates that were more suitable for them.    Just like you and Dad did.  I look at each of your re-marriages, and I see how you found the right mate the second time around.  In fact your new mate is much better than your original mate was for you.  You and H share many of the same interests and your marriage reflects your compatibility.  With Dad and M, it's the same way.  I hope the lesson learned by our children is that sometimes relationships don't work out, but it's okay to break up and try again.  I'll take more time and care selecting my next spouse, and make sure that we're more compatible, keeping a realistic view of her -- good points and bad points.  I'm not going to rush into anything, but when I date, I am not looking to just have fun (I'm not wired that way) ... I'm looking to see if we're compatible, if we have similar interests, what her past relationships were like and how they ended, and whether I think she'll be a good lifelong mate and a good parent to my children.  On the dates I've gone on so far, I've been totally honest with the women.  The first one was a very awkward date because I admitted I wasn't ready for a new relationship (this one was during the first week of our separation).  Another one knew that I just needed a friend.  Another one blew off our date.  Two more I've had 2nd dates with, even though I was sure that they would see a man who was in the middle of a divorce and probably had issues he was working on, and there was always the possibility (in their eyes) that I could go back to my spouse.  But they still wanted to see me again.    It used to hurt when L told me she was going out.  But now either I'm jaded or I've truly accepted it, because now I don't hate her anymore.  I regret not getting to know L better before we got married.  We were never totally honest with one another and over time we both continued to withhold the truth from one another, and eventually, this form of lying destroyed our marriage.  The article did describe what happened in our relationship.  Kids were introduced into the picture, and it drastically became less about us and more about the kids.  The time we spent together was primarily limited to getting the kids up in the morning or being with them in the evening, feeding them, bathing them, getting them ready for bed.  And then by the time we were alone together, she was exhausted, and I just wanted some alone time.  Her idea of quality time together seemed to be sitting on the couch watching TV shows.  The vacations we took together were almost always about me visiting friends and family.  We didn't take enough time for each other.  That is a lesson I've learned.  But I'm going to take that lesson with me into my next relationship.  Well, I've rambled on enough here.   ---------------------------------- From:  Mom To:  Me Subject:  You've Come a Long Way Baby Date: Sun, 11 Jul 2004 15:51:02 -0700     I can't believe how well you can verbalize what has happened and what you plan to do differently.  You are processing things much faster than I had anticipated.  The same thing happened when I tried to talk with my Mom during my divorce.  I was continually trying to catch her up on what I'd dealt with and she was someplace way back in my process.   What our conversations did help me to do, was to organize my thoughts in a pragmatic sort of way.  The emotional rawness of the experience continued to be debilitating for quite some time, however.  I distinctly remember having days when I was just hanging on, and others when I felt truly optimistic about my future.  It took me about 2-1/2 years before I felt capable of handling whatever might come my way.  Part of that was financial, because I had a tough time making it on the money I was earning and your Dad's child support payments.  I dated a number of people during that time and ran into people who were in various stages of the same recovery process.   I found that most of our married friends didn't want to take sides and some felt very threatened by our divorce--like it was catching or that I might go after their husband.  My best support system I developed by going to Young Single Parents which offered companionship without dating and a wide variety of activities for just adults and some that included kids.  I hope you have a similar organization available in your area.  I continued group therapy for a year and that helped immensely in dealing with my emotions and issues on a weekly basis.  I also had several close friends and family to bounce things off of.       Having kids forces you to cope with crap that comes up, even though having children complicates your recovery since you will have to continue a relationship with your ex for many, many years.  Kids also complicate your forming relationships with other ladies--ie don't bring your kids into your dating life until you are dating someone you really like.  Especially, don't do sleepovers with a lady friend while your kids are home until you are pretty certain this person is really important in your life.       It's also helpful when working out your custody agreement, to figure out a weekly visitation schedule as well as arrangements for holidays.  You'll need to build in a way to share the kids around holidays or simply alternate holidays to keep the schedule from getting frantic.  If you want to bounce ideas off me regarding this issue, I'll be glad to tell what worked and didn't work for us.   Thanks for keeping me up to speed on your progress.  I know however that behind your words there are still some very raw and painful feelings. I hope you can allow yourself to mourn the loss of this relationship while getting on with your life.   I love you,   Mom xoxoxo ------------------------------- Date: Sun, 11 Jul 2004 17:31:09 -0700 (PDT) From: Me Subject: Re: You've Come a Long Way Baby To: Mom  Mom,  Thanks for taking the time to write me back.  My therapist also feels that I've come through a lot perhaps more quickly than she expected.  I still do have raw feelings and sometimes have trouble coping.  But maybe the times are different now and divorce is more commonplace, and many adults my age have already experienced divorce either directly or with their parents.  Everyone knows someone who's divorced, so it's less of a big deal and there's less of a stigma on divorced people.  I have several friends who have been very supportive, and I've been careful not to burden any one person with too much crap (other than my therapist).  I've been keeping a web log / journal that helps me vent lots of anger and verbalize (in a way) all the feelings I'm having.    This weekend, when I was out camping, and I had some time to myself, I broke down and cried a good cry.  Despair and sadness and regret over everything that's happened.  It was good to let it out, and to find strength from it.  I am concerned about finances post-divorce, but I'm going to get a second opinion from another lawyer just to make sure I'm not getting screwed out of what my fair share should be, and what my expectations should be.  We've now moved towards a more equitable sharing of time with the kids, where I will have them two weekdays, L will have them two weekdays, and we'll switch off every other weekend -- we'll each have the kids about 50% of the time.  We also covered holidays and agreed that we would switch off with major holidays, and just keep it so whoever has the kids on the weekend of a holiday gets the kids for that weekend.  The same will go for birthdays.  We tentatively also agreed that if one of us has a birthday party, the other spouse will be invited.  Is it sad that I'm looking forward to putting this custody agreement into effect as soon as possible?  We're already saying to each other that on our particular weeknights we're allowed to just make whatever plans we want and if we're around we'll help out with the kids, but it's not required.  And this past weekend was my weekend -- next weekend is L's weekend.  But I'm looking forward to being a part-time dad, in that I'll be free to have weekend getaways with friends or a girlfriend.  This year I will have the kids for Xmas and L has agreed that I can go to California for 10 days, so that we can get visits in with you and Dad.  I'm really looking forward to that, actually.  Next year, she'll get the kids ... I can't imagine it would be for 10 straight days, so I'm sure I'll see them for xmas eve at least.  So, it was at first a little stressful thinking about how I'd only see my kids half the time.  But after this weekend, and after spending nights out, not worrying about taking care of the kids, it's something I'm actually looking forward to.  I think the kids are young enough that they will learn this soon enough to be the routine and will adapt to it fairly quickly.  I think it's also good that they're at a young enough age where they'll adapt more quickly to a step-mom or step-dad, even though that's at least 2-3 years out in the future.  Finance-wise, things will be a little tight the first couple of years, while the kids are still in day care.  But I am making a good salary, and I do have access to some savings (Dad has also offered an advance on my projected inheritance).  But once they start grade school, I believe expenses will drop dramatically.  I realize that there will be new costs associated with the kids, like with after school programs or summer camps or increased amounts of clothes.  One thing I need to do is find a support group / play group so that I can be more social with the kids.  Maybe I'll get in touch with Ivy's friends parents and arrange some play dates.  Thanks for listening.
