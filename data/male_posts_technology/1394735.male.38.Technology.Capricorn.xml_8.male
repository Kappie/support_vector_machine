That's about as ridiculous as letting a groundhog predict the weather.  These economists are so focused on what they are doing (counting beans), that they can't see the real factors which will determine the outcome of the election.  America is pretty polarized, thanks to the Demicans and Republicrats.  Those sane people who choose not to belong to a political party are lumped into what is called "the swing vote."  So, what makes these people swing?  Now, I'm not talking here about those morons who choose not to involve themselves for whatever reason in the political process.  I'm talking about those individuals who actually think.  Yes, think.  These "swing voters" don't just mark a ballot because it has a picture of an elephant or donkey next to it.  They research a candidate's stand on the issues most important to them, then they vote for the one which aligns most closely with their position.  They hope that enough of their fellow Americans have the same views and that the government which emerges after the election will be truly representative of the majority opinion.  What a concept.  A representative democratic republic.  Of course if everyone voted this way, there would be no such thing as "swing votes."  There would certainly be more than two political parties.  And the good ole US of A would become the democracy that our founders envisioned.  As it stands today, we have on of the weakest democracies in the world.  So weak, in fact, that economists actually believe that they can predict the outcome of an election by reading their tea leaves.
