After the victim of kidnapping and abuse escaped and spoke to police, the cops crawled into her house through a second story window and killed an innocent man.  I hand no blame to the police officers.  What is wrong is how they responded to the context of this situation.  Bad training, bad leadership, bad execution, which is it?  We should not have a climate where police officers are put into situations like this and expected to come out unscathed.
