I mean c'mon, I have'nt seen one bad looking person including the person who was accidentally killed by a dumpster in the middle of a thunderstorm in an alleyway in Williamstown, WV.  While we're on this topic, lets talk about one of the best shows on television right now. Las Vegas. There is nothing like a sweet show full of hot lead actresses who are all D cup, where the object is to see who can wear the shirt that reveals the most cleavage. The most awesome thing is that there areseven beautiful employees and one balding employer.  I want to see an episode of CSI: Reality where the lead investigator has a beer gut like mine and smokes like a train. Then when he's on his way back to the station he pulls over some low life, beats the shit out of him and takes his money. The victim blurts out something like 'I'll sue your ass' at which point Frank (Frank would be his real name, not Joseph or Paul or something like that) would remind him that he picked him up for selling crack to an elementary school kid last year that that has pictures of the whole thing. That show would get good ratings.
