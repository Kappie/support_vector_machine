Peter Jackson has done an awesome job with the Lord of the Rings series.  Granted, they've taken GREAT leeway with the story, putting in stuff here, taking out stuff there, totally screwing with whats really in the book here and there, but who's complaining? :-)  I'm really looking forward to seeing Shelob on the big screen. Plus the army of the dead, that'll be interesting to see as well.  3:20 is going to be alonnnnnnnnnggggg time sitting in that seat.  Going to have to make that soda last awhile.  Will post my opinons of the movie soon!
