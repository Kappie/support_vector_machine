Everyday is a little mini triumph and mini tragedy.  I got the new Chuck Palahniuk book for my birthday.  I'm pumped to read it.  He makes me want to write.  I suppose that is a good thing.  After two years of being told that my wife is the true writer, I'm ready to see what I can do.  I think I'm going to start some new short fiction pieces that are floating around my head.  Maybe I'll be able to make sense of them in time.  I got nothing else to say.  I'm lame.
