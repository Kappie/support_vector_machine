Fun and laughter on our summer holiday, no more worries for me or you, for a week or two.  We're going where the sun shines brightly we're going where the sea is blue. we've all seen it on the movies, now let's see if it's true.  Everybody has a summer holiday doin' things they always wanted to So we're going on a summer holiday, to make our dreams come true for me and you. for me and you.  -- Well, the song sounds much better :) Anyways, been home and now back, just an update :)
