You too, Merlin.   Hey Shaney, good to see ya here.  We (at work) saw the pictures from the crash, and wow, we didn't realize it was that serious.  Get better soon, bro.  Oh, we were wondering at work: So, instead of waiting a half hour to take a free cab, you instead took your bike.  Then you got hit, and went to the hospital.  How did you get home from the hospital?  Did you take a cab, a cab that you had to end up paying for?  Cause, that, my friends, is irony ramped up to 11.  Anyway, can't wait to see ya at work, and just to give you fair warning:  get some clever comebacks ready, cause a lot of people are waiting for their shot at the man who's humiliated them so many times.  Trust me, the boys in security are licking their chops at the wounded animal.  Bring your A game, and show those boys: "When it's game time... it's PAIN TIME!!"  Terry Tate represent!!
