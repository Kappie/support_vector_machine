I was disappointed then and I'm even more disappointed now.  You gave me your word.  You seem a little less clear and a lot blurier to me now.  Plans that I have made based on what I knew about you just don't seem possible now.  I thought I could trust you.  Maybe I still can., who knows?  Right know though I think I will keep my distance for a while.  I have said everything that I needed to say Saturday morning before leaving.  There really wasn't anything that you could have said to make me feel better nor defend your actions.  That is fucked up.  I don't like that shit.  It's one thing to drink but to get sober using another drug?  That's the most pathetic excuse I have ever fucking heard.  I don't mean to be selfish or be thinking about myself here but who the fuck am I to you?  Who the hell do you think you are?  Did I really mean that much that you would actually forget something that meant a lot to me?  That you could just fucking forget it?  Sure I break promises but I know what I promised and I burn it in my damn brain.  At least I make an effort to make it work.  What's going to happen to our plans now?  I don't like the idea of something that we were supposed to share and having people over like that.  I don't want to get mixed up in shit like that.  It sucks that this happened.  I don't want to distance myself from you but if I have to then I must.  Don't worry all other arrangements from before are still there.  We're still this, we're still that, just not as much I suppose.  I still love you but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.
