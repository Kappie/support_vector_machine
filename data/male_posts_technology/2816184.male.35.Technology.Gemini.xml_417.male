Just makes me wonder really.  I mean, if I were to be having the discussion I've been having with someone over the past few days, because of something tangable that I could tell where it came from, I'd feel a lot better.  I'd have something I could point to and say "Huh, there, that's what caused this" but I can't.  Lemme get a little more detailed here.  I've been dancing about with someone very dear to me about the fact that we've got something special, and that we should have more than we do, but don't and when will fate ever decide to let us get on with what we want to get on with?  But I have no idea  why  we're having this discussion.  I have no clue where it came from.  None.  In other news...my son isn't sleeping.  Which, of course, means that my wife and I aren't sleeping either.  But, she's so paranoid about me and what I do when she's asleep, she refuses to go to be without me!  I mean, talk about trust issues!  Okay, now reading that in light of the paragraphs above....I mean, that person and I aren't going to do anything about things.  It's not like we're about to leave our families and shack up.  Heaven knows, if she'd wanted that she coulda had it when I left my first wife, but she blew her chance there.  Which brings me back to being confused.  All will become clear, I guess...someday....
