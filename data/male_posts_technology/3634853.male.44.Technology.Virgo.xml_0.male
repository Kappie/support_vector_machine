I truly can't get any cards right now.  While playing Stud, trying ot mix it up a little bit, I never stayed in a hand that I shouldn't have and only lost one on the river.  I just never got good starting cards.  As far as the limit Hold 'Em tables it's more of the same.  I vowed to myself when I began this that I wouldn't use it as a forum to complain about bad beats or bad players.  My soul intent was to evaluate myself and my feelings, and to keep a record of how my earnings (or lack thereof) were going.  In reviewing what I've writtne lately it seems like all I do is cry about the cards I'm getting.  I think it may be time to re-evaluate my starting hands, do some work in PokerTracker and see if I could be playing hands a little differently and find a way to make this venture more profitable.  I don't feel like I've dug a hole that I can't get out of, but I think if I continue with the attitude I have now I can do no better than to play scared and lose any effectiveness I may have gained through study and analysis.  Now to stick to my guns......
