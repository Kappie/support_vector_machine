Where I liked it, then hated it, then loved it a lot before hating it so much I tried to commit career suicide. My smart friends who knew me well said I would never last there the first time. I'm not sure if 5 years counts as lasting or not. Now they say the same thing. At any rate, I'm coming off the road after two years and this makes me happy. People weren't made to never unpack their shaving kit for two years running and live in hotels 3 or 4 nights a week. Not even me.
