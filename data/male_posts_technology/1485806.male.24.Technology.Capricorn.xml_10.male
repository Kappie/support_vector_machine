Help Institute is a bomb shelter that forces a lot of refugees to type their email and blog in a much colder environment.  Well this wasn't a bad day ,,,,i have a bit of conflict with the dungeon master, my landlord about my accomodation, but i thank God everything have been settled and now i can focus on my studies.  Yeah i am returning as a student after 3 complete failure in the interviews but i choose to reeducate myself and be strong for the Lord is with me and He will never leave me nor forsake me...I have the power to overcome my life and i even claimed that promise in Acts 1: 8  Yeah baby...i am made strong in my weakness and Oh yeah...studies...I am applying to study in a professional paper full time and i get paid while studying...a meager allowance of RM 500.00. per month... and then 2 months of internship training.  I will once in a while drop in CF , to talk to new people and continue to serve the Lord in bringing people to church and to cell. To all those students who are from outstation, i will commit my life to the Lord to serve them.  Hehehe...of course with the usual humour..ehehehe
