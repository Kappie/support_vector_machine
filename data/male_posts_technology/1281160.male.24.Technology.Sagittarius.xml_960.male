If I go on and present the views of the non-bloggers with whom I have my contacts, then it would be like taking our parliamentary affairs to the United Nations Security Council!!!!!!! This is a simple matter…but still a matter of privileges…  Hope you people should be remembering a day when our Chitra Mam wanted to be a member of our msitmmb group during the end of our course. We said “NO” to include her in the group, though she wanted to come in our group in order to keep in touch with us…isn’t it…  Bye bye then guys and gals…
