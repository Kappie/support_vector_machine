I was about one mile in when I realized I had forgotten to check one thing before going out.  Only a runner will understand why I had to stop my run and go directly home, much to my dismay.  Either way, I felt good except for that one thing and I am excited for another training season leading up to a marathon.  No final thought for today since the run was so short.  Have a great week!
