So I took three weeks off of UPS and will leave on August 20th, the same day as Becca. I think that they are just now pouring the concrete for the foundation. So I am not sure if they will still be working on the framing, but whatever it is it will be a nice change from UPS. I think that this time I will be taking the Amtrak to get down there due to my last experience on the Greyhound.    As for Becca's trip to China, we sent off to get her passport changed and to get a visa. After we get that back there is not much left to do to get ready, except buy some clothes and miscellaneous stuff.
