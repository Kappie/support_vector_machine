The briefs are also good when dealing with morning wood. Morning wood wakes me up sometimes and the boxers don't contain it very well.  Mostly because I sleep on my side or stomach and switch positions which is a lot, um.. more difficult with a woody. But today I wear none of that because I am free. I just wanted to let it have freedom and feel the breeze... wait, feel the breeze? That isn't right. Also it might be a little eeensy weeensy bit because... I don't have any clean boxers, and I am kind of waiting for the weekend. See, because this weekend I am going home so I can see a play that my friends are in, and this way I can use my parents washer and dryer without using all of my quarters.       Ok, on a side note, one of my friends is in jail due to some assault charge. It is some charge which I have no idea whether it happened or not. I wasn't there. It was some crazy conflict between my friend TG and my friend SC when they were breaking up or broken up and still hanging out or just fucking... who can keep track anymore. As far as I can tell they are both crazy, but they are my friends and I love them. Both fun to hang out with but I guess I cannot hang out with them at the same time since this trial. It is all a big mess. ARRRRGHH! (sometimes I just feel like yelling when I hear about this)      The one who told me about this was my friend AW who I used to date (refer to the post where I dyed my hair). She told me all about this and tried to explain how TG was a dumbass and changed his story and whatnot and should have pleaded guilty. But he only got two days in jail for whatever, so I guess it could be worse. Then she goes on a rant about how this guy she went on a date with drinks too much  SODA . I understand about drinking too much alcohol and things like that... but too much soda? As she started talking about the  urlLink high fructose corn syrup  I couldn't help but laugh, mostly because I was listening to a rant on soda. But this is perhaps one of the strangest problems with a date that I have ever seen aside from episodes of Seinfeld. hahaha!
