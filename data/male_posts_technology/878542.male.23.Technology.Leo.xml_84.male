But on the other hand, who else will or can write detailed or accurate information about me? If I was a celebrity or had umbrella-loads of literarily inclined friends, I could avoid it. But as it is, I don't see any way around it.   I used to solve this problem by using false modesty. But I found that doesn't work out well either, and it obscures useful information. So I'm left with the unhappy medium between writing as many verifiable facts as possible, and presenting myself as I want to be seen.  I guess it will have to do until I can introduce myself personally to everyone.
