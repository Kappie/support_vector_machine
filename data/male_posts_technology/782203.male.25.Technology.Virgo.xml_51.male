Oh ya and she gave me the 'Dangerous Liasons' VCD in exchange for my three Janet Jackson CDs. Thats like the movie i been looking for since i was 5, but its censored so I won't get to see Uma Thurman's boobs ..sigh...After that we went to meet Xing and his friend Marcus, the one i thought wanted to hire me. But turned out to be a complete waste of time cos he wasn't the least bit interested in talking to me, spend more time talking to his gf ! I already knew that he wasn't interested when he talked to me over the phone few days earlier; basically after he found out that I didn't know VB/ASP he cut the conversation short. And I told Xing about it but he told me it's ok and to come for the meeting anyway. Now it just seemed like a waste of my time.  CDs I listened to today: 1. Dummy by Portishead 2. Homogenic by Bjork  ( LISTEN TO THIS AT NIGHT ITS AMAZING!!)  3. Brighten the Corners by Pavement 4. The Stone Roses (self-titled) 5. Toxicity by System of A Down 6. Sparkle and Fade by Everclear
