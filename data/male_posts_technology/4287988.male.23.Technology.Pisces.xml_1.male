We don't fight mind you, we just kind of get along cause we have to.  Well when I walked in the house Lexeigh ran at me to show me her new dress.  That wasn't what bothered him so much as what she called me, "Daddy".  Now James gets them every other weekend and this was his weekend.  As him and the kids were leaving though Lexeigh again came running at me to give me a kiss goodbye.  Needless to say James was so upset about this that he wasn't paying attention and slammed our screen door in poor Jimmie's face.  Well people I am dying today.  You see every Friday night me and Jaime, my fiance for those that don't know, go out to a local bar that my father and I DJ at.  Well, Jaime and her friend Jill decided to stay later than usual and talk with some guy who a friend of theirs likes.  Well needless to say we didn't even leave there until 2:00 am.  Now the only problem with this is that I have to get up at 5:00 am to get ready for work and let me tell you I didn't want to get up today.  Then to make matters better I've got a killer headache but thanks to chat at work I found someone here that had some meds.  Isn't technology a wonderful thing.
