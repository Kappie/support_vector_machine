If you're a bit of a LOTR geeky type (like Baity) then you may find some things that are unlike the book. But being an ignorant and lazy  puppy, I never bothered to read that impenetrable tomb-like trilogy thus I really enjoyed it. I will not ruin the plot for you (good vs. evil, good wins, everyone is happy.. oh fuck!) but the best moments are the dwarf asking to be tossed off by Aragon and a flaming treant extinguishing it's head in river. Awesome.    Arwen's dress fell off, and low all of middle earth did rejoice.. yay!    I've been watching you for some time now, little Hobbit..     If one more person calls me Dawson Leary, i'm gonna bust some chops!
