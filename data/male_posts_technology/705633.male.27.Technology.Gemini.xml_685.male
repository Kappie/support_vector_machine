I have always prided myself on the ability to look slim while doing absolutely nothing to contribute to it.  In fact before today I had never even been inside a Gym before.  My Brother and I have always been skinny runts, as Grist will tell you.  I loved the fact that through all of our lives people have said to us “Wait till you hit 18!!! It’s all down hill from there” implying that one day we would both wake up to find we were both Fat Bas*£%ds.  When that didn’t happen the 20th was the dreaded age when the belly was gonna get us.  But our 20th came and went and the Belly was still unable to find us.  The same thing was said year in and year out but it never came true.  Now I’m going to the Gym it feels like I’m actively doing something to hide from my long predicted belly.  Well all that is left to do now is see how long it lasts.  Danger out.
