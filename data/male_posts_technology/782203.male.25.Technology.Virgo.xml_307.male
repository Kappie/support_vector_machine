Basically what he does is he goes through and pours out everything from my drawers and cupboards into the floor or table depending on his mood. Then he puts back everything one by one into where he thinks they should be. So of cos now I have absolutely no idea which drawers have what stuff; and not to mention I had some really private stuff in some of my drawers; but hell as long as it's neat and tidy right thats all that counts.  Oh and he mixed my 200-- music cds together with my 100-- vcds ; I am definitely gonna have a lot of fun sorting that out.
