It is a kind of serial which tries to highlight the heritage of Tamil Nadu. In this serial the ancient art of astrology using finger prints " Naadi Josiyam ' features as the protagonist. 'What is " Naadi Josiyam "?' is the next question. Well, it is said that powerful saints of the ancient world wrote about all the people who were born centuries after them and who are yet to be born. Well, not about everyone but about every person who will have his/her fortune read using the " olai " (dried palm leaves). Everything about the person is told such as his/her name, parents name, his occupation, his past, present and future and is supposed to be the most accurate. It is very astonishing as to how will someone in the past know about every person and his personal details and so very accurate. The worst part is that this art is known in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and other parts of South India. It would be very interesting if those who have had their fortunes read by these astrologers share their experiences and also tell us more on this topic. I have no more information on this as I myself haven't experienced this. On getting more information I will definitely share them. Once again I thank for your patience and please feel free to comment.
