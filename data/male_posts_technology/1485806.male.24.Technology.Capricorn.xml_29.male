Oh yeah ...When i get my hands on a dreamweaver, i am gonna insert music into this blog and we can have praise and worship rite in this blog. Ohh..For the time being , well i am going to focus on how to improve cell , especially in the worship part. I seriously hope i can ask Jamie and wai nyan to help out cause we need to rise up , we are no longer just attending a cell, we are leading people to enter into the presence of God, It is an important event for the priest during David's time and now we can have the privelege of doing it . Still the attitude of doing and the reverence must not be compromised.  Well rite now with 11 days to go for my internship training, i have nothing to do than to go to college, and play Ragnarok and yam cha with my Okios. Praise God, A girl called Elena have sold a lot of raffle tickets to them and come for the family day in Praise Assembly. Which means their response to the gospel is quite good. Hopefully if i try asking them to SIB evangelistical event would be no problem.  Hmmm,,...by the way Mel and Wai Nyan, if you reading this Hopefully u guys can come back to me about tomorrow's plan.   Ps: By the way this post is typed upon a Mac Titanium G4 because Siok Chye is using my computer on the college net to play Ragnarok Online, an online Multiplayer game
