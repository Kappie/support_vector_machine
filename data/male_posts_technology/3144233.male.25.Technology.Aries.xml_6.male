It had only got worse overnight and he soldiered on all morning but by the time we got to the next stop he had a very bad limp and was unable to continue.  Send us a message Jim and we hope you are fit again soon.  Morale was obviously slightly depleted after Jimâ€™s departure but we made some good progress in leaving the Lake District and heading over the flatter land towards the dales. The weather got a little rough again, raining, generally damp and very foggy. Leo fell off a style into a patch of "manure" but was OK after he had cleaned himself up.  We got to the next stop wet and cold just in time to see all the cafes closing. However we were lucky enough to call on a very friendly pub where they agreed to get us all in the one room for a good price. Tonight we have the benefit of a proper hot meal and a warm room.   Speak soon!  P.S. Injury list:   Ed: Cuts to hands Ben: Cuts to hands Joel: Ankle sprain Jim: Knee damage (forced to withdraw) Leo: Ego
