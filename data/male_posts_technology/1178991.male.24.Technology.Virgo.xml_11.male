In the meantime, been playing around with PHP5, and it looks pretty cool.  I'm especially interested in the new set of engine level interfaces.  PHP is including some standard interfaces like Iterator in the engine, so there is a defined standard for that now.  Here are a couple of links that are related to this topic.  I have PHP5 running on my home machine, and I am going to try some of this out, and post a more detailed tutorial later, since I cant seem to find anything good on the internet about this right now.   urlLink http://www.php.net/~sterling/adt/   urlLink http://www.php.net/spl
