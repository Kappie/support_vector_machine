In other news, everytime I go use the urinal at the Woodinville theater I notice the cake holders have a website on them. And I always mean to mention it to you guys, cause I thought it was really funny. Like, hey, the thing I'm pissing on has a website. WHAT THE FUCK!!!   Anyway, I'm gonna kill off unwelcome hero as pierre's site, but I will hopefully do something useful with it. Do you guys have any suggestions?  Also, do you think you can see your parents as other people see them? or is there a parent filter there... weird...  prolly won't be able to write again till sunday cause I'm at home so I'll talk to you guys latah
