Not that I'm against anything that will make it easier to track criminals but the Big Brother approach just seems like it's wide open for abuse. And now it seems that some of our MPs  urlLink think the same . 'Function creep' is the term used to describe fears that, despite good intentions, the national ID card will be used to do a lot more than just track criminals.
