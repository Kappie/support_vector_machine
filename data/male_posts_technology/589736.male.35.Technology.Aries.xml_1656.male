Ireland and Scotland have been really fucking awesome, but in the tradition of all of my vacations, I drank way too damn much.  I think I'm going to need a few weeks of detoxing after this one.  The weather has been atrocious.  While we were in Edinburgh last week, it was raining so hard that our umbrella snapped in half.  As Nick said, you kind of understand why the Scots are so surly when God personally tells you to fuck off.  It was like he was saying, "Go home Mary Poppins!"  Dublin is a fairly unattractive city, but the people here are amazing cool.  It's the first place in Europe that I've been to where the majority of people actually liked Americans, with the exception of the "fat ones who come here and wear green."  We went to the Guiness brewery and out on a pub crawl.  Nick has been doing gigs almost every night, so we've spent a lot of time hanging out with Irish comics.  The people love him here.  These are some of the best gigs that I've seen him do.  So yeah...I'm going to go back to the room and attempt to get an hour of sleep in.
