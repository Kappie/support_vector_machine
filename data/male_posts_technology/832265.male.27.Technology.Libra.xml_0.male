So, you're a wealthy kidowner, but you can't keep the kid from smoking the pot.  You can't go to the police because, well, there's not much of a crime there and they can't give the sort of guidance that unliscensed professionals can.  Isn't it worth $80/day to send your problem child to Jamaica for rehabilitation.  It's 100% hassle-free parenting.  Tranquility Bay escorts will even  urlLink pick up  your brat unannounced so there's no time for awkward explanations or goodbyes.  The good news is that you, the parent, are still in charge.  Afterall this is the eagle way - pay someone to give your child the draconian third-world upbringing you can't be bothered to administer yourself.
