Here are few borrowed verses of a hurt lover,  You are like a soul that brought life in my being, giving happiness to my lonely plight.  yourbeauty can be compared to an angel's diviness, serenading my lonely heart.  if winter connotes coldness, you connotes the summer.  your smile always warm my heart, your scent reminds me of spring.  how i wish this feeling doesn't linger, how i wish it wouldn't stay longer.  for it's so hard to be in this state, loving a person who's not your fate.  as i write this ode for you, hope you will have a clue, that this feeling inside of me, is true and only meant for you.  don't worry if you feel guilty, for not feeling the same way, i'm not asking for any reaction, i just want your simple appreciation.  if this would be the fate for me, i should have to set this feeling free, for i know that in loving there is also hurting
