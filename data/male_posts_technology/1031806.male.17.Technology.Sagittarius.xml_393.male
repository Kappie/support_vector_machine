Peter and Solana are gone, GONE... kinda. (lol) They be in Aussyland now. Here are some pictures from the airport today around 6-7ish:     urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      I had picked up Andrew and met Brady and Pat at CCWC to carpool out to Peter's to pick him up and go to the airport, so we (-Peter) went back to CCWC afterward, a bit after youth group started. Brady left cause he's old (lol), but Pat, Andrew and I stayed... at first in the 'Nursing Mom's room' (which is really tight... there'a one-way mirror so you can see/hear everything that's going on in the sanctuary but no one can see/hear you. Eventually though, the senior high went upstairs, so we followed, but skipped shortly there after (-Pat, +Matt  Josh H) and went to Freddy's. On the way back we ran into the rest of our clique and here are pictures from then on:     urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      Now for the stupidness... I had some spraypaint in my car which we had been lead to believe was water soluble. Someone had sprayed a big smily face on one side of the parking lot and we had set a big firework off ontop of it. Nothing much more happened for a while and almost everyone left. We were starting to get a bit more crazy (lighting firecrackers off between people's feet and such... LOL@Adri) when I got the great idea of writing some random words on the parking lot like L337 H4x0r and stuff... (lol). About that time, Steven needed to use the restroom and since everywhere else was closed, he went over to the gas station across TV highway. While he was walking over, Andrew set of another bomb we had made and crap, that thing was LOOOOOOOOOUD. Steven said he heard it echoing off the theater and other buildings more than a block away while he was walking across the highway. 'Twas so loud infact, that we pretty much told everyone still around that they should leave... NOW. (worried about cops)   Anyway, I was taking Andrew and Steven home... and Steven wasn't there, so we cruised around and eventually found him. We decided to go back to the parking lot after a bit whe we new it was safe and realized that the spraypaint and stuff prolly wasn't going to come off as easily as we thought. We spent the next hour (up till almost midnight) trying different things, even going over to a 7-11 to get Coke to see if it'd lift the paint. ... Nothing worked.   Here are some pictures of the mess:     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink      Yeah... that was increadibly stupid. I called the church office asking someone to call me back tomorrow *looks at clock*... today to see about how I could help clean it up.   'Ne wayz, I'm tired and it may not look like it, but it actually takes an increadible long time to post all those pictures correctly, so I'm going to bed.
