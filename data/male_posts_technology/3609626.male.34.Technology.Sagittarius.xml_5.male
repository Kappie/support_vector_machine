Yesterday I removed a spider sac from one of Ian's books.   The thing about Ian is that he doesn't want me to squish spiders!  ARGH!  He wants me to gently collect them and let them go outside.   This morning I took a shower with a spider.  I'm supposed to go tidy the backyard - but I saw several freaky looking spiders out there! So far today, I've vacuumed 6 spiders - just downstairs!   Although, after vacuuming the little pile of dead bees and mosquito parts that one spider had been feasting on, I guess I shouldn't complain about them.  I think I'd prefer the spiders over bees and mosquitos inside my house!  I read an article the other day.  There was a line in it that said, "California has more than 1000 differenct types of spiders.  And they're holding a family reunion at my house."   Nuh-uh.  I think that this year, the reunion's at the Moser's house!  Maybe it's time to have the exterminator spray INSIDE the house, as well as outside.
