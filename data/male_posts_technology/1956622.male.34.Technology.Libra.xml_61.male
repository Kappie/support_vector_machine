We then went home and she sat on my lap and watched some cartoons. I think if I would have sat there long enough she probably would have gone to sleep.    Rick, (crazy Uncle Martha) we walked in from CiCi's and Karissa said "hey Rick" and he said I think I am going to change my name to Martha and you Karissa can be Fred.WellRick had to go to the store so while he was at the store, Iconvinced Karissa to call him Crazy Uncle Martha. when hereturned she did just that!  Anyway Rickhad amutual friend and his girlfriend over for dinner and they brought her 2 YO son. Needless to sayKarissa was having a pretty good time when I called home!  Like I said not a lot going on...   I did however, come across this fable I thought was pretty funny.     Onestone    There once was an Indian whose given name was "Onestone," so named because he had only one testicle.   He hated that name and asked everyone to not to call him Onestone!   After years and years of torment, Onestone finally cracked and said, "If anyone calls me Onestone again I will kill them!"   The word got around and nobody called him that any more.   Then one day a young girl named Blue Bird forgot and said, "Good morning, Onestone..."   He jumped up, grabbed her, and took her deep into the forest where he made love to her all day and all night.   He made love to her all the next day, until Blue Bird died from exhaustion.   The word got around that Onestone meant serious business.   Years went by and no one dared call him by his given name until a woman named Yellow Bird returned to the village after being away for many years.   Yellow Bird, who was Blue Bird's cousin, was overjoyed when she saw Onestone.   She hugged him and said, "Good to see you, Onestone..."   Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest, then he made love to her all day and all night; made love to her all the next day and night...but, Yellow Bird wouldn't die!!!!   What is the moral of this story???   You can't kill two birds with one stone!
