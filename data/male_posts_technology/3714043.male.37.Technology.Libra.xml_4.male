Come join me as my brain spills misfired synapses.  I promise you this, at times it'll be funny, at times it will be sad, at times it will be exciting, and at times it will be a bore...    So come, take my hand, walk with me...  There's no earthly way of knowing Which direction they are going! There's no knowing where they're rowing, Or which way they river's flowing! Not a speck of light is showing, So the danger must be growing, For the rowers keep on rowing, And they're certainly not showing Any signs that they are slowing...                       -Roald Dahl
