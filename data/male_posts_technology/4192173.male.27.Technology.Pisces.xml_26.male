Owning the GC is key, however, because more obscure titles have been released (like Eternal Darkness) that are brilliantly fun and very challenging - it's not the juvenile machine most non-believers think it is (besides, how juvenile is the next Rogue Squadron).  My good friend and fellow gamer FJ (PS2 owner, btw) and I enjoyed an evening last night filled with professional wrestling and a couple of S.O.'s and one G.  Aside from a good match or promo or two, the highlight was watching the game ads and wondering which platform it was going to be on.  the first was the aforementioned "SW - Rogue Squadron" - exclusive to GC;  the next was "WM XIX" - exclusive to GC.  The third was more exciting: "SW - The Knights of the Old Republic".  The suspence was near painful...XBOX.  FJ then let out a few unmentionables as he relayed his disgust with the platform exclusivity that is over taking the gaming world.  We then got a few kicks because the red neck trucker game is available for all platforms - FJ was happy to see he got something.  I send this plea out to the game companies and developers of the world...have a heart.  don't make us spend more money than we can already afford to go out and buy the latest gear just to play ONE or TWO games.  Make it a level playing field for the consumer.  Don't be dicks.  M.
