Life is shite. That is a fact, there is nothing I can do about it. No matter how hard I try, no matter what I do, things will always turn out for the worse. No matter how deap my bomb shelter is, or how many weeks worth of food we have. It doesn't really matter how many friends I have, and it doesn't really matter how much I talk to everybody. Nobody really cares about anything anymore, so why should I care about stuff others don't care about? Well I do, because I care. Now, caring about careing sounds a liitle odd, and you are all probably thinking "what is Tom smoking?" but no, I am have a strong theory. When you care about things, you think about them, which usualy makes you depressed. Think about that for a second, if you care you are thinking about it, which makes you depressed, unless you are one of the lucky ones where the person you care about cares about you. But other than that, you get depressed. Now, because you care, you keep thinking, so the best thing to do is to care about caring. Care for your care, keep caring about caring, and eventually you will care for nothing, only caring for others. Does that make sense? Perhaps I should draw a diagram.     Does that make some sort of sense? Simply, if you care about caring, you care for all, if you care for one, you only care for one.
