How stuff works       urlLink   http://www.howstuffworks.com/        This links gives a good explanation on how "anything"    works and the priciples behind them.      Hmmm, it seems the fountain of all knowledge for our off-shore engineering team is a little website called  How Stuff Works .     I just did a little search for  n-tier web services infrastructure  and I have to say, I don't think I could build any business class products with the information that came back.  But I could probably draw a nice powerpoint slide that'd sufficiently convince a CEO that I knew something.
