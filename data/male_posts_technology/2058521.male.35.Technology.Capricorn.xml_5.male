NewzCrawler is a web news aggregator, RSS reader, browser and blog client which provides access to news content from various sources. Great Software!  Actually, when trying to post to my blog I found out that its built-in BlogThis! clientdoesn't support specifying or modifying the title of a posting. (I have enabled titles by "Show Titles" in the preference tab of my blogger.com account.) Additionally, the "My Blogs" accounts in Newz Crawler don't show existing titles, either. I have posted a suggestion in the NC forums... In the meantime I use the  urlLink BlogJet  client, which supports everything I need including titles!
