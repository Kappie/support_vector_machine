I feel as though America, if it takes the approach that CK presents, would become imperialist bullies.  I feel like we're the the snot-nosed brats of the world, stomping and whining about how we want everything to be our way or the highway.  And I fear that the global community will become fed up with our audacious attitudes.  For about ten minutes after 9/11, we were the whole world's sweet wounded child.  Now we're the world's screaming bratty embarrassment.  *shrug*
