He has the following to say about Microsoft's latest operating system for mobile phones:   The most important thing to remember is that the Windows Mobile OS does *not suck*. ... [W]hen it comes to developing full-fledged mobile enterprise applications that are used daily, Mobile Java just doesn't cut it right now. ... Microsoft will show up with a good looking phone, that's easy to develop on, with great deals from the carriers backed with millions in marketing dollars aimed at consumers and corps alike, and a massive army of developers backing them and the rest of the industry will cry foul as they get tromped on yet again by the borg.    So when Microsoft Windows Mobile powers the majority of cell phones in the future, no one will be able to cry anti-trust. They did it by being relentless. While Palm, Sun Java J2ME, and Symbian are sleeping, Microsoft is running full-speed in this market.
