       
      This is the schedule for my weekend:
Saturday:
10:30 AM - Piano Group Lesson (maybe takes an hour or so)
1:00 PM to 4:00 PM - 7/8 Band Saturday Rehearsal (at MPA)
4:00 PM --> will be at Amit's birthday party sleep-over.
Sunday:
(Still at Amit's and skip church)
And I don't know what happens after that.
A pretty boring weekend other than the awesome time at Amit's.
I took my PowerBook to school and found out the school network password this week.
And I just remembered I got 102 out of 100 on my BIG math test! YEA! I got the highest score in the whole class. I can't believe it because last time I only got a C+ (as you will see earlier in the blog).
Well thanks a lot for checking back at my blog and don't stop it!
