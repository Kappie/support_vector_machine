(Although, I can slack with the best of them.)  But from a chronological point of view, and because of my career path, I can be described as nothing but part of Generation D.  Or, at least, used to be.  As part of that phenominal generation, I had the luxury of being part of a class of young hipsters that were caught somewhere between yuppy and hippie.  We have the smarts to know what the difference between TCP/IP and Voice over IP is, the style to know that the seventies are in, and the nineties are out, and the foolishness to forget to balance our checkbook.  More importantly, these things were all we had to know.  My freedom, the integrity of my country; taken for granted in a world where peace was no longer dictated by a hand gesture, it was dictated by leaders and whole continents.  Our world was one in which we had little doubt that all was going well, and all would continue to go well.  Now, we weren't oblivious to the strains of world peace being felt in such places as Northern Ireland, or the Palestine, but those (so we thought) would eventual be ironed out by liberally minded leaders who were beginning to see the light.  Or so we thought.  My generation, not only of my fellow D'ers, but those of Generation X, and Y, and all of us who were lulled into thinking peace and freedom would be in everyone's backyard someday, have been relegated to anger, hatred, disgust, dismay, and trepidation.  We are Generation 9-11.  We have lost the blind (but needed) faith of a belief in freedom for all.  We have lost an innocence that no generation has seen in over half a century.  And our generation will give way to one that most likely will share the same sense of despair and frustration that we have suffered.  We are not so much afraid of what will happen in the future, but so saddended that all we had expected and hoped for has been obliterated by the idotic actions of a small group of barbarians.  How dare they dictate what we in the civilized world have worked so hard to build.  And how dare they dash our hopes so quickly.  You might ask, if we of this generation of hopefuls are so enlighted, then how is it that our optimism is so easily withdrawn.  I don't know.  I think, because this is not something that is easily rebuilt, just as the War Against Terrorism is not easily won.  Our faith is not easily restored, because we are human.  When your parents fail you; the ones you trust so much, do you easily forget?  To regain the peace and hopefulness we had for our world, we must see that these things can be controlled and put aside.  But how do you control terrorism?  How do you forget that somewhere along the line, we had left something out of the equation.  In the 1930's the major powers of the Earth were writing and signing peace treaties and creating delegations for the promotion of peaceful resolutions like it was going out of style.  (Go ahead, check your encyclopaedia)  But, alas, we all know what happend in the late 30's.  So here now, we have this conundrum.  And now our generation will be the ones to figure it out.  And our generation will have to learn to live with this new reality; that in a world so close to peace, there is always room for war.  We will have to find out how to better keep our distance from that possibility.  Or maybe the answer is to learn how to keep the faith, so next time, we're not caught off gaurd.  So someday there will be a Generation Peace.
