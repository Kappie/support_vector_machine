I do agree that technology had made human inhuman, lethargic in some ways. But not in all. You might be wondering that why myself is speaking something without any correlation with the heading I posted?. There is relationship.  Today, I participated in urlLink Coimbatore IT.com(Achieving India's IT Vision 2008).  Among the speakers were Mr.VivekhariNarain(IT Secretrary,Govt of TN), Mr.Subramaniam(President  CEO, Covansys), Mr.Ravichandran(Sr.VP,olaris lab) etc.,  In the seminar, a lot of topics were delivered on BPO, Bioinformatics and Achieving Vision 2008 etc. But, the interesting part of the session was e-governance by Dr.Karthikeyan,(Commissioner,Coimbatore Corporation). His explanation, eye for details about e-governance is simply astonishing. He explained us elaborately about e-governance, How coimbatore corporation is doing reforms and carrying out infrastructural and corporation activities. How general public can pay taxes through payment gateways by means of their  urlLink Coimbatore Corporation  website.  He also showed a live demo how the general public feel about this modern way of using paying taxes through their website. You know what was the reply from an 60 year old citizen?(Middle class Indian). He said it is very amazing, he spend only 3-5 minutes in paying taxes. He also added that the corporation response is very positive in all the problem solving aspects(Like handling of enquiries like water problem, road problem etc). Mr.Karthikeyan is only 31 years old. He was honoured with Best e-governance implementor for the year 2001 by Mr.L.K.Advani(Dy.PM).  Technology is growing for the people. We must see it as a boon for our life, not as a stumbling block.   Bye for now.
