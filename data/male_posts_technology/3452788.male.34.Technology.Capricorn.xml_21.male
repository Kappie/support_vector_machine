Anne and I are not opposites, we come from similar economic setting, both quite introverted, a little nervous of social situations, etc.  I wonder if maybe we are too similar.  She has a very hard time communicating with me about her thoughts or feelings, unless it is about her job (she can talk all day about that).  We talk about the boring mundane stuff frequently, but it's like we are both scared to scratch any deeper.    The problem for me is that sometimes I get on a tangent and need to bounce really deep ideas or fears or concerns off someone who can give me feedback, constructive criticism, good advice, or even just pretend like they care.  Usually all I get is "uh-huh" or less, just a look that could mean "I understand and I love you and I will support you no matter what", or maybe "I don't talk about my problems, so why must you", or maybe "Oprah is coming on, I need to end this conversation", or maybe "that burrito was a mistake."  I can never tell what she is thinking, and she won't tell me, even when I literally beg.  I have not been a perfect partner, but I think I have gone way more than halfway in trying to communicate and trying to keep the interest alive in our marriage.  She just will not communicate with me unless it becomes a big deal, with tears and heavy emotions and pent-up stuff coming out in a pyroclastic blast.  I fear that so much that I start not communicating myself, on the premise that I have two choices.  I can say what is on my mind, and cause an emotional crisis, or I can just keep my mouth shut, and put off the crisis another day.  I just feel like she is not interested in sharing things or discussing things with me that are REAL important - feelings, fears, problems.  Sometimes I think she loves me but doesn't really like me.  Maybe it goes both ways...
