Honestly i have to say I'm really disappointed that I didn't get an interview; i know that I'm a really good Java Programmer; all I need now is some employer to give me a chance to show it. Just gotta keep looking until I find that person.   I am jet black.  I am stone cold.  Jet black to the center.  Funny like a funeral.  I need you to bury me.   Jet Black by Jawbreaker
