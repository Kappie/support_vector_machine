Went to the HMS Belfast and looked around that for a couple of hours. The coolest bit has to be these massive guns that you can move around and point at stuff, so we threatened boats on the river. I'm sure Nicki has some cool things to say about the boat. It really was pretty amazing. Nicki now knows all the parts of the boat, and what the different flags are called, hehe. Then we wondered down towards South Bank along the river side, up to the Tate Modern. Didn't go in, but just had a quick look. Then we got the tube all the way over to South Kensington (near Hyde Park) and had lunch in my favourite resturant. Then we looked around the Natural History Museum (the Life and Earth sections). Followed by a quick tour of the Science Museum. Then we went back into the city to Westminster and went to "the door" featured in Die Another Day the Bond movie. It's the one on the other side of the river to the Houses or Parilment where Bond goes to meet M in the underground station. Then we bought a ticket for a boat back to South Bank, but while we were waiting we went up to the London Eye to have a look. £5! Not bad, do that one day. Then we bought ice creams and went to watch protesters in Parliment Square. They where campaigning for the legalisation of canabis. One blokes sign said "Free the Weed". Then we had a lovely boat trip up the Thames to South Bank, where we went up into Farringdon where I got us lost for a few minutes looking for this tiny little photography shop. I found it in the end, although Nicki wasn't too impressed. How was I supose to know there where two post offices? Anyway, we went in there, and because I had rung the lady in the shop up asking how to get there, and after telling her our little story she gave us some free postcards. Then we joined the rest of London and got a train home.  Today  I did nothing.
