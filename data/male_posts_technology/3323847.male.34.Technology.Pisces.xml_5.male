In one nice tidy little flawed carbon-based package, we're both capabable of incredible good and incredible evil.  Yes, I know.  Sometimes I can be annoyingly pragmatic.  This gets me to thinking, is this a  universal  condition, or strictly human?  Guess we won't know the answer to that until we make contact with other life forms out there (assuming we're not alone in this expansive three-dimensional reality we call "The Universe").  One thing's for sure, though - I'd sure hate to run into an alien race which would be even  more  extreme than us!
