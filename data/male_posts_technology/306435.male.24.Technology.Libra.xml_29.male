I went shopping for  bread, chicken, hawain punch, ice cream...you know the basics.  So I was shopping for maybe ten minutes getting mostly on sale items.  I then got in line.  Well I was there for 20 as the lady in front of me was having a terrible time.  She was trying to get three boxes of cereal on sale for $5.  Well it was ringin up at normal price....so the manager took her back in the store and howed her that she was getting the wrong box.  hen we come to find out it is 2 for $5.  Oh what a mess.  Everytime they tried to move her to the side to let me in she would start to whine about how "you people need to work on your courtesy".  I swear, then her daughter came over and started yelling.  If they would have calmed down they would have realized the manager was trying to help them...  And to top it off Ann called while I was away...she got home okay...so that is good.
