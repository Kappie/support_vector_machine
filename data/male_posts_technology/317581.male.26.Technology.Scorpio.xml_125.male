After I paid the outrageous amount, including the extra account interest charge, I came back to my apartment and tried to register, only the hold wasn't removed. How annoying. I was about to condemn SFS to some extra dimensional void, but then I called the girl who was helping me and she fixed it.   Raise your hand if you like SFS..... Anybody? Anybody?
