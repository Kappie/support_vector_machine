And now coming to a news outlet near you, freedom to shut the hell up already. London's Financial Times, that bastion of left-wing rhetoric, reported 10 days ago that Iyad Allawi, the "prime minister" appointed and approved by Iraq's American management, didn't wait even a month after the "handover" to establish a "Higher Media Commission" to red line the press.  Among the restrictions? Any "unwarranted criticism'' of the aforementioned "prime minister."   [...]  And to think that one of the much-ballyhooed acts by U.S. proconsul L. Paul Bremer III, the guy who handed over Iraq's "sovereignty" to the prime minister June 28 before sneaking out of Baghdad, was to shut down Saddam Hussein's dreaded information ministry.  [...]  Last Saturday, the Baghdad office of Al-Jazeera, the Arabic-language news service often denounced by both Arab dictators and the American administration, was shut down for 30 days so that its journalists have "a chance to readjust their policy against Iraq," according to Allawi.  Oh, when will the irony end?
