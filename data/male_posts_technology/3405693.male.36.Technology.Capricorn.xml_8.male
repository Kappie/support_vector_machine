I can't get outta this cycle of negativity that's been sucking the life outta me for like 2 years.  I don't see any future past the next paycheck, and that's not a good place to be in.  I mean I see a future, I just don't see any details.  I've always had this feeling I was destined for something better than this... but what that something is is completely beyond my site.    Watched big fish tonite... See in my head i'm a big fish...and yet...my head is a pretty small pond, if u know what i mean.  Wait...that kinda sounds like I think I'm stupid...not quite what I meant.  Oh well.  Did I ever tell you about the time...
