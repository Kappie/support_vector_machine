(today)  Nostalgia, I read a little of my travel journal last night, it's amazing how I can go back there. Just a word, a smell, a picture, I can almost remember it like it's today. Yet I can't remember what I did 2 days ago. I can't remember the movies I saw last week, let alone last year. I can tell you the main characters major malfunction in every Chuck Palahniuk book, yet can't really remember the characters from the Lord of the rings(at least the ones not in theaters right now)  Is my life passing me one day at a time? or is it a year at a time?  I think I've lost all sense of time
