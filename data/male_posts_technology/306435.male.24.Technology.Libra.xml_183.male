Good movie.  Strange, but good.    My baseball game Saturday got postponed and moved from the Bellvue Vets field to the Newport Central Catholic field.  Possibly the best field I have played on in the  urlLink NKABL .  Not close to most Louisville fields, but not bad.  I was disappointed in the game.  To start I was in center field and batting 7th.  Arrrgh!  We lost 7-1.  I went 1-3 giving me a .429 average and three game hit-streak...from the seven-hole.    This week is going to be busy.  I have to get my muffler fixed and continue packing. Saturday my sister, Kelly, is graduating.  Stay tuned to the  urlLink MoBlog  for updates!
