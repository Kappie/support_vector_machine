I know that our instincts have a powerful hold upon our actions, but can't we overcome our history. The primate instincts of survival and competition are making it so that we won't be able to survive for much longer. Maybe genetic modification is the anwser. Maybe we can recreate ourselves into something that doesn't destroy everything around it. Maybe we could change into a people who love learning and art instead of money and power.
