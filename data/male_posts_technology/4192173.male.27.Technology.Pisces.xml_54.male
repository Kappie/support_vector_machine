It mostly became a night of fine tuning and bass overdubs. What I like about the brisk yet leisurely pace of this album is the ability to have some perspective and really focus in on things. Recently, Ash was pointing out something he felt was lacking in one of the songs and then added that he wanted to make sure everything was at the highest level it could be. Sometimes that requires throwing whole parts out (like we did with the verses to SOLAR) or sometimes it requires going deep into the song, listening to every individual part and either adding or removing something, which we did last night by creating a new chorus bassline for EXIST. Long, hard work, yes, but rewarding when you get the desired results.  A new song is brewing, I might have mentioned this somewhere. I think Brandt's working title for it is BITTER PARTY OF ONE or some gayness like that. Unlike the other songs on the album, he's written guitars, keyboards and such first and then I'm throwing basslines down. We did something similar on KIEKO'S LAST SMILE on HF1, but that was mostly because I hated the tune initially and was indulging him. Of course, it ended up being one of the best tracks I have ever been a part of. Anyway, the parts he has so far are quite good and he keeps throwing bits and pieces of this new tune at me each time I show up. I play bass and then I never think about it again. Then when I come back, I hear where he is at with it, and I dig it. Watch, this one's going to be a keeper.  With the exception of one track, which I need parts from Ash for, the next week or so is in Brandt's hands for guitar overdubs, so I get to breathe a bit (though I doubt I will). We spent hours last night figuring out where new guitars need to go or where current ones need to be changed. The rest of the evening was spent, almost in frustration for me, trying to figure out what the album is missing at this point. We have 8-9 songs, and I would like to see it end up being 11 songs plus the hidden track previously discussed. Therefore, there probably needs to be one last round of writing and I'm going to spend the next few weeks or so figuring out what else I would like to hear on the album as well as coming up with some interesting approaches to writing said material. My intention is to be ready to record drums by 10/1.   Well, have you see all this wonderful publicity for the Chemlab album? (read that as sarcasm).  I've got The Cure's TRILOGY DVD on. Forgot how good an album Pornography is, though I like Ash, Tom and Matt's version of 100 YEARS much better ;-)  F
