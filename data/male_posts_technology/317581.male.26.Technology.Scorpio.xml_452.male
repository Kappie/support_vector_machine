New years resolution 1.0: Pay off 1 credit card  New years resolution 2.0: Go on at least 1 date every month  New years resolution 3.0: Save 1 night a month for housemates/alone time  New years resolution 4.0: Read 1 book a month  I think that's good for now. I'm going to go check out what's going on downstairs now. Check you later. Peace-
