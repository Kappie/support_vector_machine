Throughout the conversation I could feel like he was accessing me, though in a relatively casual sort of way. Turns out what they need is someone who can do almost everything and assist the boss. Seems like the job scope, includes creating systems (not programming, I mean more like procedures) to help their admin, maintaining the PC(s), software and quite possibly hardware troubleshooting, general admin, coordinating work, etc. In other words, the works. It seemed like a comfortable place to work in, despite it not being anything like the big corporate places most graduates seem to be working in these days. We've not really discussed the specifics of the work contract or pay yet, I'm hoping to leave it till Mon. Seriously hope it's at least decent, otherwise I won't be able tot take it up even if I really wanted to. But I'm wondering what aspect I can pick up here. Besides the expected admin and business knowledge, there may not be enough in a technical sense even in the design and IT field. Serious delimma, I'm not hoping to jump into IT, but I'm also not trying to trade that off for something too broad. The boss said something about having 'faith' in the company (dun ask me how that came up), and I have to admit it's something I don't have. But that's probably natural because it's the first time I've actually seen the co.
