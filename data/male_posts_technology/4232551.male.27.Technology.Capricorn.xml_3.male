Much of my demeaner and interpersonal communications stem from sarcasm which never comes across well when there isn't a facial expression or voice tone to go with it.  Also, I can't read your reaction and therefore perform a diving "just kidding" catch is out of the question.  But anyway, here goes:  Today I worked from home.  The company I work for allows this as long as you follow the guidelines.  This means that you have to have broadband internet access, telephone access, child care and you have to have a good ergonomic working space.   Also, you have to work or at least appear to be working.  That's where my fine balancing act really turns to art.  I am the king of watching the olympics/playing video games/walking my dog/napping - and answering emails.  If I ever own a company I am outlawing this kind of work because it is too easy to to not work, or what I call "slork" (slack and work, genius).  The acronym for working from home is oddly "WFH" but I think that "WTF" is also very appropriate.  I don't want to go into too much detail about what I do at work, but it is for one of the larger tech companies and I can work all day without having to talk to anyone.  If I were to actually compare what I got done today with what I get done at a full day of work in the office, I would say that it was about 1/10th.  It's ok though because I am faster than most of the people that I work with so my boss sees the same from me as he does from everyone else.  It just takes me less time to do it so I have the slorking luxury.  After slork, my wife and I went to Toys R' Us and emptied out the gift cards that were sent to us for the birth of our newest daughter.  My wife talked to one of our friends with a newborn and they recommended a Sea Sounds Baby Rocker, or something like that.  It looks like a lawn chair for a baby except that it is a little more reclined, has an attachment that vibrates the chair and a fake plastic bubbling and music playing aquarium that sits right in front of the baby's face.  This is all an amazing invention and it seems to be working well.  My baby is fast asleep in her vibrating lawnchair listening to the soothing bong sound of the bubbling aquarium.  It's all about conditioning at that age.  "JUST KIDDING"
