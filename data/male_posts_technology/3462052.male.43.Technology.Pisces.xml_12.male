On Tuesday evening a Customer service rep called me at home and asked me many questions in regards to my experience with the "New" specially made for NYC cigarette and appologized for any bad experience that I had with them. She was very concerned with the burns I got on my hand and was a very pleasant woman. She explained how these cigarettes were intended only for NY. I am to send her my pack of cigarettes and for compensation a coupon good for a new carton. I do not plan to purchase this carton in NYC thats for sure. I hope that all Smokers in NY begin to order their cigarettes online, out of state or through bootleggers. Its cheaper and we dont have to smoke that new shitty stuff.
