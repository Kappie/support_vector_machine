This wasn’t supposed to happen, the script wasn’t written for such darkness. Whatever and wherever went wrong might have dire consequences. My heart doesn’t agree to the fact that sons of same ummah (if there is any) are responsible for this crime. It hasn’t sunk in properly yet. But this is what reality is, it might just stop our government from sending troops to Iraq. The sacrifice might save many more innocent lives.  But what about those families? Someone’s beloved husband, someone’s dear father, someone’s brother and someone’s guardian. Will someone replace those shoulders? Will someone be there to heal their pain.  May Allah give them place in Jannah and provide patience and means of living for the suffered families.
