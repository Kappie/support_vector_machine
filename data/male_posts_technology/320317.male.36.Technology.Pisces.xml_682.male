 I couldn't agree more. I think Flash definitely has it's place, but trying to be everything to everyone is just plain stupid. I have said it before, but I feel you should use the technology or tool that best fits the job. Flash is great for some things, but you shouldn't try to do "form elements" in Flash, which is much best suited with good old standard compliant HTML.
