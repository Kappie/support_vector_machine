I had calls from two people who wanted to get together that night, but I was too exhausted.  So I just sat home and hacked around on the comp.  I had my job interview today.  It was one of those group interviews, so it was easy.  All I had to do was say a few things about myself and read from a manuscript.  It can't get much easier than that.  It seems like a nice place to work.  It's only a temporary job, but it'll allow me to get some money saved.  I guess I'll try getting more images together for my sister's website.  Until next time, See ya 'round
