Is it a Tadger, Todger, Tinker Tonker Taylor (oops, don’t end in “er”) Twanker (Too many letters) Twater (Bit like a smelly, wet jumper…) Twoter (Clutching at straws here)  I just don’t get it. Calling someone and shouting “You’re a twat” at them, I understand. But to shout “You’re a Turner!” ???? What you want a prize? What is a T***er? What are those other three letters. Even if it isn’t three letters but more or, heaven forbid! Less letters, what derogative insult starts with “T” and ends on “ER”? I know one that starts with W and ends with ER but none with a T at the start. Either I’m missing the obvious or someone just doesn’t speak English!
