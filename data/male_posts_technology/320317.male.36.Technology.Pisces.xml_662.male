Opera Software said Microsoft has been sending its browser a faulty style sheet, which determines the presentation of graphics and text in a browser window."

 Don't get me started on this one. I certainly don't know this for a fact, but this seems to me as just a case of Opera releasing a new browser, and MSN didn't update their site to handle the changes to their "browser-sniffing" code. Considering Opera's market share, I am not sure I blame them. I can guarantee there are other sites out there don't work correctly in Opera 7, but there are no conspiracy theorists working those stories. By the way, if you are using Opera, you probably dislike Microsoft anyway, so why would you even visit MSN? I know that isn't the point, but I think it should be asked.
