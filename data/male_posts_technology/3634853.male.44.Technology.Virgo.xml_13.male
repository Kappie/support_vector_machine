If I'm totally honest with myself, and log each and every days results, I should be able to see how I'm doing toward my goal, but should also be able to see where I'm most succesful and where my play needs work.  Some of this may be difficult to track at first, as my interests are so varied and my ultimate goal is to be at least proficient in many different games, but I will do my best to keep this journal understandable, easy to read, and most importantly, functional to me in my assessment of my play and progress.  Since I am starting with such a limited bankroll, I will primarily be playing Sit N Goes (SnG's), some $1/$2 Limit tables, and an occasional $25 NL table.  These are all Hold 'Em.  Additionally, on rare occasions, which I use to primarily change the pace, I will play $1/$2 Stud games.  Each of these will be reported seperately with a days recap at the end.  Most of the SnG's will be either $5  or $10, and occasionally I will venture into a MTT, but only as a change of pace and to give myself some experince in that arena.  Now, to the nuts  bolts!  If I begin this quest today there are 198 days left in 2004.  Since I don't want to put too much pressure on my initial phase, I am going to shoot for a $2000 BR at year end.  This would mean that my daily average would need to be $10.10.  If I 'm not able to play for a couple of days that doesn't matter as this is a daily thing and I have figured in a low expectation so that I can absorb difficulties in getting to the table as well as the totally expected down times.  The quest begins!
