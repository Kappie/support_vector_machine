Tonight was no exception.  The figurado was a squared off unit with a twisted cap and a little tail hanging off. It drew well and stayed lit fairly easily until I had about a third left. Before lighting, I had the cigar in my mouth and it moderately irritated my mouth and tongue. Most of the irritation subsided once the cigar was lit.  The flavor was strong, but not overpowering. It was like the bass was turned up a notch from typical. My main complaint was that the dang thing would not burn even for anything. I twice relit the cigar to burn off "overhang" only to see it return on the same side of the cigar. Now, I'm no expert at getting a symmetrical even burn but I've never seen anything like this before. At this point I'm chalking it up to a bad cigar. Mt brother-in-law had another Cuban Crafters cigar (different kind but I don't know which one) that burned quite evenly. He was pleased with his.  Being full-bodied I got (and still have as of this posting) some significant aftertaste. Even after a shower, teeth brushing and (so far) 2 mouthwash events, I still have that "wonderful" after smoke smell. Oh, my wife is soooo happy! ;-|   All in all, I'd give this cigar about a 3.75/5 for flavor, a 2.5/5 for smoking mechanics (burn, ash, etc) and maybe a 3/5 overall. Someday I'll try this one again and report back. I've had better full-bodied smokes so I can't really recommend this particular CC line to anyone (at least in Figurado). I have a Mild-To-Full sampler so I will be devoting a few upcoming posts to other Cuban Crafters offerings.
