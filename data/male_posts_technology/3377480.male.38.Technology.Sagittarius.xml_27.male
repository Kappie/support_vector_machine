Katy mixed it, her sister wheeled it to my brother, they scooped it into 5 gallon buckets my brother carried it to me andI put it in place. Notice the sticks sticking up? that is were the top of the cement goes to. most of its about 1.5 to 2 inchs thick, but this one spot is 4 to 5 inches thick, that takes alot of mixing to fill. I just smooth the cement so the top is even with the sticks, then i take the sticks out.  Also the main drain is in as is the nych for the light. The wife and I are going to do about 2 hours an evening on cement, should be done wed? or so. and during breaks I will finish the plumbing and run the electical. should be putting the liner in sat. with working pumps and filters. In other words, no deck done, but sunday we could be swimming.
