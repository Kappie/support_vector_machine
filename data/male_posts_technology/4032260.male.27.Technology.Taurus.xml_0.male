(Phil 3:7-11)   A question has been posed to me (and I have also wondered) is this: "If my righteousness is only through faith, and not works. And if all my righteousness is as filthy rags, then what's the point of trying to be 'good' all the time?"   Well, our goal is not to "'be good all the time". Listen to Paul in these verses. He wants to know Christ. He wants to know the power ofJesus' resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings. Why does he press on? "I press on, that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me." (v.12)   Jesus died for you. But that's not all. He has a purpose for you. Press on! KnowHim!    On a personal note: I went street witnessing with a friend last night. We met many people who knew God and went to church, yet couldn't tell us what the Gospel was nor why Jesus died. There was one guy though who, in retrospect, I'mconvinced is one of the reasons God lead me out last night. He was an older muslim gentleman... I'll just ask that you pray for him... pray that God will work in his heart to seek truth and to see Jesus.
