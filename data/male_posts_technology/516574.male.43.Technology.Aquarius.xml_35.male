UPN has   urlLink Smackdown  , so it gets my vote...  2. roller derby or WWE?   urlLink WWE  -- I liked the old-style derby, but the new inline-skate version of recent years never worked for me...  3. Loretta Lynn or Tammy Wynette?  Always preferred Tammy (although what I've heard of  urlLink Loretta's newest album  so far has been great...)  4. Tony Lama or Durango?  Durango, as I'm drawing a blank on the former...  5. fried Spam or fried boloney?  Bologna ( urlLink "I don't like spam!" ...)  6. Buck Owens or Porter Wagoner?  Buck had a better voice, better songs and a better TV show; Porter had better performances on his TV show -- slight advantage: Buck...  7. fiddle or banjo?  I will suffer mediocre banjo ( urlLink George Seagal ) far easier than mediocre fiddle (Jack Benny)...  8. Texas or Tennessee?  Loved Six Flags over Texas; didn't like the job interview I had in Tennessee...  9. Ford or Chevy? (pickup of course)  Not a pickup fan -- no answer  10. extended cab or long bed?  I like sleeping in roomy beds better than long rides in cabs... oh, you meant pickups again? No answer  11. Tabasco or Texas Pete's?  Tabasco (being unacquainted with Texas Pete's...)  12. Saints or Cowboys?  Cowboys ( urlLink you'll never make a Saint of me ...)  13. baseball cap or cowboy hat?  Baseball cap (as evidenced by J's continuing campaign to get me to relinquish my current one...)  14. double wide or single wide?  No answer  15. Wal-mart or K-mart?  Dead heat  16. "Your Cheatin' Heart" or "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"?  I once heard  urlLink Gary Morris  do the most dramatically dirge-like version of 'Lonesome' imaginable (which is probably why he later got hired for  Les Miserables ...)  17. Gunsmoke or Bonanza?  Bonanza -- the only memorable redeeming features of Gunsmoke for me were William Conrad's narration and  urlLink Miss Kitty 's wardrobe...  18. Johnny Cash or Merle Haggard? (ooooh... tough choice)  Cash  19. catfish or buffalo wings?  Wings  20. Charlie Daniels Band or ZZ Top?  ZZ Top (though Daniels is a hot fiddle player...)  21. Velvet painting: Elvis or bullfighter?  Elvis  22. Plastic sunflowers or plastic flamingos?  Giant plastic flesh-eating zombie bunnies (oops, did I say that out loud?...)  23. Lawn chairs: molded plastic or aluminum frame?  Aluminum  24. John Wayne or Clint Eastwood?  The Duke for acting; Clint for directing -- for porpoises of this, we'll assume acting...  And so my Trailer Trash Culture score (# of first answers divided by # of questions where either the first or second answer was chosen) =  .42  (to two *very* significant digits [grin]...)
