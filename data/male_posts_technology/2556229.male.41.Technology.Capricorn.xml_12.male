If you read the internals of this poll Kerry is smoking Bush  ..and this little nugget from  urlLink DailyKos  speaks volumes about Shrub's support in the Cuban community.    One interesting observation -- my father-in-law, Cuban-American to the core, is itching to vote against Bush. He visited his family in Cuba every year, and is furious that anyone would try to separate him from his family.   Three months ago, Kerry was a "communist". Today, he's got my father-in-law's vote in crucial New Hampshire. And lots more votes just like it in Florida.   Awesome! My wife and I will be helping to take New Hampshire for Kerry also. Did you know that if all the other state go the same way they did in 2000 and NH goes for Kerry he wins. That's right! Count for yourself  urlLink here . Bye bye the dumbya...
