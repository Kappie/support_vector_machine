Personally I use Shutterfly.  When you are looking at a photo that you want to print, there will be a link in the upper right hand corner it says "print this photo with shutterfly".  The pictures are high quality, they don't fade, etc... 4x6's are 29 cents.  Cheaper than taking them in to get done.  Do what ever, it don't bother me...
