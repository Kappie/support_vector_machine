       
      vanilla ice cream chocolate chips caramel, fudge  cookie dough  search the contents within healing the parts that do not show  whatever emotions feelings hurt and anger that currently exist  are refreshed and restored back to normal just like the earth from a springtime mist  however temporary the gratification of this quick fix may last  each spoonfuls slowly and delectably leads my frustrations into the past  and although after this last bite i'll still be all alone  with a smile  face covered in ice cream i'll turn around and say hey look ma... no cone!
