I have a work cell phone they contact me and last night, contact me they did. I got a call every 1.5 hours. I kid you not. Now, the issues were trivial in correcting thankfully, but the fact is everytime I would get about asleep the phone would ring. I am a light sleeper anyway and it takes me awhile to get back to sleep. So I had plenty of coffee this morning and my patience is short today. I did manage to mow the yard this evening. My daughter has a slumber party tomorrow night and we are getting prepared. I have 3 more nights on call and then I am off for a week, vacation. I am counting them down.   Just to let you know what exactly I had to do during on-call. I work for a company that owns and operates hospitals/facilities.  I work in the interface group and when a interface goes down, specifically a critical one (Radiology, Pharmacy, Lab, ect.) then I get called to get it going again. This normally only entails me to recycle (start/stop) my side and then have the facilty or vendor to recycle their side. But it takes time to first page the other then wait for the call back, then request that individual to recycle their side. In all it can take over an hour, depending on how quick the other person is. So when I say I got a call every other hour, I really mean, I got little sleep last night.
