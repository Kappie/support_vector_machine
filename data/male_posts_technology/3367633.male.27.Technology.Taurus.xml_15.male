I am glad that they are using these as an outlet and such in its way is a good thing. People expressing their feelings on the web instead of in real life. But hey even that can have a negative impact as the last killing in Japan showed. Some girl posted a negative thing about her friend and then her friend killed her because she wouldn't remove it.   I am always reminded of the story of Pandora and her box. Even after all the bad things were released into the world, Hope was first thing to be found as it was waiting right under the lid.
