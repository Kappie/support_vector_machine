Angel has been apparently axed, as has Andromeda... and it seems little is taking its place.  I hope I'm wrong!  I did comparitively little today as I've been more than a little tired.  After storming through another five chapters of Transformers: Fusion and going to sleep, I was first awoken by the cat, and then someone wanting a lift.  Obviously the 4am mornings of earlier in the week had caught up with me.  Roleplaying is looking a bit dicey this weekend... one GM is making his usual excuse and the other has alternate arrangements.  Is nothing sacred?!
