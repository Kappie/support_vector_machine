Anyway was watching Survivor yesterday night and one of the contestants, John, won a reward challenge by getting the other contestants to believe that his grandma just died (which wasn't true), so that they will take pity on him and let him win. This week he is making promises to the others by swearing on his dead grandmother's grave.  But it is really interesting how manipulative people can get, almost made me forget the sad fact that I am at home alone with nothing to do on a Friday night.    Today: 2/10
