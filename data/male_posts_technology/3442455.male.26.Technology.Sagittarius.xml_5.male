The only real reason I'm doing this shit instead of other shit is because I'm stuck at work and have no interest in the things I should be doing here, and because I'm here I don't have access or ability to do the things I REALLY should be doing. My car got broken in to again today.  Thats what you get with VA plates in brooklyn.  I want to scream.  I want to record myself screaming with frustration and press it on wax and scratch the fuck out of it. I'll need a distortion pedal and a microphone. I want to scream while I'm scratching myself screaming. I'll actually need two distortion pedals. One for the mic, one for the tables, come on y'all lets rock this...
