Our lifestyle demands two incomes, but, if I ever get my company off the ground, I'd absolutely love to stay at home.  Here's an  urlLink article  by Catherine Seipp for the  urlLink National Review  where she basically dismisses all stay at home dads as tree-hugging, irresponsible hippies who live a sloths life off the hard labor of their indentured, carrer-woman wives. Instead, she contends that all fathers should be like her dad.    When my daughter had a bad day at school recently — her English teacher had called her a racist for writing a paper arguing that affirmative action isn't necessary for women — Grandpa still didn't cut her any slack at dinner. "We're going to have to make a videotape of this so you can see where you're going wrong with your fork-twirling skills," he said. "We'll call it, The Racist Eating Spaghetti." Still, over the years I've come to appreciate his retro, Yesterday's Dad ways.  Wow.  There's a guy I want around my daughter.   Who cares about your future, or an honest discussion on an important issue, just make sure you look lady-like while eating your spaghetti.    urlLink The Blue Sloth  and  urlLink Rebel Dad  (8/9/04) have written some great respones that are worth a read.
