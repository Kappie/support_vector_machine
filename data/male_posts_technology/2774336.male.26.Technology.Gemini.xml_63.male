       Belching, sour stomach 

    

     

 

 

 I had a half bologna sandwich with mayonnaise for the first time in a long time.  The results were disastrous.  I'm belching a lot and bringing up a lot of acid.  My throat is burning.  My intestines are gurgling badly and I'm a bit nauseous. 

  Update:  I can't even begin to understand what is going on with my stomach.  There just doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it anymore.  The only constant is that if I eat or drink, I feel sick.  It's 11:37 pm now and I'm finally feeling a bit better. The odd feeling in my stomach has settled.  I wish I could explain it better, but I suppose it felt as if I had eaten 20 cold raw eggs.  My stomach felt like it was full of cold fluid that was making me nauseous.  There wasn't enough belching to make me feel better, but the belching I did have made me feel even worse.  I can't wait to find the doctor that knows what this is. 

 It may be a bit suprising but I almost feel like eating again.  I don't get hungry anymore, but I do have a constant urge to eat something.  My stomach doesn't want it but my brain knows better, I guess.
