Anyway... read it and understand how far off the mark the Rethuglican platform and the actions of Bush are from the beliefs and practices of the Catholic Church.  Remember that Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount that we are judged by our deeds not by our words.    Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles? Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore by their fruits you will know them.     This does not bode well for Bush. I hope he repents.
