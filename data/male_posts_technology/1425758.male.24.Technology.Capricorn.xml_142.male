 In the morning we asked in the visitors center if we can go to some place where there are beautiful views, and so many people, and they recommended lake Hetch Hetchy. In the evening we went there. It's a long drive and some it is outside Yosemite proper and the road is narrow and a little ruined. We listened to Kid A on the way and it was really fitting. The lake is pretty big and there is a dam. I thought to myself -- "is it, like, God dam?"
