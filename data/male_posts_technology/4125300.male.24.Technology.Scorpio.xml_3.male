We sat down to watch the Cowboy Bebob movie, which is a pretty good anime flick.  Unfortunately, I couldn't stay awake to save my life.  Felt kind of bad about that, but it was a lethal combination of food coma and exhaustion, not a lack of interest in the movie that put me to sleep.  Oh well, I think she understands this.  CW made a comment the other day on how her friends had been breaking up with long term significant others recently, for the express purpose of seeing who else is out there.  The comment started me thinking about my progression through girlfriends, and the reasons the relationships have ended.  At first, I thought that my last two serious relationships have been very good experiences.  The lessons learned were many, and hopefully will serve me well.   However this morning I've come to a completely different conclusion.  The choice of people I've dated previously are precisely the people I couldn't sustain a long term relationship with.  The starving artist, and the P.H.D. student 8 years my elder, are great examples of  that  which could never work out.  So have I had  any  relevant experience?  The wanderlust idea struck a chord in me.  Will CW be motivated by a similar desire to see who else is out there?  Will I?  I think it is futile to worry about those things.  The future is unpredictable; enjoying the present is much more important.
