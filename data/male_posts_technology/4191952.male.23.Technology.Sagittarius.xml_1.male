Get here at 7am and leave at 6pm. 7am is great since it gives me time to get ready for the day, pour some coffee, eat some Reese’s Pieces…send out some emails. 6pm is equally as great since it allows me to gradually slow down and finish up small projects here and there and also relax before I go to the gym. I made it this morning, so that’s two down, two to go. I was a bit skeptical about the 10 hours in a row, but it makes it even and you really don’t notice it.  I also got my car back. I was given a 2005 Nissan Altima, which is a great car, but going to that from a 2003 Hyundai Tiburon is a change. I spent the good part of 2 hours taking the stupid rental car back and having to get my girlfriend to take me to get it, but I didn’t mind. I was just happy to have my car fixed after over a month of having a huge dent in it.  The only snag of the day was when my baby decided to go see her friend that lived 2 ½ hours away and waited till around 2 to tell me about it, but after a little thinking, I was fine with it since it meant that I was going to hang out with  urlLink Rob  and then go to bed.  All in all, I had a good day, got my car back, and got to hang out with my best friend…can’t really complain about that. I also got to sleep in the middle of my bed all sprawled out.  I figured, a good evening away from my babe is what she and I needed…some time alone. Like I’ve said before, Separation makes the heart grow fonder. I could lie and say I didn’t miss her a little bit, and I was happy to have her call me at 9. The bed wasn’t quite as warm as I remember, but I needed that. I needed to be away and to miss her. I think she missed me too. I’m pretty sure she didn’t call at 9pm just to tell me her best-friend’s mom’s dogs had puppies…made me fell happy she was thinking of me.   urlLink
