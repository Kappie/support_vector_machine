I've been trying it out for the last couple of days, but this morning I noticed a feature that now has me hooked.  The feature is that you can set multiple home pages.  So, when you launch your browser for the first time, instead of it coming up with just one page, it can come up with two, or three, or more.  For example, I have an internal SharePoint site relating to community that I go to all the time.  I also want the Blogger window to be as quick as possible to get to.  Google is another.  Lately, I'd settled on the Blogger page and moved a few other links to the very top of my Favorites, but it's not ideal.  It seems so simple: add more starter pages.  But like so many simple things, it's only obvious once it's pointed out to you.  I'm sure there's more in this browser that's cool that I haven't discovered yet, but don't wait for me to tell you.  Try it out for yourself.
