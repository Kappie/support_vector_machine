First of all I'm giving up allot to the bitch and willingly too and it's still not enough. Remember the party I went to with a friend and then went to breakfast the next day with this friend? Well according to my current Bitch future ex, I'm automatically sleeping with this friend. I was seen at the restaurant by my current bitch future ex's last boss and she went and told the bitch I was at breakfast with a chick.So now I'm confronted with the question of "who did you go to breakfast with". Now I know she knows something at that point and I know nothing happened so I proceeded to spill the beans and be truthfull and honest about the whole situation. Well that wasn't a good idea either. I was screwed no matter what I said. So the bitch proceeds to reem me a new ass hole and calls me a peice of shit and hangs up on me. Yeup she hung up on me. Now I'm not really a big fan of the C word when it comes to actually calling a girl that but the bitch was being a CUNT! Sorry ladies for using that word but seriously, I think I deserved that privaledge. So anyway, that all happened on Monday with her hanging up on me and stuff. I haven't even commented on Sunday. But I'm not done with Monday and Tuesday yet. So after she hung up on me I gota little worried about what she is going to do next. She called me back and proceeded to accuse me of doing things that I didn't do and continue to put me down and call me names. So that was Monday.   Tuesday comes along and she calls me up and tells me not to get all pissed off and scared and worried. Ok, I don't know about you but when someone says that, what's the first thing you do? You start to worry and get scared and try to figure out why you'd get pissed off. Am I right? Of course I am. So she proceeds to tell me that she contacted a lawyer. I'm shit'n bricks at this point. Then she tells me that the lawyer thinks I'm being very reasonable and very cooperative with everything. That's coming from the enemy which made me feel a little easier............until this morning.   So this morning she called me first thing and implied that she was contesting the divorce and what would I do if she did. Once again bricks are coming out of my ass. Lawyers were mentioned and she made the comment of "You'll be fucked if you get a lawyer". Now the bricks are turning into cement blocks, you know the big cement block with the two holes in the middle. So any way, I know exactly how to handle that so I'm just trying to be nice and work the friend thing at this point. I don't know what else to do.   As for Sunday, it got a little ugly on the phone with her. I had already had a bad day by getting up to the counter after shopping, and had a pile of clothes and a line behind me. I wrote a check and gave it to the clerk. She proceeded to punch in the numbers and put the check through then tells me they can't accept it. This is after I just wrote a check in the shoe department of the same store. WTF!! I still don't know why but I ended up holding up the line for about 20 mins and walked away with none of clothes that I brought up to the counter.   So when I got home after the shopping experience the phone starts ringing. I ignored it cause it was the bitch. Well it didn't stop ringing for over an hour. So I called her back and chewed her a new ass hole. I called her a psycho stalker and a bitch and I think I might have mentioned a restraining order. I don't really remember, I had some alcohol in me at the time. All I know is that she really pissed me off and I wanted to beat her. So you might want to say that I'm a "Wanna Be Wife Beater". I wish I could remember all the details of Sunday to end this blog in an interesting fashion, but I'll leave it up to the imagination from what you've all heard about Monday, Tuesday and this morning.   See ya for now and stay tuned for more interesting tails from "The Wanna Be Wife Beater".............................To Be Continued!!
