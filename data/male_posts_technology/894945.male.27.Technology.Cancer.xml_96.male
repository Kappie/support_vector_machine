I'm not mention any names but this is a example of the kind of person that reads my site:     I've set myself up another box now, so I can play around with linux without the fear of loosing my entire rig if I accidently shaft my hard disk. Queeg is a Pentium 2 400mhz, with 256mb, made completely out of old parts I had lying around. A couple of ethernet cards and a hard disk later, she's up and running. Queeg is getting my old IBM 8gb disk and a shiny, spanky new Western Digital 80gb is now in Holly. It freaks me out though as it's TOTALLY QUIET. It's a ninja hard disk.  I did my reiki master teacher attunement at the weekend, and a Native American workshop, where i met my 'spirit guide' totem animal. It happened to be a wolf, which is a bit of a cliche as they always seem to be a wolf, but I went with it.  I did nearly burst out laughing at one point during the meditation, where the tape says... "See yourself and your totem animal flying through space... " I then look left and see wolfy floating on his back, paws crossed against his chest. What a show-off. There's me trying to get to grips with astral projection and my spirit guide is performing a circus act.   Oh my god, there's a group of German people having group sex on Sky one.... eugh.. :-[
