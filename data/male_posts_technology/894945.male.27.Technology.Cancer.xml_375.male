We had a blast, We were a little slack with the snowboarding/skiing somedays, we went to the Barbary Coast (the best bar in the world) and had an all day bender, flirting with the waitresses (me) and thrashing the locals at pool (Dougal).  But we have all improved lots, I can now handle all green, blue and a few black runs.. and some basic jumps etc.. Dougal is lighting fast on his skis and Lady Kate has mastered her turns and did great.  However the trip back was a fucking nightmare. I have flown back from New Zealand direct to Jersey and this was worst. Monarch airlines suck ass. We were waiting at the check in desk for ages with nobody there for about twenty minutes. Eventually somebody showed up and checked us in. We knew that the Airbus A330 we were supposed to be flying back on had gone tech (engine faliure) so we had to some back on a A300 instead, which doesn't have the same fuel capacity as the A330 (see what happens when your whole family is in aviation, you get geeky like this) so we needed to refuel in Goose Bay.  So we were eventually left about four hours late, and had to stop in Goose Bay for fuel about two hours. Goose Bay really is the middle of nowhere. There's a air force base and that's it.  The flight from Goose ay to Gatwick was pure hell. The seats in the A300 were packed in so tight and close I felt like a battery hen. Dougal and Kate fell asleep easily enough but I couldn't. I checked my watch. They had a program on Burger King on the TV. I checked my watch.  The toilet was occupied. I checked my watch. Empires rose and fell. I checked my watch. Stars were born and died, going super nova somewhere far away outside our steel tube. I checked my watch. Ice ages frooze and thawed over. I checked my watch.  Just when I was about to try and hang myself with the little pair of crappy headphones I was given, we landed in Gatwick. Thank fuck for that. Dougal and I rushed to the bar for a emergency blood/alcohol level improvement, and found the taste of a Gatwick pint of Heinkein rather like a pint of cat urine compared to Canadian Kokanee. Eesh.  I am now waiting for my jet lag to wear off, and trying to find somewhere that'll ship me a crate of Kokannee and some Canadian babes to serve it.
