We know that  urlLink bloggers helped dethrone Trent Lott . Can we elect a president?   Howard Dean is one of the contenders for the Democratic nomination that has interested me most of late. I certainly haven't made up my mind who I am going to vote for, but I will definitely be keeping an eye on this site.
