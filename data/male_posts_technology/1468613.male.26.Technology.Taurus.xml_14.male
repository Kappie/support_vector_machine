Thinking that it had missed him completely, James went to bed immediately after 'The Tart Affair', [Read: Insanity is in the eye of the beholder] feeling like complete shet...Bring On The Kleenex! Rising to feel not much better...Woe is me!  With the  urlLink Mini  battery now fully charged, and the oil and water checked (Courtesy Pierre Latrine), I am having a SARS Street freeday, living it up with the folks for Bubble's 20th Birthday...Bring on the  urlLink Booze ! Anything to numb the pain....  No other real news to report Old Boy, hope that things are well in Glasgow, the weather is pretty dull here in  urlLink Melbourne ....so dont miss us too much...especially with our SARS like sicknesses...There hasnt been a posting from you in a while, so hope to see one soon....  All the best, jaMEs....  Ps. I tried to do that fancy link thing that Carrie does, but it all linked to really cheesey porn, so I decided against it!   Pps. Ok I think it should work now...with no  urlLink porn  links....
