I figure it's just part of the roller coaster of life that we're on.     Weather is colder today then it was yesterday. We hit 52/53 and went out for a hike on one of the trails at the Mines of Spain State Park here in Dubuque. Parts of the trail, that were on the side of the bluff, were fairly muddy and slick. When you consider at some points how steep the trail is, you don't really want mud under your feet.  Other then that, it's a really fun hike.   When we got to the top we were at the Julian Dubuque Monument.  My wife Z*lda was telling me, that the monument originally built by the Native Americans in this area, was made out of wood, with holes  so you could see Julian Dubuque's body. They have since redone the monument, so that it looks like a giant rook from Chess, made out of huge blocks of limestone (I believe anyway).  We spotted an eagles nest on the Illinois side of the Mississippi. It wasn't hard to find, those things aren't exactly little.  Watched some more of the 1st CD from "The Two Towers" Extended Edition DVD set.  It's just such an incredible set of movies.  The 4 disk set is the only way to go. I'm still enjoying the extra scenes they put back in, from the book, that just give the movie that extra edge/detail it needs. Granted, I still cant sit through the whole thing w/o a trip to the bathroom. 3hrs 43minutes is just too long for 1 sitting and a large pop.   It's now officially December, and that means only 23 more shopping days till Christmas and Santa are here! (oh, wait, I've seen santa probably 3 different places already, scratch his part LOL)
