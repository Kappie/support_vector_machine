Do you think I'll get the treatment of others who have dared to exercise their Constitutionally Guaranteed Right to Free Speech? What if we all showed up at bush speeches wearing "Lick Bush" shirts? What if I sign the allegiance form and show up in a Kerry shirt.... Hmmm. I live in New Hampshire, I think I might find out. Just some thoughts on something I read on Carpetbaggerreport today.  urlLink http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/002232.html
