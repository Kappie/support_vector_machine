Just wanted to drop a line and tell you to pick up this neat little flick directed by  urlLink Don Coscarelli , the cool cat that directed the Phantasm movies. It is currently available in DVD. This little gem has been getting a lot of exposure in some indie festivals, mostly comedy and fantasy. Problem is that the whole distribution of the movie has been handled by Coscarelli's pocket, which is why very few folk have actually had the luck of watching this movie. It has toured several places, building up a cult following. Of course, this is mostly due to Bruce Campbell's performance that is getting rave reviews all over the place.   The movie is about an old, forgotten Elvis Presley ( urlLink Bruce Campbell ) that finds himself in a rest home in East Texas. Apparently, the real Elvis has not died, having exchanged lives with an Elvis  impersonation in order to give himself an opportunity at a new, better life. Of course, now that has come and gone, he is full of bitter regret and frustration. His only friend, a black man that claims to be the real JFK ( urlLink Ossie Davis ). They both realize that something strange is going on in the rest-home when old people start dropping off suspiciously. Apparently, their is an Egyptian cowboy zombie on the loose who is sucking the souls of their fellow residents.   While slow, this movie is very campy and extremely entertaining. Mostly thanks to Campbell's flawless and hysterical performance as the King. Plus, their is a lot of humanity and sadness in the character. It never gets ridiculous. You never see him as a joke. Just as a man who has made so many mistakes, he now has time to reflect on his failures, while he slowly waists away in a rest home.  There is a lot of social critism here in the way we treat and discard our old.     Basically, it's that type of movie that doesn't quite fall into specific genre categories. It was comedy, horror and drama. It's sad that a movie with such independent spirit and energy (especially considering that this is a "geriatrics-fight-Egyptian-cowboy-zombie movie") would never receive a proper theater distribution. Now that it has received a most excellent DVD release by the people at Metro Goldwyn Mayer, this movie will have the chance to reach a wider audience who will ponder why trash always hits the cinemas, yet meaningful movies about old people battling mummies get overlooked. =;-)   urlLink Sailor Ecchi
