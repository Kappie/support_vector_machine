Americans: Please divert your course 15 degrees to the North to avoid a collision.  Canadians: Recommend you divert YOUR course 15 degrees to the South to avoid a collision.  Americans: This is the Captain of a US Navy ship. I say again, divert YOUR course.  Canadians: No. I say again, you divert YOUR course.  Americans: THIS IS THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER USS LINCOLN, THE SECOND LARGEST SHIP IN THE UNITED STATES' ATLANTIC FLEET. WE ARE ACCOMPANIED BY THREE DESTROYERS, THREE CRUISERS AND NUMEROUS SUPPORT VESSELS. I DEMAND THAT YOU CHANGE YOUR COURSE 15 DEGREES NORTH, THAT'S ONE FIVE DEGREES NORTH, OR COUNTER-MEASURES WILL BE UNDERTAKEN TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THIS SHIP.  Canadians: We are a lighthouse. Your call.    Now, that is what is called a CLASSICAL PARADIGM SHIFT.. !! LOL   Sudhar jaao, bhai...    Cheers !!
