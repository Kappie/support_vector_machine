Last night I worked the the bar (Post Office Saloon) I was working the door (checking IDs and such). It was kind of wierd again, since I used to work there (behind the bar) and now I'm on the other side missing all the work, and enjoying the experience. I love being the host of a party that I don't have to clean up after or pay for! I also miss having the ability to leave work there and not take it home with me...of course I probably would begin to hate it if I ever went back, because now all I think about are the "good times" and not the bad, but that is the way all memories are.  Well, thanks for reading this installment of nothingness. Maybe I will be able to discipline myself enough to do it again!
