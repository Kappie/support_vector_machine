An' now look at yourself. You're not even a has-been. You're a never-was. " - Coach Reilly,  The Mighty Ducks  (1992)  Wednesday night I played my first floor hockey game in the Cincinnati Sports League.  It was more than I was anticipating.    It is a co-ed league with 5 players on the ice... er... gym floor at a time.  Seems simple enough, right?  Well let me tell you it is not.  Ann and I arrived before the game and quickly found our fellow teammates and prepared for the game.   Then we saw the other team.  Their team name was "Off the Ice" and were they ever.  We are pretty sure the goalie was Canadian.  He was sporting actual goalie equipment including the painted mask.  Every other team member was wearing some sort of armor that looked to be designed for Barry Bonds or a samurai.  We were wearing shorts and t-shirts.    They scored first, but then I earned my first assist when I hit Scott over the middle for the score.  It went downhill from there.  I took a nose dive trying to run and swing at the same time and got my first knee strawberry in like 6 years.  Later in the game the ref yelled 1 minute left just as a member of the other team took off on a break away.  The score tied 2-2 I sprinted after him and made up ground quickly.  I scooped the puck from in front of him and off the gym wall back towards the center of the ice and in the same motion hit the ground hard.  I slid into the boards.  It was really a few boxes and a table turned on it's side, but it is cooler to say boards.  My team cheered and I popped right up and was feeling great until I hear the whistle blow...HALF TIME!  What?  Half time?  We have to play for another 20 minutes?    Needless to say I didn't have anything left in the tank.  I don't think the rest of my team did either because over the next twenty minutes we gave up 6 unanswered goals.  Beyond the score it was fun.  We have a bye week next week, but after that I am sure we will pull it together a string of victories.    Okay, that is all I have.  So remember to keep your stick on the ice and put the puck in the goal...or something like that.
