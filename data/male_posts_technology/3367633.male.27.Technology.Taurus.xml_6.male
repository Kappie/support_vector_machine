You are HIP and syphilis negative.  You are not immune to either Hepatitis B or A. We need to get you vaccinated for these.  The thyroid is perfect.  Your blood sugar and other electrolytes are all normal.  Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.  Rob  Rob Killian, MD/MPH   So i have another doctors appt on monday to get my hepatitis A shots. i need to check into the shots first.
