Nothing really happened in the time that i could not get on but i will tell all anyway. Last weekend I went on a youth tripwith my church, it was awesome. Went to Silver Dollar City in Branson,MO. Then we did some other fun stuff. Oh yeah, I made a new awesome friend that weekend too. Her name is Heather. She is pretty cool, I wont bore you with the details(not that she is boring or anything, i least i dont think so. I guess i cant type fast enough to tell you what i would like.)  Then this last week we finished the MAP testing, most boring if you ask me. Nothin else really. I was reading Hellfighter's blog and now i am worried i did something to make him think i am not his friend. I hope not b/c he will always be my friend. So if you read the Hellfighter please let me know if I did something to make you think i was not really your friend anymore.   Well Happy Easter to everone if i dont get to it tomarrow. Oh and if you read this Heather, you never said good bye last night, so i shall say it to you now , Good Bye heather. and Good bye all!
