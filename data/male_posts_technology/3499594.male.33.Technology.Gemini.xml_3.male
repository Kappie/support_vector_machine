My wife had her 30th birthday party yesterday. I planned it on her and I was glad to see alot of her friends come over. The kids played and swam, ect. Her dad grilled all day and made enough to feed an army. Polish sausage, smoked sausage, steak, burgers, hot dogs, bratwurst, ham, pork chops, and more. It was a huge success. I put a canopy in the back yard with plenty of chairs and her mom brought over teather ball. It was the first time I ever played it and believe me, it was more difficult than it looked. I got bopped in the head twice and it was moving fast. For those like me who never played; Its a teather ball on a rope tied to one pole. Basically two people play and each try to hit the ball to get it to wrap the pole all the way. Each person is attempting to hit the ball in the opposite direction. I think I lost on every game but one, but it was a blast.   I was thinking about something this weekend. Here is the scenario, a person who loves his house is getting new carpet. Now  when someone knows he/she is getting new carpet, wouldn't they be less worry of stains or a tear in it? Think about it, you are getting brand new carpet in one week and your kid (or someone else) spills something on it. You don't fret because you think 'Oh well, I am getting new carpet anyway, it's not such a big deal'. So you cover the bad stain with a rug or move furninture till the new carpet comes in.  Keep that in mind. Now a person's life expectancy is what, 70 at best, normally around 60? Ok, let's say 70. If you think in 70 years equals 70 days. So let's  say 70 days you will get new carpet. You know at first your going to take care of that carpet the first part of those 70 days. SO the first 35 days, you take care of this carpet then as you get toward the end you get a little less caring. A little blemish here, a little red stain there, the carpet gets a less newness on them. Do you see where I am going? If a Christian believes in the Bible literally, and asked Jesus to take their sins, accepting Him as their saviour, the christian would believe he/she was  going to receive eternal life, thus a new body. So why is the christian afraid of what  his/her body is looking like or the toll on it when they know they will be getting a new body. Christ said, our lives were but a shadow, basically this is nothing. But we tend to dwell too much on this body and life than the new one to come.   I didn't intend to really preach, but I couldn't help but think about this scenario during the weekend.  On a less deep discussion, I can't wait till DeadZone tonight. I missed most of it last weekend.
