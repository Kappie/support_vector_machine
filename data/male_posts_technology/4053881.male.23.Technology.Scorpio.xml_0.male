Everyone....  ok maybe not everyone, but 90% of the people in Montreal do not know how to drive safely.Ok, people can say thatthe streets are not fit for good drivers....I mean with all the murder holes, or should I say pot-holeson the streets to ambush these war or assassins' vehiclethat we call cars, are all there to serve as obstacles to "test" the driver's skills and verify that the driver is alert at all time...Oh how much I must saythanks to the government of Quebec for public funding to repair the streets...How they always repair that stupid same highway from years to years...(15 on the Decarie level, anyone?) but never repairs some of the streets. Then, to add more problems, well there's the number of lanes in the streets and highways...What's wrong with those engineers....2 lanes.....need I say more...What kind of big city have 2 freakin' lanes at highway interchanges...Turcot interchange(where the 20 meets the 720 and the 15), or how about those freakin' bridge like the Champlain bridge...With a population of about 3.3 Millions in the metropolitan area of Montreal, you would think that engineers would think about making the number of lanes more than freakin' 2 lanes....Ok, so this being said, traffic is really bad in Montreal   To make things worst, as if that wasn't enough..There's the people....YES the PEOPLE. Awww Montreal, where the city speed limit is only a suggestion. Now you would think that with all thedespicable road conditions, people would actually be more careful or drive slower...Guess again, how stupidpeople can sometimes be, is truly amazing. People think that their racing against freakin' Micheal Schumacher...and I don't mean just the people driving regular cars...I mean everyone in Montreal!!! Even bus drivers...Oh don't get me started with them...Some of themhavea donkey's behindattitude with the intelligence of a brain obtained from a box of Cracker Jack...Where do they get these bus driver...So to show you an example of the "excellent" service on the37 circuit,here is an example...And it happens quite frequently...Not just once and a while..I meanalmost everyday frequent....   First, as I wait for the bus at the bus stop, well it can be sometimes really hot, really cold, rainy or snowy depending onthe weather. So as I'm waiting,the buses from the 37 circuit is either too early, or too late...But when you come in a bit late..They never wait for you, and actually drives a lil slower so the drivercan wave their hand and say Bye. Or if they want to be on time, they hurry to arrive early, and they let the bus at the stop so that the chauffeur can have his or her break...away from the bus...so, instead of letting the people in, they let the people stay outside in the bad weather and the chauffeur always go back in the warmth somewhere unknown where all decent or not chauffeur go during breaks. Ok, so after letting the people stay in the bad weather, they let everyone in and show how they have power and control the almighty bus by demonstrating their cantankerous behavior. But hey, it can be understandable..I mean you're driving all day, making about 60k a year, with lots of benefits, and overtime, and you get to be on strike for any reasons paralyzing the whole population using public transportation, oh and you have to deal with people sometimes...Life can be soo hard for them :P...anywhooo..as i wait there to ring the bell to stop just before my stop, i ring the bell...i look around in the bus to see how many people will get out....There's about 5-10 people in the bus but none except me that wants to get out, nothing the driver can't handle.....So as I wait to get out in front of the doors, the drivers starts to accelerate..Then I'm like err WTF,why drive so fast when the stop is only about 100 meters away. Well I start waving, and quickly saw that it was not very effective, so  ......Then as I give the WTF stare and watch the bus driver through the mirror, he doesn't mind me.....So as I walk up the alley to the main entrance of the bus and go to the driver and tell him  me: hey I don't mean to be rude, but you missed my stop...  Bus Driver: oh, did I?(pretending to care) oh I'm sooo sorry....well I just didn't see you nor the stop....  me: yeah it's ok (thinking yeah right Jack A**, you couldn't hear the bell, couldn't see the bus stop sign, and didn't bother looking in your mirror)  B. D.: oh well I guess I could let you out here..(meanwhile he's still driving)  me: yeah here would be nice...(if you really meant it, why didn't you stop before saying it)  ok so this is one of the many examples that reflect the attitude of the people driving in Montreal..FASTER is better....now, picture and imaginethis, imagine a bigger scale of those kind of people, but all driving on the highway or on the streets....hogging thelanes as if the street belong to them. Cause most of them think that because they pay taxes, the street is rightfully theirs since it comes from THEIR money....So you see, people, drive fast..say on average 120 when the speed limit is 70, occasionally cut people cause there just soo many drivers..that people driving fast tend to driver even faster...cause it's not a race, but they don't want to be stuck behind in the so-called traffic, oh and did I mention that we had to dodge the pot-holes, now adding to this, you have the small number of lanes serving a big population of cars...which in the end gives you...a big nightmare...  BTW, it's not just bus drivers..even the "special" people from those "special Olympics" do that too...the other day I saw2 physically challenged..or should I say freaksin a wheel chair racing on the side street on those electric wheel chair... >.  i'm not saying that when i drive, i'm a safe and perfect driver...but geez..PEOPLE use your comon sense......we're bound to go down as a society....
