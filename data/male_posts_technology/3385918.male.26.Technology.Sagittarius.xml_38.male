There are some parts that I don't recall, but I will try to write everything I remember as accurately as possible.  I recall going to a restaurant at night to get some food. It was like a dinner buffet type of thing. Outside, in the parking lot, someone has chained two puppies to a hydrant. One of the puppies was brownish red, the other white. They barked and became playful everything someone passed by. I had seen the puppies, played with them a while and then went into the restaurant.   From the restaurant, I spied on the puppies wrestling each other and generally doing what puppies do best. My mom was there and she was sitting beside me. I asked her if the owner could be in the restaurant and she told me that there could be a possibility (which, in this dream logic, would explain why the puppies where there).   I started debating what to do. I felt that if I left the restaurant and they were still there, I would take them for my own. Then I thought that the owner might not want them and left them there so someone would pick them up and give them a good home.   When I left the restaurant, I walked toward the place where the puppies had been chained. They were no longer there. I felt sad, but thaught that where ever they went, they were probably better of than being chained up to a hydrant.   The dream quickly changes location and now we find ourselves in a dirty looking warehouse in the middle of a getto. There is this big group of people waiting to get into the building. There are these large men serving as bouncers. The bouncers where keeping people out of the warehouse and letting a few walk in. Someone was being beaten pretty badly next to me, but I'm not sure by whom.   From this point on, I am not directly participating in the dream. I see everything and I am following someone that seems to be me, but older and Canadian. No, he doesn't look or act Canadian. Nobody mentions this fact either. He just is. In the dream I know he is Canadian. Just like that. Weird, huh?  For some strange reason this Canadian guy who is supposed to be me manages to be let in and is told by someone there that the "big boss" is granting select people gifts for their loyalty. He also mentioned that the Canadian guy was to choose a gift when he meet the boss, but had to then put a blind fold on and choose the gift at random. Also said that it was late and there might not be that many gifts to choose from anymore. The Canadian guy is led to a room, where he is left a lone with the boss...  It was Quentin Tarantino !!!   How the fuck he got into my dreams I will never know.  Quentin gives the guy a blind fold, which he puts on. Quentin leads him toward a night table and has the guy open and search the bottom drawer. There are only two things there: a box wrapped in brown paper and some skies. The guy chooses the skies, but, after taking off the blind fold, asks what's in the box. Quentin laughs and the guy picks up the box and opens in slighly to reveal: the puppies !!!   !!!  They were not moving and the guy turns to Quentin and asks how he could have done something like that? Quentin shrugs and answers that puppies are a great gift, but they often suffocate when packed into gift boxes.  The guy goes mental and screams and Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino takes the box, pulls out the puppies and throws them out a window and onto the crown outside.   The Canadian guy starts beating Tarantino with the skies and then, after Tarantino is a bloody mess, jumps out the window after the puppies.   He lands on top of somep people that start carrying him over they're shoulders. There is mass chaos. It now looks like a rave than a group of people waiting in line. There is drinking and drugs. People start poring alcohol on top of each other.   In the middle of the crown, a father and his son look on and point at the ravaged puppies, also laughing.  The Canadian sees that people in the crown are tearing the puppies into pieces and laughing. He gest angry, pulls a lighter and throws it on the people. The lighter makes contact with the alcohol and everything burst into flames.  The flames quickly die down and there is this big, black spot where the people where supposed to be. They were all burned to ashes except the father, son and the Canadian guy who looked angry at them.  The father picked up his son and told the Canadian guy that they were lucky that they didn't drink or else they would have caught on fire and died like everyone else. They start to leave, but the Canadian guy grabs a bottle of alcohol, pours it on the father and child and lights them too on fire.    !!!!!!!  The child screams "Daddy !!! I'm on fire", as they both quickly burn and disintegrate into ashes. The Canadian guy smiles, turns and walks onto the sunset.   End of dream    Pretty weird, shocking stuff, huh? My dreams tend to be crazy stuff like this. If anyone knows exactly what this dream could mean, feel free to post it up in the comment area.
