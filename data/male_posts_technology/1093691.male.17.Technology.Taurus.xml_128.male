Forget the illegalness :) of it because I have been doing it for yonks and the police are after FBI hackers, not general home users. Makes sense.  Hm, get some Nickelback on those CD's!!! As well as the Bryan Adams album "Reckless". Some specific Pink Floyd tracks perhaps, loadsa Bon Jovi as well.  Tom doesnt seem to know how much I will be plugging "You give love a bad name" on the ski trip......
