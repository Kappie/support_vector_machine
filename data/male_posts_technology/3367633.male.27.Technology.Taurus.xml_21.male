Also no word as to yet as to the job in huntington. ohh well we will see what happens.   Looks like aaron had a bad time at walmart the other day. walmart is evil people dont go there. they sued my mom for falling in their store and hurting her back. they said it was her falt. Yeah some one brakes a bottle and its the other persons fault.
