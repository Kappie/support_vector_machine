I'm not sure what's worse... Having nagging tasks that I don't really care to do or having nothing at all.  It's not really going to be a great week for me. It feels like Monday because I took yesterday off to celebrate my daughter's 3rd birthday. My parents are in town, too... all the more reason to stay home. We always have fun, usually going out to eat. So I'm already nearly 2 days into the week. I have two term papers due by the tenth and I haven't really started writing either of them. I've written an outline (sort of) for one of them and I'm not even sure what topic I picked on the other... Wren and Bernini I think. I also have a short quiz to do online and probably homework from the class that I accidently skipped last night because I didn't realize it was Monday. It didn't even hit me that I missed the class untill this afternoon.  I'm not really interested in anything I'm currently involved with outside of my home-life. We're building a new house but it's not started yet. I can't wait until that gets going... it will give me something to look at other than the news. I'll be getting a new camera soon so I can take higher quality pics of the new place under construction. The digital camera I have now has got to be about 5 years old. It takes just OK pictures and it's too slow. I really don't need a new camera. It may not even be fulfilling to get a new one but I feel like I have a good excuse so I might as well get one and see if it makes me smile.  The weather channel says it's 70 outside right now. At least it's cloudy so I don't feel so bad.  Gil just asked me how to deal with stupidity. Now that's a tough question. At this point in my career I try to seek out the ones I already know aren't stupid and we work things that way. If I can't find that I just let stupidity run its course. I don't care enough to put the effort into chasing down crap anymore. Since it doesn't get me anywhere why waste the time and energy just to make it look like I'm trying really hard?  I left the car with my parents today so they'll be picking me up soon. Guess I'll start the 10 minute walk to the visitor center.
