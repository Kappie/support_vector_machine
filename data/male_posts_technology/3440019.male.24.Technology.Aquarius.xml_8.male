Some say it is concealment of fear. If you can hide fear well then you are courageous and brave. Some say it is in the genes. Some say it is the way you are brought up. If you are brought up in a way so that you are never exposed to confrontations and even if you are confronted by a rowdy you are asked to stay away from him. Which one is true I am not sure.     Some go to the extent saying courage is of two kinds. One - the courage you show in life to overcome the various failures in life to succeed, which we call the strength of mind. Two - to fight back when somebody assaults you, the physical strength.  Some say the rowdies or bullies are hiding their fear of failure in life by trying to show courage by bossing over the others and showing that they are superior.     But whatever said courage is a combination of both physical and mental strength. Most of us can take failure in life in stride and be successful but how courageous are we when encountering a thief or dacoit or any anti social element.If they can sense fear in us we are dead but if we can instill fear in them then we win the battle. That is what happens when we are encountered by a thief or so as fear is instilled in us.     Therefore, I conclude that concealment of fear is courage and nothing more. As usual please feel free to comment and thanks for your patience.
