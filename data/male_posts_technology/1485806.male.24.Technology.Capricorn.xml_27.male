A word have been given during worship on Sunday ...that is change coming , and we must learned to receive it with joy and that change might change the way we do things and our situations.  Well, it came sooner than i thought, I mean a cross over to the area of promises ..to me i am not sure...but i chose to hang on like always knowing by faith God have something exciting prepared for me. I know there will be criticism , there will be jokes or even persecution for the things that happened to me, but when i looked back, i chose Jesus to hang on to.  My training have been left hanging as a result of the Human Resource Development Corp 's inefficiency in handling the matter and now i am left by myself to look for a job as soon as possible to cover up the time i have lost. A backup plan have been drawn and i prayed God will annoint that plan and help me to rise up.  So I plead with the rest of reading this blog to pray for me to have strength to face the promises and challenge that God have in store for me....to walk by faith and in obedience to His Words.... My carreer path lies in God's hands....  Other than that hey, it is not a time to moan about it but it is something to be done about it....
