Watched "Meet my folks" yesterday it was pretty funny. One guy was like justifying to the gal's parents how there was nothing wrong with the fact that he likes to be spanked in bed.  Amd the lie detector test showed that one guy DID sleep with his ex- girlfriend's MOM eventhough he denied it.  Can't wait for next week!   Eek my blog looks like crap on the Mozilla browser at work I can hardly read the words. Gotta do something about it soon.
