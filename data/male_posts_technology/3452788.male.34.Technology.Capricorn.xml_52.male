Her method of child care is child-directed, play-based and loosely scheduled, in which the kids get to do essentially anything they want (within appropriate bounds), learning and developing through play and social interaction with other kids.  This would be the exact opposite of the structured pre-school environment, in which there is a schedule and a lesson plan for what the kids are told to learn today.  Anyway, she is having a problem when parents choose to remove kids from her care and put them in a more traditional pre-school "so they can be ready for kindergarten".  When parents do this, she feels like it is her fault, like she is doing something wrong, like she needs to change what she does to reflect what the parents want, that she is hurting the children by doing what she does that makes the parents want to change, etc.  I tried to tell her that if she really believes she is doing the right thing, then she should not take it personal.  She cannot control what other parents feel or believe is best for the child.  She did the best she could for that child for the time they were in her care, and that's all one can ask.  She cannot decide if she wants to believe that or if she even wants to continue doing daycare. I think she feels like she cannot stop, or take a break, because the disruption would negatively affect the kids.    I think she is an extremely patient and caring person for doing child care, because I will be the first to admit I could never do it.  I think the part that bothers me about the little ones is the total dependency.  When they are older (like our kids), they can do things for themselves when you need a break.  But Anne does need a break, whether or not she will take one.  She won't "call in" sick, because it is difficult and inconvenient for the parents, even though it is usually a parent bringing a sick child that causes Anne to be sick.  She is stuck in a similar loop to me, i.e. "I have to be there for the kids, because they need good care, so I will put their needs ahead of my own".    At the end of the day, she has very little to no energy to deal with family needs, meaning kids and me, so she gets away from the house to do stuff on her own at least 2 nights per week.  I like to let her have that time, but I also struggle with lack of energy from my issues and wish I could have that time away as well.  When she does stay home, she generally does not want to do home chores, because she has been home all day running after kids.  When she does decide to do dishes/laundry/cleaning, it seems like it is always at 11pm or later, when I am ready for bed.  I try to fill in and do my share of things, but I feel like it is never enough, and I believe she thinks the same thing.    I think this is one of the basic problems between me and Anne at this time, even though neither of us really wants to address it.  (This is also why it is simply inconceivable to me that she is interested in another child - more about that later.)  I am not in any way saying that she should stay at home and cook and clean and not work - I don't believe that is fair to her, or any other woman in the same position.  All I am saying is that we need to address this problem, because I think that deep down, it is a real source of anger for her that hurts our marriage.
