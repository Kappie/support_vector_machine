Finally I was able to covered more than 600 yards without stopping and never felt like I was going anaerobic. In fact, I felt like I could swim for a very long time.   My main swim set has consisted of doing 5X(100 @ 2:00) with 60 seconds rest. These intervals are challenging for me but I seem to be adapting to the stress. I tend to finish the intervals around 1:35 wich gives me a 85 second rest. Not sure how to go slower and I really need all that time to recover. I plan to increase the number invervals in the weeks to come.   On the bike things have been going well except for an unfortunate mechanical mishap I suffered on Saturday's hill climb. Having failed to check my tire pressure (I did not own a gauge or a pump at the time), I climbed San Juan Grade with tires filled with ~40 PSI instead of the 110 that should have been in them. The ride was very challenging and I assumed it was so due to my poor fitness. It was not until Sunday afternoon that I checked my tire pressure and realized the true source of my struggle up the hill.    My running suffered the most this week due to improper planning and fatigue. I went on an impromptu trip to Santa Cruz w/ Julie and failed to get my Friday run in. Thursday's run was canceled due to the effects of Wednesday's 1.5 hour session on the trainer.  Sunday's long run was replaced w/ a 10k @ race pace.   My overall health is good but I have some tightness in my back and a minor ache in the groin. Both of these  ailments occurred after Sunday's run   Lessons Learned   Check your tire pressure before every ride! Give the body time to adapt. This takes time and trust.
