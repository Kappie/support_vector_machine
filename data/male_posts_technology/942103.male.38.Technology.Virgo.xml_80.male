The second week was, plainly put, a bust.  The lecturer was two-dimensional and boring and I found it difficult to even follow the lecture.  She sounded like -- indeed, was -- she was reading from a printed sheet.  This week's class, the third, on Death in New Orleans, was quite interesting.  One class left to go.  I decided that I'll wait to write about it until the classes end.  I had hoped to summarize each class, assuming that they were all going to be as information-heavy as the first one.  This wasn't the case but that's an OK thing.  I'll probably draw primarily from the first class when I write but touch on things learned from the other three.  The first class is what got the ball rolling, anyway.
