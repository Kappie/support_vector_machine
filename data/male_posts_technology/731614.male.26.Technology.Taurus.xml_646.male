If  Del Taco    In-N-Out  were to become readilly available nationwide, would California then lose it's cultural significance?  3.  What's the most embarrassing thing you've said to somebody (something that made you immediately regret the comment)?  4.  It's really fun to be drunk in public, huh?  5.  Holding a pee as long as possible before release is pleasurable - yes or no?
