The Fall is when all of the game companies traditionally launch their big titles leading up to the Holiday season. From September through Thanksgiving, it is a time of plenty for gamers everywhere. It is also a trial by fire for your wallet.      Without further adieu, I present the list of games coming for the rest of the year that will probably be bought (most anticipated titles highlighted):     August/September     ESPN NHL 2005 - Xbox   Star Ocean - PS2   Spy Fiction - PS2   Phantom Brave - PS2    Silent Hill 4 - Xbox   Sly 2 - PS2   Demon Stone - PS2   Def Jam 2 - Xbox   Final Fantasy XI: Chains of Promathia - PS2   Blood Will Tell - PS2   Monster Hunter - PS2   X-men Legends - Xbox   Shin Megami Tensei - PS2    Fable - Xbox    DoA Ultimate - Xbox   Pikmin 2 - GC   Donkey Konga - GC   Half Life 2 - PC   Kohan 2 - PC   Call of Duty:United Offensive - PC   Sims 2 - PC   Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War - PC   Rome: Total War - PC         October    ESPN NBA 2005 - Xbox    GTA: San Andreas - PS2    Death by Degrees - PS2   Otogi 2 - Xbox   Red Ninja - Xbox   Paper Mario 2 - GC   Close Combat - PC   Armies of Exigo - PC       November    Ratchet & Clank - PS2   Lord of the Rings: The Third Age - PS2   Gran Turismo 4 - PS2   Metal Gear 3 - PS2   Jak 3 - PS2    Prince of Persia 2 - Xbox    Viewtiful Joe 2 - PS2    Halo 2 - Xbox    Baiten Kaitos - GC   Ghost Recon 2 - PC    Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth - PC       Damn. Looking at that list makes me want to cry - both in anticipation of gaming goodness and how bad my wallet will hurt.
