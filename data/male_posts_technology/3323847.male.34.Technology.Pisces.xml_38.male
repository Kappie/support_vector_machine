He's still the same hard-driving, hard-thinking man I've always seen him as.  I've always considered his shows as brain-food, with a little sugar (comedy) thrown in for good measure.  If you like honest debate on topics that impact our lives, I highly recommend you put his show on your "to watch" schedule.
