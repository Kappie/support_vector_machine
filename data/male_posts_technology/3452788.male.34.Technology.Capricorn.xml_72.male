For example, I may or may not be named Rick, but it works for me.  I would not shout to everyone on the street my address, kids names, when I am home, stuff I own, etc.  If you give away too many personal details, an anonymous stranger suddenly has enough information to start stalking you in the analog world.  In addition, maybe I don't want people who know me to suddenly discover my life story (and maybe salacious gossip about them) on the web.  I will be genuine and honest (to myself primarily, and to the blog community as a whole) in sharing my thoughts and experiences.  But being a chronically paranoid person, you will understand if I don't let the defenses down entirely.  If you try to storm the castle, the tiny plastic cats will be unleashed...
