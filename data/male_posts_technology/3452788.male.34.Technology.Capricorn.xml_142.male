Anne offhandedly says "How did you get her into bed?  Did you just push her in and shut the door?"  I was so totally confused, and apparently my face showed it?  I was thinking "get who into bed, and why can't I remember?"  Finally, pointing at the TV, I said "get  who  into bed,  that  girl?"  Anne realized why I was so confused and started laughing hard, and after a few moments said "No dopey, how did you get your daughter to go to bed so early?"   It was very funny at the time, even funnier if you were there.  Maybe it doesn't come across so well in print...
