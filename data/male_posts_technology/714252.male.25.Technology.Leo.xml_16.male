Death is too good for him..  I think this at the VERY least cancels out ANY possible Blackmail material out there!  GAH!  J00 are so dead..  Anywho.. Had the wierdest night last night.. Went to Hip-Hop Dance classes with bubbles and my little sisters which was fun.. Going to Salsa tonight which will also be fun :) and then I am going to eviscerate ash.. Pictures of the mangled corpse will be available on line as downloadable wallpaper, and for that authentic fan-boy feel buy the "I survived Jonnys evisceration" T-shirts and Mugs, complete with bloody corpse pictures!  GAH!!!  Oh yeah, I also was chatting to a girl online last night, showed her The .Bar site and she recognised me from the pictures! Turns out I had met her before in a club! Dublin is tooo freaky..
