I rather do it myself, but today I am tired of fighting with blogger.  I have not as yet been able to make my damn images load.  I don't know what the hell the problem is.  To make matters worse every now and then they do load, and instead of being happy for my Jpegs of Capistrano I am just confused which makes me angry and disappointed in that order.    A side note before I get onto other matters.  Am very tired today because I shamefully stayed up late last night to watch Notting Hill.  What an awful film!  I hate Julia Roberts.  You can tell she is a totally soulless flake, and what's more is that she has two bottom lips, which is really the least of my gripe.  Anyway dear reader, I wanted to speak to you on a matter that has been on my mind as of late.  Over the past few weeks I have developed a friendship via email with someone.  I have never laid eyes on this person before, but the individual in question seems affable enough, and friendly, and is not a leper from what I can tell.  Were this relationship to have developed in the space outside my computer screen I would never give it's nature a second though, but the fact that I now have an internet pal is disturbing to me some how.  I know this should not be the case after all we live according to a gazelshaft societal model.  I remember back in fourth grade we were assigned Russian pen pals to whom we would write letters that would be returned just as you were losing interested.  Was the Berlin wall down yet?  I don't think so.  I guess that means the KGB got hold of the sea shells my pen pal asked me to send him.  It could be that 8 ounces of coquina shells and I sent my poor comrade and his family off to Siberia to farm snow for the good of the state.  Man, I never thought of that until just now.  Cor!  I feel totally ok about my internet pen pal now.  I'm glad we had this talk.
