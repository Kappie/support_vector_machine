I woke late and hopeful for the scent of overcooked Jimmy Dean sausage and eggs, but instead I heard my three year old daughter's airy giggle. She was wistfull and restless. She poked me in the nose. "Why does daddy's bedspread have flowers and blue? I arose and stretched, calmly speaking to her with soft high pitched arching answers, hoping to thoroughly satisfy her zest for the mundane reasons why these things are the way they are. To which, I failed miserably and the anticipatory "Why" came rattling back through our airy separation.  "Where's that damn breakfast?", I wondered. She ignored my complaint and asked why her butt has itchies. "Well, young grasshopper (she giggled and I pulled her onto the bed) you need to take if off right when you wake up. What happens is the urine seeps from the absorbent crystals in your Buzz-Light Year pull-up and back to your bum, where it causes a rash on your bum, dear." And not to be out-done I added, "Let's get you into that Hello Kitty underwear, so we can put on some clothes and head out to breakfast." I swept out of bed and her into my arms and headed off to her room, my boys dangling in the cool summer air. Ahhh. Sunday morning with the kids. Freedom. Butt naked baby! Give that boss the finger, cause it's my day to what I want!  We backed the car out of the driveway while my two children wailed in mercy. "To the beach." "The wading pool!" "I want my book. No, I  need  my book," our oldest daughter pleaded.  Our youngest daughter began to pump up the volume. I suspect she had a bubble--they hurt when your only 8 weeks old.  I braced myself and smiled at my wife...your problem Mama. Cause it's papa's day today.  We accelerated down the hill towards our favorite breakfast joint: The Alki Cafe. Situated on the shores of Puget Sound, with ceiling to floor windows soaking up the view like a Buzz-Light-Year pull-up. The place has an all right sausage scramble, and a killer Huevos Rancheros, but to our chagrin the line was out the door. We were late.  We opted for a new place, beneath the West Seattle Bridge. There, next to the harbor train tracks, lives The Chelan Cafe. Bristling with working class stiff and familes. We barged through the glass door and made our way to the restaurant line. Not to be outdone, this cafe had it's wall adorned with a local artist's renditions of seascapes and tugboats. Red and greens and water colors fading into stretched canvas, interspersed with charts and antique photos like the one above the fruit still, that showed M/V Kalakala cruising the Bremerton run, back in the day.  Connected to the diner was an expansive room with tables of families, where kids and older folks enjoyed the sunny disposition, together and happy. This room exuded summer fun; the dull chatter broken by the oft laugh and order kept the air light. The room filled with energy.  Across the diner, a small door opened to a hallway. And connected to the hallway The Chelan Bar opened into a dimly lit tunnel, dim and mysterious. I leaned over and tried squinted hard, trying to see into the bar more clearly.  The room was lit by neon signs reflecting off the painted mirrors. There, sitting on a stool, was a faceless creature slumped over the brass bar. He wore a faded red T-shirt, blue shorts and thongs. His dark hair laid flat on his shoulders. Greased and mashy. The time was 11am. He slumped there motionless, downward into the bartender's well. What was this man thinking? Did he have a family? Probably not. He was just a bar fly on father's day.  I spent the rest of the day kicking in the pool and chasing kiddies with sprinklers. I saw the grass grow. I smiled. I'm lucky
