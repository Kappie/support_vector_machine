Bob,  I thought all day and night about the e-mails. This needs to just end. I dont ever wanna feel the guilt for what happens to your family and worse then that I dont want you to ever hate me for a choice you may regret later. I also can not stand the thought of the pain it is going to cause to hear you are not leaving and to have to hear what will make me feel as if Im not good enough or worth it agian. Its just a no win situation.  I do love you Bob and I know you feel the same for me but you also know I can never make up for a big house and a place at the beach and nice cars and my parents are not her parents and im not the happy home maker, I dont even cook for christ sake.  I will always be here for you. We can talk whenever ya want as much as you want. As far as seeing you? Well, thats a more painfull part. Give me time to work up to that please. But you are my friend for life and I wont shut you out.  Im sorry it has to end up this way babe but I wont set myself up for hurt and disapointment anymore. But I will love you forever.  Susie
