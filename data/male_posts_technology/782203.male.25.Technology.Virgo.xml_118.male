We then had pizza for dinner quite happening and add to that my mom's fried rice and i gained back any calories that i lost playing bball earlier.   I'm actually a little pissed with 2 friends rite now ...but I am gonna rant abt that in my private blog. Yeah i got this private blog set up recently to like vent my feelings like when I am unhappy with them. But don't wanna post it here cos those people might read it and get upset or offended and thats the last thing i want to do.  Gonna go to sleep now its 4:22am.
