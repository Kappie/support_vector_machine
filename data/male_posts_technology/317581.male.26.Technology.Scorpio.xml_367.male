So, it was a fun party:)  Also, we cleaned the garage(at least figured out what was trash, and what wasn't) yesterday morning.  And now, we're hanving a super bowl party today. So that should be fun. WE're having Pizza, pop, and chips. Maybe even a bit of a pool. (we'll see)  Well, I'm gonna try and get over this "headache" Peace- T  PS- So far we've figured my team consists of all the cool guys from my team, + 2 guys. (Cool guys from my team = Nate, Brad, Brothers Green, Jeremy and me)
