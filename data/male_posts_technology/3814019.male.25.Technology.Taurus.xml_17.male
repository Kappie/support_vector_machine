Apparently my call is important to them and they are doing everything possible to get me an advisor, but its got to the point where all I want is for this crappy tune to go away. There must be a helpline set up where they do requests for PhoneHold FM. I wonder how long the queue is for that.....Oh well.  "hello, is that mister Halkyard?" said the woman cheerfully "I am afraid the direct debit we set up for you didn't get finalised by one of my colleagues, and although you have been sat blissfully ignorant by making the naive assumption that we have been taking your money out of your account, the bill has in fact been mounting up. I would just like to apologise on behalf of the thousands of semi trained monkeys that are currently packed into this tiny room I work in, for the unacceptable levels of ineptness you have encountered. Also please ignore the nasty letters we sent you stating the imminent arrival of the police and possibly a justice of the peace to your doorstep. We understand this may have caused you some distress and we can only emphasis dearly our discomfort for one of our valued customers"   meanwhile, back in the real world...   "Hello sir, i'm afraid we didn't take your money out, oops nevermind eh!"
