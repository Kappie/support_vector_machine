Bostonians get to log on for free, as long as they put up with a pop-up advertisement every three to four hours.    urlLink Wired  gives a quick report about this free wireless access in my future home city. Looking forward to trying it out. I am so spoiled having pervasive WiFi here at Dartmouth, but I support I can put up with one popup every few hours.
