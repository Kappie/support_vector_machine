It is always a sincere pleasure to hear from our valued, caffeine addicted, customers! Sadly, we have no immediate plans for the Channel Islands, though it remains under consideration. I have shared your comments with the Store Development Team who welcome customer input in their considerations.  I hope you will continue to enjoy our coffee for many years to come.  Kind regards  Daniel Forsythe Customer Care Specialist
