It's helping me neutralize free radicals which can help prevent cell damage.*  Emerging science suggests that this remarkable nutrient may help reduce the risk of heart disease.*  I haven't felt this healthy in nearly two weeks and I can tell that all my radicals have been neutralized - all thanks to my multivitamin w/ lycopene.  *THESE STATEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION.  Since I started taking my new multivitamin I've really become a great lover and I'm as virile as an ox.**  My manhood has also increase in length  width by 20% - 35%.**  I've also become much more attractive to most women in the age range of 18 - 34 according to emerging scientific testing**    **THIS STATEMENT HAS NOT BEEN EVALUATED BY ANY FEMALE HUMAN BEINGS.
