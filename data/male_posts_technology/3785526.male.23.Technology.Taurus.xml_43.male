I love Halle Barrey. But I like Michelle Pfiffer better. For quite sometime i was not able to tell the difference between Gwyneth Paltrow  her. The same happened with Deepti Bhatnagar  Sonali Bendre(I think this is common atleast). But im wiser(definitely) and older(22 years and 11 months of it) now and capable of remembering faces like the back of my palm. That reminds me, im still due one post. The return journey i did from Trichy to Pune on 18th last month. Well, as i  urlLink already told  u guys, the Gods have this thing against me. Now i try to remember what happened during the flight. I realized, I've a very bad memory. But then again, i can recognize all the five airhostess if i see them anytime, anywhere in my life. The other thing i remember was the take-off and landing. 3 to 5 Gs the plane reached during those times. About the plane itself, a Boeing 737, a congested KPN airbus with 3 seats on either side of the aisle is what it is. Nothing great. Greatness was the stewardess.  There was a rookie in the lot and my fellow hot-blooded passenger tried to flirt with her. Boy what nerve this guys have...I just asked for more water...very politely.  And to top it all, Star Movies showed `View from the top` that evening.  All in all, it was one of those rare journeys i did without any embarrasing moments.
