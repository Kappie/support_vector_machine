Of interesting note is the temptation inherent with Apple's Rendezvous technology. Berners-Lee was on the same wireless hotspot I was on and using his laptop during his speech. If you have, or ever have had, an Apple anything, you know this could be very bad.... If I was just a hair more malicious. His name popped up on my Rendezvous buddy list and I so wanted to IM him, but held back that urge. Would that not have been in the middle of his keynote.... muhahha.
