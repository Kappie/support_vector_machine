Actually, it   is   the good kind of rain, isn't it?  The rain is toying with me, though.  On one hand, it's keeping me from the one thing I want most right now -- to go mountain biking.  On the other hand, it suits my mood perfectly.  I want to sleep a lot and not think about the billions of things that need to be done -- taxes being high on that list.  But I can't sleep.  Well, I could sleep, if I let myself.  But in the words of a good friend's t-shirt, "I'll sleep when I'm dead."  
 
 I saw  urlLink The Producers  on Broadway this Sunday.  Sunday was Easter for you atheists and agnostics out there.  I'm not a hugely religious person, but I do like to be with my family on major holidays.  So why was I in NYC, you ask?  Usability, my friend.  I wanted to book tickets to The Producers a couple of months ago.  I went to their website, entered my date of choice and clicked submit.  I got a result back which surprised me because I expected the show to be sold out.  It was.  What the website gave me was the first show available after my date, which was Easter Sunday, April 11th.  I being, the typical bumbling internet user that I am, immediately bought the non-refundable tickets.  This is quite a racket they have going here.
 
 I took the Kona out for it's first long-distance spin on Saturday.  I rode about 15 miles on the  urlLink W Railroad .  It was a fantastic ride.  The weather was immaculate.  The trail -- although paved -- was perfect.  And 15 miles was just about my limit for riding before my a$$ went numb.  I love the bike.  I'm taking it out again as soon as the trails are dry enough -- this time off-road.  I'll keep you posted on its performance.
