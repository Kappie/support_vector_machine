I'm looking over at the girl who sits across the isle from me, and I'm wondering: How good can she be at her job that she remains employed despite working approximately one (1) hour a day?  I mean, she's here for a good seven hours a day, but I'm estimating that she only works for one (and it's definitely not a contiguous hour).  
 
 This made me think.  How effective am I during the day?  Naturally, I'd tell you that I put in a solid eight hours day in and day out, but I'd be lying.  So, I'm going to put it to blogger.  Blogger will be my independent consultant who will measure my effectiveness.  Let's begin...
