It wasn't the best speech of the convention (Clinton, Obama, Edwards, and Sharpton were better), but it was the best speech I've seen Kerry give. He only went Franken-Kerry once or twice. And I was really surprised how effective stressing foreign policy was.  I was hoping he wouldn't stand back on the terrisom issue but I didn't expect him to actually do it.  Kerry gets it. Kerry really comes out looking like the candidate of optimism while Bush looks like a fear mongerer.    While he wasn't my first choice, Dean was my first pick and then Edwards won me over, I think he is proving to be the best choice to defeat the Arrogant Bastard and lead the country.
