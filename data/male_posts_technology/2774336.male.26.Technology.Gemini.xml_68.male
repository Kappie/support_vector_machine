 I had some Peanut M's for my sweet tooth at around 2:00pm. The results were facinating.  I could feel my stomach tightening down a little bit more with each piece of candy. 

 Heres something I didn't consider...MM's contain Lactose. 

  Update:  I ate a great deal when I came home.  It went ok, meaning I was at about a 3 of 10 for discomfort.  One my symptoms settled I decided to have a very small bite of a rice crispy treat and that went terribly.  My esophogus is burning and my stomach is tight again.  Maybe because the treat was hard and scratched my throat?
