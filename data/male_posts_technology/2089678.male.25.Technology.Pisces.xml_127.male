Desktop Sidebar displays e-mails, appointments, task, notes, Messenger contacts, stock quotes, weather forecasts and constantly updated news from blogs, RSS newsfeeds and web pages.   Still not enough? You can control Windows Media Player or WinAmp from Sidebar, and Google is only one key click (Win+Q) from you.   Desktop Sidebar is fully customizable. With skin support, you can change the appearance of sidebar and can freely arrange panels by adding, removing, moving and grouping them together. All panels can be configured with a number of specific options.   Check out link to Resouce for more.  [Resource-Type: Software/Tool; XRating: 5++]
