Do Not  DO NOT go outside until you are told it is safe to do so.  Everything will look quiet normal  - you will not see, smell or feel anything different.  But don’t be fooled STAY INDOORS. DO NOT fetch your children if they are at School unless you are instructed to do so.  They will be safer where they are under cover. DO NOT use any vegetables or fruit from your garden.  Use only food already in your home. DO NOT use rainwater, the mains supply should be quiet safe, if its not you will be told by radio or television.  Obviously the rumours are not true: -   People don’t glow green like you would have thought. Jersey water is not supplied from rainwater but from some unknown source or is treated for radioactive polution daily just in case.   All Jersey buildings are built to repel radioactive rays.  There is not a bunker in the island you have access too.  The consultancy bill for this information probably cost the Island Several million Pounds too.    Do they really think Islanders are really that stupid?
