As I mentioned, during Sat's class Williams Sensei requested that some of us drop by if possible to help as uke for the Sho and Ni dan gradings on Sun. Sun morning, I went down to GWCC as arranged. Everyone was there early. After warmups, Sensei explained some common procedures during the grading (eg. bowing to kamiza, first, bow to ukes, time in between the bow to kamiza and time turning around to bow to ukes should be the same, bowing to ukes is on own discretion and timing and NOT after the call of 'Hajime!' - a shomenuchi strike would be on the head by then. Also, when nage was suppose to do a weapon technique or kata, they mus never never take the weapons themselves. Instead, someone had to kinda take the weapon from the ground and pass it to them instead.  Even the nages taking dan gradings had to rotate as ukes (3 shodan, 2 1st kyu). In addition, there was a 3rd dan (Japanese lady based in Australia I think, practicing for 8 yrs I heard), 1 1st kyu (I think), 2 green belt (3rd kyu), 2 white belts (namely Tony and me, Aikikai 5th kyu).   Shodan Gradings  Jeremy (1st kyu) started first. Katatedori grabs, shomenuchi and yokomenuchi strikes as well as tsuki punches. Basically everything was free play. After that were the bokken and jo katas. Jeremey did well but you can tell he was really nervous and he really got breathless very quickly. Usually his movement would be pretty good. After the kata came randori.  Pearly (1st kyu) - if I got her spelling right, came next. She was very very nervous. Pretty much the same thing as Jeremy. But she was so nervous she got quite a bit of the kata wrong. Plus her weapons work didn't seem to be as 'forceful/strong' as Jeremy's.   Nidan Gradings  Next Michael came. I'd say he performed the best. Everything was pretty much the same except that randori was against 4 ukes instead of 3. In addition, there were some techniques against the bokken and jo as well. Also there were some randori using the jo against 2 ukes. Anyway, I think he's nervous as well because he got a bit breathless in the middle. On a side note, Michael and his wife cross train in Kendo. I think they are shodan but they might have gotten their nidans by now (or will be getting it soon).  After Michael was his wife, Janice. She was pretty good too. I can't remember much save that it's almost same as Michael's.  Last was Mark Tham (the guy who created the Martial Art website on his homepage). He's a Wing Chun practioner too. His techniques are pretty soft and you can tell he adopts a lot of the 'Ki-style hopping around' quite often. But he has a very soft style. I distinctly remembered being his uke for his 'jo randori'.  I honestly can't remember who were the ukes for whom. I helped out in most of the katatedori, a few shomenuchi and most of the randori. A few distinct things to note is that I did some good ukemi, some weird ones, and some extremely horrid ones too. Basically we ran and fell all over the place grabbing, striking or whatever. Trying desperately to build up a certain rythm for nage. Sometimes as uke, when I hesitate, I kinda broke the rythm for them and they had to pick things up again. It was a good lesson on randori though.
