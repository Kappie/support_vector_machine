You're a Speak  Spell!!  You nerd, you.  Just because you were disguised as a toy doesn't mean you weren't educational, you sneaky bastard.    urlLink   What childhood toy from the 80s are you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       You are Francesca Fiore! You have no problem getting what you want, where you want it, and when you want it. Sometimes you get a little sidetracked by your sexy sidekick Bruno, but there is no mix that you cannot get out of. You are sexy, you are beautiful, you are glowing, you are Francesca-enough said! You have starred in many movies, even if their content is somewhat questionable and has been censored all too often, and you have a love of all furry creatures, especially if they can make a good handbag.     urlLink   Which Kids in the Hall Character Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       You are a Fucking Idiot.  You're all about screwing people over.  Your celebrity icon is Heidi Fleiss.    urlLink   What Kind Of Idiot Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla        Also known widely as the Fire Bird, the phoenix is a profound symbol of life and rebirth. It has a life cycle of 500 to 600 years and after that amount of time, it sets itself on fire and dies in the flames. Then, after three days, it rises again from the ashes. It is a completely benign creature who lives in dew. It is said that the phoenix has a beautiful melodious song which grows ever more mournful as its life comes to an end. It is also a symbol of the sun and immortality.   What mythical beast best represents you? urlLink Take the quiz!    the end result seems to be i am francesca fiore's reborn sarcastic, nerdy, and fucking idiotic side, which happenss to resmeble a cross between heidi fleiss and a speak and spell.  a speak and fleiss if you will.  also, happy birthday sandra, and welcome back lisa.  my set of wacky wall walkers has gone missing.  has anybody seen them?
