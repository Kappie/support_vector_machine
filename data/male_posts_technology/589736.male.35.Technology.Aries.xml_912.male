There must be some way to get throught the hatred that prevents them from accepting anything but their total victory.  If OBL wants to sit in the middle of the desert and preach hatred of the Zionists and their lackeys (USA), I have no problem with that until the hatred crosses the line and becomes violent action.  Then, I see it as a simple matter of survival.
