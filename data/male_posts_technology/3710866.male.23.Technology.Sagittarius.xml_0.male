I suppose I should have mentioned this earlier, when I was dropping all the science on you and telling you the names of stuff.  But, well, I lost my nerve, you know?  One reason I lost it is that this word's no sweetheart to say, I can tell you.  Here goes..."phenylethylamine."  What did I tell you, eh?  Even your own scientists shorten it to PEA, so they won't keep screwing it up when they try to say it and making an ass of themselves during, I don't know, seminars or whatever.  But I got to admit, the length of it wasn't the only thing that stopped me.  Fact is, I'm a bit guilty about it.  PEA, you see, is a dirty trick.  Sure - like I've told you - I was worried you wouldn't get yourselves together, and that things would fizzle out 'cause of it, but PEA...well.  Okay, I'm just going to tell you straight out.  PEA kicks in when you're attracted to someone, and here's what it does: it stops you from seeing their faults.  PEA is, like, your actual rose-tinted glasses.  That's bad enough, right?  But then...Sorry.  Okay.  The length of time varies - it can be years - but after a while...it stops working.  Yeah, I know.  I'm not sure I'd have had the guts to tell you this if your scientists hadn't uncovered that bit of evidence already.  A dirty trick, like I say.  Worse still, a dirty trick badly done.  Let's just say I owe you one. This book isn't for everybody.  It's a touch slow in sections and if you don't like brit-wit, you'll hate it.  I really liked it though, and I think it's considerably better than his rookie effort,  urlLink Things My Girlfriend and I Have Argued About .  The book has a lot of interesting stuff to say, a great ending, and a laugh-out-loud-moments-to-pages ratio of about 1:5.
