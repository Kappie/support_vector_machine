Gaines: Heh. I learned that when you're poor, you don't get the legal defense you need. Look at all those poor people like me in prison, you don't see too many rich ones. I couldn't afford a lawyer. If I had those Choate, Hall  Stewart people at the beginning, I wouldn't even have gone to prison. And I learned how many people there are like me. Wouldn't hurt anybody, didn't hurt anybody, and people are spending their lives behind bars. There's no justice. But I also learned about my own strength. There are so many people who go to prison and give up, they say "you can't beat the feds." But I say "fight every day," and that's what I did. Every day, I wrote somebody about my case. Sometimes you get weary, but you never give up. After all, I wasn't there to learn how to crochet.   also go to  urlLink This American Life  and find the story under 1999 - sentencing -
