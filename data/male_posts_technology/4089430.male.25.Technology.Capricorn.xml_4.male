Notice, I call them the big questions-- that's what an INFP is supposed to think, and I do.  99% of people are not INFPs, but you can still come along for fun and pretend with me that this is important to your daily life.  The question that I've latched onto from an early age has centered on the nature of belief. I was raised in a Christian setting and was coming up swimmingly until a wild event occurred.  My mother had gone with a friend for the day down to farm nearby where a  urlLink woman claimed to be receiving visitations from the Virgin Mary .  One was scheduled for noon on this particular Saturday.  My mom was a skeptic of course, but it was nearby and seemed like a fun, relaxing way to spend the day.  There were over a thousand people there, so they went off by themselves to walk in the country-side.  It was a beautiful day; they set up lawn chairs, took a few pictures, and decided to just hang out and enjoy the country. Well, as fate would have it, the picture that they took at noon came out special.  It was a Polaroid of the sun with a large ancient door over it.  The door was translucent with large iron hinges, and most remarkably a keyhole that was half as tall as the door itself and positioned in the center of the lower half.  In the keyhole was a robed figure (a man I think) who was walking through it toward the sun. They fell to their knees in tears.  After returning, telling the story, and showing the evidence, I was convinced. Raised as a Catholic, there was no real reason to be freaked out, but I was temporarily transformed.  Belief had entered the realm of reality and shaken me to my feet. I returned to my school armed with the photo and ready to blow people away; as you know, Internet, no one was impressed.  WHY!?  Being another step removed from the source made it an urban legend, just a story surrounding a quirky photo, a guy trying to make a fool out of those who would be taken in.  So many people have multiple belief sets.  We believe that stepping in front of a speeding vehicle will kill us, and we act accordingly.  Perhaps, we also believe that Jesus is the son of God, yet we live the same as atheists.  Some beliefs are automatic, others are an act of will.  How do we live according to ALL of our beliefs? The main problem is that we sleepwalk through most of our lives. The vast majority of our days are spent on autopilot, doing the next thing, making the usual decisions, and being held in place by the same fears.  I've identified three ways of coping:  1) If you basically don't care, turn to  urlLink page 239 .  2) If you think we need to stop sleepwalking and live in the "present moment" all the time, then turn to  urlLink page 18 ; and when you give up on that idea, try reading the  urlLink Bhagavad Gita .  Then if you, one way or the other, come to the conclusion that this is only possible full-time for a hermit on his 77th reincarnation cycle, try coming back and reading on from here.  3) If you think that we need to somehow improve our sleepwalking, by training ourselves step by step with the intention of converting belief into knowledge (this is more or less why I got a four-year degree in acting), then come with me to future post, "A Practical Guide to the Art of Sleepwalking" on  urlLink page 178 .
