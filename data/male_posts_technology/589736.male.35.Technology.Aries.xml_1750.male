He currently has three recurring roles on three different shows on three different networks (Clayton Webb on JAG; the Speaker of the House on the West Wing; the MACO major on Enterprise).  I have seen him various parts over the past few years, but I am beginning to notice that he looks a little like Robert Culp.
