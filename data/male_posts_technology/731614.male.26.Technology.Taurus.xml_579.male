OH, here's something interesting -  At the Indiana State Park, my Aunt pointed out this sign -   She told me it's where the Amish go to meet.  Thanks to Boz and Belle, it had a whole different conotation though, like it was the Amish make-out spot.  So I made her stop so I could take a picture.  I didn't actually venture down the trail though, 'cause I imagined all sorts of goings on that I'm sure had no basis in reality whatsoever.
