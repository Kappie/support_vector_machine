I got, er, slightly burnt yesterday at the War  Peace Show. Lol. Its quite funny. I have a nice red triangle on my front now!!! YAY JACKIE IS BACK!!!!!! I'm happy :) But I'm not because my wrist is kiling me, I think it is from teh tank ride and me holding on too tight!  Tom, Jo - have fun in Prague!!!!!!!!
