KILL 'EM TO DEATH! KILL 'EM A LOT! KILL 'EM A BUNCH OF TIMES!  On a related topic, I've decided that our society needs better accountability on a personal level. Not jail or some other unreliable future punishment, but real-time consequences. Too muchassholery occurs because jerks don't fear retribution. This is why I firmly believe in violence. It's not just for entertainment, people. Useful results can be obtained.  I thought about starting a club and asking members to wear buttons with slogans like "Decrease the Peace," "Kiss Me, I'm Psychotic," or "I Kill People Like You," but buttons are hard to see at a distance and those little stickers aremostly only dangerous to the wearer. Instead, I think everyone should carry a flame-thrower with them at all times. We could be called the Flame-thrower Brigade (or FB's, pronounced "Feebs"). They're easier for peopleto see, useful for solving almost every problem, and the added weight will improve our cardio conditioning. Perhaps you think this sounds a bit harsh, but consider the following scenarios:  Theater Owner: Can I, after charging you nearly $20 for a ticket and popcorn, make you sit through several minutes of commercials too long to be played on TV? FB: Of course, if I can set fire to your theater on the way out.  Person in Parking Lot: Can I place this flyer, advocating my political views/telephone billing plan/pizza parlor, under your windshield wiper? FB: Sure, if I can set your flyer ablaze and shove it up your nose.  Religionist: Ding dong! Why don't I tell you about my religion? FB: Why don't you BURN IN HELL?!! (fwoosh)  So, you can see, all of life's little troubles can be solved with the judicious application of fire. So let's be good to each other, people. Or elsesome FB will roast you like an espresso bean.  Good is bad, bad is good, all the stuff's the same. I'm back, baby.
