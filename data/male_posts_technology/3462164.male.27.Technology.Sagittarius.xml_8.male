A lot of people blame two people in particular, Rick Berman and Brannon Braga. Rick Berman took over as producer of Star Trek after the death of the series founder, Gene Roddenberry. Brannon Braga was a writer during the days of The Next Generation, and was promoted to producer for Voyager. Together, the two have run the series into the ground. In an interview with Ronald D. Moore, writer on The Next Generation and Deep Space 9, he revealed that the writing staff had to lie to Berman in order to do the show the way envisioned it. There were a couple of great ideas they had which they never could do, because Berman felt that they pushed the envelope too far. As for Braga, he has never seen an episode of the original Star Trek. He has violated continuity countless times, recycled old episodes repeatedly, and cheapened the show by putting as much sex in as possible in an attempt to grab ratings. Instead of expanding the audience, all they have done is alienated long time fans, many of which have turned to other shows. Fortunately, the two are stepping back from day to day involvement in Star Trek, and the series will be handed over to Manny Coto, who joined the writing staff of Enterprise for Season 3. I, for one, am very excited, for Manny Coto has written some of the best science fiction on TV in a long time. He was the series creator of Odyssey 5, which ran on Showtime for a season before it cancelation. Odyssey 5 was one of the most original shows I have seen in a long time, and the decision to cancel it was monumentally stupid. It was the second highest rated show on Showtime, but they decided they didn't want to do science fiction. That's just like when Sci-Fi channel canceled their highest rated show, Farscape, because it's ratings weren't as high as Stargate. More on that some other time. Coto also wrote some of the best scripts not only of this season of Enterprise, but one of the best episodes in all Star Trek. I am very confident that under his direction, the show will get even better next season.
