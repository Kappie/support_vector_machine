It was still fun though.There were performers on five different stages, all kinds of different ethnic foods at reasonable prices, and some arts and crafts. It was a fun experience, but way to many people there, especially by the food stands. We got a whole coconut, that was not as good as the fresh ones from Hawaii. We also tried some fried bananas, much better than the ones we tried in Nicaragua. All in all we had a good time there.
