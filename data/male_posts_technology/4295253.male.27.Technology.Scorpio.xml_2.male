Work has been going fairly well recently but I am swamped in information. I took a month off to by with my newborn son, and I came back to something that I know very little about. It's all about regulatory compliance, internal controls, and Sarbanes-Oxley, things that I don't understand. Even better, it is for a large bank which has tons of documentation for us to drown in.  I'm creating new Livelink object types to capture all of the metadata they require. I found out that other people that are also working on this in Ottawa aren't even as far along as I am -- and I thought I was working slowly! That makes me feel much better about things.  William is six weeks old today. It's hard to believe that it has been so long. I remember it like it was yesterday -- but I'm getting more sleep now than the day after he was born!  I bit the bullet today and responded to Apress. They want me to write a book about mono. I've always wanted to be published, but with the baby and work it will be hard to find the time. I hope that it works out well. As he said, all I need to do is get in the habit of writing on a regular schedule.  Speaking of mono, I was going back through some of my mail and remembered that Sebastian wanted me to work on XML Encryption. So, I'm updating my mono to see whether there is still work to do there.
