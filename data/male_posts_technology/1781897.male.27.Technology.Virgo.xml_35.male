Me and my whop friend (JR.. i always feel it is important to include his ethnicity because he disses the Pollock in me) are heading way down south on a week long surfing extravaganza!  Hopefully we will return with lots of fun stories, minimal injuries, and enough pot to get us back to the bay area.  Sharks are bad....a nice left break is good!  Hope you all have a wonderful holiday!  Wish you all the best......give yourselves a big \e/ hug for me, and i'll see ya on the flip side.
