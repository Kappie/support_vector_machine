This just brings something to mind. Is that how Aikido grades work? That once we've achieved the minimum no. of hours and we're about able to get the next grade. I really don't think so but I still get a bit of a nagging feeling that it may be slightly true. But shouldn't it be the case that techniques and understanding be the main factor when it comes to grading? Part of the reason why I may have the wrong impression is also of the regularity of grading dates. Sorry I'm always doing some kind of comparison, but back in UK, we never actually set when a grading may take place. Pauline Sensei would at most give 1 week's notice but I did hear of a grading being sprung on the students the very night itself. Her purpose of course, is not to cause panick and fail any of the students. But it does seem more effective in the way they would handle the stress and sudden preassures in real life.  I sometimes wish things were just simpler where everyone just train train train and forget about grading. That'd be wonderful. If it comes it comes, if it doesn't well, no loss either.
