Nothing too alarming about that in itself but unusually, as Jim rather excitedly informed me a few days ago, this book contains a preface (entire first chapter to be exact) dealing with the ethics of the meat eating practise. Itâ€™s encouraging to see a chef/cook with this level of recognition take such a step. I had never imagined chefs really gave the issue any serious thought at all. And Hugh seems highly intelligent. You might find this chapter interesting whether you eat meat or not, and his arguments in either direction could certainly challenge you if you have not explored the issue to any significant depth.  I believe though, that his arguments are not as strong as they may appear to be. Perhaps we can communicate this to him soon.
