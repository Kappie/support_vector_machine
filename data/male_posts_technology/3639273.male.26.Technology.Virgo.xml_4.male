The Revelation was one day "Maurice" our deacon was sitting around wondering why people could not be more like me. Read more... Pray more..  listen more...etc...  then while wondering this all day long he got along with God and God (The Lord Jesus Christ) asked him.  Why can't you be me like me.     This is so deep it cut hard. We sit and judge others about where and when they should be somewhere, someplace or where they should be at in their walk or even in their relationships, job, homelife etc.. when in fact we all come short of the glory of the lord. Why must we hold ourselves as Gods and ask others to be like us.
