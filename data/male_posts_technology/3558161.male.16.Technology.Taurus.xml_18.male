Symbolic, meaningful. Things that you can listen to and get goosebumps because you know what it resembles, what it reminds you of. Songs and music are one of the biggest triggers of memory, too. When you break up with someone, I guarantee you'll hate to listen to "your song" that you had with "them". Either that, or you'll cry when you hear it :)  Everything you are Falls from the sky like a star Everything you are Whatever ever you want  I wanna kick at the machine That made you piss away your dreams And tear at your defenses Till there's nothing there but me You're angry when you're beautiful Your love is such a tease I'm drowning in your dizzy noise I wanna   feel   you   scream.     Good music.. is what keeps much of us  going  in life. It's one of the most important things to some of us.   Everything you are Falls from the sky like a star Everything you are Whatever ever you want  Everything you are Falls from the sky like a star Everything you are Whatever ever you want  Everything you are Whatever ever you want Whatever ever you want Whatever ever you want           Dizzy - Goo Goo Dolls
