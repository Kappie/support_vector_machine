I joined a powerful group to do a high risk adventure, and we succeeded, everyone disbanded the group and I awaited the return of a couple of my allies to start my own group for 1 more high risk adventure that would allow me to get the sleeves I desired.  The group was a ranger Gwean, Disciple Tikob, Mystic Kretais, Cleric Akcron, Channeler Arymist, and myself. The group was slow to organize but once organized we had our Monk be the bait while I acted as tank pulling them off of the monk. After a few kills, we encountered a bat. I had forgotten how badly Bats hate light, and so I summoned forth a flash of light to blind the bat, who then proceeded to run in fear, and brought a large army of undead upon us. I died while ensuring others escaped, got resurrected, apologized for my error, and we continued.  The monk then started pulling pairs of enemies, which were causing a lot of havoc, as they were dealing a lot of damage to us. Eventually poor Akcron died, then I died, and most of the party died. When our chances of completing our collection of materials for the wayfarers was at it's lowest, the Ranger Gwean left our group. We shall remember this and never group with him again.  The loss of one of our front line fighters resulted in the odds being higher, and our resources being lower. We still kept our heads high and tried our hardest to succeed, but in the end, we failed to perform our task. we sulked out of the dungeon, licked our wounds, and camped for the night.  Last night, upon waking from my slumber I head someone shouting in the Plane of Knowledge that a Nagafen raid was forming to slay the Fire Dragon. I accepted this call, and waited for others to join our band of adventurers. It soon became clear that raid leadership could not make up it's mind, many leaders bowed out of the position, and eventually as we made way to nagafen's lair, someone became leader and was not responding to our requests, so I requested leadership, but by then morale was so low that many of our raid disbanded from us and returned home, so many had left, that the raid was no longer survivable. I became Raid Leader, and decided that the raid was a dead horse, and there was no reason to kick it any longer. Made way back to the plane of knowledge and camped.  I would like to congratulate my honored Friend Kretais, his elders of Shar Vahl have dubbed him worthy of the title Baron. I only hope that soon the dwarves take notice of my contributions and do the same for me. I would also like to congratulate my good wizardly friend Arymist on his being inducted into our special band of friends. Peace be with you, and the rest of Justice Eternal.  Hopefully today's adventures turn out far better than any that have come before. I intend to investigate the Mistmoore catacombs, and attempt again to gain enough favor for the mighty armplates to replace my simple Acrylia Studded Leather I've been wearing for quite some time now.  If ever shall we meet may it be as brothers, and not as enemies. Ziggur
