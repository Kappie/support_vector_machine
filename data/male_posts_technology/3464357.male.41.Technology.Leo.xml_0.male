Keys to achieving this PR were: 1) Speedwork at the local track.  8 miles of 2 mile repeats at 30 seconds slower than 5K pace, with 1 lap rest in between. 2) Plyometrics.  I used the 4 exercises described in Runner's World: bounding, skipping, etc. 3) 23-mile long run.  The longest long training run I've ever done. 4) Marathon race pace band.  This allowed me to focus less on mile-by-mile pace and more on keeping on track for the overall target I set of 3:30:00. Next up: Telford Financial Half Marathon on May 31 in Farmington.
