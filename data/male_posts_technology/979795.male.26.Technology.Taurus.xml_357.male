We did a form of kokyu nage backstretch which also seemed a bit like going into a shihonage. Dunno how to explain it, but I'm sure we've done it before. Paired with a relatively beginner who might have practiced for sometime before because he was a pretty good uke as a newbie. After that we did Shihonage and I think it wasn't as good as I really wanted that to be. Didn't get too many locks on my uke. Also paired witha  little chubby girl and Karen. The new girl was either sec sch or late pri sch and I think she felt really awkward about the training. But luckily Ms Wong was there to always reassure her. But she did apply a shihonage before she made my elbow 'point upwards'. Think I was quite lucky to have reacted when I did so I got away unscathed. Sensei did call out to her but a bit too late. Think it's a common mistake for beginners to get this wrong lah, I still remember when I first did it. End of the first session was practicing sitting kokyuho with a lady. It was quite nice because we did koyuhos so continuously that everything was relatively smooth and we did not feel as tired as we might have usually been. But I think both our knees and legs were feeling quite sore because of all the kneeling.  Second hour basically was spent with Karen as my partner. We did a variety of techniques from iriminages to koshinage. I tried to apply what Gary said about keeping the arms relaxed and they did feel better during the technique. But I wasn't able to keep it up all the time. I thoroughly enjoyed today's class this evening.  Asked sensei if he will still be teaching in Siglap. He said yes. Apparently Sunny had secured a new job and is not able to teach on Thurs at BVCC. So Sensei will resume the same plan again after a period.  About my first day at work, it was pleasant. Went directly to school to meet the HoD. Met Victor and Emily from the co. who were there to discuss the specifics of the contract with the school. Nice people. After that I returned back tot he co. with them and tried to familarise myself with the system and services they were providing to the school. Though not difficult, there really was a lot to learn and remember. I did feel that the package was extremely well designed and its concept was good. It's a powerful and flexible package, I think schools who use it are really getting a damn good deal here. I think the main challenge here is how to make teachers adopt a more open attitude in learning elearning and making them want to apply it to their work. Because the possibilities of how the system can help them are endless from what I've already seen. I wish I had taken some kinda Education Psychology stuff that I can apply to this kinda situation. I've heard so many stories of how resistant to change people can get sometimes. There's quite a challenge involved as well because not to be confused with purely training that so many commercial schools seem to be involved in, our co is really much more into spearheading elearning. The initiatives they've adopted is really quite fresh to me. All employees have to choose to develop an elearning module in 2 mths in an internal competition within the co. It's really to encourage employees to enhance their development skills and keep in mind that elearning is really the aim behind everything we do. There's like some kinda monetary incentives for winners of coz. I'll only be going over to the school from Fri onwards. Figured it's the best time to do so because the end of the week will give me some time to familarise myself with the new environment before I reeeeaaaally get rolling. I'm expecting there's gonna be tons to do and catch up because according to the HoD, the school is already like 1 mth behind schedule. I've already got a teacher's list and there's about 75 of them in all. Heard that students range around 1300 if I remember correctly but I've not seen the exact list yet. Also managed to meet another trainer, Danny, whom the company had attached to the school across mine. It was quite refreshing
