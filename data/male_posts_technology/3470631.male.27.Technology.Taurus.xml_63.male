Sightings at the after-party I attended: Nancy Pelosi, Wesley Clark. Definitely B-List - no question, but hey it's something for Boston.  Qdog and I ran it absurdly hot - staying out till 4 am last Monday Night. Worst idea ever - but it seemed like a decent one after 5 Krispy Kremes and a ton of liquor.  My new drink is Jack Daniels on the rocks. It makes a statement - not a BIG one, but it's something.  I also think that it's cool to smoke cigarettes. Not that I do it (at least not often at all), but there is something old Hollywood/Very Cool about sitting at an Oak bar, drinking Jack on the rocks and smoking a ciggie.  That said - I can't pull off that look. I wish I could. I think my hair's too short.  It's a good look though is my point. Anyone who says it isn't - isn't very cool.  Sorry
