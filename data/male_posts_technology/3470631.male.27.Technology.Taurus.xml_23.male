I'm demanding a classic 90s TV network channel to appear on cable - it's about 2 years past due in my mind. The lineup should include:  Doogie Howser MD Wonder Years The last couple years of ALF 90210 Party of Five Felicity  Byrds in Paradise (the short-lived classic starring timothy busfield, seth green, and a very young and supple Jennifer Love Hewitt) The Hogan Family  Boy Meets World  Two Guys and a Girl (and a pizza place) (Wherever that blonde actress is - will u marry me?)  Clarissa Explains it all (where is melissa joan hart?) I'd even throw in a couple episodes of that show Sisters - just for a little Sela Ward action and drama for the ladies  They would show movies like Airborne - the one where Seth Green plays Wiley Man and the new kid in town wins over hot chicks with his sweet rollerblading moves. It's all about street-hockey and then the big race at the end of the movie - a winning formula for any 80s - early 90s flick. If you haven't seen this movie you need to go out and rent it immediately. It's horrible.   I'd watch every night - it would be just like when I was in Middle School (years where my coolness level hit rock bottom - not even on the map). Was there a better hour on Tv than the Doogie/Wonder Years hour?
