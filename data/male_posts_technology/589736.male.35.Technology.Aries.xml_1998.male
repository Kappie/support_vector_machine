I have been listening to the governor talk about the need to overhaul our state tax system.  The one that troubles me most is the increase to the cigarette tax.  I have heard that Virginia has one of the lowest, if not the lowest, tax per pack.  That seems to be the overwhelming reason given to raise it.  If the revenue generated from this increase was to go directly to treating the illnesses of smokers with no reduction in the current amounts going there (i.e. an increase in actual spending), I would not have a problem with it.  But, I have observed politicians long enough to know that this will not be the case.  I point to the Virginia Lottery as my case in point.  When we (the voters) were sold on the concept of a lottery, we were told that all the profits would go to education.  The good news is that the politicians held true to their word for once.  The bad news is that the amount of money that had been coming from the general fund has dropped dramatically.  Basically, they used the lottery to fund something that everyone agrees needs it, in order to be able to increase some other programs.  I do not doubt that our current politicians would do the same thing with a cigarette tax.  Now, if they are just trying to raise more general revenue, this is also not a good idea.  I point to New York City as an example for this one.  They recently, within the last 2 years, raised the per pack tax to some astronomical level, like $5 a pack.  This was intended to help ease their budget problems.  Instead, they ended up with a larger deficit than before because all this revenue failed to appear.  The reason?  Smokers, despite there lack of heeding the warnings of the danger, aren't stupid.  They know that they can go someplace else to get their cigarettes and have done so.  Heck, I'm sure that some entrepreneurs did the math and realized that they could make several trips to Virginia, load up on lots of cartons, and took them back to New York where they sold them for a hefty markup but still less than the "legal" packs.  The bottom line, to me anyway, is that getting whatever amount we get now is better than gambling that we won't lose more by raising the rates.  I know that Julie's parents get many cartons to take back to Florida whenever they pass through because of the price difference.  They aren't the only ones.  If you raise the rate, much of this business will dry up.
