I have been real busy with life and if you look at every fansite out there it will have an "under construction" notice or an excuse why they haven't been working. To be honest, I'm just lazy.    If you have been reading my blog since november you probably noticed that i was working on an AMV [anime music video], well it wasn't exactly "anime" but it did have a gundam toy and an art manikin in it....  I have not gone anywhere with that video.  Life gets in the way and I'm gonna try to be more dedicated. I'm having to "re-make" the video on movie maker. And I am working on the "re-done" site to replace the SP5HD stuff.  I don't know where to start.....  If you have any suggestions, or stuff you want me to make a site out of, email me...  I'm gonna see if I can get the comments working right now.  alt code of the day alt-020202 = Ãª  EDIT- I just got the comments up (provided by haloscan) If you read my blog frequently or if you're just surfing please post! ^_^
