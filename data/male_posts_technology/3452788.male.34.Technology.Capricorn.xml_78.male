Normally I would hang out near the band room (I hear y'all saying GEEK or BAND FAG), but near the end of my senior year I was getting tired of that scene, I needed a change, I needed to feel something different.  Also, I was relatively happy the last half of that year, I had a few good friends, doing well in school, coming out of a shell socially.    One particular day, Alyssa and I and maybe someone else (Jason or Rich?) spent the majority of lunch sitting in the quad, typically the hangout of the "in crowd" and very much the social focal point.  Normally I avoided this place, but on this day the grass was a little greener, the April sun warming me inside and out, and I was encouraged rather than unnerved by the sound of people laughing and chatting.  I ate a thick chocolate milkshake with M, the candy freezing hard, crunching in my mouth.  We joked, we watched people, we talked about whatever.    The library guy had rolled out a stereo system and big speakers, typical for springtime.  Led Zeppelin IV was playing.  It was the first time I had really listened to the song Stairway to Heaven.  I felt every note. I was very quiet, taking it all in, seeing what I had missed out on during my self-imposed exile from the rest of the world, saving the memory like a video in my brain.  Alyssa asked me if I was ok - I must have drifted off into my mindscape again.  Yeah, I'm OK.  I have my best friend, I'm not nervous, I feel music, I feel alive.
