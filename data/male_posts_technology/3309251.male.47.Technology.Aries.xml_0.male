If you are on land, try to get on the alligator's back and put downward pressure on its neck. This will force its head and jaws down.  Cover the alligator's eyes. This will usually (but not always) make it more sedate.  If you are attacked, go for the eyes and nose. Use any weapon at your disposal or use your fists.  If the jaws are closed on something you want to remove (a limb, for example), tap or punch the alligator on the snout. Alligators often open their mouths when tapped lightly and may drop whatever they have taken hold of and back off.  If the alligator gets you in its jaws, you must prevent it from shaking you or from rolling over. These instinctual actions cause severe tissue damage. Try to keep the mouth clamped shut to prevent the alligator from shaking.  Seek medical attention immediately even for a small cut or bruise to treat infection. Alligators have a huge number of pathogens (stuff like bacteria and viruses) in their mouths.   Of course the best advice is to not swim or wade in areas where alligators are known to inhabit and never feed, harass, touch, poke nor capture one of those pesky creatures....if you know what's good for you.
