That's right, I made a new blog, but this one is special, cause I'm hosting it myself :)  Yes, MovableType (a blog making engine) is now installed on my linux box, and so is my blog :-D  Sometime soon, when I get a PCI sound card, I'm going to be transplanting computers around. So I'm *hoping* that all my movable type stuff doesn't get deleted, but if it does, I haven't messed with it that much, so it's all good.
