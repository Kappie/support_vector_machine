Sometimes I wish I had it all figured out. What I really want, what would fulfill my life and make me the man I want to be. But then I realize that's what everyone wants. A clear path where all the choice were already made and you just had to follow the steps correctly.  But then there would be no fun. Well, I need to pack. I'm headed to idaho to bring Cindy back to Seattle tomorrow and am waking at 5am so I can get there in 1 day.  Peace-
