So, I cut this cord that we think isn't connected to anything, but then Matt comes and says, "The internet is down and we can't connect to the server." anyway, I'm the first one to be like, umm... maybe it's that cord I just cut, even though it's blue and the one in the server room is white. Well, we trace the cord and low and behold it connects to a blue one.  Well, the guy who had to use a shorter cord, has been using 2 hooked together this week, so I moved him to a short one and a different office for right then, and took his linker guy. then I clipped ends on the the cable I just cut and put them together while Matt went and got more patcher guys.  That is my story for the day.... The end
