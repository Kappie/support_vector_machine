(lol) Apparently though I can get away with wearing a band-aid over it... don't ask me, I'm not the one that made up the rules. ;)  In other news:   Scheduled Downtime    We are planning to have 2 hours of downtime tomorrow night, July 13, between 8p-10p (Pacific Time). Blogging should resume as normal after 10p. – Jason G. [7/12/2004 04:36:27 PM]
