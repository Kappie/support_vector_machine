I'm teh r0x0rz.   *shoots otis*  STOP DOING THAT!!! *dadadada* FUCK YOU, OTIS.  I swear to god, i'm going to shoot you in the FACE. With a can of MACE. Windu stylee.  HAHAHAHAAHAHHHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAH.  It feel so great to have my homework done for once. I think i'll gloat again.  HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAH.  I'm on the outside, i'm looking in. I can see through you, see your true colors, cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me.  HAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAA.  *looks around the room*   Hmm...there are like 2 people that are actually workin on their homework. Good job, 2 people. No one has their work done, yet everyone slacks off. Could this be the reason why everyone has bad grades? I think so.  *note*  I KNOW that dani's computer broke. So i'm not blaming her. Her computer is teh sux0rz. Sides,  she's working right now. Mowhoahahhaaha. She doesnt know that she's being WATCHED AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME!!!!!  *nother note*  I beat Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. My conclusion is...it's the greatest fucking action game ever. Adam and I are having a heated debate over who would win in a fight. Solid Snake, or Sam Fisher. I'm saying that Snake would win, Adam's saying that Fisher would win. DUH. Snake would fucking pwnz fisher's ass. Snake can dodge bullets. Can fisher? NO. Can Fisher flip out and kill everything around him? NO. Can fisher hide in the dark? YES. But that doesnt matter!!! Snake has night-vision goggles. In conclusion, snake pwnz fisher. End of story.
