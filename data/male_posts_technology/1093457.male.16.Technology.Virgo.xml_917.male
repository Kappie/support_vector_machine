Jackie - the batik has come out really well, the colours are sooooo nice!!!! Max - paintballing......wooooooooo! Tom - baa. bleep.  Ok so I had an argument with James from Cumbria trip last night, I don't know if we are speaking now or not but I'm not as bothered now that my friends have grown with new folk and like the grunger lot. Its not too bad. I have found out that on Saturday - and probably Sunday - I will be working at Woolies from 8.30AM to 5.30PM (or later). Argh!!!!! I will be so tired on Monday.
