I have to give major kudos to my dear wife, Julie, who's slaving away on a paper right now.  I wrote the words about having to write a paper late at night, and how you just have to write the thing.  She seemed to like that idea, but it's always better in theory than in the real world.  As soon as I said that you should just write the thing, I just about went to the bed and fell asleep.  It was a close one, and sometimes you face that moment of truth where you will either stay up and get the paper done, or you will not get it done at all.  I have made decisions to stay up, and I've made them to go asleep.  I just mean to say that there are a lot of people that face these types of decisions every day.  I guess I don't know anyone who doesn't have to make it happen.  I believe "Just Do It" it is one of the best phrases ever uttered.  It's an almost perfect idea (when applied to things you should do, of course) because there's so much we face that isn't pleasant, that pulls at our hearts in a burdensome way, but which we know we have to do.  We have to teach ourselves to always retain some portion of our personal soul that's willing to always take the stand and tell the tired brain and the sore back and the stinging eyes that it's time to Just Do It.  And then when It's done, the body will rest and that part of each of us that stood up for what needed to be done will also rest and grow stronger and have better footing for the next fight to do what we know we've got to do.  We've got to do it.  Our greatest source of control in this life is in our ability to do the things we know we should.  Almost everything else is to some degree beyond our control.  So, take control and Just Do It.  You might ask, "What is 'IT'?"  But you know the answer, don't you, when you start to consider?
