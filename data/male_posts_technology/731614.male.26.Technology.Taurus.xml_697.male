Supermarket chain Tesco is developing plans for what it calls the Tantrum Tamer with trolley manufacturer Wanzl.   The design features an electronic screen attached to the handle of the trolley and a seat at the back.   I think it is possible that Tesco may not have thought of ALL the possible add-ons that would help the shopping parent entertain his/her child/ren. I am certain that RW...BS housemates and readers can come up with some excellent suggestions.
