There is no need for this to be a scientific survey, but I think we will collect our notes in a variety of ways and keep reasonably accurate records.   Organizing the data will be a challenge. I believe we can start small databases; one for flora; one for birds; one for other fauna. The bird information is different enough from other data that it might merit its own database. On the other hand, if we begin to catalog insect life, that might create a new database need. All of this needs put on to the web site.
