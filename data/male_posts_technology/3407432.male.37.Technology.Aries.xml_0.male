In other news, I've finally got around to assembling some more "real robot" ( urlLink http://www.realrobots.co.uk ). I've had up to issue 76ish delivered, but only got around to assembling up to issue 32 until last week. Nearly caught up now, only 6 issues to go.  Added a Commodore 128 to my old computer collection. I used to have one back in '86, but sold it to help fund an Atari ST in '88. It's nice to have one back again.  Want to build an arcade cabinet and put MAME in it. Probably just a whim that I'll never get around to doing, but we'll see.  Re-read Asimov's I, Robot book in preparation for the film. Originally read it many, many years ago and couldn't remember any of stories unaided. The film has nothing to do with the book. Except for the title and they both have robots in them. I read somewhere that Asimov invented his three laws so that he couldn't write any "turned on their masters" type stories. Oh dear.  Also been watching "Wonderfalls". It's really good. why'd it get cancelled? Not fair. Even worse is that the DVDs are very unlikely to get released over here. Bum.  Oh well, best get back to work - shame it's so dull at the moment :(
