It seems like each time I install a new system I get more and more things to work correctly and I learn how to overcome more and more obstacles.  Windows hackers/techies have to perform tasks to overcome obstacles all the time, but they are usually very different obstacles than the ones you find in Linux.  I have ran into many problems so far in Linux and overcome quite a few.  A few of the problems I have run into so far include:     lack of Cannon i950 printer drivers installing a printer attached to another machine (Windows) on the network   uncorrupting amule (emule for Linux)   getting sound to work after breaking it, installing a new Window Manager (IceWM)   finding various dependencies for various programs   making my own shell scripts    I have overcome most of these problems.  I just bought Slackware 10 (it was really free with $6 shipping) and I am hopping to switch sometime soon.  I need to set some goals to accomplish before I feel that I can switch.  I want to be able to compile and install a new kernel, and keep up-to-date on various other software easily.
