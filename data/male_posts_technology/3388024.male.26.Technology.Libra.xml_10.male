Apparently my 20/200 vision didn’t thrill them so I have to wear my glasses to fly, but seeing how I have to where them to drive, walk, or even dress myself I guess it’s no shocker.  All and all everything was ok, I do have to get a note from my regular doctor that says my diabetes’s is ok and I’m not going to go into hypoglycemic shock or anything equally as troublesome to paying passengers.  But again, no real shocker.  So there’s another easy way out closed to me.  For some reason following dreams means doing scary things, like changing.  And so far god has not seen fit to bless me with an escape route back to my old daily routine.  So here I march, afraid, down the path to possible happiness and a feeling of fulfillment.  Life just stinks some times.
