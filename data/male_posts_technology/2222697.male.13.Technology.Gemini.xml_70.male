We had an idea a while back to spend a whole day inside a few refigerator boxes.  We never did it.  But, w0t0 was something different. We got the ent√òr page up the first day, and we were hoping to actually create something besides an army on AOE. I have done two comics both pleading him to send me something.  I decided to start one myself.  Harrison is very welcome to actually start the w0t0 project again. I will make my own comic, sadly, IT will SUCK.  I have always worked on my drawing skills but my brain works on patterns, and I am very creative. My brain almost doesn't want to make something like a drawing.  ---  Shelby is THY mad at me because my blog is becoming a rant corner besides a journal. My blog is very different from other peoples. Morgan Webb rants, Piro rants (it is his job), and I have yet to see a blog that I did not inspire to not be about ranting. An online journal is for complaining and you will probably read peoples journals and their life would be completely different in the real world. I usually don't follow traditions, I make my own.  So now will be a mix of both.-  ---  Zell started a yahoo group (link later) and I am looking forward to hanging around there.  I am making my personal site (link later) and I enjoy making a site the way angelfire intended, where all you do is a layout and  select clipart .  I wish all my sites are that simple...  wait, eep I just remembered when expage used to be free!   urlLink i think this is it   I made that site in 5th grade (the skatetown years)  ha, i was such a  nerd  back then...
