These titans of American presidency are enshrined upon Mount Rushmore, one of the modern marvels of the world, and with good cause.  But now a you would put environment destroying, union busting, astrology consulting Ronald Reagan, a president with the most convicted cabinet members since Grant, along side these demi-gods of statesmanship?!  You've got to be kidding!    What's next, Congressman Ose?    Let's put Jefferson in the boat with Washington as he  urlLink crosses the Delaware .  How about a dog at the feet of  urlLink Whistler's Mother ?  Let's change the ending of  urlLink Death of a Salesman  so it's not such a downer.  Or maybe we should paint the Washington Monument red, white, and blue?  That'd really show how patriotic we are, huh?  What do you say, Congressman?  Any other great American works of art you want to "amend"?    Thank goodness you are retiring at the end of this year.  Maybe someone who truly understands and appreciates our American heritage will fill your misplaced shoes.  But what to do about swarming pork-slingers slavishly lining up to co-sponsor this affront on history and art?
