Actually this is the second part to the dribbles of information that I gave you in the last post about my trip to Niagara-on-the-Lake, and also some other winery visits on the U.S. side.  As noted, I am not a wine critic so I will not rate wines here... this is a technical service to help those wine geeks who want to know just a little more wine chemistry.  So with that said, on the U.S. side I decided to taste some NY and PA wines, specifically not vitis vinifera (traditional European grapes like Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon).  Rather I decided to test the vitis labrusca or the American native varietals and their hybrids.  The reason was actually purely technical.  As noted in the post on lady bug taint, I have been searching for differences between v vinifera and v labrusca with regard to tainting by a whole range of pests and mites.  Additionally I wanted to investigate "chemically speaking", the term "foxy" with respect to wine character.  In wine jargon, foxy is defined as the odors and tastes of wines made from many of the American species of grape (i.e. vitis labrusca). A flavor substance called methyl anthranilate is partially responsible for this characteristic. A foxy wine smells and tastes like Concord grape juice.  I have heard this term used but didn't know how its effect on my palette.  The methyl anthranilate comes from grape skins, and therefore is much more perceptible in red wines (which the skins are left in contact with the juice) than in white (which they do not).  The most foxy of all the wines that I tried are ones you would have heard of if you have ever visited a PA or NY winery; Niagara, Catawba, Concord, Delaware etc.  The Niagara is a white wine and had a distinct foxy characteristic, as did all on the list.  The hybrids of v vinifera and v labrusca, tend not to have as much of that foxy flavor, but still a bit, for instance sevyal blanc is hybrid and many of the sevyal were very foxy (to me).  Incidentally, a very popular hybrid that is catching on here in the US and Europe is Vignoles.  Done well, it is grapey without the foxy characteristic.  Winemakers do have to pay attention to this grape closely and make sure that the sugar does not get too high (or you get Welch's Grape Juice).   Research shows that as the grape comes closure to ripening,the concentration of methyl anthranilate increases dramatically.  Therefore it logically that if the grapes are overly ripe or have had a late summer burst of warm sunshine, the higher the methyl anthranilate and thus the more foxy the wine.  Combating this is difficult, as normally the Niagaras and Catawbas are meant to be sweet wines, and thus the winemaker is pushing for a high sugar content prior to crush.  We actually testing Wine Rescue on methyl anthranilate, as the chemical is relatively adsorbable and we felt that it may be a method to "clean up" bad vintages in the winery.  The analytical is not yet back, but to the taste it definitely removed much of the foxiness of the wine.  The the case of a $6 Catawba from PA, it turned the wine into a much more even and pleasurable summer experience.  While the science of foxiness is a bit on the boring side, it is important to note that many of the up and coming hybrids can have the foxy tones, and the winemaker must be alert.   Next time we go Malolactic!  Cheers
