Snacks and tea were the fillers. There was a dance floor with occasional loud music, but no one danced. I am told that other mixers are much wilder.. i look forward to them.. In sum total, a nice opportunity for me to meet people from diverse backgrounds and put our daily work in perspective.. though elements of fun are really needed.. i will be missing the All India Mixer, but hope to catch the next mixer whenever it happens!!  My recommendation to everyone from IT - get out and see who uses the applications we write.. it will give you an idea of why discussing UI design is sometimes more important than system architecture using SOA with robust multi server application middle tier able to excute transactions in nanoseconds ..... probably the budget with 0% excise on garment is a bigger news...
