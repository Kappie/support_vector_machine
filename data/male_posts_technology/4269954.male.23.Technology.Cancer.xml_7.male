    
       First off, I am starting out with a theoretical nest-egg of $25,000 (it's a common amount on the fantasy stock market site I use). Also, I am using a commission rate of $10.95 per trade based on rates that I found on  urlLink http://www.ameritrade.com . Also, the "system" says you should put all your money into 1 of the approved stocks. I am going to try to put my money into 2 approved stocks when I can unless there is only 1.  Day 1: According to the 1% Theory system, I picked ASO and CPSI. At 10:07am EST I bought 478 shares of ASO at $25.39 and 587 shares of CPSI at $20.55. I set up a couple of limit orders (automatic orders to sell when they reach 1% or higher) and went on my way.  Lets see how long it takes to succeed or fail... 1.5 hours...  At 11:04am EST I sold ASO at $25.75 and at 11:23am EST I sold CPSI for $20.77.   Today's Percentage Gain On Investments: 1.065% Overall Balance: $25,301.22 Overall Gain: 1.03% Average Days Per Trade: 1     In case you're wondering, there will always be a slight discrepancy between "Today's Percentage Gains" and how much the overall gain goes up. Today it is illustrated because I did not use 100% of the cash that I had to make the trade... I used most of it though :-)
