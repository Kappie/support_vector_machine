Woke up in Plane of Knowledge Again(Thank Brell!) and was immediately greeted by my associates in battle Kretais, Katheena, Ellektra, and Akcron. After discussing things a bit, it was decided that Karnor's Castle might be the place for us to conduct battle. the Drolvarg's were a pretty mean sort of creature, looking kind of like Gnolls, only taller and stronger. So we all went. Upon arrival, Akcron got herself into trouble and promptly died. I had to resurrect her. One she had been resurrected, we went invisible, and made a mad dash for Karnor's.   One thing to note, Drolvargs have sharp senses and can see through Invisability. When we got into Karnor's there were already a few people laying waste to the Drolvarg guards. After they saw our party, they moved further in, knowing we would handle the outer defenses. After we arrived, Katheena disappeared, I still have yet to figure out where she went. I mourn her loss if she has been taken by Brell to never return.  We spent a great deal of time assualting the outside defenses, and on occassion I would bait the battlements from their posts to chase me into the throes of awaiting death. It was only toward the end that the unfortunate began to happen.  Of course we had Ellektra with us, our enchanter who has a knack for dazing enemies so they do not attack us. Well we were doing a decent job, and I eventually bait a fair group of about 3 to 5 Drolvargs, and Ellektra is doing the best she can to hold the dazing effect up so we only have to deal with one of them at a time. Unfortunate for Akcron, and for the group, there was a Beastlord, I do not remember his name, but if I did I would curse it from here to Brell. he pulled even more monsters on us. Ellektra of course using her maximum ability to keep the enemies dazed, when the beastlord starts to kick random monsters, shaking them out of their dazed states and back onto me. Both myself and Akcron die in the resulting wave of death.   I start heading back, with Akcron deftly behind me. unfortunately by the time we reached Karnor's Entrance, looking back, Akcron had gotten killed by the spiders protecting the entrance. I managed to resurrect both bodies of Akcron, and she Resurrected mine. and we attempted to continue battle. but With the Beastlord there pulling too much for himself and causing nothing but trouble to us. we decided to call it a night. Akcron gated, and I decided that I would stay behind. I setup camp in a wall of the castle. hoping not to be seen. I was successful.   If I should ever meet that beastlord again, I hope he would be prepared to battle a Paladin of Brell, for he cost my allies greatly, and nobody harms my allies and gets away with it.   If ever we meet may it be as Brothers, and not as Enemies. Ziggur Rathebringer
