The guys has virtually zero discernable talent or skill whatsoever. I mean he cant sing worth a shit for one, and he releases his own CD? It'll probably sell like hotcakes too.  What the hell is so great about celebs anyway? What do they contribute to society? Even a skilled actor like, say, Harrison Ford is less deserving of our admiration than the guy who invented the flip top toilet lid, for crying out loud! Even a normal schmo handling a nine to five job has more in the way of real skill and has to rely more on intelligence etc to get his job done, than, say, Sarah Michelle Gellar. Sure she may work hard putting in 4 hour shifts every 3rd day at the set , but come on, she reads a few lines and jumps around in a catsuit, and the world thinks she's like , Jesus Christ or something. But some poor slob programmer sitting in a basement churning out software that  runs  an  entire  corporation, he gets all the recognition of a cockroach. I mean who knows the name of the guy who invented the the microwave oven, or the guy who invented the air conditioner, or the guy who discovered quantum mechanics? Modern inventors and geniuses get no deserving respect. Everyone knows Einstein,Newton and Edison, for example. But who can name the guys who mapped the human genome first, for example? A monumental discovery, one akin to the invention of the lightbulb, and yet seemingly no more important in this day and age than Britneys latest breast enlargement rumour.  How many kids today want to be scientists and doctors compared to kids who want to be actors or pop stars? I think, if the question was posed to the kids of today, we'd see a worrying figure. Which illustrates my point - this world has something fundamentally flawed with it, if it values human  ego  over human ingenuity.
