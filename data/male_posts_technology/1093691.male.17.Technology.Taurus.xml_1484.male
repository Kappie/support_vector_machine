At £29.99. Woo!  Today I wandered into Croydon and back out again having brought like nothing apart from some more hair shampoo. LOL. Great. I am such a big spender. Haha. Paul is coming over once he finishes work so that'll be cool. Other than that I haven't done very much. I should've spent today doing revsion. But did I? No. Gah.
