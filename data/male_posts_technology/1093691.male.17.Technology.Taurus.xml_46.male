That way, if someone turns up wearing the same dress as you at least yours will be slightly different, if not better.  Don't put on bright make up!!! Keep it simple and beautiful.  Earrings which dangle usually add to the elegance. According to  urlLink this  American prom site we should do the following:  4 Months Before Prom...  Make a checklist.  Find out how much money your parents will contribute.  Start saving money if necessary.  Pick out that special dress (put it on lay-away if necessary).   3 Months Before Prom...  Begin to maintain your hair and nails.  Pick out your accessories to coordinate with your dress.   6 Weeks Before Prom...  Purchase your Prom tickets.  Make an appointment to have your hair, nails, and makeup done.  If you are doing your own hair, start trying out different styles.  If you have not been asked for a date yet, check to see if the one you would like to go with has asked anyone, or ask a close friend before it’s too late. You can also go with a group of friends and have just as much fun and sometimes more.  Discuss your plans for Prom with your parents.   4 Weeks Before Prom...  Start wearing your Prom shoes around the house to break them in.  Pick up your Prom dress.  If you haven’t already done so, introduce your Prom date to your parents.   2 Weeks Before Prom...  Confirm all reservations and appointments you have made for the day and night of Prom.  Take care of last minute details: pantyhose, film, etc.   Prom Day  Pick up your date’s boutonniere.  Go to your hair, nails, and makeup appointment(s).  Put some extra cash in your purse.
