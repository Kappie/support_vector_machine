The water was high and there were some great rapids.  We had our own rafts, so we didn't go with any of the professional outfitters.  (It's a lot cheapter that way.)  For the first half of the ride, I was on a two-person inflatable canoe ("the Tahiti").  I don't think my partner and I hit all the rapids perfect, but we still had a great time.  We stopped for lunch shortly after one of the biggest rapids:  Time Zone.  My friends Cory and Justin wanted to use the Tahiti, which I was a little unwilling to give up.  Eventually I gave in, though, and rode on one of the larger rafts.  Interestingly, they tipped the Tahiti over in the next rapid.  According to Cory, he was pulled underwater for quite a long time.  Suddenly he started doing somersaults, and the water ripped his pants off.  Fortunately, he made it out alive, even if he didn't have all his clothes.  Justin continued through the next rapid on his own and flipped the Tahiti again.  Once he caught up to the raft I was riding in, I jumped in with him and we made it through the next rapid just fine.  However, the raft I just left hit one of the rapids just the right way to throw half of the riders overboard.  The raft didn't tip over at all;  it just bucked out most of the people in it.  The rest of the trip wasn't nearly as exciting as all that.  The rapids were great, but no one else tipped over.  We teased Cory all the way.  Fortunately, one of the girls with us had an extra pair of shorts that fit him in one of the vehicles.
