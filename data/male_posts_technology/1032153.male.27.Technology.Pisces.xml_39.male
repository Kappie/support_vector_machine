How's that for dedication to the task?  Well I had some very interesting news, and as I promised honesty as I began this blog, I shall share it with you. I received a traffic infringement notice on Sunday whilst picking my Aunty up from the airport. I travelled left through a stop sign intersection like it was a give way.  So I got fined for it. Fair enough too. Well the police officer was very pleasant, and even let me off for the fact that I din't have my license with me, which I thought was pretty decent of him. Funny thing is that this whole incident got me thinking. As I told a few others, they were like yeah well that's what I do! Others made the excuse that as long as no one is coming and you can see it clearly on these stop signs, you should treat them as a give way. But I think not. It's a law of the land, and not matter what we think of it we should obey it, so in essence I believe it was jolly fair I got pinged for breaking it. Isn't it funny how we look upon somethings as really bad (like I do on the red light running issue) and think other things aren't so bad, like giving way only at stop signs, and driving past ten on our restricted, or driving with pasengers on our restricted. It reminds me of the way we so often (myself included obviously) treat God's law. For example:-  Those who break the commandment that tells us not to murder or commit adultery are somehow worse than those who only break the one about stealing, lying or breaking the Sabbath. Funny thing is that although  we  make degrees of sin,  God  makes it clear that ANY sin is enough to disqualify us from his presence. So that's what that road incident reminded me of.  Well yesterday I went round to my next door neighbour's place. Graham Paton (who was my boss at Red Cross) invited me round to have a chat and catch up with what I was doing. It was so cool. We had a really good chat and catch up about things. he is really a top rate guy.   Today I went past Peter Warner's place on the way home to get some panadol for my headache. I saw him out by the road, and stopped in for a chat with him. We talked about youth in the church, the boys camp at Emmanuel which is coming up, and so on. He gave me a stack of panadols for my headache which was really cool.   Well tonight I'm cruising round to my nana's because it's her birthday, so that should be awesome!
