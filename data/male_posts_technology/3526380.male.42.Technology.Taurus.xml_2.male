It may have had something to do with the fact that I was on my way to work, which is an event that often provokes these kind of questions.  More about that later.    For me, there is not a single answer.  For example, I am happiest when I am with my wife just hanging out, having dinner together, breakfast, going someplace together, watching a video, etc. She's cool and I like hanging out with her. I feel very lucky to have a friend like her around.  I am also happiest when I am in my pool just lounging around, having a drink.  I don't know why, but that really relaxes me.  Just floating and relaxing.  I spent the better part of Memorial Day just floating in my pool lounger with a drink ( urlLink margarita ) in one hand and a good book ( urlLink Lonesome Dove ) in the other.   I am also happiest when I am traveling (for pleasure, not business!).  Especially if it involves the great outdoors or a national park ( urlLink Big Bend National Park  is a great example).  I really like the outdoors and hiking and stuff like that.  Not that I'm any good at it. But I still like it.  As I mentioned earlier, I've been reading  urlLink Lonesome Dove  by Larry McMurtry.  One of the characters in the book, Gus, told another character, Lorena, that if all you have to look forward to is one big thing in life that you think will make you happy, you are likely to be disappointed.  He said that, instead, you have to be happy with the little everyday things in life.  That way, you are always around something or doing something that makes you happy.  I'm trying to learn to do that more.  So, when are YOU the happiest?
