It`s taking a big effort for me to be pleasant to everyone! But I will be pleasant to you my long suffering readers.    Rest Home  We sung at a rest home today. It was sad. Here before us were people standing on the edge of the precipice `Christless eternity`, and they didn`t know it. If this doesn`t make you sad,what will?
