The template work is going slow as ever.  I hate the fact that the previous designers were inexperienced and therefore there are 1,652 lines of HTML in one page I'm updating.  But I'm almost done with the first bit.  We got new kitties a couple days ago and they're being a little annoying.  Last night our oldest cat slept with me and woke me up at around 4 a.m. demanding to go out the open door of my room and be fed.  I don't feed the cats ever, so I just shut the door, locking him out of my room, but he scrathed up the carpet by my door and that woke me up.  So after an hour I was like fuck it and got up and threw him out the backdoor.  Literally.  So, overall I got like 4 hours of sleep last night, and I'm definitely feeling tired at work today.  C'est la vie.  The reason I went to bed at 12 last night was because I was watching the movie 'Heat' with DeNiro and Kilmer.  I absolutly  love  that movie to no end.  I started watching at 8, and finished (after numerous interruptions from the cats) at 11.30.  By the time I was ready to sleep, it was past midnight and I was pissed.  But, that's all good.  I'm fairly awake now, with pizza, coffee, and coke pumped into my veins.  But still, it's not a good thing when you wake up with a headache.  I need more sleep and less screen.  I'm keeping my tan from this fucking 20" lcd I live in front of.  Dammit.  peace out
