The main character (her name escapes me at the moment) kicks some serious ass. That black leather catsuit outfit of hers makes her look sexy, but still makes her look tough. Very cool that they were able to pull that off for her.  Vampires vs. Werewolves rock! I'll be buying this on DVD when it comes out.  Head on over to the forum to talk about this wicked movie!
