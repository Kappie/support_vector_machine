Not likely exactly at 1:15pm cause I have to close my batch. 10 minutes later not 15 minutes. :)   Is it pay day yet?? I know.. next week.  I miss you, Edgar!! I can't wait to spend the day with you later... and Meryl, Haha!!  Hey.. I think I want to cut bangs again. What do you think?? Not like a lot like a bowl haircut, just a few wispy bangs. I dunno, gotta think... but I do know that I will be getting a trim soon. Gotta ask mom.  Remind me to ask mom about the vitamins. You should start taking them. Mom and dad were talking about you today. Cause mom saw you at lunch and said you looked tired. They were just saying that you should start eating more veggies and fruits. That you are not getting the right foods in you. But you will hear that later. Haha...  Ok, it's 8:04am, gotta get my desk together. :)  MwahMwahMwahMwah!!
