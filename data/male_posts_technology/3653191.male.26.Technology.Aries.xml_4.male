As we move ahead, with the technology moving towards "dumb clients", you will now have every damn thing being hosted out of heavy duty servers...    And I hope we will soon enter an era when we need not have to BUY internet.. it shall be freely available like water, air.. and we will be using laptops without any storage disk space.. LOL !!  Cheers !!
