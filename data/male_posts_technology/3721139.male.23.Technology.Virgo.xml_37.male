I know, it's probably those pills I took for joint pain last night.  Lately when I've been climbing, my shoulders will hurt when I'm locked off on a hold, but then release. So anyway, I went to Smoothie King last night, and picked up a bottle marked 3-in-1 Joint Health. "These statements are not evaluated by the FDA," so who knows what sort of crazy reaction is going on in my brain. I just hope the pills help the stiffness in my joints.  Ok, that solves that,  now to take a hot shower, workout, and go rollerblade around Research Park if it stays cool outside.
