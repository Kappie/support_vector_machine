Like Iraqis, Pakistanis, Israelis, etc.  And yes, they are considered Caucasians.  As far as the movie is concerned, and no I haven't seen it, I've heard that they don't have a single black person in the movie.  Now I find that almost impossible to believe that back then being that close to Africa that not a single black person was present in that city during that time.
