Then many years after their death someone published it and let the world see into the mind of such an extraordinary person. Here... we've sped up the process and cut out the middleman. Now I can record events along with my thoughts and feelings and instantly make it available to billions of people around the globe (not that I think even the smallest fraction of those people will know  about this loglet alone  read it). With that being said... here begins my journal...  (We'll see how current this gets kept... )
