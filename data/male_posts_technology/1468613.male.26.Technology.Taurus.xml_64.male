I've got a few pictures and sound bites but it looks like I was standing just a little too close to the speakers. Just a real pitty that Maree couldn't get a ticket to the concert but it sounds like she had a bit of luck that night anyway, going down to my local "Fat Boabs" and winning £10 and being offered a job behind the bar.  Will post pictures at some point, promise!
