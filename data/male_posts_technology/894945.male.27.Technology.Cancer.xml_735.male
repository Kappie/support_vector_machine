If you send your name and address and where you bought the product I will send you a full refund.  I presume you bought the purple bag, the chunk style litter. Originally, all litter was round, then the new chunk style was developed because it does not roll when displaced from the box.  We found that it does not last as long but a customer should still get 3+ weeks from it, especially for a cat who urinates less.  I would love to know the source of the problem because your experience is atypical.  I do apologize for the results that you have had.   Sincerely Leo Lane   Result!
