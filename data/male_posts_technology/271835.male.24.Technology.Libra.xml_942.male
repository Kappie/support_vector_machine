I know for a fact Merg will like the first one as he hates this particular management phrase: I'll be more enthusiastic about encouraging thinking outside the box when there's evidence of any thinking going on inside it.  via  urlLink mijnkopthee  and despite the  urlLink last post on NL  it looks like I'm going to have to learn Dutch as I'm plundering loads of linkage from Dutch sites which I find via  urlLink bloglog.nl  - where the  urlLink WIP  shizzle is from. Largest  via  ever?
