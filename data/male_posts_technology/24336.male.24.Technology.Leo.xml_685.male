The modeling of her face might be said to be too broad, and the lower jaw was set a trifle forward.  Her upper lip was thin, but the slightly prominent lower lip was at least twice as full and looked pouting.  But her magnificent, abundant dark brown hair, her sable-colored eyebrows and charming grey-blue eyes with their long lashes woukd have made the most indifferent person, meeting her casually in a crowd in the street, stop at the sight of her face and remember it long after."  F. Dostoyevsky
