Woke up at 6 am to jog with the Au Yong bro as usual except that i have not been doing this for the past few days and this routine have to be initiated again .Just as we are retiring saw this huge group of CLC people having family day in Bukit Kiara and later met Angela and James... they (Sheep United) are having a time of their own to jog albeit late a bit cause they jog at 8 where today is a public holiday so Bukit Kiara is congested with not the usual people.  Then at 11.30am , I joined the Pure Joy people(Ken , Mel and Kyron) to meet up with Ps Lindy and 1800 united and John Chew to go for wall climbing which is awesome because I for the first time have to take a basic course on how to scale the wall and how to belayer someone. It was a really a sport that i can managed quite well...very intensive on the physical and mentally because it challenged ur mind to think when you are tired to chart our route along the handgrips and footholds..to get to the top.  Had a really good time hanging out kyron and well Melissa Wong...get to know her just a little closer and found out how good she is at this as well. Ken Hiew as usual provides the pure joy and of course made the whole outing today fun. To see the whole thing works out with other cell as well, i am challenged to bring SImply United to have fun in cells especially in the area of wall climbing . To hear from Wai Ping my cell leader Daniel so cham staying back at his house unaware of the whole outing trips tickles me a little...cause Daniel have been voting each year for Simply United to go wall climbing but each time was voted out. To think that this year , his cell member would have gone with other cell for wall climbing and not invite him , is quite a big dissapointment.   Sorry i don't have pictures cause i did not bring my digi cam there...if not the pics there would be fanstastic. but of course this whole outing guarantees me a second trip to further improve myself in all this.and really strengthen my body for all this...I just hope that i can remember the knots and the process of belaying someone.  Opps gtg now...i have my current work to do and i am really sleepy cause i did not rest and i went straight to work ...until the next morning 7.00am.
