The lead couple had no chemistry. The editing was pathetic. The set piece tear jerker scenes were plastic. The timing of the not too pleasant songs was worse than could have been though possible and the ending was…… well lets just say that if you haven’t caught onto the fact that this is a really, really bad movie then you need to have your head examined.  I also watched ‘Day After Tomorrow’ its not great but it isn’t bad either. Roland Emmerich seems to specialize in making movies in which the actors are subordinate to the movie and its setting. Thankfully he then proceeds to save himself a whole load of money by not casting top notch actors. Actually it all makes sense in a skewed sort of way. The movie had its really bad moments but on the whole it did what it set out to do. And that is to wow audiences with effects sequences, which are truly amazing in their sheer scale. Sure the theme is outlandish and very over the top but I wasn’t looking for a National Geographic Documentary anyway. All in all its worth a watch.
