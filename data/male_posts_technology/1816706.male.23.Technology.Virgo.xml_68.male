     
      Got up around 4:30am and got read to go back home... to Hawaii.  It was an odd feeling.  And from the moment I hugged Heather goodbye, it was like my surroundings dissapeared and I was just a traveler again, walking through an airport, getting on a plane, then another airport, then another plane, and I blinked once and saw Heather, and blinked again and Andy was picking me up.  Back in Hawaii... Aloha.
