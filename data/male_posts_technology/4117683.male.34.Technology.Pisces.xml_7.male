They let the other 2 dweebs go man the company that I worked for send us some ID-10-T's. I was helpingputting the lights for the display up, cos the assholes at Lowe's didn't find them until we were gonna be done in less than 15 minutes... Well I got about 1/2 way in setting up the light.. My headache just got too bad...So I left...  However, I still had to take the bus back!!!! I left there about 6:00, and I didn't get home until 8! The second I came home I puked! Then I crawled in to my room, did a shot of my  urlLink Imitrex ! Then I took a nap... After waking up about 930 My headache was gone! So I eat... Also I looked out side, and I now have found my 3RD computer in the trash! This one wasn't that good.. it was a Compaq 4704, a P-133 but it had a monitor, the keyboard and mouse, and all the needed cables.. So I will use it for scrap!  I am beat! and tomorrow I got to go to part# of my med eval... So tomorrow I will tell ya'll what I will be on next!  Lates!
