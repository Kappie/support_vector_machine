I realised it's been a long while that I had been reading in on forums and articles. As I surfed on, I found many articles of interest. Some of which beared some relevance to thoughts and misgivings I have about attempting the coming grading next month. I've been feeling indecisive about whether to attempt it. Most part of me feels that I shouldn't.  I came across some articles at AikiWeb and I began trying to evaluate _my_'fear' or unwillingness to attempt a grading. It dawned on me that at 6th kyu grade, I do feel a 'wanting' to attain 5th kyu. But I feel pretty often that I am unable to handle, execute and receive techniques. It could be due to this lack of confidence, but a lack of confidence to do what? To pass my grading? No, because if Sensei would allow me to register for it, it probably means that I have met the standard to take and pass the grading (how well I perform on the day itself is another matter). It may be the confidence to live up to the next level of performance. I do feel more confident just practicing with juniors and peers and I may be trying to avoid facing the challenge of the next level. It sounds very much like I'm avoiding what I'm not good at instead of facing up to it and trying to overcome it instead. I think I feel a bit apprehensive of facing the responsibility of holding the next grade as well. Such that if I do a technique worse than a more junior grade, I won't feel good about myself. That sounds very much like a struggle on ego. All because I do not feel good appearing like a substandard Aikidoka of the grade I am holding.  It shouldn't be that case. An uncle once told me something which I interpreted as 'Do not let the success of others intimidate / demoralise us. We should, instead, use their success to inspire ourselves onwards.' I've remembered the meaning conveyed in many instances and I thought I did as well in my Aikido training, but I realise now that it might not have been so.  Enlightenment: I will never be the good Aikidoka I hope to be wherever and however I train, but it should not stop me from trying to be.  I will always be a substandard Aikidoka of the grade I'm holding, but as soon as I become the substandard Aikidoka of the next grade, it makes me a better Aikidoka which I've been at the previous grade. To put the arguement into a more personal context; I'm proud to be a substandard 6th kyu. When I become a substandard 5th kyu, it means I am an improved substandard 6th kyu and I should be glad about having improved. Rather than compare my current standard of Aikido with others, I should be trying to attain the level of Aikido the better ones are practicing. 'Looking bad' itself is a great lesson on humility on the mat.  We should not let our current state hold ourselves back from the next.
