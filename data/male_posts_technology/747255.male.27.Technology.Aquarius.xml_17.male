Last week I sent an e-mail to a singer who performed at a youth camp I went to in 1987 or 1988... I was basically just trying to find out if he was the performer or if it had been someone else. Anyway, I wasn't quite sure of his response. I wasn't sure if he was just being sarcastic or was sincerely bitter. If he is bitter about whatever happened that summer (which I've sent another e-mail tonight trying to find out) it just adds another log to the burning pile of distrust and doubt that's accumulated around me regarding the church.  I really don't know what to think anymore. I hardly know myself. I don't have any burning desire ... well... for anything. I think back to my teen years (I'm just 27 so it's not like it should be so foggy) and remember (barely) some of the things I used to do. I'm not sure what really compelled me to do the things I did regarding the church. I was probably labeled a fanatic by most people who chose not to associate with me (most). I wore t-shirts with Christian messages... Carried a bible... Talked about Jesus and salvation and grace and forgiveness... on and on. But thinking back on it I can't really say it was religious conviction that led me. Peer pressure and fear is really what it seems like from this angle. I went to church on Sundays and Wednesdays (Baptist). Some of the most beautiful girls I've ever known were members of the church I went to so that was a plus... And maybe being churchy was what I thought they wanted in a guy so that's what I wanted to be. I remember a retreat we went to one summer... There was some big exercise we did regarding death and final judgment. I ended up in hell. Most of the kids in there didn't think much about it but it really bothered me. I ended up sobbing like a baby about the whole thing and by the end of the night I felt like the ministry was what I wanted to do with my life. I can't explain why and I don't remember anyone ever asking either. I read about the catholic church during the renaissance. The church controlled everything.... Who got to learn how to read... What they read (bible)... and on and on. And I think about the bible. How has the bible changed over time. Who decided how things would be interpreted. Who decided what parts stayed and what parts went? Man, of course. But the faithful tell me that these people were inspired by God and acted on His will. But they all thought they were inspired by God and acting on His will... Back in January Pat Robertson said  urlLink "I really believe I'm hearing from the Lord it's going to be like a blowout election in 2004. It's shaping up that way."   In case you didn't know he's talking about Bush winning in a landslide... God told him that. I don't know.  I don't go to church anymore. I still feel like I'd eventually like to find a church to go to and be comfortable in, but I don't know why really. For friends? I don't need church to have friends. Besides, I like to watch R-rated movies. I like to drink beer and wine... rarely to a drunken state but I like to drink. I like to discuss things that some people in the church would rather not. I don't need friends from church for all that. You don't have to be a churchgoer to be a good person. The only thing you have to be, to be a good person, is a good person.  Sure, our nations laws may be based on judeo-christian tradition but are they not also common sense? Or do they seem like common sense to me because I was raised in a Christian church? Likewise, does Catholic tradition seem strange to me because I was raised differently. I think so. I think Catholics interpret some of the things the bible says very strangely. But they think the same about Baptists. But I digress... Really though, don't all religions teach that it's basically wrong to kill and steal and do bad things? I mean, they're BAD things...  So Jesus is the redeemer and God knows everything... I am given a decision to make, the outcome of which defines the destiny of my soul. Do I accept Jesus as the Redeemer? Does God know what decision I will make? If I don't know the decision I will make until it is made, is it still free will? Maybe I just won't decide. But to be indecisive is to have decided not to believe. So when one decides not to follow Jesus and they keep with that decision until death the soul is condemned to hell. How? Does God create for the sake of creating? I don't like to grill a steak just to chuck it in the garbage without eating it.  Would God create all things in 6 days, rest on the 7th, and continue to rest forever more? I've done such things, though not on quite such a grand scale. I could name a dozen unfinished projects right now.  Is there a God? A Creator? There will never be an answer. A scientist, by proving through experimentation that there is no God, will probably at the same time prove himself to be God. Also disproving the omniscience of God.  And yet, after all this rambling, I'm no closer to knowing who I am, what I believe, or where I am going.
