God knows what we need and what we don't; however, we think we know what we need and we think we don't need God's help in deciding what that is.   God says in this passage that he wants us to be expert builders.  However, expert builders haveto work long, hard hours and often get frustrated.  We don't want to do the work that God has given us because we have our own agendas.   I think it all comes down to prayer.  When we are following God's plan for our lives and not our own God will not always make it easy on us, but he always knows what we can and can't handle.  When these frustrating times come along remember that God is making us expert builders, pray and good things will come out of it.
