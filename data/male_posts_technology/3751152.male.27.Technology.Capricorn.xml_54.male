I don't get up immediately because he's done that before just to annoy me, but then after the second howl I hear this kind of squeaking sound.  I pause and listen wondering what the heck it could be and then it comes to me that maybe he caught a mouse.  I get up, he's still meowing, and walk into the hall and there is this poor cute little bird!!!    I couldn't believe it.  He actually caught a bird - the poor thing.  I felt so bad yet wanted to also laugh at the cat.  He didn't really hurt it - so it seemed.  I mean, there were a few feathers out and it seemed unable to fly away right away but it also looked like it was completely in shock.  I walk over to the bird and call Adam up from downstairs and Tigger starts meowing all cutely and trying to poke at the bird as if to say "Like the present I brought you?"  So we shoo him away and Adam picks up the bird and we bring it out to the backyard.  What do you do with birds in this instance anyways? Its not like we had a birdcage lying around and could look after it.  We bring it out back and I try to check out its wing - nothing seems to be wrong (no blood).  It chirps, leaps out of Adam's hand and goes under the rhododendron bush.  We figured it well-covered under there, make sure the cats are in and leave it to calm down/sort itself out.    I'm still amazed that that evil little fat bastard caught a bird.  If anything, I thought I'd have a mouse on my floor before a bird but I guess I underestimated him.  What I'm really curious about is how he got it into the house.  I mean if he caught it outside he would have had to put it down, then open the screen door (as I had closed it), then pick it up again and bring it in the house.  Strange  slightly talented kitty.  I blame Beanie - he picked the cat out!!    No worries though - I'm assuming the bird survived and is well - I checked under the bush this morning and it was nowhere to be seen.  I hope it was only in shock and recovered and flew away.  Stupid cat won't even eat chicken cat food and he goes after a bird... sheesh.    Anyways, I actually work today so its about time I went and blow-dried my hair.  Gotta find a dress for the wedding tomorrow too!  Later!
