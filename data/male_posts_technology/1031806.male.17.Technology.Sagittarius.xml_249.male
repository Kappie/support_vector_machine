I've been finding myself doing this a lot lately and I think I've finally figured out why I deprive myself of sleep so often: I don't want to think. When I go to bed, I simply lie there, sometimes for hours, and over analyze every situation from my past or possibilities in the future that I can think of. I'll critique myself over and over again, sometimes focusing for days at a time on the same random event in my past that for some reason has been brought to mind. It's maddening to say the least. I feel like I'm slowly... every so slowly, going insane.  In related news, it would seem that my attention issues are getting steadily worse. I'm prolly going to have to forgo OMTA syllabus this year since I can't get my act together and practice regularly. This saying nothing about my completely failing my junior year... yeah, ain't life jolly?  Oh, one major point of happiness at the moment is that my school's Winter Banquette got cancelled because of the ice, so... I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO AFTER ALL!!!! *dances around*  ...We really should get a band of people together and rent a limo...  O, and there was one other thing that had me pretty happy today but I won't go into it.  And rest assured that I'm working hard to get the hundred or so pics from Vegas up, but it's turning out to be an undertaking of some proportion trying to find the names of all the different $20,000 - $160,000 speakers that I took pics of.  Pics that I've uploaded so far can be found  here .  Appendum: I just read Steven's latest post about not being motivated to do anything, even stuff that he wants to do, so I decided to add this to mine as well: I think that's also a major issue (dang I need a calculator to count all my issues now...) that I'm facing... I'll come home from school and simply sit around, not doing anything... no coding, no reading (I used to LOOOOOOVE reading), no random computer stuff.. I don't really even want to get into bed... I just sorta lose my will to do anything at all and just sit there... and sit there...   God I need help...
