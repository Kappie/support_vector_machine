Thanks to  urlLink Paul Allen  from Infobaseventures for the link.     There are some interesting panel discussions. Just looked through the war between the WIFI and 3G technologies. Came to know about some interesting facts - companies like Tropos Networks using Mesh technologies with technologies such as WiMax can build up a wide area network for a whole city in just 3 weeks. Next year in Asia - WiMAX will be rolled out in some particular cities. It looks to be growing at much faster pace.    The key to all wireless technologies is still - what does a consumer want? What kind of applications - irrespective of any network will provide the kind of mobility a user wants.    The link to all the web casts and the schedule can be had from here .   urlLink http://www.alwayson-network.com/events/index.php
