To make the long story short and sweet, I am living in a new hostel, not as nice as the old one, and I only have two weeks in which to stay here, but that's ok as it will force my ass to find an apartment.  Work has started off very good too.  We are quite busy, but it's fun, and learning lots.  I also got some japanese books for christmas and today just signed up for Japanese class at University of Hawaii here so I am looking forward to that.  Weather is cool at night now, almost enough for a jacket.  Other than that things are good, hoping to find a place soon and start taking classes, and getting back to the beach more and maybe a few more hikes!
