The plan, dubbed the Frozen Ark, is actually a gene bank to preserve the biological details of species. It will hold samples of DNA and tissue at minus 80 Celsius, so as to save their genetic material for ever and give scientists an otherwise lost opportunity to study them. Over 10,000 species of animals are likely to vanish over the next 30 years due to climate change and habitat destruction. Of these, some 33 species are already extinct in the wild, and nearly 1,000 are deemed to be critically endangered.
