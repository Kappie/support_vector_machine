Many listen to music in their cars, their homes even outdoors using discmans or whatever device they prefer. We can’t get enough of it. For many, music has become a drug, a psychological addiction.   And this is the main question of this article…    Is music bad for us ?   Well, firstly, what is music ? Waves, music exists in the form of waves that have been modulated by a device. These waves exist in the form of electronic pulses that travel through a number of other devices, to an amplifier and then to an output device of some kind, such as a speaker.  That’s all very well and good but it still doesn’t help us work out whether music has a possibly negative effect on us or not. Or does it ?  Music is extremely complex. The waveform that our computers and sound reproduction equipment can store and reproduce has an extremely high resolution, meaning that a lot more than a beat, and instrument and a few words can be contained in a small track of sound. A good example of this is Dolby Pro Logic, which can detect encoded tracks in music found on DVDs.   DVDs are encoded with sound tracks that actually have several other sound tracks encoded into the main sound track. This system can successfully carry up to 22 smaller sound tracks in two larger sound tracks, demonstrating the quality of a pair of sound tracks.  ...again, where am I going here ? Well, I’m leading up to an interesting point :P  So, we know our music today is extremely complex, we know the quality is also very high.   And now for the linkage...   We as humans only use approximately 10% of our brain’s capabilities… the rest belongs to our sub-conscious mind which, it has been demonstrated, is able to process subliminal messages where our normal mind cannot or sees nothing.  Our sub-conscious mind can implement ideas and information included in subliminal messages in our lives or our actions, like hypnosis.  An example of this was demonstrated when a movie was edited to have an image of glass with water in it every 25th frame. The audience watching this movie didn’t notice the altered 25th frame, but their sub-conscious mind did, and after a few minutes, at least 85% of the audience got up to get something to drink, almost simultaneously *insert twilight music here*.  It is now possible for subliminal messages to be included in music… simply because the raw quality of the waveforms we listen to are highly complex. It is possible to find these messages in some artists’ music using professional sound editing software. I will not mention names…  Happy thinking !
