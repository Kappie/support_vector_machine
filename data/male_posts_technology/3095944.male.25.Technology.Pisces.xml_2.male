I would sit in front of my PC, fire up my browsers and search for random stuff via any search engine I happen to be on. After doing this for nearly 10 years now, I felt it would be nice to share my discoveries with everyone who cares to check out the cool stuff I happen to stumble upon. Well, this is the venue for that. Welcome to Nowdstuff!
