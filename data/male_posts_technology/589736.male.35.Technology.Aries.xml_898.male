It seems to me we've been leaving the reason for later since 1948.  Which is acceptable, if it has indeed taken these 50+ years to put out the flames (although my amateur eyes don't see the fire getting smaller).  How many years does one fight flames until one can reach the oil flow?  Analogies Amok -- Am I correct in rephrasing that violent terrorists of any kind flourish because there is very little oxygen (economic growth) in the room, and the terrorists supply a half-opened window; and that in this room, everyone else (the mass population) can't breathe clearly, and thus can't think clearly; and that our intent is to force oxygen into the room, thus allowing everyone (the mass population) to breathe easier, which will allow them to gather their wits, and be happy, thus making the terrorists and their little half-opened window irrelevant?
