I think the subway guy might want to hire me, and I think I would have a lot less stress in that sort of job, but I wouldn't be using any of my 1337 h4X0r skills like I use here? I think part of the dilemma would be that I'm not full time here, but subway isn't quite a career type workplace.  I don't know, I'm going back to work. Peace- T
