Watched "Mein Hoon Na" Twice, first at priya on friday night and then at Waves Noida on Satuday afternoon.  BEER, cocktails, and whiskey flowed everyday to keep the Throat wet and spirits high. Friday was definately TGIF, Saturday was at Ruby's Tuesday and Sunday was at PVR and then at Twister, GK.  A lot we all chatted and a lot we all remembered together....  So folks this B-day life was both FUN and Funny together.
