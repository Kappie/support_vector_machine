So if the document from a couple days ago is by him then it needs to be taken seriously.      Justice is done   Los Angeles beat the New England Revolution yesterday in the MLS Cup final, and thank goodness.  As much as I dislike the Galaxy and their ber-whiner Cobi Jones, anything is better than a team that plays like the Revolution.  You've seen my comments there, of course.    The one thing that I absolutely loved, though, about the Galaxy win, was the look of sheer joy on the face of Carlos Ruiz after he put the winning goal past Adin Brown in overtime.  Too often in this league, the foreign players don't seem to be taking the whole thing seriously, like MLS is just something to do to get out of wherever they were playing before.  But the look on Ruiz's face was one of the sheerest outpourings of emotion I've ever seen on an athlete's face... and this was for a U.S. soccer final!  It is SO nice to see the foreigners take this stuff seriously here... big kudos to Ruiz and the Galaxy.    Granted, I hope he doesn't continue that look at Crew Stadium on Thursday when the Crew takes the Galaxy on in the U.S. Open Cup finals, because the Crew needs to win their first trophy!
