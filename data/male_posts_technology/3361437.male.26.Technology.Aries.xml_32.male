Programming in the Brain          I’m staring at source code again.    This time it’s not mine.   I’m  not looking for a flaw.   I’m not  trying to fix something.   I’m just  trying to understand; hundreds of files, thousands of functions, millions of  lines.   I stare at them and I read  them, not line by line.   I skip over  those and glance at declarations.   I  see words stitched together into names with parameters and types.   I’m not sure what they mean yet,  unfamiliar with the pattern.   I  don’t really know what the code inside does, but that’s just details.   I see the names to know who they are,  where they are.   I’m building a  roadmap in my brain.             Soon the code takes shape to me.    It might have been hours or days, but eventually it is there.   I can now feel the code, a sensory  perception on the periphery of what is real.   I know how the code is defined, what its  facets look like, where they are placed.    I scroll through the files once more, seeing them again, like photographs  of old friends.   I look into each  and see references to others.   Look,  there’s that same little guy.   He’s  over here too.   I don’t know why,  but now I see how.   The code becomes  three dimensional, linked together in a graph, woven together like a tapestry;  function upon function, hierarchical and ordered.              It’s only now that I begin to understand what it is that  the code actually does, a portrait forming in my mind, full and complete.   I had some idea going in, but that was a  base perception, a rough image painted with broad strokes.   Now I see the details, the intricacy, the  patterns and the truth.   I walk  through the code and feel it react.    I know where it is going and I know where it’s been.   I don’t need a machine to tell me  this.     It happens all inside my head as I sit in  the car driving to and from work, as I shower in the morning, as I lay awake at  night.                  But that's just  me.
