At school, I would always be trying my best to do some silly thing to make her crack up. She has a very nice smile too.   Fredz (A.K.A. Madam X) is my internet best friend cause I see and / or talk to him almost every single day on MSN. I would say that it's one of my oldest and dearest friendships. =;-D         urlLink Sailor Ecchi
