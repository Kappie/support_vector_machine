I still do repairs, and I still do case modding (think cold cathode BLUE! lights and fans, and I still do Linux, and I still offer 24/7 tech support for a really fscking' reasonable price, and I still think you should see me before  being screwed by  buying from Dell, and I still think that PC manufacturers suck, because I guarantee my work for life. Not parts, but I'll try. So please, SHOP FORT COLLINS FIRST!!
