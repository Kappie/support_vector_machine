I'll be working at the  urlLink Microelectronics Research and Communications (MRC) Institute  in the Evolutionary Computation Lab.  I don't really know what I'll be doing, but from their website, it looks rather interesting.  Hopefully, I'll gain some good experience that will help my future career as a computer programmer.
