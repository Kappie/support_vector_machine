Instead, I'd pulled my money out to buy the car.  Oh well.  Oh yeah, it's also up on high volume - 10M shares traded today, currently up .58, trading up 20%.  Up on high volume usually means good things.  I've heard before that precedes price.  The big question is whether it closes near the high for the day, and whether the volume continues at it's current rate.  If the price and volume drop off near the end of the day, the tomorrow doesn't look as good.  In the meantime, other stocks aren't moving much, and RCO is down .02.  Green day overall so far, though.
