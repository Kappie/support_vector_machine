I dont't agree because the poor cat was deprived of a bird and a mouse today so he deserves some treats.  Today was fun.....all about the slip and sliiiide and we saved a bird from Max..hah So.,..Kristen and Co. took over Craigs and Scrub Scrub Scrubtorious's living quarters so I am therefore forced to share a bed with Yastine...but at least we'll have the bliiiiiizard which is clutch because Autumn is 90 degrees inside :( Ok, well i dont really have anything else interesting to say....so fuck you....fuck you....you're cool...fuck you..im out!  A-funk  P.S. The mouse's name is Shmee
