I have a wife (Rita) and 4 kids:: Russell is 18 and at the moment living w/ his Mom in Indiana..But she is a really worthless piece of shit and Russell is beginning to see this 1st hand and is thinking about coming back to Md to live... Jon is 17 now ..he thinks that the world revolves around him...he is a good kid (besides being a lazy ass teen ager... Bobby Jr...HE is a good kid..always does what i want him to do and is very helpful...he may not have the booksmarts that his brother Jon does, but he is a very "hands on kid"...Bobby is bright in his own way Brittany...10 years old now...my only little girl...maybe this is why my feelings for her are different...she is the typical little girl...loves barbies and polly pockets..enjoys cheerleading and riding her new bike  Ok, all this being said, I would do anything for my wife Rita...she is my friend..I don't hate her..but I don't feel that "spark" that we once had...it's more like someone that ya'd take bowling on Friday night than someone ya' take to a fancy resturant for a candle light dinner (not that there's anything wrong w/ bowling)...Rita is very "cold" ...not very personal or intimate..this pretty much drives me crazy...she will cry at the drop of a hat when ya try to offer a suggestion or correct her (that always plays on my conscience)...when we first dated, we were very "touchy-feely" and romantic but now it seems like holding hands is even a chore...I love my wifes hair...it's long and silky and so soft to the touch...i used to love to sit for hours while we watched tv and run my fingers thru it, but no more...now it seems if we are even watching tv in the same room, we sit on opposite ends of the couch...when we sleep, she used to lay on my chest...and we always used to kiss, but very seldom anymore...seems like the only time we kiss is when one of us is trying to get the other ready to "fuck" (which happens few and far between)... The only reason that I can find in my twisted warped little mind to Stay w/ Rita is the kids...brittany in particular...I am her sun and her moon...night and her day...I can't have my little girl growing up thinking i am a dickhead oh well, gotta go for now...more later
