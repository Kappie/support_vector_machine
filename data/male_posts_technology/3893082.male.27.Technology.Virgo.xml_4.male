You see, I work for a large corporation, 14k+ people, as a Helpdesk Technician.  That means that their are 14k+ people that rely on me and my co-workers to keep their computers working for them.    Today, our computer systems and network decided that they would all go on vacation and this left everyone wondering why it is they can't view their email or find their files or who is this weird email from or blah blah blah blah blah.  This wouldn't have been an issue if we had more than 6 people to support everyone!    Unfortunately, we have to escalate our system outages, notify management of the outages, answer email's about the outages, document the outages in our helpdesk software, and continue to take calls and help people with their every day tasks that they are having problems with.    Honestly, none of this bothers me.  I am a work-a-holic and if I am not busy I tend to fall asleep! :-) That and I really do enjoy helping people with their problems.  What pushed me over the edge today was all of the questions I had to answer for my co-workers because they weren't sure what to do for most of their calls.      Again, this is usually not a problem, but for some reason today, everyone was very impatient today.  If I didn't answer their question within 5 seconds they asked it again, and again, and again...  Of course, I would finally answer them but only after I finished the call I was on.  This, of course, tended to piss them all off and make them even more whiny.    Oh well, guess we can't all be perfect! HA!  I'm definitely no were near being close to perfect.  If there is even such a thing!      Blog at ya'll later...
