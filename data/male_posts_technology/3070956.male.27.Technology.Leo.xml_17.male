LOTS of Tequila ...LOTS. Man, we had SOOO much fun - I was totally out of control. But, not a regret - it was a great time. No hangover today. Not even a little. So... either that Tequila has something really good going for it, or... I didn't drink that much.Whatever happenned, I got more drunk-feeling than I have in months!  sigh    Brad would've won a prize... urlLink      ...and I was a whore of a social butterfly...     urlLink    urlLink      Dana (in the pink above) actually flashed for one of the pictures, but then I found out she erased it. Oh well. Not like I would've posted it anyway... unless she wanted me to, hehe.   Angie is friends with our friend Lisa. They are so fun! These pictures are of me and Angie, and then Scott with Angie and Lisa. Angie is related to one of the owners.     urlLink         For some reason, I was being encouragedto slap this guy's ass. hahaha...     urlLink     These girls were fortunate enough to be around me atmy peak... they were lots of fun, too. I think Chis and I were... talking to them, hahaha... uugh.     urlLink     After the shenanigans, Alan, Lisa, and I took off to sober up at Primanti Bros.     urlLink
