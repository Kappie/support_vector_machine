The Repugnicans take a few shots ("He's inexperienced", "He's a trial lawyer") which land nowhere.   And what happens next?  Why naturally the Administration announces yet another extremely vague yet somehow "credible" terrorist threat perhaps/maybe/probably/your-guess-is-as-good-as-mine aimed at disrupting the upcoming elections.  Coincidence?  Okay, so here is your homework assignment: first, divide yourselves up into pairs.  The first person is to collect whatever polling data they can tracking Bush the Younger's popularity since 9-11, keeping their sources consistent (compare Zogby to Zogby, ABCnews to ABCnews, or even Fox to Fox) and noting the dates of each significant dip; the second person will chronologically sort all "terrorist threat" announcements from both the Justice Department and the Office of Homeland Security.  What do you expect we'll find?  I may be wrong but I've got a strong suspicion already.
