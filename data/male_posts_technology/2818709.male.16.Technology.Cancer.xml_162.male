So, i asked adam to put on headphones,  because he was playing Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow. I wasnt going to ask him to stop, because even I wouldn't have stopped playing. But, he mocked me. "blahbhabhaha!" in that stupid sassy tone. I asked again, he sassed again. I gave up, because i knew that i could get him back later.  My dad came in at like 11:00, because HE could hear it, too. Everyone that has been to my house, my door was closed, and HIS door was closed. That's how loud it was. It wasn't me just being an ass. It was adam always having to make it be "his way". Adam STILL wouldn't turn it down. My dad walked away, because he would have beat the shit out of adam, and no one wants that. He stopped playing at about 11:30. Fucker. He said "You dont always get it your way, nick." ...i never get my way. Adam's always has it his way. Always. Maybe i'll put a password on the comp tomorrow. That'd be nice.  Better yet, i'll give him a guest account. And the password will be "dumbfuck". Meh, he wont even see it coming. I really dont care what the folks do. It's my computer. I'll do whatever the fsck i want to do with it. He'll take away the xbox in revenge, i'm sure. Do i care? no. I have Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. I havnt beat it on easy or hard yet. I'll do that. Maybe the little ass will decide that he'll spend some money, for once. he's the biggest cheapskate ever. He has about $500. For some reason, he doesnt ever spend it on anything. He constantly complains about the headset for the xbox, and yet he wont go spend the $20 for a new one.   Adam is an ass. He will pay for his crimes. ph33r m4 wr4th.   [I want a socom.]
