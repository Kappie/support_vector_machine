How about ensuring that no-one will ever bother to talk to you over just $22?  Ok, I know that for a lot of people that might seem like a lot of money.  But what if the guy involved drives a Mercedes, has a rich wife, and a reasonably high paying job?  If it were you, would you allow just $22 to set your name in mud?  I know I wouldn't.  But obstinance is a terrible character flaw that dooms you to commit some pretty stupid acts, simply because it makes you blind to the finer points of reality.  Ok, so what about the $22.  What's it all about?  The company runs a footy tipping competition.  It costs $2 a round to enter for a total of 22 rounds.  All up that's $44, which for the sake of those short on dollars, the footy tipping gods allow you to pay in two installments.  One at the start of the competition, and one half way through.  They even give a bit of leeway, allowing tardy payments of installments.      Well, the gods were bitten this week.      You see, we are long into the second installment and someone is refusing to pay.  When asked why he said he didn't want to as he had no chance of winning the competition.  This would be a fair argument, except that for the last 7 rounds he's stood a decent chance of winning the pool for getting all 8 games right in a round.  It's like someone getting a lotto ticket, not winning, then refusing to pay for the ticket because they can't win.  He's also caused the footy tipping gods some grief.  You see, the final pool is based on the number of people entered.  Also, the weekly prize pools have been overpaid because of the payment refusal.  The gods are not happy about this at all.  Personally, I don't enter footy tipping competitions.  No good can come from them.  But for those who do enter, not paying your dues is one of the seven deadly sins.  The other six involve cheating, winning, and baracking for Collingwood.  Ultimately though, the lesson here is not to be obstinant.  You should always analyse the situation at hand.  Is it really worth becoming an outcast over a pittance?  Here's hoping none of you guys ever commit social suicide..   ... or barack for Collingwood.
