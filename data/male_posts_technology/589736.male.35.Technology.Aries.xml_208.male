Where is the outrage / moral indignation / "see we told you meat was bad" related to the 18  MILLION  pounds of beef that have been recalled for e-coli contamination?  Heck, I am a sworn omnivore, and I think it is an extremely wasteful thing to have slaughtered all those cows for absolutely no benefit to anyone.
