A long time ago. Back when I was in highschool.. this 'internet' thing started getting quite popular, in Rotorua we didnt have many local BBS's to call , so our modems were relagated to $5 weekend calling people around the country to play modem to modem games. Nerds. But I digress, I started using the internet sometime during my 6th form year, when wave internet launched in Rotorua, and shortly before Voyager started offering internet in rotorua. Back then, 36k dialup was the same price as 256k dsl. Madness. There was a glitch in the voyager sign-up cd, where you could link out of it to browse the web without having an account.. that was leet.. but anyway... IRC.. I started on irc after my still good friend john showed me it.. back then you could list the people online, and it'd take like 10-15 minutes to list EVERYONE on IRC, and back then there werent a thousand different servers.. new zealand had its own server.. and I think it was all dalnet. There werent many kiwis online, and if there were, they were probably pencil-neck geeks.. and quick as a flash I learnt that spading american and dutch chicks was largely a waste of time, unless they had the money to come visit me. My first nickname on the internet was Kermit_ with the underscore because someone already had kermit. Ahh well.. the underscore came to represent all sorts of deeper philosophical enhancements to the name.. I used to hang out in a channel called #nz.. everybody did.. it was the done thing. The first person I met from IRC was a good looking blonde teenage girl called Kate, who lived in tauranga.. about an hours drive from rotorua.. they turned up (her and her friend) to meet me on new years eve.. and sadly I'd already committed to going away to stay with a couple of my female friends in a caravan, at a beach. Nevermind. The second IRC people I met, werent untill later, till I'd moved to auckland, to st heliers to be specific. The first Auckland IRCr I met was ..a cute blonde teenage girl... are we sensing a trend here yet? by the name of becky, who lived just around the corner. Her friend amberleigh, was also hot.. I'm getting off the track here.. um.. MyOldSock... at school in 7th form some of the guys were being dicks and phonetically sounding out their names with other words.. like Kyle Spiers became My Old Pliers.. when I came to pick a new nickname, that stuck in my head so I went 'hmm, cant use -his- that'd be unoriginal, so I changed pliers to sock and tada.. boring huh? since then I've had all sorts of deep philosophical reasons that I've told people, to either hook up with them, or impress them. It's great.. now I'm world famous on irc, cant possibly change it aye? cept to maybe SlookyDMC - which is the letters reorganised.. courtesy of MiJiT, from #auckland on the undernet.  Chur.
