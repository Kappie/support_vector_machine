I can never comprehend The beauty it reveals, in full,   But I know this much; It appeals to many,  But to none so much As the One who created it all.  Of fire and ice, Of wind and rain; Destruction and death, Desires profane. I see them augmenting  The beauty here That was displayed within. Hidden for a while  When filled with sin. But this is not the end.  Of fire and ice, Of wind and rain, Revivals revitalize The hidden, the slain. For in death and destruction,  Life is brought forth To rule and reign o’re All the earth. So, unto the end of ages, And onward, still,  He prevails.
