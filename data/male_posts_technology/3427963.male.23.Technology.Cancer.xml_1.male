Never expect any reply from her lah so jus lie in bed about to sleep lor then out of sudden, kena shocked by my phone ringing sound. Cos its always very quiet in my rm so wont expect any sudden noise lah. wokened up by the phone lor, its her.  " wei, u going to sleep soon? cos i going down stair for a jog", she claimed at ard 11+pm " huh, go joggin at this time? u crazy ah?" i answered. " no lah very sian anyway can i call u back after my jog?" she asked. " ok lor, jus give me a call lah when u finish" i replied. actually i damn tired liow cos had a sumptious steamboat dinner wif my colleagues and so damn filling. went back to sleep when she called my hp. i rejected the call and used my rm phone to call her. chatted til 1 plus and she ask me to give her a morning call in the morning. Well, glad she still alive lah cos she ahsnt realli been responding to my smses. Dun know lah.....she need to wake up a bit lah!!  very tired, dun even know wat i'm typing liow. Need to sleep soon if not tomolo morning cannot wake up liowz. Well wat i can say is no matter how tired i am, i still wont mind if she call me in the middle of the nite one cos i realli miss her that much. Miss her smile, miss her voice, miss her everything lah. Maybe i'm too obsessed wif her. Fwah! cannot, muz do sumthing bout it liowz....this cant go on.....hmmmm...any suggestions??  cheers, Teddy
