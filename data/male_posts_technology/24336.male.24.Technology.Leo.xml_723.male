Oh lo', you said that v5 would be the best of v2 and the best of v3 combined!  All I get is crash after crash after crash.  DELETED!  iTunes for me for life, or until something better comes along.  

UPDATE:  So I go to uninstall Winamp and the uninstall program freezes my system!  I force-reboot (no, not a Jedi power) and try again.  It takes four minutes for the uninstall UI to come up.  Once the app uninstalled, it crashed explorer (not IE), requiring another reboot.  Bah!
