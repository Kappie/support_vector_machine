For all we know, we could be in someone's(God's) dream. He/She wakes up some day, our existence is totally annihilated, the point is you don't know. You can't know whether or not you're doing anything, a butterfly in brazil triggers a rainstorm in Norway, it's all bullshit. Rock's shit, death is the end? Nihlist? We believe in nothing. Cahlen, you're so full of shit, I can't even look at you.  This'll be a point where we have to just respect each other's opinion and not force our beliefs on one another:)  As far as making your own problems, you said yourself you do, in the sentence after you said you didn't. Worrying about what other people think is bullshit, yet, if you worry about that, you are creating that problem. It has nothing to do with the outside world. It's us, fucking up our own lives.  ARGH! Oh well, check out these blogs I found today, I think they kick ass!   Sunday Hero    Prostitute Laundry
