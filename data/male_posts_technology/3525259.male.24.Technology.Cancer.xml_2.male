Louisville --> Freshman Dorm Freshman Dorm --> Louisville Louisville --> Frat House Frat House --> Arbor Hills Arbor Hills --> Frat House Frat House --> Caliber Woods Caliber Woods --> Frat House Frat House --> Arbor Hills Arbor Hills --> Arbor Gates Arbor Gates --> Gables Montclair Gables Montclair --> Virginia Avenue House  10/11 of these moving days were done using friends, a uhaul truck, or some other form of do-it-yourself option where I had to lift chairs, boxes, desks, all that shit... tons of shit every time. FINALLY i wised up and paid for 3 movers to come help me move out. Now, I dont have a ton of shit.... i actually have never really had to buy furniture sets besides my bedroom stuff. I could have done it myself, it would have been slightly cheaper. But the reason I agreed to get movers is because I would have to move my shit plus Katzs shit and who the hell wants to endure that misery again. (our old place had 3 flights of windy stairs)  So the movers show up at 9 am on sunday...stellar. rainy weather, this is getting so much better. here is what they basically look like:
