I'm just disappointed that I did miss some lessons and I can't remember a lot of the things I was taught, especially weapons work.  If I could just understand things better, I might be able to practice weapons at home. But ...  Anyway, I did meet a lot of nice people (and a crappy one) at the camp. I'm glad on the whole, I still enjoyed everything.  I do have some wishes though ... wished Gary was training there as well (hope you're reading this dude   haha).  Tommorrow will be my first day in camp. I have to get used to wearing uniform again. Not a problem though.
