Well for the first time in memory  urlLink VeriSign  have done  urlLink something good .   This couldn't come at a better time for me. I'll be switching all my sites over to my new DNS servers very soon and this just makes it that much less painful. Nice work VeriSign, course you should have done it ages ago.
