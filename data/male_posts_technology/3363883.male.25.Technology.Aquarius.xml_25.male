I stuck my hand up and pointed out that they’ve explained how to install, configure, fix, cluster deploy etc….. the software but not actually what the hell it does. I wasn’t expecting quite the cold attitude I received.  Then again, the instructors were German. It probably wasn’t efficient to let me know during the course.    So apart from the bloody difficult course, the hotel I decided to stay in wasn’t much better. I was told that the company would pay for expenses but to try and keep it on the cheap-ish side. No problem. I found a hotel that would set me back about £26. I forgot that this means NOTHING in London. My single sh*ty bedroom was cracked and the window wouldn’t close properly. I’m not sure which was my favourite part, finding that my ensuite was in fact the whole floors bathroom AND it’s only soap was so mouldy it could have been blue cheese; OR finding lots of hairs in my bed when I pulled the dooner back meaning the bed had been made but the sheets not changed.    Real Quality.    But you put up with it. It was worth it [almost] for the rest of the weekend. I caught up with a great Australian friend in London, Kerry. Top bloke. He’s one of those guys that you instantly are relaxed around and feel confident in yourself because he wouldn’t expect anything less from you. Really sound guy. It’s always too long between seeing each other.    He is also one of the craziest drinkers I think I’ve ever seen.  I was hoping to have a quieter weekend with him after the last weekend.    No such luck.    I met him at his work, the BBC, and we went into one the bars in there for some decent priced beers. By the time we left, we were ticking over nicely. We met Kerry’s new girlfriend, Merrily, and another couple at Belgo which is a special Belgium restaurant in Covent Garden. Sitting down with some great surf’n’turf and a couple of glasses of Duval [9%] later, we were ticking over nicely. The girls wanted something sweet for desert. I’m not such a big fan of sweets when I’m drinking so I let Kerry talk me into have a depth charge which involved putting a shot glass of gin in another duval.  It’s at this point things started to get untidy.    We scraped ourselves up and walked over to the Lowlander which is a Dutch/Belgium pub also in Covent garden. Among the beers consumed were SATAN. Tasted so bad it was good. Also, it came in with glasses with SATAN imprinted on them. Fantastic. Well, I had to get a couple just for myself didn’t I? You can’t give up an opportunity like that.    I’d like to thank Kerry for letting me keep them as well. As he pointed out, he can get more whenever he needs.    Saturday morning was a bit slower but by the time it was midday I had made a move into the centre of London. I decided it was time for a musical and made it to see Phantom of the opera. This is the first time that I went and saw an opera that I had already once seen before.    --aside--  I took an old girlfriend to see it when it was being performed in Adelaide. It was one of those crazy big events that I organised for my first love. Funny. It was the first big thing I’d ever organised for someone I really care about. I still remember that on Thursday 20th March 1997, I picked Debb up at 5:40 at her place; took her to the ritziest restaurant in Adelaide [Lenzerheide]; then it was off to the theatre for Phantom. We were FRONT row a little bit on the side; after that it was to the Grande in Glenelg for a beach view and a beautiful night in. It was a very special time for me [and I like to think Her]. Funny how some things won’t leave your mind, no matter how long ago they were.  --End of Aside—    Well, I can easily say that the Australian production was a MILLION times better. Everything was superior, from the acting to the lighting and sound. I still enjoyed it very much and was definitely entertained, but it was interesting to compare it to what a fresh group of performers in Australia would do.    After that, I went and did some discount shopping at French Connection with Kerry, picking up some nice clothes and then went to Merrily’s house for a cocktail party.    What was it like? Good. I convinced Merrily the night before to get a blender for the cocktails. We did all kinds of crazy drinks, starting with Melon Margaritas and then WooWoos. Eventually, it came down to doing everything and then making up some more new cocktails. I think I managed to excel. With the aid of Kerry’s mate, Robo who came up with the names we did the following drinks:    Purple People Eater: Casis, Vodka, Peach Schnapps, Lemonade  Yellow Submarine: Vodka, Gin, bacardi, passion fruit juice  White Christmas: Coconut Milk; Rum ; Peach Snaps.    All of the above included Ice.    Fortunately, every cocktail included a great deal of ice. This meant that while we got pretty damn toasted that evening we were continually being hydrated. End product? No hangover whatsoever. We went to bed at about 4 and were up again at 9 cleaning up without any sore heads. Happy days.   Still. Sunday was a VERY long day of me waking up and helping clean up Merrily’s flat. Then it was a way long haul home to find that Debb’s was kind enough to cook up a big f*ck off dish of fish and potato. While the food was good, I felt very guilty as I managed to miss the name of a great friends’ first child. I’m sorry Neil. I left at the first good opportunity and it was still [way] too late. London is a horrible place to get in and out of at any time, but if there’s a reason to get out/in, you’re in trouble.
