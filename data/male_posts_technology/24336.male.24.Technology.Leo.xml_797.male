I received my invitation through Blogger, but now that I am a user I can invite two more people!  The first two to contact me get dibs.  (Note:  If you ask via email, I only check once a day and thus it would be faster to txt/IM/call me.  If you email me right away yet I get two phone calls after your email was sent, you ain't getting GMail from me.)
