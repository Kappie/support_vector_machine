In May, I started seeing a girl, and 3 months later we're still going strong and only missed one day without seeing her...that's a different story...the point here is that I neglected my friend for that amount of time because I assumed he didn't want me around. It's those types of things I hate about myself...assuming and then remourse. The thing is, it never matters if we miss one day or one year apart, we always act the same way around each other...plus there was other things going on that I didn't know about that he was dealing with.  It's funny how after a welcoming hug...and him rubbing my ass(non-gay)...we're back to talking about whatever we did before like I was just there the previous night. I guess sometimes you have to be away from someone awhile to truely appreciate them...nothing can ever take the place of many Everquest/N64 Griffey sessions.  I laugh sometimes when I go see him on Mondays and we watch wrestling...We're so unentertained during it, but we watch it anyways...I think it's more or something going on while we visit rather than we watch it...I think the most entertaining thing I saw on WWE was when Scott Steiner fell of the mat and smashed his face...Fucking Hell that was hilarious...I still have it taped.  We met in the 10th grade...funny how almost all my friends I knew before then ended up being childish dicks that never appreciated things in life other than whorish girls, beer, and...well...ok...nothing past those two things.  I have another friend that I see about once every five months...it's not so much that he's annoying and I don't want to see him, but crap, I don't feel like taking off work on a Friday to drive 5 hours to watch him smoke a joint with about 8 of his friends that I don't know...He actually invited me to go camping with him and 10 unknown people...cause he had a pound of weed and a keg...wow, the drunken 16 year old in me was mildly excited...is it a bad thing to rather want to stay home and play Warcraft 3 rather than do that? I say yes cause it would have 1.) been a sausage party, and 2.) been so damn boring I would have been trying to channel my thoughts to a computer to play a little Warcraft 3...and I'm pretty sure 5 of the guys with him were not of the American citizenship...far be it from me to think Escobar wasn't born in donkey filled adobe home, but the lack of English speaking skills kinda tipped me off. Made me think...hmmmm...there's somthing fishy about how he can't understand a damn word I say!!!!  I miss my friend...the old way he was...a horney kid who was my friend...but he's quickly becoming just a guy who you went to school with.
