It strikes me that placing a top security pass in a box of morning cereal is NOT common behaviour and I do not think I will be able to speak to her anymore for fear of being cut up and placed in a bag of Findus frozen peas or something!!!  Anyway, for anyone who is interested in a new hobby I call 'S.H.I.T. - Special Hats In Trucks' here is a photo of my lastest hat invention...     Baity signing off..... (may have to go to the doc again!!!)  'Into Glory Ride'
