I know no HTML!!" Please, please,  please,  can we change it? Umkay? Umkay!  Right-o, next order of business. My diary was deleted last night. A year, 306 pages, 3445 notes, 159 entries, of my life was deleted by someone who couldn't punctuate a single sentence to save her life. I didn't do a thing but cry. Lord, how I cried. All last night, sporatic periods of today, and then when I went onto TOD today and realized that it really wasn't there. But then, I did the right thing for the first time in my life today. There were girls, girls that I actually think may have done it to me, that I cracked, destroyed, and nearly deleted sometime in November. So, I got into it today, and I remade it. I apologized to the people that, more likely than not, did this to me. I've never done what can be called "the right thing" before, but I feel really good about it.   I guess the only thing I really don't understand is that, if I was nice enough to do this, why is it that I was enough of a bitch to be called a communist, an internet whore, and then to be deleted? Who have I ever been that mean to? Ablah. Nu, I've started over, and so therefore I will not dwell on the past. *Nods* See? I'm like a walking, talking self-help tape! Whee!  I...have nothing more to say other than..."What? You want to buy ugly pants?" Have a nice evening, all. Please, drink plenty of coke and stay off the roads. They're full of hobos and hookers this time of night. Really! Love you!   Because one random person just isn't enough...
