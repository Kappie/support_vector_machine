Trying to view the net in shades of yellow will kill your eyesight for at least an hour for every 5 minutes of surfing.  It was a nice flat screen 17 inch NEC, but I got it used without a warranty.  $350 will disappear from my wallet soon.  I am currently using a 14'' POS, and 14 inches is not enough to satisfy.
