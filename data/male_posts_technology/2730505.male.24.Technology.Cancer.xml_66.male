I finally have some sort of path to follow in terms of growing out of my position into another one and take even higher level responsibilities.  For a second there I have been thinking that I was just being taken for granted but it's good to know that people do appreciate your work and the work you put into things and return the favor, if I may say so, appropriately.  Recognition is one of the  things that make things worth it for me.  Recognition (per Maslow) is one of the things that is a need for humans.  There are the physiological and safety needs that are already there for me.  Now I find myself in need of higher level needs.  Belonging, Self esteem, and Self Actualization.  I guess the raise falls under the Self esteem umbrella in that it is some form of recognition in my professional life.  It feels good to be recognized and appreciated for what you have done and what you are trying to do.  I think everyone needs that in some shape, way or form as well as enjoys it.  I mean really, who doesn't appreciate a good pat on the shoulder?  I also got my tax return back.  I don't know what the fuck happened to it though.  I deposited the thing and only half of it showed up in my account.  WTF?  The receipt printed the exact amount that I had entered and that was on the damn check but I checked this morning and it's not the same.  I don't know.  Speaking of which, I should call the fucking back to see what the hell is going on.  Anyways, just wanted to share my little victory/achievement to whoever is out there.
