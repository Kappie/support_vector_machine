Watched Stargate SG1 and Stargate Atlantis and Played Rainbow Six 3.  Lots of Holla holla there.  Stargate is such a good show I don't know why not a lot of people watch that thing.  I guess I'm just such a big scifi geek I can't get enough of it.  I'll even watch episodes that I've seen numerous times.  From the Gould, Sagard, Replicators, Nocks to the new formidable foe in Atlantis called the Wraith, yeah, it's going to be a good season.    Saturday spent the day with the family.  Got drunk with them.  I went home and showered and changed and waited for Vicki and Carol to show up.  Wow, this is the first time I met Carol and she's a damn fine red head.  Vicki was also looking good but I don't think she looks bad ever (at least I haven't seen her look bad).  We went to the party at Da Beach and waited for everyone.  It was a good time.  Let's see, people who were there were Me, Vicki, Carol, Inbred, Drift with Bobbi and Emily, Mark and Patti, Blade, Tom, vito, Helen and friend, Phil with more than a few friends, room mates and friends.  It was a good time.  It was packed when the free shit was going on but it thinned out right after the free shit stopped.  We then went to Phil's house for a little after party and Derek came out to meet us out there.  After that we just went home.  Good birthday but I really felt older than I ever have.    Sunday was a boring day.  I just hung out at my parents house and just bummed out.  That night though Emily was supposed to call me so we can go out but she didn't so I called Derek and he didn't have work monday so we went and saw I,Robot.  Good movie, not very deep but visually spectacular.  We went back to his place and played a lot of Rainbow six 3.  I got used to the Big TV and I sucked when I got home.    Monday was grocery shopping day for me as well as the room mates.  Shit, everyone bought food and the fridge is packed to the hilt of crap.  Just bummed around all day after that, payed some bills and played.    It was a boring but not really boring weekend.  This weekend I think Emily will be coming down going out to see a movie and maybe even dinner.  Not quite sure yet.  can't go out too late Saturday since I got work on Sunday and that's going to be a long day. probably a 10 hour day Sunday.  Eh, that's a short version of the weekend.  Too much shit to do at work to type more.     have a good one everyone.
