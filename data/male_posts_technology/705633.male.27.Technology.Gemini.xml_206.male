Last week I was with one of my summer interns in the lobby when a receptionist complained that her printer wasn't working. The intern discovered a pen stuck inside the printer. He started to jam his fingers down to the printer to get the pen, but I told him we didn't have time for that now, just put a note on the printer telling folks not to use it and then report it to the Help Desk. So he grabs a piece of paper and starts scrawling on it. I left before he finished the note.   About 20 minutes later, one of my techs comes in and says he was just in the lobby, saw a piece of paper on a printer and went to investigate.   The picture below is what he found.. sometimes things don't always come out the way they were meant to...
