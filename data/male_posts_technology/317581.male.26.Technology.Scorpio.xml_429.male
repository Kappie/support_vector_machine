Perhaps it is misconceptions, or maybe I am just a scary person.  What does it mean to be christian? What does it mean to be set apart? Is there something that says that boys and girls can't be friends? Even if there is sexual tension, what about the possibility of giving up on sex for the better good of keeping a friend?  I wish to be a salve that can take pain away and allow wounds to heal, but I cannot, if I am not allowed. Perhaps there is more than just that. I find great comfort in comforting others.  I know that looks matter. And I wish they didn't. I need help in the dressing department, as I don't think I dress myself well. And the female friends I have tend to agree with that.  Well, I gotta run, catch you on the flip side-
