You have to be powerful enough to stop war, because if you're weak you can't stop war. And Budo has that yin and yang, it has that Tate to yoko no ito, izu no mitama to mizu no mitama. There are all Shinto terms. Yoko no ito means moon, feminine, water, love, the power of forgiveness, the power of love. Tate no ito means sun, we talk about masculine, we talk about fire, we talk about the power of decision. That is the time when you don't forgive, that is the power to cut."   -- Steven Seagal, 7th dan, Shihan, Shinto priest
