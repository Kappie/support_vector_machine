I have been reading in 2 Timothy today - a small but significant letter - the last one of the Apostle Paul - languishing in a prison dungeon      Verse 8: So do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord, or ashamed of me His prisoner. But join with me in suffering for the Gospel by the power of God      Lord, make me bold for Your Name's sake - the world takes pride in such shameful acts - why should I not take pride in the most wonderful Person in the universe? Can I thank you enough for all Your love      What a relationship!
