And I don't like living like that. I just want to hibernate and get away from everything.  (Maybe I shouldn't say God's hand, although I do believe in God's sovereignty, it seems that he is allowing our family to undergo many trials)  Well anyway, I'd like to register my sincere disapproval if that counts. I know it's meant to be good for you, but right now it feels very not good.  ok thats me for today.
