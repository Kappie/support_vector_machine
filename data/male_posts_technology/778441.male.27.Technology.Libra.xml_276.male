Dr Hans Blix said the secret info they gave didn't help him find any evidence that Saddam Hussein was developing illegal weapons. ...  Dr Blix said his team went to the places which were supposed to contain weapons - but they found nothing. ...  "Only in three of those cases did we find anything at all, and in none of the cases were there any weapons of mass destruction," he said.  This comes when British PM Tony Blair is facing hell about misleading the public over the alleged possession of WMDs by Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. In particular, Blair's pre-war contention that Saddam could launch dooms-day weapons within 45 minutes, has come uder a lot of fire. So much so that Blair is now facing a  urlLink parliamentary probe  over his (mis)handling of intelligence reports about the existence of Iraqi WMDs.  On the other hand US President, George W Bush, has managed to steer clear of controversies as his popularity ratings have stayed high even as Blair is finding life tough in UK. But the Democrats are slowly drawing their knives out for him.  On a 'thank you' visit to Qatar, Bush  urlLink gave a speech to the troops  stationed there.  Speaking to troops in Qatar, Bush suggested it shouldn't be surprising that no such weapons have been found, despite the fall of Saddam's regime and the presence of coalition forces in Iraq for more than two months.   "This is a man who spent decades hiding tools of mass murder," Bush said. "He knew the inspectors were looking for them. You know better than me he's got a big country in which to hide them. We're on the look. We'll reveal the truth."   Also,  urlLink BBC reports ...  Greg Thielman, who was until September 2002 a top official in charge of non-proliferation and strategic affairs in the US state department's intelligence bureau, has expressed doubt over the objectivity of the US evidence presented to the world.   "Evidence has been distorted and the public has really been misled on issues that helped inform the decision about war and peace," he told the BBC's Today programme.
