Corrine Brown went on that well-documented tirade on the floor of the House of Representatives over the 2000 election, accusing the president, once again, of stealing the election.     It's not the first time she's had a lapse in judgment. In 1998, the House ethics committee reported that she used poor judgment when she accepted gifts from an African businessman.    He had provided lodging for Brown in his luxury Miami condominium. His chief financial officer gave Brown's daughter a $50,000 Lexus automobile. So, it should come as no surprise that she would fixate on 27,000 votes that she feels were illegally thrown out in the 2000 election.    Nor is it a surprise that she would conveniently ignore the fact that thousands of military ballots were tossed out after a protracted court battle by the Gore campaign. Why would she want to consider those votes when they most likely were going to go heavily toward the governor of Texas?    No, she's much more concerned about the felons who may have been prevented from voting, while conveniently ignoring yet another bloc of disenfranchised voters who did not have the chance to vote in the Florida Panhandle.    Those people who were standing in lines across that region of the state, one known for being heavily Republican, gave up and went home when the networks called the election before the polls had closed.     By some accounts, thousands of votes went uncast because of that mix-up. But, that's OK. They were probably voting for Bush.    Brown is an embarrassment to the U.S. House of Representatives, the state of Florida, the city of Jacksonville and the district she represents.    If she put as much effort into serving her district with honor and dignity as she does into fanning the partisan flames of hatred with her campaign of disinformation, we would have one of the best representatives in the country. Instead, we are left with a laughingstock.
