I'm plugged into a wall socket for power, so I'm in no danger of running out of battery, which for some reason is the greatest concern I have at the moment.  (Very nice!)  There's a  Starbucks next door, and I can get a connection via T-Mobile, so I've bought a DayPass for my internet access.  I needed to get to my workstation and the corporate network back at Microsoft, but fortunately, I have a smart card reader and a smart card and thought ahead enough to get the remote access stuff installed.  So, what am I doing with that, besides adding to my blog?  Well, there were some updates I had to submit regarding projects at work that really needed to be in tonight.  And there was a bit of email to reply to, including one sent to me at 2:30pm requesting a 5pm the same day reply (what were they thinking?)  But you know, it didn't seem so bad doing the work, since I was able to have dinner and some drinks at the same time.  I'm now thinking that Ram and I should hold our weekly manager/direct report 1:1 meetings in the evenings at a local hotspot or something.  I've had no problem getting quite a bit of work done, and have enjoyed it a lot more.  I'm on to something here!  Maybe I should just stay in this bar indefinately, and attend meetings via phone.  I wonder how long it would take before anyone realized I never came in the office?  I should ask Robert - he's never in the office, for real.
