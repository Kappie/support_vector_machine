You're not gonna get trolleyed, you have an exam on Monday. Oops. Wtf was that that just went up your nose. Holy hell that burns.  (fast forward 24 hours)  Holy hell I'm still awake what the f*#% was I thinking?!  Blergh.  So then...  Did the stupid project management exam on monday - this would have the distinction of being the ONLY exam that I have not left early on. In fact - it would be the only exam that i've never *@$(ing finished.  I hope that was not related to the EARLIER dalliance.  blah blee bloo. another one tomorrow. then.. it's all over.  I have no money. Woe is I.  :/
