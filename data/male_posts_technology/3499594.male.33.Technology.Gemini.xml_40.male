I was glad to get out and hit the Hotel room. I guess some enjoy to get out and hit the town, run around ect. But I personally much rather sit quitely here and watch a movie in peace.  I will be in training all day tomorrow. We are to be shown a new FTP server and this guy wants to hand the support over to the team. yeah.  I am tired and ready to go home. 2 with 3 nights to go.
