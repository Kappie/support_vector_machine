Very nostalgic, and I'm not really sure where it came from, which I suppose is one of the best times to be nostalgic.  Thinking about the years past, the friends I haven't seen in a few years, the ridiculous shiest we used to do, and could get away with, just because it was us.  "The Mummy", the "Stone Cold Nights", South Park soundtrack nights.  The Rock t-shirt, 5th Floor "Don't be one, eat 'em" T-shirts, Drinking Volume's 1-x, The fridge in the outer room.  Beer Land, 100-cup, random road trips.  Trips to "W" Big M just to get Chicken Finger subs.  Rolling 10 deep in the The Drunk Bus for after the bar trips to Nick Tahoe's just to get Garbage Plates at 3 or 4 in the morning, and then having to drive an hour and a half home.  People jacking the pizza delivery guy after the hockey game, and then splitting up and running to God knows where around campus to not get caught.    As I sit here and ponder all of this and so much more, one word comes to mind.  Invincibility.  We were so popular, and so well liked, we walked around knowing everyone, or at least knowing that everyone knew us.  Basically no matter what we did, no one cared because it was "us".  For those who haven't experienced this feeling, I must admit it's invigorating.  But that leads me back to "us".  What happened to "us"?  "Us", like every great group of friends is bound to be tested at some point.  We're so scattered all over the place, some not even in the country.  Some of my closest have gone off to fight for us, and thankfully they've all returned safely.  If you haven't had a loved one or close friend experience this (in my case both because they're all loved ones) it's a tough concept to grasp.  How do you keep "us" together?  Phone calls, IM's, Road Trips, and weddings seem to popular techniques in our group.  Hey we're getting older, I mean one of "us" is pregnant for God sakes (many congratulations btw!!)!!    So this brings me back to invincibility.  Collectively we were invincible, but does that still hold true as individuals?  Does something like that carry on with you once everyone is scattered?  Do other people notice it?  Do the others feel the same?  I know it's hard to believe that anyone could truly be invincible, however the bond we share makes me think differently.  It's a rare achievement in life, to find a group of friends that you would do anything for, and know they would do anything for you.   Maybe it's exactly that, which makes us invincible.  Love all you guys.   ~J~
