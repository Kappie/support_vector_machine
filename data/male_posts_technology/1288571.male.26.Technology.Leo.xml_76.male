I've got some sort of flu and it kept me up for most of the night. Yay me. I hate being sick, I dunno about the rest of you. Someone out there might go "But you get the day off work!".. true, but I feel guilty about taking sick days. I don't know why.  I actually have some GOOD news though. My ISP has sent me a little note that they're going to be doubling my download speed and increasing my upload speed by 4-5 times!!  All for   FREE   too!  My rating will soon be 3mbps down and 800kbps up.  Oh yea! There is a god :D
