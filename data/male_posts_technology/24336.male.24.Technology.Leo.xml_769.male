All those levels beat, all those new trophies acquired, all those end-bosses defeated...   I needed a console, and fast!  I ended up using my $101 store credit at GameStop to buy a refurbished PS2 with network adapter and another copy of Gran Turismo 3.  I still had my saved game from when Joe and I co-owned a PS2, so I fired that up.  

Last night, I ended up beating all of the rally levels.  I used the same car for all of the levels:  a heavily modified Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VII GSR, putting out about 542 HP.  There are 10 tracks on the rally circuit, 3 races per track and 2, 3 and 5 laps per race.  That means 300 rally laps to complete the entire circuit.  My car couldn't handle as well as most of the rally cars on gravel, but the sheer power got it through those tracks without fault.  On tarmac, the car could handle at least as well as the rally cars and I still had a huge power advantage.  The prize for getting all first places on the 30 different races is the  urlLink Suzuki Escudo Pikes Peak Version .  You'd think a Suzuki would be a horrible prize car, but mine is currently modified to put down 1881 HP!  Top speed is currently 278.9 MPH, nice.
