No mag wheel means the great rotation plan won't work until I get the flat fixed. So now I am driving around with three mags and a spare. :)  But that's ok, I can then get the tire fixed and do the rotation as I replace it. Then I don't have to worry about having uneven tires on the front wheels, as I'll move the current rear tires to the front, maintaining rotation direction, as is recommended for radials. As if I know :) Still, it's good to know I can still change a spare in pretty short time.
