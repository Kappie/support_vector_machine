The guy from my firm,  J_ has called with 'good' news from Michigan - they've probably agreed to everything I wanted - down to less than 50% travel from 100% and a who knows how much more money. Then I'll have to explain to him why I won't take it - which he won't understand. Bottom line is, I'm quitting. I'm coming off the road completely and moving home - for less money - and that's that. It's complicated. And I need to get into a lot of other stuff before it would make sense to anyone. I could say I'm doing it for the family's sake and that would cover about 60% of the reason - and that's probably what I'm gonna tell  J_,   though that won't make much sense to him.   Maybe I'll talk to him tomorrow.
