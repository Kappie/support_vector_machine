On my walk through the woods to work I noticed how a thick over-growth of leaves has enveloped nearly everything. It's interesting as you walk because you quite frequently hear squirrels, and who knows what else, scurrying beneath the underbrush.  Today is hot and muggy. I expected the humidity to be high from what I'd seen on www.weather.com, but I also expected thunderstorms, which as of yet have not shown themselves. It's just a weird lightly foggy haze.  I did get some quality work done. Although, I'm still unsatisfied with the quantity.  Spent several hours replying to a very short email from Kristi, the details of which I'll keep between her and myself.
