The commercials are what really draw me in. Plus the idea of what should be a really kickin half-time show.   Well.. for some reason the phrase "purple horse shoes, green clovers, silver sun nipple rings" popps into my head.    I'm already being told that my finding what Jan*t Jacks*n and Justln Tim*rlake did as inappropriate, was the wrong way to feel.  But, JJ and JT took the right of parents away from all around the world, who were watching the show, that just MIGHT not have wanted their children to see that.    I wouldn't have an issue with it if it would of been on Pay-Per-View, or regular cable type channel.  By doing it that way, they would of been required to put a TV Rating code on it.  It was inappropriate, pure and simple, just as thats simply my opinion of it.  Right or wrong, my view is that it's wrong.  Plus the dancers sort of  , whom if you paid attenion, were wearing mini-skirts, garters, stockings, small types, that kind of stuff, if you were in the stadium in person, it might of made you not notice how JJ and JT were quite touchy/feely in a very intimate way if you get the drift.  Oh well.... My take is, that best part of it was the Budwiser commercial with the romantic date in the horse drawn carrage.  Ah, serious drama!
