In fact, I find it difficult to use a HRM in the pool let alone stay in the right zone. Most of the time I'm just trying to remember to breath!       Zone             HRM         %                     Recovery      103-22      55-65         Base             122-140    65-75       Tempo           140-160    75-85        Fast Tempo   160           85              Race             160-178    85-90
