I pulled that game out of my archives to play it again because I haven't been able to find anything else to keep my interest.  When looking around on the forums for Uplink, I found a link to a similar game.   urlLink Wirelords  is a browser based game that is similar to Uplink, but is multi-player and is a little easier to play than Uplink is.  There is no real plot to the game but it is still addictive. :-)  Other than that, I have been enjoying my days off and am starting to get a little bored of computers all together.  I really need to get out and meet some more people!  I guess I am just too lazy! ha  Then again, going out requires money, which, as I am sure we are all aware, is pretty scarce now a days.  Kinda sucks getting paid a less than average salary for doing Helpdesk/Desktop Technician work.  If it were easier to find a new job in the IT field I wouldn't be complaining, but after 300 resumes and no calls I am a little worried that I'm stuck where I am at!  Oh well, life goes on... :-)  Blog at ya'll later...
