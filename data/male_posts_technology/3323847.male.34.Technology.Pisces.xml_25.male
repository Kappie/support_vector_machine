This isn't your usual, court, though.  Those in the military do not fall under the same rules and regulations as the people they are fighting on behalf of do.  They fall under the  urlLink UCMJ , and the UCMJ is not kind to those who break the rules (unless you got some  serious  political clout).  As a citizen, I find this punishment to be a bit heavy.  As a former Navy man, I must say I'm not really all  that  surprised.  Uncle Sam is big on "tough love". ;)  Based on what I've been reading on these cases, I'd say it's time to break out " urlLink A Few Good Men " and brush up on how the "I was following orders" defense works.  I believe, however, that the movie was much more black-and-white than this Abu Ghraib case is (or will become).
