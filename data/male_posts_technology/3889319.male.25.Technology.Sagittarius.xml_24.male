I don't snap out of one sweating...I actually like them more than my sexual ones.  Last nigh i had a dream in where i was with someone (a girl).. Her face were out of focus, so i couldn't tell who she was! I suddenly found myself reading a letter that i got from Pelephone telling me that i got the job.. And i was so happy.. It's a feeling that i can't describe really.. I felt i was flying and very excited.   I went to Pelephone some last week ago for an interview. It went very well, and i had the impression that the job was mine. I haven't yet got a replay from them, they say they will contact me in the very near future, and it always takes them 2 to 3 weeks to do that.
