While as weekends go, it was fun and lots of fun,  it was such a good weekend because NOTHING went wrong!!  It’s been a long time since something like that happened.    I ended up going out on the Friday night with a couple of friends that grew up in Faaaaaaaaringdon with Debbie [flat mate] which was class.  I was supposed to meet up with more people from work but I couldn’t be arsed going to them in their seedy club and they couldn’t be arsed seeing me in the classy pub that I was in.  Oh well.  I had way too much to drink and there were good times all around.  We end up getting back at some obscene time.  I am the only one that holds off from having a Kebab [be proud] and am woken up at 8:30 by a mate who reminds me that I have to help him move house.  Who calls up at 8:30 on a Saturday morning??  That morning involved work which was okay.  A bit of extra cash can never go astray.  It was topped by playing Risk with some great mates.  Thankyou Phil, Bush and Ross.  There’s something pretty primal about plans for world domination, drinking beer, dribbling shit, eating Pizza and smoking Jasmin Flavoured tobacco.  It’s just such a class combination.    Bushra was kind enough to bring me back a proper Sheesha [nagile] from Dubai.  I still have some tobacco spare from Kristen’s and my trip to turkey.  It’s great stuff.  Very relaxing.  Sunday was exercise with some gym; some riding and some golf.  Pretty chilled out all around.  Sat  back that night to watch Greece beat Portugal.  I’m sure you’re reading this Mr WillieThePimp.  Congratulations on winning, but it was still a dull game.  I wasn’t quite ready for bed so gave a look over my flatmates PS2 games.  I tried something called manhunt.  I couldn’t believe it.  There is no plot [that I gather] and the whole point of the game [so far] is to go around and kill people as gruesomely as possible [you get a star rating].  You can use plastic bags, glass shards and baseball bats so far.  Let me say.  It IS gruesome and surprisingly fun.  Hmmmmmm.  Not good.  I also caught the last half hour of Kingdom Hospital.  I don’t know if anyone else has seen this. I quite enjoy it. It’s supposed to be based on a Stephen King Novel.  A hospital is built over the site of a tragic fire where lots of children died, so the hospital is now haunted.  Yeah I know.  Original.  Still. I find it very compelling and recommend it [form a safe distance].   My Big news however is that I WILL be coming back to Australia .. .. .. AGAIN this year!!  I’ve booked the tickets and will be coming back to see Alex and Gareth get married.  Oh Happy Days.  I was really upset that I missed out on Debb’s and I’m not sure how I would take it missing out on another wedding of such a close couple.  So happy days a head.  I think if I work hard, I will just about lose enough weight by then so that I can regain it all with some of Mum’s Cooking :- )  I’m looking at arriving on the 23/10/04 and leaving again on the 2/11/04!!  Happy Days.
