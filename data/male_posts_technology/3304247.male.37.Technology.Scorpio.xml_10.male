Ronald Wilson Reagan was the first president I voted for.  My political view of the world developed through the Jimmy Carter years and I was not happy with the where he was leading us.   Ronald Reagan was a breath of fresh air.  I distinctly remember Reagan as an exciting person.  A person with a message that I personally needed to hear.   I did my senior year high school government class project on Reagan's second run for the presidency.  I was so proud to be able to do a presidential race.  Kids only had a chance to do a presidential race every four years and I was lucky enough to get President Reagan to boot.   Those years of his presidency are some of my fondest.  High school, and college.  Cares and responsibilities at a minimum.  My whole life before me.  His outlook matched mine.  I thank him for his can do attitude about this country and life in general.   I have followed him over the years about like everyone else.  I would hear news reports of his health and think fondly of him.  I know, I and many more, will always think fondly of him.     He was one of our greatest presidents.   I will miss him.
