Anyway, I just got the new catalog in the mail, when I saw  urlLink this ... I can imagine that is a pretty cool jacket, I have the Retro X jacket, which they don't make anymore, but is just like the new one except without a hood.  It's the black one every calls my yak fur.  It's so warm and its windproof too.  The first day I got it, I drove with the windows down in 20 degree weather. It's hard, if not impossibly materalistic, to rationalize $185 on a jacket.  I got my Retro X on sale.  A constant battle of mine is to stay focused on lifestyle choices that are consistent with what I believe about our mission here and how God wants us to steward our resources.
