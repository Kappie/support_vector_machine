I think everyone has wondered what life would be like if we'd made different choices. This is not going to be a post about that. This is going to be a post about people who sit around waxing philosophical or political all the time.     Screw that. Who's got the time?     Why are we so damn whiny? It's like - look people, it doesn't matter, cause you DID make that choice, and that's it. You don't get to go back. So shut up already and do something useful. What I'm doing now is not useful, so I should beat myself up over it, but for some reason, I just don't wanna. so here goes:  1. - You can't change the past, forget about it. 2. - You are VERY unlikely to change peoples personal views and beliefs, no matter how much you argue, and what you say, unless that person is really searching for an answer and think you can give it to them. 3. - Opinions aren't right or wrong, don't get so uptight about it. 4. - No matter how many mean looks you get from teachers, peers, or anyone else, you should be able to speak your mind freely. 5. - The people who tend to preach Free Speech and Open Minds mean only theirs, not yours. remember that the next time you decide to promote Pro-Life, Anti-Drug, or any other "right wing-redneck-know nothing-bumpkin" viewpoint.  Just some thoughts. Read "The New Thought Police" by Tammy Bruce - it will make you think twice about the support the left wing gives to "free speech".  Startled me to see I agreed more with a Classic-Liberal Gun-owning Lesbian Journalist than with any politician I can think of.  I'm out - need coffee and sleep.
