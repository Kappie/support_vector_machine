I have to advertize a product and nitrogen has to be incorporated into it. so im getting an old spray-paint can and making a label that says atmosphere in a can. Yeah exciting. There is nothing else to do today with my same boring life. I am still working on the game creation site. And I just sent a review into vizzed.com. Well I will keep you updated on this thing people call life. bye self therapy!
