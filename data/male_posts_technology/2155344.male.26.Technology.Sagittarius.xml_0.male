     
      after a really long time. I don't remember the last 3 day weekend I had! I do remember our trips to Miami and Las Vegas though.. so it hasn't been a really long time since I've had time off from work but I could always use some more!! :)  Well the mother in law is visiting for Memorial day weekend, we're taking her to Alcatraz and our local temple but nothing else is decided, lets see.
