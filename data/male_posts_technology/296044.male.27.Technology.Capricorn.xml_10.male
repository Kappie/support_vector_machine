I've been in a somewhat melancholy mood lately.  I'm restless, and not sure what I need to get me out of it.  My roommate Eric and I saw some great paintings in a gallery on High St. the other night.  I wish I had enough money to buy them, that might satisfy something I'm looking for right now.  Is the Fair over yet?  I wanted to go again this year, but no one seemed to be interested, and I didn't really motivate myself...  I wanted to be with the commoners!  My computer has crashed at home.  No artistic creativity for a while.  Should I turn to pencil and paper?  Can I draw?  "This must be the place I've waited years to leave." - PSB  There's this guy I work with, and I hate his fucking laugh.  He laughs at the dumbest stuff.  Freak.  He's laughing right now.  I'm gonna burn down the building.
