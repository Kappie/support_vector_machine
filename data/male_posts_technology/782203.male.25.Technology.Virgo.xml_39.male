Well like my mom used to say: "You learn new things everyday". Of course she said it in Tamil, her english isn't that good. But I dun know how to write in Tamil so i can't write that here. But even if I wrote it in Tamil I still have to translate it to English so that my fans can understand so it will be pointless. Sigh why can't everyone in the world just speak one language!
