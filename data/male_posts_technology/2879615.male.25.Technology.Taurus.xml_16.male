Kimbo being the kind, nice soul that she is, decides to "pickup" our food for us as she has to run some other errands as well.  Great craig thinks to himself, that = more sleep for craig  .  So after dosing off again, the rumble in my stomach returns, so craig awakes and wonders where the Kimbo is and how good the food that she has so kindly "picked up" for us is going to taste.  After and hour plus passes, we decide to contact the Kimbo.  Cell phone... nawp (everyone knows the Kimbo can only keep a cell phone for 72 hours or less), Vinos... nawp, she left there an hour ago.  No Kimbo, oh my...  ITS, yup, there she is, it appears she has FORGOTTEN about us who are starving to death in the living room.  So craig is forced to travel to campus to retrieve our now *cold* food from the depths of Kimbo's car.  Hey, at least she remembered us right??  Nawp, definitely not.  Can craig get a phone call??? something??  Now for her lame excuse...  So she got to Vinos and they didn't have any eggplant, so she had to wait as they made the stomboli, losing precious time in the process as she needed to return to work.  After she has retrieved all the food for everyone involved in this lovely fiasco, she had no choice but to return to work.  So when she got back to work, she mentions to others in the room, that she needs to contact the poor starving people in the living room, however for some reason she failed to do so.  So, craig hollas with some big ups to Kimbo for being the *best* delivery person I know.  I can't wait till I can return the favor! Kimbo are you hungry?  I'll be glad to pick it up and leave it on some street corner for you to pickup, cool right?  Holla at yourself one time.  beat it, craig "A woman should never tell a man what to do!"
