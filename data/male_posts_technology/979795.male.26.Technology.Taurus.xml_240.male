Been really making good progress the past 3 weeks. Started off with about 4 rounds initially, each round is estimated to be about 500m maybe. At that time I weighed about 68kg. At the end of last week I weighed about 66kg or so and I managed to be clocking about 6-8 rounds per run. Did 10 rounds once but at a really slow pace then. It was kinda fun. Like I said, the run yesterday was quite crappy. I miscounted and had actually wanted to stop at the end of my 6th round. But when my housemate (Justin, aka personal runnung trainer haha) stopped running, I realised I had already done 7 rounds already (coz he managed to lap me by 1 more round). Had to suck it in and just finish the final lap. Was really on the verged of giving up mentally. Wah liews. But at the end of it, felt good that I still managed to complete 8 rounds instead of giving it up at 6. By the way, I've been maintaining a constant 65kg so far. Doubt I'll get any lighter than this.  OK can't leave out Aikido stuff completely I realised. Coz I need to make a point with relevance to my legs. The exercise I've been doing has a bit of impact on my legs. They feel stronger but as they are still aching from my (almost) daily reps, they do feel kinda sore right now. I'm targetting to increase some kinda endurance training to my legs by increasing the hiji/higi tai practice I mentioned a few posts earlier. And if I can help it in terms of schedule and studies, I may swim once/twice a week as well. Legs legs legs ... very important. Keep overlooking them. No choice lah, my legs are generally the weakest area coz of my lack of emphasis in every exercise I do.  Which reminds me, really funny, when we left for our run 2 sessions ago, 3 angmoh girls were in front of us. While we overtook them, 1 of them called out "Woooo!! ... Sexy legs!!!" Hahaha, I felt like laughing out there and then. I immediately called out to my friend in front of me, "Eh Justin, calling you leh." His only reply was "Siao." Hahaha ... We sure have some funny moments over here.
