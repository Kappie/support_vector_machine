The one that is giving me serious struggles is her view on religion.  Obviously I have heard the argument before that faith and religion is for the weak, for those that need that crutch in life.  But her argument was that man's life and morals are based on his ability to think and reason, which is the opposite of taking something explicitly on faith.  I am seeing many contradictions between faith and reason now.  All our lives we are told that we are supposed to use our minds, to think and be the best that we can be.  Use Your Head!!!..............Why don't you think?  But when it comes to God and religion, we are just supposed to turn off our minds and not think or try to explain?  It seems like a giant contradiction.  Humans were blessed with the ability to think and reason, given to us by God.  But we aren't supposed to think and reason about God????? Hmmmmm....... supposedly contradictions do not exist.  So it is either one or the other, or I am thinking on the incorrect premises.  This is messing with my mind.    But there were other great points as well.  One idea that came to me indirectly from the book is:  Why do people wear their suffering like badges of honor?   I know i've tried it before, its a plea for pity.  "Man, I've had it so much harder than you,   you  never had to deal with the shit that I have,  you  have no idea!"  Who gives a shit.  Hey man, that's too bad that you've had it rough.  But guess what:   So have I.  So have most people out there.  Suck it up and lets go out there and kick some ass together.    Wear your happiness on your sleeve.  Wear your success on your sleeve.  Wear your pride on your sleeve.  Your accomplishments.  Your ethics.  Something positive instead of negative.    Well, onto 'The Rum Diary'.  Probably not gonna get any brain busters out of that one.  Maybe an urge to drink rum on the rocks and kick it on a beach somewhere, but no brain busters.
