Which is a strange enough new play on words I said the tragedy is how you're gonna spend the rest of your nights with the light on So shine the light on all of your friends when it all amounts to nothing in the end.    nothing much about this day. just blogged hop and commented out on some people. don't even have any plans to gimmick tomm night. i still need to accomplish lots of things in mind, as well as my detailed plan this coming december (hope i still have my job).  having a jobless christmas is too pathetic.  darn i miss u...  hope u know who u are....     I wont worry my life away.yeah oh oh... I wont worry my life away.yeah oh oh...     -fin-
