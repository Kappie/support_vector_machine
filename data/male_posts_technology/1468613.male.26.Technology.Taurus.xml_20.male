As soon as I was in the terminal at Heathrow, I passed one queue. Then I was in my first queue to get on a transfer bus which led to a queue of busses to get into the other terminal. Then I had to queue to get up the escalator and then there was another queue for the queue to pass through security. Once I was past that queue I waited again in another queue to pass through immigration... and then that was it!  I've never been through so many queues in my life! But now I've found myself the BA version of Qantas club and in sort of normality again.  I've been looking around for digital cameras but not the cheap $100 ones I'm looking for... So unfortunately you guys might have to wait a little while before some pictures come through.  The flight was long to say the least... last leg was about 12 hours in the air from Bangkok... It was a bit disturbing to see some people walking around with surgical masks... not too sure if that was to protect themselves  from everyone else or the other way around....   Will post again when I get to  Glasgow. cya!
