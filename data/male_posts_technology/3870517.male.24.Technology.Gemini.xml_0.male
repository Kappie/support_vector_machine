The CSI episode was amazing, a man charged with arson and the fire brutally killed his wife and his 8-year-old son. Mel was with me watching the episode and before the episode ends, VJ called my attention. He was asking me to buy them dinner; he and Jups were finishing their reports for their submission today. I went out to buy and when I came back I missed the last part of CSI and Mel told me everything about it. We ate our dinner in the staff room. Jupanie told me that she borrowed a VHS of a movie entitled "Holy Ghost" of which I have never heard of. I was thinking maybe it was an independent movie; most independent movies here in the Philippines are released onlyon video. It starred Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel, directed by "The Piano" director, Jane Campion.    The movie was all about an Australian girl (Winslet) who went to India and was captivated by the guru of an ancient belief.Her amazement led her to live in India to become one of the wives of the guru. Upon hearing this situation from a friend, who was with her when they traveled to India, her family decisively planned to hire a “cult exiter” (Keitel) to get her back. And the rest of the film became an intriguing tale of love, sex, passion, and lust.    I was so consumed by the film's storywhen VJ and Jups came and told me that we are going to The Venue. It’s ladies’ night so Lotlot and Jups will not be paying any fees and besides they wanted to have some good night of fun and dances. Off we go to the place despite the rain the heavy rain. Unfortunately, Ladies’ Night is not really free for ladies, they will have to pay half of the entrance fee. We paid and got ourselves in a huge place where everyone was having the time of their lives. The live band played a mix of hip-hop and R, they got a nice rapper although I must admit that I can’t figure out what he was yelling. We ordered four bottles of beer, fries and a pizza. The waiter asked us that we have to pay for the beer because it’s not included in the fee. Off they go dancing while I was waiting for our orders at the table and taking care of their belongings. The second band for the night started their playlist with a mellow. Everyone got back to their sits and listened. When the dance music came back and our orders came, we get to feet and went to the dance floor leaving out things behind. Anyway, their where people sitting next to us and would notice if our things will be stolen.    Everything went fine until the clock hits one in the morning. We went back to the center and I finished my viewing while they are busy finishing their reports. I fell asleep after watching, woke up early, went home, sleep and came to the office late.    I’m out.
