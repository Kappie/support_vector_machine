I come to England poor and broke, Go to dole see labour bloke. Fill in forms and stand around, Kind man gives me eighty pound. Thank him much then he say, "Come back next week get more pay"  You come here make you wealthy, Doctor here to make you healthy. Send for friends from Afghanistan, Tell them "come as quick as you can". Plenty of us on the dole, With motor car and big payroll. Come with me we live together, Only bad thing 'the bloody weather!'.  All get nicely settled down, Find big house in busy town. Fifteen families living up, Twice as many living down. All are paying nice big rent, More in garden living in tent. Soon we send for wife and kids, Kind man give us loads more quids.  Twelve months later buy a rolls,  Still go to labour draw more doles. Wife gets glasses teeth and pills, All are free get no bills. As white man pays out all year, To keep the national assistance here.  Bless all the men big and small, For paying tax to keep us all. We think England damn good place, Too good for white man race. If they do not like the Afghan man, Theres plenty room in Afghanistan!
