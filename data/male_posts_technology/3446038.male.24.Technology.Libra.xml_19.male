It gives me great pleasure to find that Douglas Adams had answered this question:   The answer to this is very simple. It was a joke. It had to be a number, an ordinary, smallish number, and I chose that one. Binary representations, base thirteen, Tibetan monks are all complete nonsense. I sat at my desk, stared into the garden and thought '42 will do' I typed it out. End of story.   Find the relevant post  urlLink  here  .  And take a chill pill now. Rest in peace. The answer is  42 .
