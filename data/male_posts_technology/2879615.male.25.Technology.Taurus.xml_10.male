These internet radio stations just don't understand that people aren't interested in a wide, commercial-free variety of music.  People can only handle one or two songs in a row before they start craving the sound of a booming, echoing voice shouting about the incredible one-time-only sale at the local car dealership.  According to a pole conducted by Collier's magazine, 74% of radio listeners only tune in to help themselves decide how to spend their money.  Also, a whopping 93% said that they preferred the advertising jingles to the actual songs.  The number one song on Casey's Top-40 for thirteen weeks in a row has been the Safe-Auto song.  If you are interested in facts like this, I suggest you head down to your nearest newsstand and pick up the latest issue of Collier's, which despite the alligations of a few homosexual nerds, DOES exist.  Just look below at the cover of the best-selling issue from 1938, containing Martha Ostenso's "The Dreamer" which was just recently auctioned on e-bay and sold for the highest amount ever paid for any piece of artwork, making it almost twice as valuable as the Mona Lisa.  Of course this now makes Collier's the wealthiest and therefore most powerful corporation in the business world.  They just recently announced their plans to buy Microsoft.  And it was just made official--Collier's has been named the #1 magazine OF ALL TIME in the Best-Magazines-Of-All-Time list in Collier's magazine.  So you can all just go blog yourselves, bitches.
