It would seem that many of these changes are affecting life in North America more then the rest of the world. With the rest of the world gaining at the determinant to the North American society.   An example is the Canadian election. The ability for the country to instill a government such as the liberals, headed by a criminal group of unaccountable and allegedly unknowing administration, boggles the mind. The head of this group, our now famous Prime Minister is a tax evader and drug smuggler. This so that an unproven honest guy doesn't muck it up.  Certainly interesting times, you reap what you sow.
