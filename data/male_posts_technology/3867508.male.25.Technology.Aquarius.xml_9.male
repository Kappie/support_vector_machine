Oh well.   Last night I went to the Kerry 2004 Meetup here in Albuquerque. It was a good time, we talked about the campaign and how the Democrats can win. Richard Romero, who is running for Congress against the evil Heather Wilson, stopped by and talked to us. It was really good to be involved.   Ok here is an article that I think dissects some of the 9/11 Commission report.   urlLink The 9/11 Report: Bad News for Bush   Obviously this article is very one sided, but I am not saying that it is a comprehensive review, I just think that the media at this point are not properly highlighting (or rather lowlighting) the things that the Bush Administration should be faulted for. In my opinion Bush is getting off easy here. Ok I will go over this article in my next post a bit.
