Sometimes I can never understand why people call up and complain about having too many username/passwords to remember and suddenly, I'm complaining about the same thing.  Oh well...at least I recognize that I am complaining about it. First step to correcting a problem is recognizing that it exists.   There's a new format to the site. I'm trying to find something so people can post comments on a post and such. My sister could get a good kick out of that.   10:24 pm. Why does that seem so late for me now?
