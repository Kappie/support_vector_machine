The story revolves around Prasanna an aspiring director who waits for the right break in the cine field. The heroine is Navya Nair, the third actress from God's own country to enter into Kollywood. The heroine wants dosen't want to marry because of her inherent hatred towards the male clan. Her father wants her to marry Prakash Raj. She seeks help from her friend's brother who inturn approaches Prasanna to help her. Prasanna lies to Prakash Raj that Navya and he are lovers. The consequences of this lie forms the rest of the movie.  Prasanna has done a wonderful job as the hero and Navya is refreshing. She resembles actress Rohini a lot. Prakash Raj has dun a wonderful cameo. The three friends of the hero fit into their respective characters like a 'T'. Music by Ramesh Vinayagam is good, but I seriously wonder why he sings most of the songs. On the whole a good entertainer and it deserves the 46 marks given by  urlLink Anantha Vikatan.   Watched "Kanedhire Thondrinal" where Simran looked too good. A good movie on friendship and love. The director of this movie has a great sense of music. He got the best out of Deva in this movie (except Sallomiya... all other songs are Deva's original tunes and good too) and then introduced Harris Jeyaraj in Majnu.  As if Navya and Simran are not enough, Sneha was there to torment me in "Yeh ... Nee Romba Azhaga Irukka". A typical Vasanth flick, where one can get a lot of sweet and cute scenes to watch though the main storyline wud be bad. Sneha was so beautiful in this movie. There was nuthing much in that movie except Sneha and songs. Vasanth is one director who gives so much importance to songs in all his films. Dunno why he never worked with Mastero Illayaraja after "Keladi Kanmani". "Keladi kanmani" is one of the best movies to have hit the screen. After that he gave two more hits in "Asai" and "Nareukku Ner" but both lacked the "Keladi Kanmani" quality.  On the whole I had an "Azhagana Weekend"
