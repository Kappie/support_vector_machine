And that is my fav dish in the whole world cos its mouthwateringly delicious. Its like chicken sambal but the gravy isnt as thick as sambal and its much sweeter and pretty spicy. It was so good that I licked the gravy off my plate! But got a feeling my stomach is gonna suffer from my greed tommorow. Watch this blog tommorow to find out.
