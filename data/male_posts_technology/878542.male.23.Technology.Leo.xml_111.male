In addition to updated electronic versions of many MIT publications, they include lots of searchable journals, papers, and links embedded into them to internet resources. Very data rich, quite useful in certain circumstances.   If you ever feel like jumping into the deep end of the pool, regarding knowledge of self, or where your thoughts really come from, this would be the place. Buy a subscription, read the four major reference introductions, and then take some aspirin and try to decide what to read first. This place is very big, I didn't get very far in my six month membership, and I read very very fast.
