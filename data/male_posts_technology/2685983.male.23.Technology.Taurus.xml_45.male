The mascott on the box of Chester Friend Chicken is a smiling and waving cartoon chicken with a red cowboy hat.   so i'm sitting there eating my chicken and I look up at the bucket and all of a sudden lose my appetite and feel sad. Look at Chester so happy and cute and he's going to die so I can eat him.  It's pretty weird when places advertise their food with a cute picture of the animal you're about to eat...occasionally eating itself, really disturbing.
