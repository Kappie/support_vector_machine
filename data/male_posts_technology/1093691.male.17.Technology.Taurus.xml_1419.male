It has taken it home, and fed it to it's 3 little tiger cubs, who have mauled it for a period of 18 days. Then, a hunter comes and shoots the tigers, and manages to accidentally shoot my throat four times in the process, picked it up, ran it through the blender 7 times, dipped it in acid, rubbed it down with sandpaper, and then returned it to me. Gah.
