More than 190 exhibitors are showcasing their wares this year -- 55 more than last year, according to Warwick Davies, group VP at show organizer IDG World Expo -- and attendance is expected to match last year's numbers of between 10,000 and 11,000. "The event has always been a great watering hole for everyone from kernel developers to line-of-birth managers looking at bringing Linux into their companies," Davies said." The main theme of this year's show, Davies told eADT, is "Linux: Beyond the operating system." Attendees can expect to see "a whole host of applications that allow you to run your business on Linux," he said. Within the "beyond the OS" theme, this year's show is putting a lot of emphasis on desktop Linux. Nine sessions are dedicated to Linux desktop strategies and technology development. There is a Desktop Linux Pavilion, where new open-source desktop technologies will be on display. And both Dell and HP are expected to unveil new products for deploying Linux as a Windows alternative. Linux integration is another focus of the show, Davies said, so attendees should expect a range of announcements and exhibits around the issue of working with Linux in mixed environments. A new security track has also been added to the lineup, which Davies sees as a sign that more enterprises are looking seriously at Linux. "Security is a buy signal," he said. "When people start thinking about security, they're not wondering about whether they want the technology, but how they can make it work in their organization."
