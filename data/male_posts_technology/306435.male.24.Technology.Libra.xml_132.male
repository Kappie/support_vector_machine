The football season is is in full swing, along witht he fantasy football season.  I am in four leagues this year.  My usual league with Justin, Tom and Jim.  I am also in the Risley league as well/  My cousin Michael is running it and as of right now I am winning my week one match up.    Watching football is in full swing as well.  University of Kentucky defeated ranked Louisville and then UTEP 77-17 to jump out to 2-0.  I talked to a gentleman at work today who said he had gone to the game and said it was the biggest blow out he had ever seen in Commonwealth Stadium.  By the way...why is Kristin Titan fan...I mean common I will give her the Cardinals, but the Titans?  I wonder if she even knows who Warren Moon or Ernest Givens is?  Fun n' Gun?  I have been lucky to talk to Ann in Missoula quite a bit.  She is enjoying her job very much.  She really likes the people she works with and that is great.  I have been hanging with K$ and Marissa a lot.  This Saturday I went with them to K$'s home town of Scippio, Indiana.  It was a small community.  Lots of farms.  We got to go to the oh so famous Broomsage.  It was a "country club" if I ever saw one.  Mullets, trashy outfits, line dancing, rap music, and the live stylings of "Eastern Sky".  It also has a lake outside with a twisty slide.  Let's see what else has happened...we went out to the gambling boats for Tom's 22nd birthday.  I didn't win money, but I think everyone ese did.    That is about it...I will be trying to update more often.
