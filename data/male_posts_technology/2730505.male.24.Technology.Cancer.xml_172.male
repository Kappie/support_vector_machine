I sent her an email because I talked to Jenny and she doesn't want to go to the party this Saturday because she is uncomfortable because she thinks that everyone in IL hates her.  This is what my mom said.   she should not care less on what others think about her. it's all about bryce.. that she should open his world to the love of the other half of Bryce's being.  we are his family.. whether she likes it or not.. whether we like her or not.. whether she likes us or not.   Amen Mom, Amen!  I already know what Jenny's response would be.  It's gonna be along the lines of:   it's not my job to bring Bryce to IL, if they want to see Bryce then they can drive here to Iowa and see him   what a retard.  I was going to pick them up and bring them back to IA.  She's not doing anything.  If anything she's gettign her fucking ass fed and taken cared for while she is here.  I think this is why it will never work out.  I don't know why I missed her, I guess it was just a fluke.
