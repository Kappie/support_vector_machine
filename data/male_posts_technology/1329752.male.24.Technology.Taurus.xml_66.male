"Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry You don't know how lovely you are  I had to find you Tell you I need you Tell you I set you apart  Tell me your secrets And ask me you questions Oh let's go back to the start  Running in circles Coming in tales Heads are a science apart"    haven't opened my blog for almost a week as usual. i just broke my "NO BEER UNTIL NEXT YEAR" policy. i almost forgot it was octoberfest nga pala. the price of beer at "chicharitos"  (the place here in magallanes where me and my colleagues used to hang out after work)  deppriciated from 25 to 17 pesos per bottle. sagot ni sir. sabi nga ng isang free newspaper "the best things in life are libre" (hehe).     "Nobody said it was easy It's such a shame for us to part Nobody said it was easy No one ever said it would be this hard  Oh take me back to the start"    that was on a tuesday night.  friday night comes. it was another senior colleague's treat. we went to bargo (few steps away from common ground). it was my first time to be there though. i found the place quite ok. the ambiance seems to be ok. i just don't like their vip rooms (vip rooms ba tawag don?) umm'.. i think i got the wrong term.. ohh i got it. ktv room pala (hehe..) the dining and the outside plus the service seems to be fine. the ktv part seems not. maybe ktv isn't their specialty.    "I was just guessing At numbers and figures Pulling your puzzles apart  Questions of science Science and progress Do not speak as loud as my heart"    dipa don natapos. after saying goodbye's and thank you's to my boss' and the other 40 somethings, me and the other 20 somethings walked looking for another hop. since full na daw sa tia m, we end up ordering 5 bottles of smb lights at arkdia. they're jamming with the crowd when i was busy talking with 2 sisters on a table beside ours.  that was on a friday night up to saturday morning.  i woke up 10 am wherein i should supposedly be there at work around 9. i arrived at the office at 2 pm. finished a module around 6:30 and left there by 9 pm. slept around 11, had lots of dreams until 3 pm (i even dreamed of a grade school classmate named joerela) hmm... bakit kaya?    "Tell me you love me Come back and haunt me Oh and I rush to the start  Running in circles Chasing tails And coming back as we are"    right now i'm listening at  coldplay's scientist , few minutes ago i was staring on a national bookstore baggage number. pretending it was losts, i paid 50 pesos for it... just to have that thing tagged 21.  i wanted to write something about these midnight religious battles on tv kya lang i'm lazy right now. maybe next week perhaps...  ' need to wake up early. take care all and tke cre Ã¼.    "Nobody said it was easy Oh it's such a shame for us to part Nobody said it was easy No one ever said it would be so hard  I'm going back to the start"
