Friday night was good fun, we started off at the Wine Bar, had some food at Bella Pasta and then went out to a private party near first tower. We were accompanied by two Toasterfilettes, Chrissie and Donna. Fantastic girls, really flirty and great fun. We stayed at the party for a bit then headed back to check out the new "GAP", Zebra Square. The place is a pimp heaven - walls covered in furry zebra print, and the staff wearing Randy "The Macho Man" Savage Zebra hats. I met a nice Irish lass and somehow convinced her that we should snog, so we are going at it and I bump into somebody. Brett, Dougal's brother, snogging the face off Irish girl's mate. Outstanding! 2-0 to the home team :)  I had the hangover from hell and just about recovered ready for a night at the Splash. We started at the Post Horn, having a few beers to grease the wheels. Sitting outside we played a drinking game I learnt in Australia - Chicken. The noise of about eight largered up lads screaming  "BUCKEEEEEEEEEEYE!"  at the top of their voices echoed around St Helier, a mating call to attract female talent. It was time to get some food and somebody suggested Hector's fish-n-chip place. We were greeted with almost blind hatred by the cholesterol fuelled waitress, who at first wouldn't let us in. She then told us to keep quiet (while we were taking a photo of us sitting at the table). It was like being back in school - fuck that, I’m not having a restaurant treat me like they are doing me a favour by serving me. Hector's, you can kiss my ass. We went to Burger King instead and had some good, old-fashioned western consumerism instead.   Anyway, we head out to the Splash and the place is MOBBED. There's a fancy-dress party up there, and in front of me in the queue is Elvis Presley talking to Osama Bin Laden. More Splash craziness ensues, and we roll out at 2am to find the coaches are packed. So as we wait for the next one we have a bit of 'male-bonding' on the sand, wrestling and pile-on's. Very immature but great fun, and much to the delight of the Splashers when we brown-eye'd the coach. Eventually we get a ride back into town, and decide to throw Brett into Liberation Square fountain. The poor git was soaked, as was his nice Ericsson phone.   All in all, a magic weekend. The pictures are going to be up very soon.  Now, where'd I leave my Alka-Selzter...
