 The shower drain is not draining so I'm forced to wash up in the sink.  Not having a shower makes me cranky. 

 I had a half banana with peanut butter at 11:00 am, the other half at around noon. 

 I don't think my intestines liked the peanut butter.  I'm having gurgling, cramping and a little nausea. 

  Update:  The dull pain in my intestines has not left me all day.  It really steals my appetite.  I've had a little food today, but not nearly enough.  I'll likely eat more this evening and be up late, sick in bed. 

  Update:  I'm sitting down to a frozen chicken dinner.  I'm eating very slowly, but I'm sure I'll still be sick.  My intestines are  still  cramping.
