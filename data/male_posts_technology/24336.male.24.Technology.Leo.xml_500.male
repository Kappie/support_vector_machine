Alissa tried the ice cream and that got a thumbs up, Jamie and I tried the cookies and they got a thumbs up.  Big thumbs down on their fountain pop though.  The cup was probably only 12 ounces yet it cost $1.39!  For $1.39, you get a 32 ounce cup at Jimmy John's.  I guess they have to make up costs somewhere.
