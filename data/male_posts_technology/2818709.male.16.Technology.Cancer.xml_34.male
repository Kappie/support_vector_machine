Oh well.) decided that she was going to give the entirety of the other art class detention because they all failed the test. Ok, wtf? (Assuming that she gave them proper notes, but she DIDN'T.) It would be THEIR fault for failing. The F is punishment enough. Ok, now on the fact that she DID NOT give them/us proper notes. BTW, my class all failed the test too. We got the same notes, but no detention.     Stop, drop, KABOOM!, baby rub on ya nipples Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles Far from little, make ya mammary glands jiggle Got 'em under control, the bowl of tender biddles Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles Just play a little "D" and I'll make ya mouth dribble Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not whiffle Hit 'em in triples, wit no strikes, stripes, or whistles I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, wit a ghetto tempo I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again My eyes chinky, I'm wit Chingy, at the Holidae In  Legendary words, from the Ludacris Ludacris.
