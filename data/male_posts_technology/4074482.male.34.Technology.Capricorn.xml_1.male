I'm a man and a popular belief is that we (men) are incapable of being soft, we can't be nurturing this quality is only associated with women. Men are mostly associated with solid metals such as steal, rock, mountains, etc and women are associated with softness, flowers, pure drop of water etc. I have to come out of closet and admit against the popular belief that being a man I'm loving and nurturing. I'm MERCURY!!! Do you understand now what I am talking about? Why I associate myself with mercury?  My emotions run wild just like mercury. It rises on a hot contact in a glass tube. If it gets hot I go high, if it gets cold I go low, down, shrink...  The hotter it gets, higher I go and there come a point I cant go any higher, I'm a prisoner in the tube and I feel like I’m gonna burst out of it. Once I’m out of the tube no one can hold me. I will spread like mercury in tiny pieces, every piece of mine will be complete in shape but it wouldn’t be the same.  You can put it together and bring the old shape back but there are so many pieces of mine to put together, it will take too long and it’s so hard to find my little pieces that are lost. Would anyone care to find those pieces and put me into shape I was? Every time I’m dropped I changed my shape, I collected myself together like mercury but some pieces of mine are lost, I can’t be the same. I’m dropped over and over and over. More I get dropped smaller I get, if I kept getting dropped I will lose my existence, may be some where my tiny pieces would exist but it wouldn’t be my shape, I’m gonna lose my shape.  Can some one stop this heat?Can some one cool it down?Can some one make sure I stay in tube? May be this time if I’m dropped I may or may not stay the same shape. I always come down on a little breeze of kindness, I always rise on a little warmth of emotions, I always take the shape of my container, I hug every corner of this container, I fill it completely every corner of it, every inch of it unlike rocks. I’m the mercury and I don’t discriminate shapes, but my container has to be my size or bigger. Not too big that I disappear and not too small that I spill over and lose some parts of me. Just big enough to hold me. It neither let me spill nore let me disappear.  I’m done for today, I have expressed myself, now I’m back to the battle of temperature...
