Reese's Pieces.   2.  are you happy with your life right now? what would you change, if anything?  i'm happier than i thought i could be, but i still want to be earning better money and playing more Dr. Mario.   3.  do you think you are the smartest member of the bloghouse?  no... wait... yeah, no.     4.  what is your biggest guilty pleasure?  i have so many, but it has to be a tie between power ballads and Star Trek.  somebody help me.    5.  do you tend to be aware of your surroundings?  in other words, if i were standing behind you with a cream pie right now, would you be able to duck before i hit you with it?  i claim to be very aware, though my glazed-over gaze suggests otherwise.
