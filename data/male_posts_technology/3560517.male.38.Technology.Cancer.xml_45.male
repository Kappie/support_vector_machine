WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic candidate John Kerry ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ), whose campaign demanded to know on Wednesday whether President Bush ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ) read a key Iraq ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ) intelligence assessment, did not read the document himself before voting to give Bush the authority to go to war, aides acknowledged.   "Along with other senators, he was briefed on the contents of the NIE (National Intelligence Estimate) by (then-CIA ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ) Director) George Tenet and other administration intelligence officials," said Kerry spokesman Phil Singer.   Kerry's campaign has challenged Bush to say whether he read the complete intelligence report before deciding to go to war, or whether he just read a one-page summary, which Democrats say gave him none of the dissenting views included in the full version.   The Kerry campaign stepped up the attack on Wednesday, sending out an e-mail with the headline, "Did anyone in the White House read the full National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq?"   In a conference call organized by the campaign, Senate Intelligence Committee Democrat Richard Durbin said Bush should have read the 90-page report issued in October 2002.   Asked if Kerry read it, Durbin responded, "I don't know."
