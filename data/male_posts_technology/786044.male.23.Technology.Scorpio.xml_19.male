I guess he had enough of people calling him  urlLink Mr. Vanessa Williams , and he's decided to become his own man.  Of course, it says the two had been separated, so it wouldn't surprise me if she initiated the separation, and he was like "I'd better break up with her before she dumps me."  Okay, that's probably a really mean thing to say... but look at the man's hair!  Perhaps all the styling product affected his ability to reason.    Fantasy   Impact    Well, I'm sure a lot of men's fantasies will be impacted by this news.  As for the world of basketball, I can't believe that anyone is really going to care if Fox is depressed and can't manage more than 3-4 points a game next season.  I read in some article about it that he was considering retirement as  an option to continuing sucking.  Seems like a poor time to file for divorce when you're finally going to stop travelling around the country for 8 months out of the year.  But I've never been married, so what do I know?  If he does retire, look for Ricky Davis, Jumaine Jones, and maybe even rookie Justin Reed to pick up Fox's 20 minutes, 5 points, and 4 rebounds per game.  In related news: Thanks to Yahoo for taking Mr. Vanessa Williams picture down from his profile page! I was able to fully scour the depth of his career without being reviled by his hideous mug.
