I thanked her for the new one, then suggested an alternative (this is not romantic, but it was Father's Day, not Valentine's Day).  I suggested that I would really rather have a Garmin Forerunner 201, a wristband-mounted GPS unit that is ideal for long-distance runners.  She agreed to my proposal on the condition that I let everyone know that the Garmin unit on my wrist was my wedding band.  I agreed.  She returned the wedding band and I bought the Forerunner.  I've worn it now on a half dozen runs.  It is the greatest running accessory I've ever had.  I love it.  And I love the woman who gave it to me.  I think of her every time I wear it.
