That's four monitors, keyboards, and mice per machine.  Using a kernel patch, 2 PS/2 ports, 6 USB ports and four video cards four people can log on and use the computer without knowing that anyone else is sharing the computer.  This is a great money saving idea for Linux, the os is free and now their cutting down on the hardware cost.  However, if one computer goes down, four users could be affected.  This looks to be a good option for organizations that are trying to keep cost low or for lab areas where users are not using much of the computers resources like surfing the web, checking e-mail or light weight apps.
