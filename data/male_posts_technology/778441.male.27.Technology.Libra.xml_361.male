The weaseliest organization is  Recording Industry Association of America  while the weaseliest company is  Microsoft .   Politics  continues to be the weaseliest profession while  George Bush  has the honour (by a long long way) of being the weaseliest individual in the world. Interestingly, one of his  bete noires ,  Michael Moore  is close on his heels in the second place.   Blaming fast food restaurants for making you fat , deservedly, bags the honour (??) of being the weaseliest of all behaviours!   [link via  urlLink slashdot ]
