So he comes and helps saturday, about 4pm I thought I asked him to drive me to the hardware store. Guess not. about 30 min later he calls thru relay texas asking what kind of cement I wanted. he just took off without me to get what I needed. and he did get what i needed. was cool.   So sunday, we are working hard on putting down cement, and he tells me his legs are tired from dancing the night before.  Me being the big brother ask the only good question.   "So did you get lucky?"   he says "arghkdighh" (i dont know what the hell he said)  I said did you "get with a girl?"   at this point I think we had some more poor communication.  I think he said 2 girls. I know thats what he said.  I said, "you got with 2 girls same time?"  He said, "no 2 diffrent girls"  me, "oh so you got with one girl then got with another in the same night?"  he said something i didnt understand,  something about 2 girls same time, or something.  i then told katy, and he started yelling, stuff i didnt understand.  so i just said to him, "ok you got with 2 girls same time then 2 diffrent girls diffrent times later?"   at this point he quit talking to me.   so im wondering just what the hell kind of party he went to.  and next time he should invite me!     editors note.   after reading this after i posted, thought i should clarify. Just picture said brother, and i think you know who it is, getting mad at me, then really getting mad when i said something to katy.   He said some choice words outloud! I think i embaressed himsomehow!
