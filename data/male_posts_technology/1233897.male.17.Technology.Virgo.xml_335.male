All the people in these pictures plus Gwen, YoungHee and Adri went to see Shrek 2... Fairly good movie actually, pretty funny. Later all of us minus Adri and YoungHee went back to Mel's (where the pics were taken) to watch Evil Alien Conquerors. Note I only happened to remember that I had my camera with me and subsequently use it   after   Gwen left, so though she isn't in any of the pictures, she was there with us most of the evening. o.O James, one of the guys in the pictures, gave me one of his shirts from back when he used to work at Wendy's! So cool... (lol)   My NEST group's last meeting on Friday  (a school mandated grouth group of sorts)   My cellphones on Thursday  (Note the plural... I got my phone replaced but forgot to back up the phone directory... It pays to have friends in Sprint: I got to keep them both for a day.)
