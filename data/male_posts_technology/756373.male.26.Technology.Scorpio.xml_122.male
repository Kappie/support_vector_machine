I'm taking this opportunity to emote about a disparaging habit that emerges from certain quarters when tragedies such as the following arise.  Over the past few days, on a couple of South African internet forums, more than merely a few people suggested the theory that Leigh had orchestrated her own kidnapping, in order to get money or attention out of her parents. These people have consequently been proven wrong, and terribly so, when she was found murdered yesterday south of Johannesburg.  This illustrates a glaring fault with some left-leaners. There seems to be a iron belief that when bad things happen, they are not the fault of bad people. Moreso, a belief that bad people -  evil  people - do not exist. The simplest answer - that vile criminals kidnapped Leigh in an attempt to extort money from her wealthy parents, then murdered her in cold blood to prevent her from identifying them - isn't enough, in fact, deep down, it's incomprehensible to them. It disturbs their 'comfort zone', the one where the only evil that exists is The Man. So instead, they don a certain kind of rose-tinted spectacles, one that blinds them from the simple and horrible truth, and rather concoct a wonderful conspiracy theory that helps them find solace in the belief that bad people aren't bad - only  normal  people are. That criminals aren't at fault, but the  situation  is. That the victims had something to do with it. That Leigh was probably a scheming Right-Winger. That the Bushitler planned 9/11, and the CIA assasinated JFK. That the Jews secretly control the world. Etc.  It starts with a simple conpiracy theory, such as Leigh kidnapping herself. It's so easy to believe, so comforting, exciting even - and it's all downhill from there.
