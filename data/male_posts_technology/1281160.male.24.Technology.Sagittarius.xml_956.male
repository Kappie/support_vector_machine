This blog description below wud have made me and some others feel the way they are now...   "just a team weblog about our work, lives, hopes, dreams, disappointments, disasters, and any other issues that we get time to discuss on."   For the rest that u have discussed....I hope its irrelevant to the present issue and its neither ranjini nor the others who wanted srini to be included in the blog but its u who presumed that he cud be in our group...It is not a no to srini but in generic terms this means something in general though the reason for this issue cud be out of srini...  ok Bye bye
