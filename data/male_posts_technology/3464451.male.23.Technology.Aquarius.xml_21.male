YES!!! finally off this sickness cloud....  in the past couple of days, I have done pretty much nothing, watch law and order, sleep, and more sleep.  went to work today and my boss was telling me I am taking his position for a week while he is on vacation to see how good I do..  if I do really good, I might be in order for a promotion...  YEAH ME YEAH ME!!!  I can't wait for that one. been in this job for almost three years working my @$$ off just trying to get somewhere... and finally.   Still taking medicine though and it sometimes makes me drowzy so...  better get off here before I go but let me get your alls opinion on something.....  "why is it my fault, so maybe I try to hard, but's is all because of this desire. Just wanna be liked, just wanna be funny, guess the jokes on me.   So call me Captain backfire.   another social casuatly, score one more for me.   How could I forget, momma said thanks for speaking, no filter in my head, what's a boy to do.  Guess he better find one...  I'm never speaking up again, It only hurts me"      That is so true...  everytime a guy speaks up, even if he is a nice guy, it just backfires and hurts him.....   ah well, tis one of life's many challenges for me to solve....   take care....
