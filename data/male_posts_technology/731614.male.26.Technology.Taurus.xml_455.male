I will throw pickles at your head. You will cry. I will laugh at you. We will embrace, dive onto the futon and make hot monkey love. I will promise never to throw pickles at you again. You will apologize for annoying me. I will burp. Loudly. You will wake up in my muscular arms. We will drink coffee and coo at each other. You will do something trivial which annoys me. I will throw extra-crispy French fries at your heaving bosom. You will cry. I will tell you that these French fries are trans-fat free. This will reassure you. We will dive onto the futon and make hot monkey love. I will eat the French fries."   (Thanks to D, for the pick-me-up that I so greatly needed)
