That decision has taken five months to make, arggggggg, I really don't want to go, but It'll be fun(I hope). Oh and today has been one of those rainy days where you feel like all depressed and stuffs, I have been feeling really stressed and pressured this semester, I have 4 classes two of which are online, and the other two are at school, I can come with Lit/Comp but Math, umm no, even though I like math, I suck at it, unless it's something like math that is needed when I am programming a Java program, oh yeah, I am working on learning JDBC(the Java database connectivity language) so that I can, well, so I can know it and say I know it, I am also trying to learn Assembly because it seems like something fun to know. Right now my list of languages to learn is(in no piticular order): Assembly, VB, ASP, SQL, C, C++, and JDBC.  Well thats all till tomorrow.
