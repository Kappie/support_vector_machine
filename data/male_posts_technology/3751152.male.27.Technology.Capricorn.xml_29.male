Gathering from the posts I've read here for about a year, I've come to one sad conclusion...My life is just not that exciting...But don't let that detour you from reading my posts!  I'm sure from time to time you've enjoy the trivial things that is my life, so lets get this sorted then.  Most of you know I'm from Eastern Canada, which can sometimes be a great thing, and sometimes, like when it comes to airfare, a horrible thing.  I've been looking at flights to such places as London (YES MATT, I HAVE LOOKED INTO GOING TO BOMO, STOP ASKING!), as well as the recently announced Canadameet 3.  I have a hidden agenda though by going to Can3...One being visiting other friends and family.  I have scattered friends that have moved from home to venture for work, and it would be nice to finally visit them for a change.  Not to mention, I won't have to convert my canadian play money! w00t!  Anyway, flights from Fredericton are terrible, as many from the area can attest to.  Unless you get to a major airport city like Montreal or Toronto (Maybe Halifax to a lesser extent), you might as well tack on an extra 500/person just to get you there.  TERRIBLE!  So needless to say, here's waiting for a seat sale.  Today was a nice relaxing day at work, for a change.  They've having Employee Appreciation Day for the customer site I work on, and they invited us to join in on the festivities.  Very nice of them to do so I might add.  They just served us catered lunch and I'm stuffffffed.  I guess I'll end here, instead of rambling on my first blog.  So there goes my blogger cherry, and I'll never get it back again :(
