We covered over 700 miles one way. That trip is when I was introduced to Burger King's Icee/Soft-serve float. Quite possibly the world's best tasting frozen beverage. You may also note that no matter what I start out talking about, I willultimately relate each good experience to food. Coincidentally, if I'm giving directions to someone, most all the landmarksemployed will be restaurants.
