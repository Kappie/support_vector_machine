This Income tax does not cover Wipro's other portfolios like Healthcare, FMCG etc, but covered only Wipro's IT and ITES. Wipro will have only Rs.13 crore as profit, if it agrees to pay Rs.261 Crore to GOI(Profit in III Qtr of Wipro Rs.274 Crore).  According to STPI laws and amendments, Software companies which are registered under STPI are exempted from I.T. for the earnings and profits which comes under software exports. It doesn't make any sense for a company like Wipro to come under Section 10A of Income Act, 1997.  What I feel is such amendments of I.T will affect the morale of a company like Wipro. Any arguements and criticisms for the above point are most welcome.
