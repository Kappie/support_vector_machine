This is clearly the most unpleasant choice we've had to make, as  we've got the best, brightest, hardest working folks  in the industry at Sun, and it hurts to lose a single one. But I won't say this has been a difficult choice, because we know that  we need to improve shareholder value  and we need to assure our customers that we are financially fit and in this for the long haul, and the only way to do that is with aggressive cost-cutting measures in every part of our business."   I am not sure what these laid off employees are thinking about Sun, Java, Shareholders and their life as a whole but it really hurts to loose a job, that too after giving your heart and soul to make something that really counts. Ever hear Microsoft laying off people to do well in the stock market and improve the shareholder value? I am sure it could have done it (even though its doing really well).   This is not the first time ever that I have heard Sun laying off its staff. If at this rate, Sun starts removing people, who will innovate? Who will carry Java further, that too at a pace where the giant is slowly catching up the market.   I would like to ask everyone, if they have already started feeling the heat for .NET in the market?   As my friend says  "Winner is not the one who fights the hardest, but the one who survives the longest." . Till date, I was thinking and favoring Java not to be open sourced. But if Sun is finding it SO difficult to sustain, I feel its time to give up on Java.   Although silly, but I wish IBM could acquire Java, and maybe Sun.
