Still doing the summer school thing, with a kick ass 90 avg and 3rd place in my class, its goin really well :D.  I was able to help some friends on the weekend, they called me at 3 in the morning, in tears :( and they didn't know what else to do, they were at a party that went bad :(, so I told them to come here and spend the nite, I didn't want them wandering the streets at 3 in the morning.  That night really made me think...I was so glad I could be there for them when they really needed a close friend, someone they could trust, and talk to as well.  That nite however, I didn't sleep, for 1 reason only, I was to glad to see them safe and secure (and I DO NOT! cry that often, but that nite I did).  They felt bad for calling me @ 3 in the morning, but HEY!, if I couldn't have been there for them, what kind of friend would I be?, when I can't even be there for them when they really needed me?  So I am extremly glad that they called, and that they were safe and sound :).  and that I could be there for them when they really needed me.  The three of them mean alot to me, mainly becuase without them, I would not be here at the moment, they mean a great deal to me, and I'm glad that they are safe and everything is okay.  What else is new with me?, not too much, got alot on my mind right now, when I shouldn't.  I'm not stressed about anything, just guess I still got a few things to work through, O well, hopefully everything will work out...right?.  Went for a walk with Lisan last nite, walked on Nose Hill for about 2-3 hours or so, which was incredibly good, she's a good friend, don't really see her as often as I would like though.  O well, enough typing for now, im about to pass out from being tired :P  Post Later  P.S. I promise to keep it updated more often for those who read it, LOL.
