I can't really even imagine the conversations and comedy that that kid will be taking part in.   Off the charts...  Commentary from him so far:  cusickmw: I called desbrow mary donohoe cusickmw: that didn't go over too well cusickmw: lots of ackward - who the hell is that cusickmw: in general the conversation was like this "oh, looks like she got fat, so did she, so did she....."   Also - will anyone really believe Timmy when he tells them he starts Med School in the fall?
