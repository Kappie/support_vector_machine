Almost wrecked my Pc yesterday after buying a new case and trying to wrestle the motherboard out of the old one. For some stupid reason, the manufacturers of the new case released mounting brackets with screws that , for some obscure reason, didnt fit well with said brackets - they stripped almost immediately. I had to pry the damn board loose with a pliers and a flat screwdriver. A quick slip of the hand and I had scraped the back of the board good. After a tense 2 hour process I managed to transplant everything, and wasn't surprised when the PC didnt want to boot. fortunately, after thinking about the problem and not immediately attributing the problem to my clumsy haste, I deduced that I hadn't configured the jumper on my primary hard disk correctly. A  quick tweak with the needlenose pliers, and I was sailing smoothly again. I think the people down the road heard my sigh of relief. They probably heard me cursing God before that as well. :/  It gets FRIKKIN hot here this time of year, so my next pet project is to mod my case and install 3 new fans. I'm going to try and do it properly - the previous mod I did was a real hatchet job. I'll post some shots , maybe, if it turn out OK.  In closing -  why  do us men always feel the need to do dumb things like this ourselves?  I could pay some techie a few bucks to do it for me, save myself a lot of hassle and get it done properly...but no, for some reason, that thought never crossed my mind, and now that it has, it's so quickly dismissed. I still have to ask the question though. I guess it's that all-male drive to fiddle with things and  fuck  them up completely that drove the human race to invent shit like fire and the wheel and rockets and the A-Bomb. Perhaps it's a good thing. Although how many cavemen burnt themselves discovering fire in the first place? How many people died testing manned rockets? Not to mention the Bomb. I guess with the desire to create and fiddle and fuck shit up, comes the possibility of accomplishing either great things, or terrible things. Or you can just end up with a pile of fucked up shit which you take to the PC repair experts and ends up costing you three times as much to fix than if you'd merely taken it to them in the first place. I wonder, are we really super-intelligent, or just downright too damn stubborn to do things the easy way?
