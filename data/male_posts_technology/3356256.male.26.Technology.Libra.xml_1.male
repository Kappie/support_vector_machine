I've gather some info from the rumor mill and it appears that the sysadmin group will be one person short.  Does that mean that they will be looking for another sysadmin?  Could it be that they will hire another worthless  insultant  (consultant)?  Who knows?  I've really wanted to join that group for quite some time but  never have been lucky enought.  You would think that by know I would have left and found a sysadmin position somewhere else but I haven't.  Hopefully they'll get someone internally and hopefully that means me...    On the anime front, I'm really looking forward to watching  urlLink Samurai 7  which is a remake of Akira Kurosawa's classic " urlLink Shichinin no samurai " aka Seven Samurai. Gonzo Digianimation will be animating this series which means that it's going to be great.  Last Exile, Gantz, Peace Maker Kurogane, Chrono Crusade and Zaion where all made by Gonzo Digianimation and they were all great.  From what I've heard, they will be taking a different twist on Samurai 7.  Samurai's in space?   I'll just have to see how that works.
