Competition is something space travel has been virtually without since the US/Russian race to the moon; it will be healthy to reintroduce some of that spirit.  My question is what will commercial interests be competing  for ?  Maybe the Royal Carribeans and Carnivals of the world will start developing luxury space cruises.  I for one would love that.  We're pretty far away from a week-long cruise going anywhere terribly exotic in galactical terms ("off the port side you can see Titan...") but that's one of the things competition could help bring about - speed improvements.  I would wager competing luxury lines would be quicker to approach light speed than single government outfits.  But luxury lines visiting Jupiter aren't going to happen right now.  First we'll be sending mining operations to the moon, and maybe film crews into orbit.  It will be a while before you can sign up for zero-gravity painting at the local college.  With a bit of a leap of consciousness that leads me to another point:  Well down the line, when everybody can afford space travel, what will that mean?  The internet used to be a very different place.  The hurdles were partially cost but mostly technological.  By its nature it excluded most of the population.  Once those barriers were removed, the internet became much like highly-populated places on earth: dumped on.  Naive IE users get mugged by spyware, even long-time internet readers suddenly get bombarded with advertising at every turn  Cybersquatters grab domains to extort money from those who would actually make good use of them.  As someone who's always loved astronomy I just don't want to see the space we bring within reach become a commercialized dump.  I'm tellin' ya, billboards in space.  It will happen.  Even the heavens aren't sacred to those who spend their lives chasing dollars.
