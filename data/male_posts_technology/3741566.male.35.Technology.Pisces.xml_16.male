I’ll cover my experience with it and also give my thoughts on sexual orientation as a whole.  First, as usual, I’ll give you a bit of my prior history to bring you up to the present on this subject.  My mother and biological father split soon after I was born. Dea (  It was about this time that I started to understand that Dea’s constant hatred of all things male stemmed more from her sexual orientation than it did from anything that had actually occurred in her life. It became apparent that she was actually a gay woman living a lie and the destructive part of her personality was, in part, a result of her inner turmoil. Dea ended up getting married for a fourth time long after I had left for the Army. It was shortly after that last marriage that she finally came out as gay.  I say all this to make the point that I am very familiar with issues of sexual orientation. I grew up with a natural “gaydar” that has proven to be uncannily accurate over the years. Not only does my gaydar spot those who are strictly gay, it also spots those that are bi and strongly bi curious. In fact, throughout my dating years and beyond I have always been drawn to women that my gaydar tells me are at least bisexual.  So here I am thirty-five years old and married to a woman who is partially out as bisexual. It has been a long road for her and one that she has nowhere near completed.   This brings me to the portion of this post where I stop talking about what has happened in the past and start talking about the now. Why do people have such a hard time admitting to themselves their sexuality? When they finally do come out to a friend or lover it still takes years for them to fully come out about with ALL of their feelings and thoughts.   In the early 40’s Dr. Alfred Kinsey came out with a scale that describes human sexual orientation. This scale was meant to show that people’s sexuality is a fluid thing. Most people’s sexuality isn’t set in stone and actually changes over time. The scale goes something like this.  0 - exclusively heterosexual 1 - predominantly heterosexual, incidentally homosexual 2 - predominantly heterosexual, but more than incidentally homosexual 3 - equally heterosexual and homosexual 4 - predominantly homosexual, but more than incidentally heterosexual  5 - predominantly homosexual, incidentally heterosexual 6 - exclusively homosexual  My current sexual orientation would be a one. I have only had heterosexual relationships but I have certainly thought of having male-male sexual encounters and am not allergic to the idea as a whole. I however, couldn’t see and have had no fantasies about these encounters being anything but purely sexual in nature. I also have no problem telling my lovers how I feel about it and what I have thought about (much to the surprise of some). I also am not ashamed of it. Although I certainly wouldn’t go about announcing this to my closest male friends, that has more to do with the fact that my sexual fantasies, heterosexual or homosexual, have never been a topic of conversation with them and I see no reason it ever should be. My sexual orientation leans heavily to heterosexuality and at this point in my life I have no plans or desire to ever be involved in a homosexual relationship. If at some point in my life that were to change, and I were to want to pursue a relationship with a guy, I wouldn’t have an issue talking about it with anyone, just like I don’t have an issue talking about my heterosexual relationships with anyone.  My wife’s journey though this scale has been drastically different from mine. While I have only recently even considered a sexual encounter with the same sex, my wife has been thinking and experimenting with the same sex since long before I met her. On top of this, she has only very recently come to even tell me anywhere near the whole story. As of today, she would tell me that she is equally heterosexual and homosexual, a three on the Kinsey scale.   I believe that she is a firm four and if I were to be even more truthful with myself I would say 4.5. Let me explain.  We were still dating when Scottee first confessed that she liked women. Throughout the next ten years she was steadfast in statements that it was something she could live without and that it was something she didn’t think of often. Wendy came along and changed all that. She finally admitted to what I have known all along, that she often thinks of women and that, more times than not, she is thinking of women when she masturbates. She also has now admitted that she knows that she could be in a relationship with women without a guy involved and be perfectly happy.  She has come along way in a short period of time. She now is very open about looking at other women and will comment freely on their attributes where before she tried to hide it (although she has always been poor at hiding it).   Watching her in love with another person has been an experience of a lifetime for me. I have been able to look at it from the outside and watch all the stages as if I were watching it on television, somehow detached from it. The only thing that bothers me is that, even though I have assured her for years that her sexual orientation is not an issue with me, she continues to hold back. She still isn’t completely honest with me about it. How do I know this? There are some good clues and also some things she said straight out.  Let’s start with the clues.   1. Scottee has never been a real touchy-feely person with me. It has always been an issue in our relationship that it is usually I that has to initiate sex or tender moments. I hear her now plan and talk openly about initiating things with Wendy days and even weeks in advance.   2. Scottee has never been one to comment on my body. If I am nude around her, it is also rare that she looks at me or even notices my nudity. When Wendy, or any other woman that she has been with, has been nude around her she can’t take her eyes off her and usually that is followed by her can’t keeping her hands off of her. She will usually comment on it as well.  3. I have never seen Scottee have an orgasm faster or harder than she will when with a woman. The mere idea of a woman being in her bed is usually enough to have her hornier than at any other time. The look of bliss itself after she has spent a night or even a few hours with a woman, speaks volumes. Although we certainly have had great sex, the looks and the reactions she has to women are something that has never occurred with us.  Now we can cover the things that have said straight out.  1. After one particularly wonderful night with Wendy, she came home in a tizzy. She almost begged me to make love to her, and while making love, I asked her as I sometimes do, what percentage dyke she was. Her reply was 95%. She went on to say, that she must admit that women are usually on her mind 95% of the time and that she sexually enjoys women much more than men. It was a very good night of love making. She has said later that she only said that for my benefit (she knows that it turns me on to hear), but I’m not stupid, I know the truth when I hear a woman cry it out at the top of her lungs.  2. On many occasions she has admitted that she is more sexually aroused by the female form and that given a room full of beautiful women versus a room full of beautiful men where she could pick any ten people to sleep with, at lease nine of them would be women…preferably all at once. J  3. She has told me that if we weren’t together, it is very possible that she would be with a woman.  This doesn’t sound like a three on the Kinsey scale. A solid four, maybe four and a half.  I mention all this not because it makes me jealous. Ah, I can see that you might be thinking that I fib. Well the actual point is that none of that bothers me. Why? It is because I know that Scottee loves me. I also know that she enjoys my company, both in and out of bed. So what if she is more sexually attracted to someone else? I am certainly not in a competition that I am aware of. In fact, I like seeing the lust in her eyes as she stares at lovely women. I like hearing what her dirty mind is thinking during those times, and I like seeing her come out of a shell that she had put herself in for so many years. It actually brings us together in a very large way because it is something we both share in common.   So why is it that I had to wait ten years in order to enjoy this side of her? Why is it that so many women hide what it is that they feel and think? In this modern age it seems beyond foolish to blame it on society and certainly beyond foolish to say that it is looked down upon. Society actually seems to have embraced bisexuality among women. Even if they were to not want to shout it out in public, why hide it from the person you love the most? It makes no sense to me.  Take Wendy for example. I have no real idea where she falls on the Kinsey scale. I could only guess. Why? I think you’d have to ask her. She is a walking contradiction. She is in a relationship with a woman. She professes to be in love with a woman. She professes to be deeply attracted to a woman, but at the same time, she has professed to not find women attractive. She has said that Scottee is the only woman she has ever been attracted to. She has stated that she doesn’t look at other women sexually. She wouldn’t call herself bisexual.   All this can be quite confusing until you look at the facts. She IS in love with a woman. When in bed with Scottee and I, she normally is completely involved with Scottee, with little interest in me until after she has finished with her. She has admitted to frequently masturbating to the thought of other women, and just like with Scottee, it seems that the male form (or at least my male form) isn’t nearly as exciting to her as the female form.  It seems that we have the mouth saying one thing while the body does another. Why is it important to me? Well first of all, the inconsistencies bother me. Second, it seems to be a pattern that she isn’t the most truthful person I’ve met when it comes to her feelings and thoughts. If she isn’t truthful about something that so obviously isn’t an issue with me, what else will she hide? Third, she actually gets upset when I’ve brought the subject up. Now I stay away for it altogether. If we can’t talk about something so basic, what does that say about the relationship? Fourth, it is something we have in common. Now that I’ve seen how much it has brought Scottee and I closer, it seems a shame that I have to steer clear of the subject. Instead of it being some horrible thing, it could be something of an awakening. It seems that Wendy is always hiding something. When she isn’t hiding things from others she is hiding things from herself. It is exactly issues like this that stunt inner growth. Truth is the word and the word is truth. Truth will set you free.   As Kinsey so rightly pointed out, being attracted to the same sex doesn’t mean you are gay. In Wendy’s case, I see her about a three on the scale, regardless of her words, but that is only a guess since the truth may never be known.   Sexual orientation is a fluid thing and labeling yourself for all time as one thing or the other is senseless, and on the same note, denying your attractions and burying feelings that you have whether they are sexual or emotional, is deeply destructive to yourself. It keeps you from really discovering the person you are inside and might keep you from really enjoying life itself. How can you walk around and be a happy mentally healthy person if you keep telling yourself such negative things? Denying any feelings and thoughts is always negative. Embrace your desires and learn to figure out what they say about you as a person. To me, Scottee’s desires only tell me that she is a much more complicated person than others I have met. I see her ability to see through gender and love a person for who they are as maybe her greatest asset and I am grateful for it. I just wish that both of them could trust me enough to give me the complete story. I have always shared myself on that level, baring my soul to the core.   The knowledge that my wife prefers woman sexually or that my lover is as attracted to women as men would never bother me. The knowledge that they both keep so much of how they think and feel hidden from me is the thing that makes me sad and lonely.   Just my thoughts on dealing with a partner’s sexual orientation
