Hung out on Poipu beach all day and swam and tanned.  Got a call from this lady at Adecco that said the company (Inets – www.inets.com) that I interviewed with before wanted me to come back for another interview.  I told her that I wouldn’t be able to get back until Monday, so it looks like I will be interviewing again.  The job sounds pretty cool, though I don’t know everything about it.  It is direct hire, and it something along the lines of driving along the island all day and fixing clients computers, not sure who the client is yet though, sounds pretty sweet though.  Ate at Taqueria Nortenos which was some cheap ass Mexican food, then for dinner we ate at Roys.  Roys is crazy expensive, but the food is just some of the best, and after living off hot dogs and ramen noodles and other cheap food for so long, it was just heavenly.  I don’t even really like sweet food, but I had the signature “death by chocolate” dessert and it was pretty damn good.
