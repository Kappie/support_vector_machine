It was printed in a conservative publication.   urlLink http://www.amconmag.com/12_15_03/feature.html   And how far over the edge does a government have to go to get the following quote out of Pat Robertson?  "The Conservative movement has been hijacked and turned into a globalist, interventionist, open borders ideology, which is not the conservative movement I grew up with?"  So those in charge at the moment have scared the piss out of Pat Robertson. (If the irreverent reverend FLAWell starts quivering, I'll take that as one of the signs of the apocolypse.)  What is so troubling is the lengths at which the authorities are now going. It is one thing to ignore dissent, or to ridicule dissent. It is another thing altogether when the authorities will use draconian measures to stomp out dissent altogether. The images from the recent DNC in Boston, where protestors were rounded up into razor wired containment areas well away from the conventioneers were reminiscant of pictures of the internees at Guatanamo Bay, the ethnic prisoners in the Balkans, and yes, even of the Holocaust (did I mention I prefer the Patriot Act when read in it's original German? Inspiring.).  We have become political prisoners in our own countries, telling ourselves we still have democracy, yet opposing points of view are frowned upon, ridiculed, shamed, and threatened. Open debate is no longer permissable, and attempts at starting a dialogue are met with reactions such as "Go Fuck Yourself".  urlLink http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3699-2004Jun24.html   But of course, the royal court demands an apology when someone utters profanity in their direction, as well intentioned as it might be.  urlLink http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1036304/posts   So we know both sides can use profanity, though those sitting on the throne at the moment might resort to a beheading or two.  And they'll both have razor wires pens outside of their national conventions. And they'll both sling arrows at each other as they play along with the charade we call democracy. But when the votes are counted, or not counted as the case may be, did you really have a choice? Do you really think either millionairre has your interests at heart?
