Have been a few days without blogging and I am in a much better "space" right now :)  Have calmed down a lot about a few things that have pissed me off and I have decided some people aren't really worth getting stressed about.  I have discovered recently that some of my friends I have trusted too much and given more respect than they are due.. My friendship is something that is given freely and I will go out of my way for anyone, then I wait and see how the friendship develops. Sometimes the friendship develops wonderfully and I end up with friends I truely respect and would do anything for (Gordon is a good example of this.. In a short space of time I have come to have great respect\admiration\time for the big G). Sometimes, I don't...  Sometimes I get "friends" who have only one thing that is really important in their lives and that's them.. I don't really have the time\energy\desire to have friends that are only skin deep. I still spend time with them but in my own mind they are acquaintances that I will of course go out of my way to help and all the rest but you know it's something that you do in the knowledge that when the time comes and you need them there is a good chance they won't be there..  The other thing I spoke about in my last blogs was the people who think they know me.. There have been a ton of people over the years who think they know me and never really discover otherwise.. Hell I think sometimes even my closest friends don't really get certain areas of my life.. (At least with them they try and I do appreciate that..) There's been a few times in the last few months that two of my closest friends have really surprised me with things that they have said to me.. I just thought in my head "Wow.. I thought he knew me better than that.." when it happened.. Maybe I am too secretive with the stuff that really makes me what I am.. I know that sounds strange.. I talk on my blog about being sexually abused when I was younger, shaving my testicles, my history with girls and sometimes some pretty heavy details about what is going on in my life at the moment but the thing is that none of that is what I am or makes me who I am.. They are all things taht have happened or I choose to do but none of that defines who I am or represents what I think about things..  I have moments in my life that were special and I keep close to my heart and none of that really makes it here.. It's the kind of thing that only the people who get close to me ever hear and even then I can count the people that I have ever included in that group on one hand. I'm vaguely extroverted and I think too many people mistake my "public" face as being who I actually am.. When in fact nothing could be further from the truth..  An example would be my self confidence.. I have BUCKETS of self-confidence when it comes to certain things. I KNOW I am great at my Job. I know I will ALWAYS have a job if I want one. There are loads of areas and situations I feel confident in\about but when it comes down to it I actually have huge problems with my view of myself.. Hot or not was a real surprise for me because I truely thought I was an ugly guy.. I still think I am un-atractive and that the picture must just be a good pic that has some wierd lighting shit going on.. I figured being able to dance and having a strong air of self-confidence was why I managed to meet girls and my "winning personality" got me from there ;) Now I have a 9.3 to 9.4 sitting under my pic and I still can't comprehend it.. It just doesn't fit in my head at all.. (Or Karls ;]) And there are other areas of my life where my confidence is "strange" but I won't go into all that here ;)  Hmm.. What a strange blog this is turning into.. Anyway.. I'm gonna stop boring you all and get straight to the good stuff..  This Friday at 8PM we are all meeting in SIN in Temple Bar for drinkin' dancin' and celebrating another year on the planet for myself.. One and all are invited and they can all bring a friend :) The only requirement is that you come in a god damn good mood and ready to party :)  See you then :)
