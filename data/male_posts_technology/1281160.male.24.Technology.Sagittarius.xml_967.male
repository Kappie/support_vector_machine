I had been waiting to try it out for a long, long tiem, well almst a year to get my hands on a blog running on MT.  After a couple of tries, I finally got a free hosting at  urlLink Weblogs.us .  Pongal seems to be a start of a good month. Initally, I am transporting my " urlLink Quod scripsi, scripsi " blog  from  urlLink Blogger  to  urlLink jaxsays.weblogs.us . I have not transferred the entries there completely. Just to keep you informed, I have posted a poem there. Hope you like it. Please update your bookmarks to the new site.  Bye and have a happy Pongal. Jax.
