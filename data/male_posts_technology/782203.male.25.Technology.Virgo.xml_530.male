But she did call later and this was how the conversation went.   Me to A: Eh wasted you couldnt come, wanted to intro u to my friend.  A  to Me: Is he cute?  I  to Me: No tell her I am not cute.  Me to A: He says he's not cute but he has a really big dick.  *I looks at me horrified*  A : I'm not interested in that ! Me : Well I'm just trying to tell you all his good points, starting from the biggest.   OK might need to work on my matchmaking skills a bit more.   But this waitress there started chatting with me for quite a bit. That doesn't happen very often, I should buy 4D.
