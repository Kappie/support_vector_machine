"I don't think anyone watched it for sex and nudity," he said.  Mr. Koonin has to hope he is right, because the explicit sex and frontal nudity are precisely what have been edited out — along with a few select, and not infrequently used, words — as HBO's editors cleaned up the show for broadcast on TBS, which like HBO is a unit of Time Warner.   I think taking out the  urlLink sex out of Sex and the City  for air on TBS will make it a totally new and different show. Whether that new show is any good remains to be seen.
