It's sad when you wish that a server would crash or a hacker would decide your company looks up for the picking, anyway due to the lack of activity I decided to write a blog post. It gives me a chance to close my eyes and let my fingers do the typing... yes, I really do type blog posts with my eyes closed, so if I start randomly saying what I'm dreaming, don't blame me.  Anyway, on today. Yeah nothing too much going on. I didn't want to get up this morning, I was so tired. Sarah and her family got home last night so I stayed up iuntil like 12:30 talking to her cause it's been so long. It was nice to talk, I've missed it. The phone company was stupid and never sent us a phone bill, so they turned off our phone for the moment. My mom's going (or more likely already gone) to go in and yell at them about it today.  After work today I'm going to Katy's and we're like watching a movie until other people come and then everyone's going to the fair. It'll be neat but I'm not riding any rides or spending any money cause I'm broke and don't feel like mooching... I hope people don't decide to go out to eat.  On Friday my boss comes back from his camping trip, he'll find everything almost exactly the same as when he left, which may not sound like a good thing but it is, cause it means I'm not fired.      Saturday... I'm hoping to go to Sarah's on Saturday since we haven't seen eachother for so long. It's not a guarenteed thing but it'd be really nice if I could do. I'll have to check with my mom if it's ok to spend the night cause they've mentioned in the past that it's easier on them and I agree... and I'm not really in a position to complain about them allowing me to spend the night (as if I would complain). I'm hoping to go cause that'd be really awesome... even though I don't have her anniversary present yet (I'm getting it next week!). Also next week I am getting my surround sound speakers and the sound card for my computer, and the optical drives. After that there will only be the two video cards and the three monitors... and of course the desk, and then it will be complete. Fun fun.  I believe that's all I have to say for now, I'll post sometime in the future.
