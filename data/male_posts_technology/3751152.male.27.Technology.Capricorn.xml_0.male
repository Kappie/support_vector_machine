I chose a few that I wanted to post - and no, I promise I won't put yet another one of Jason ;)  Here ya go:   CAN1 - Ottawa   Jason grinding Will with a baguette.  I wish I had a photo of the bus pole grinding... or the video of him chasing me down the Rideau Centre with that baguette!    The guys in their boxers at Double Deckers pub.       CAN2 - Toronto   Jake  Russ show us there is no IN and OUT privileges with them!    Phil and Joey get into some heavy statue snogging!    Ahh some of these I almost forgot about :)
