Anybody seen the news about the new politically charged film coming out from Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the creators of "South Park"? Slated for theatrical release two weeks before the November election, "Team America" is a spoof on the war on terrorism starring ... puppets! Puppets, man! (Mir should love this.) It looks like it will skewer those on both sides of the aisle, from Bush and Cheney to Kerry and Michael Moore ... taking no prisoners!
