But that's good :D Gmail is pretty good, liking it so far, doesn't make huge differences to me because I don't use email a whole lot, biggest gripe atm though; can't apply filters to emails already received and archived! C'mon guys, that's a bit slack, I would imagine that to be a feature that should be incorporated into the filters part of it first up.. Hell, outlook express can do it!
