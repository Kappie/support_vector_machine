I also downloaded the Google toolbar to assist in picking web pages to add to my blog. I find I tend to get caught up in the whiz bang aspects but tend not to find actual uses for all of the stuff. It's all very neat but so far I am finding this rather pointless.  I guess I am not imaginative enough, or my expectations are to high. Still it's only my second day of playing with this. Maybe I will get into this maybe not.
