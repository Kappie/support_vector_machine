Just got out of a meeting about the upcoming work schedule for the project I'm working on. I'm questioning why I'm tailing off it earlier than some of the other people on it. It either means they have something else in store for me, or it's unemployment.  That's the life of a freelance contractor tho. Lack of security vs working freedom is the trade-off. Then again, define job security. I like what I do tho. Easy money. Ideally I want to work 2 thirds of the year and spend the last third doing nothing (i.e playing, vacationing, fishing...sleeping). I almost do that now, tho more randomly. I just need to establish the pattern to take me thru the rest of my life.
