Today is her first day of classes, for three weeks, then off to do her practical training. *Sigh* So far away we are from each other.   Work is work. My big boss sent me an SMS yesterday to call for a meeting this morning at 8.30am. This morning, as I was entering his room for the discussion, he stood up and said he was hungry and asked me whether I was hungry as well. Before I could answer, he said "Let's go to level 7 for breakfast". So we did, with another colleague of mine. So we had the discussion there.   Didn't do much over the weekend. Just sat at home, either reading, walking around, looking for food, or watcing dvds'. Just lazed around. So not in the mood. I wonder when I'll snap out of it. Maybe it's taking longer because the time we spent together this time was longer and more fulfilling.  Saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Quite a good movie, actually. And like someone said to me earlier, it's not like the first two. The first two is, for lack of a better word, childish. This movie is quite dark and forbidding. And it's so illogical, but then again, that's the appeal, huh. I don't know, I think I like the first two better.   Saw "The Patriot". The one with Mel Gibson. Saw it alone on Saturday. Then when my parents came back from somewhere, saw it with them. In the end, my parents saw it again. I like the movie tremendously. Almost as much as "Braveheart". It's almost the same, isn't it. I mean, the hero loses someone he loves. Then he avenges their death. But darn good movie, nevertheless.  Saw "Desperate Measures". Andy Garcia and Micheal Keaton. Yes, I was bored that weekend. That's why I saw so many movies. Saw it with my mother, then my father and niece joined us. In the end, I was bored with the movie. So I started reading a book. Heheheh...  Can't seem to concentrate too well these days. Actually, I can. But when I'm not doing anything, then I'll feel it. The emptiness, the boredom, the loneliness. It's not as bad as it sounds, trust me. Just need to get over this thick sense of loneliness enveloping me.   I can't believe I actually wrote all of that. I am seldom open with people. I do sometimes, but not often. I'd rather listen than talk.
