That statement is at the heart of the war on file sharing, both of music and movies, and underpins lawsuits against thousands of  music fans, as well as legislation approved last week by a House  Judiciary subcommittee that would create federal penalties for  using what is known as peer-to-peer technology to download  copyrighted works. It is also part of the reason that the Justice  Department introduced an intellectual-property task force last  week that plans to step up criminal prosecutions of copyright  infringers.  But what if the industry is wrong, and file sharing is not  hurting record sales?  It might seem counterintuitive, but that is the conclusion  reached by two economists who released a draft last week of the  first study that makes a rigorous economic comparison of directly  observed activity on file-sharing networks and music buying.  "Downloads have an effect on sales which is statistically  indistinguishable from zero, despite rather precise estimates,"  write its authors, Felix Oberholzer-Gee of the Harvard Business  School and Koleman S. Strumpf of the University of North Carolina  at Chapel Hill.  The industry has reacted with the kind of flustered consternation  that the White House might display if Richard A. Clarke showed up  at a Rose Garden tea party. Last week, the Recording Industry  Association of America sent out three versions of a six-page  response to the study.  The problem with the industry view, Professors Oberholzer-Gee and  Strumpf say, is that it is not supported by solid evidence.  Previous studies have failed because they tend to depend on  surveys, and the authors contend that surveys of illegal activity  are not trustworthy. "Those who agree to have their Internet  behavior discussed or monitored are unlikely to be representative  of all Internet users," the authors wrote.  Instead, they analyzed the direct data of music downloaders over a  17-week period in the fall of 2002, and compared that activity  with actual music purchases during that time. Using complex  mathematical formulas, they determined that spikes in downloading  had almost no discernible effect on sales. Even under their  worst-case example, "it would take 5,000 downloads to reduce the  sales of an album by one copy," they wrote. "After annualizing,  this would imply a yearly sales loss of two million albums, which  is virtually rounding error" given that 803 million records were  sold in 2002. Sales dropped by 139 million albums from 2000 to 2002.  "While downloads occur on a vast scale, most users are likely  individuals who would not have bought the album even in the absence  of file sharing," the professors wrote.  In an interview, Professor Oberholzer-Gee said that previous  research assumed that every download could be thought of as a lost  sale. In fact, he said, most downloaders were drawn to free music  and were unlikely to spend $18 on a CD.  "Say I offer you a free flight to Florida," he asks. "How likely  is it that you will go to Florida? It is very likely, because the  price is free." If there were no free ticket, that trip to Florida  would be much less likely, he said. Similarly, free music might  draw all kinds of people, but "it doesn't mean that these people  would buy CD's at $18," he said.  The most popular albums bought are also the most popular  downloads, so the researchers looked for anomalous rises  in downloading activity that they might compare to sales  activity. They found one such spike, Professor Oberholzer-Gee  said, during a German school holiday that occurred during the  time they studied. Germany is second to the United States in  making files available for downloading, supplying about 15  percent of online music files, he said. During the vacation,  students who were home with time on their hands flooded the  Internet with new files, which in turn spurred new downloading  activity. The researchers then looked for any possible impact in  the subsequent weeks on sales of CD's.  Professor Oberholzer said that he had expected to find that  downloading resulted in some harm to the industry, and was startled  when he first ran the numbers in the spring of 2003. "I called  Koleman and said, 'Something is not quite right - there seems to be  no effect between file sharing and sales.' "  Amy Weiss, an industry spokeswoman, expressed incredulity at what  she deemed an "incomprehensible" study, and she ridiculed the  notion that a relatively small sample of downloads could shed  light on the universe of activity.  The industry response, titled "Downloading Hurts Sales," concludes:  "If file sharing has no negative impact on the purchasing patterns of  the top selling records, how do you account for the fact that,  according to SoundScan, the decrease of Top 10 selling albums in  each of the last four years is: 2000, 60 million units; 2001,  40 million units; 2002, 34 million units; 2003, 33 million units?"  Critics of the industry's stance have long suggested that other  factors might be contributing to the drop in sales, including a  slow economy, fewer new releases and a consolidation of radio  networks that has resulted in less variety on the airwaves. Some  market experts have also suggested that record sales in the 1990's  might have been abnormally high as people bought CD's to replace  their vinyl record collections.  "The single-bullet theory employed by the R.I.A.A. has always  been considered by anyone with even a modicum of economic  knowledge to be pretty ambitious as spin," said Joe Fleischer,  the head of sales and marketing for BigChampagne, a company that  tracks music downloads and is used by some record companies to  measure the popularity of songs for marketing purposes.  The industry response stresses that the new study has not gone  through the process of peer review. But the response cites  refuting statistics and analysis, much of it prepared by market  research consultants, that also have not gone through peer  review.  One consultant, Russ Crupnick, vice president of the NPD Group,  called the report "absolutely astounding." Asked to explain how  the professors' analysis might be mistaken, he said he was still  trying to understand the complex document: "I am not the level  of mathematician that the professors purport to be."  Stan Liebowitz of the University of Texas at Dallas, author of  an essay cited by the industry, said the use of a German holiday  to judge American behavior was strained. Professor Liebowitz  argued in a paper in 2002 that file sharing did not affect music  sales, but said he had since changed his mind.  The Liebowitz essay appeared in an economics journal edited by  Gary D. Libecap, a professor of economics at the University of  Arizona, who said that his publication was not peer reviewed,  though the articles in it were often based on peer-reviewed work.  Professor Libecap said he attended a presentation by Professor  Strumpf last week, and said the file-sharing study "looks really  good to me."  "This was really careful, empirical work," Professor Libecap said.  The author of another report recommended by the industry said that  the two sets of data used by the researchers should not be compared.  "They can't get to that using the two sets of data they are  using - they aren't tracking individual behavior," said Jayne  Charneski, formerly of Edison Media Research, who prepared a report  last June that she said showed that 7 percent of the marketplace  consists of people who download music and do not buy it. That  number is far lower than the authors of the new study estimated.  "There's a lot of research out there that's conducted with an  agenda in mind," said Ms. Charneski, now the head of research  for the record label EMI.
