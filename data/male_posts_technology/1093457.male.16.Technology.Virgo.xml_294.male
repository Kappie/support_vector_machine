I think  urlLink Darren  did, I'm not sure. Didn't leave until about 07.00PM. Why? Well the coach was late. Then they had to keep repacking the luggage bit because there wasn't enough room. Plus there was a big ol crack in the front of the upper section which they thought was dangerous. Because of the late start we missed about 3 ferrys to France. Eventually we got on one at about 10.30PM. While waiting to get booked on this ferry we had great fun at the front of the coach taking  urlLink pictures ! And generally being hyper. The coach trips there and back were probably the best bit of the trip!  urlLink Madness ! To get to our designated (love that word) hotel we had to pass through France,  urlLink Switzerland  and Italy. Long trip but fun. The hotel was cool, had to  urlLink get up  each morning at 7am! There were many o amusing moments throughout the week. In Verona  urlLink Jane  ate a Kinder egg. The toy was this Virgin Mary staute so we built it and put it at the front of the coach. About a minute later a nun crossed the road!!!!!  We even brought some football shirts and made our own  urlLink team ! If ever to go to Venice make sure you get a ride on the  urlLink gondalas . Take an art book! Do some  urlLink sketching ! Ever met  urlLink Peggy ? Of course we were  urlLink cream-crackered  on the way home. Maybe that was because were up  urlLink late .... But whenever you go on a group holiday, always take a  urlLink group photo .
