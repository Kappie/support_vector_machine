I indented all of the blockquote like normal, but I also indented the first line as you would for a new paragraph. Pretty lame thing to lose 2 points on. =/ I mean, at least I was consistant in it.  I believe I also did quite well on the final exam, which was 60 questions and an in-class essay about frequent testing in classes bleh.   So yeah...    -intX    blasphemy
