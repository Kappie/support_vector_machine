The first week seemed very long but this past week has flown by and I'm sure it's going going to get any slower. The pace at work is picking up as the different teams start producing their work and the task of integrating all comes up. In particular, because I'm only here for a limited time, I have to try and get my parts working and coded so that other people can understand it.  This weekend I'm not heading off with the others to Belgium but instead I'm going to spend some time in Glasgow getting my bearings and doing some exploring. In case you haven't heard I sent my application off last week in the chance that I could get my application back quickly. I came back very quickly but unfortnunately without the visa. It appears that I have to apply from Australia, my country of residence. I've checked out some other consulates and it looks like it's the same! Had I come from  urlLink Malaysia, Singapore, Fiji or even Tuvalu  I could turn up at the Swiss immigration and they would be able to provide me with a visa on the spot, but because I'm Indonesian... no way. However, it could be possible to send my passport and application all the way back to Australia and then I could visit John in Zurich. I'll just have to be more organised if I come here again but it's just a shame that I can't go with others because they usually just decide a couple weeks before going and say, "Hey, anyone want to go to Spain?"  Such is life...  However some good things have come out of not being able to go to Brussels, firstly Monday is going to be a public holiday and everything is going to be shut. So There are a few of us going to go into work and that means I get a day off in lieu (sp?) -- that means I get to hopefully have a long weekend with Kaia in stead! (yay!) Also last night when I went to have some drinks with the others after work, I met Tracy, Julie and Simon (can't remember his name!). They're all big Rangers fans so they've invited me to go and watch the Rangers match at the pub on Sunday... but we have to meet up at 11 even though the game starts at 3! FIVE hours and that's even before the first kick! I think I'll have to pace myself, these pots are awfully big! And finally, today I did some exploring -- going all the way up Sauchiehall St to Glasgow University... the area around there is really cool! It's a much younger area and of course lots of students around. As I was walking up I saw some towers that just appeared out of nowhere. So I went up and had a look and found one was an old church which was now offices for lease and the other one had been converted into offices too. But I kept on wandering up the hill and found myself in Park Circus where there are residences for students. There's a circle of houses on the top of this hill and it looks very much like those multi-storeyed houses from Mary Poppins. And right in the middle is a small park. From one of the streets that radiate out, there is a veiw over a huge park and you can see on the next hill the tall spire from Glasgow Uni. It's a pretty amazing sight... RMIT sure doesn't have anything that compares!  So I walked up to the Uni around the back way where there was more student accommodation. Lost the uni spire but found it again when I turned a corner and headed towards it past the library. It's pretty scenic for student accomodation but I guess it's pretty small inside those places... and cold. I kept on heading down right into the uni grounds and went around one side where there was a little court with more of those mary-poppins houses. I guess some of the lecturers must live in them. Then I walked then around the front and through an archway into one of the courtyards in the middle. There was a file of students heading somewhere onthe other side so I meandered around to see where they were going. It must have been exam time because everyone was just hanging around with notes, waiting to go into a door. There must have been a few other exams at the same time because in another courtyard there were more groups hanging around. I didn't want to seem to much of a tourist so I wandered around to the other side and took a few photos... it was just an amazing building. The buildings are made of this deep reed sandstone and everything looks like it just has this  history  to it.  After wandering around the uni I walked down the hill and cool shopping strip in Byres Rd. (The fire alarm went off again - it's about 6:30 so it must be someone's dinner again!) Had the best coffee and lemon torte at a place called Tinderbox. It was also a great place to escape from the weather! It was all nice and sunny the whole day and then it just started bucketing down. The weather changes faster than it does in Melborune for sure. The street had also a lot of other pretty cool (and the fire alarm just went off again - don't these people learn!) shops and cafes. Definitely a place to visit again :o)  After my coffee and watching people go by, I thought I'd try and head down to the River Clyde and to the Scottish Exhibition  Conference Centre which I tink is the one that looks like big silver mussel. But I couldn't find the right road to go down and the scenery was starting to get a bit industrial. The path back towards the motorway and the city centre again was pretty ordinary and I ended up going through a part of town that had what looked like commision housing. I eventually got back over the motorway and was on the city centre side. Thinking the area down by the River Clyde would be a bit more scenic...  Ohh, the TATU video clip has just come on... I wonder if this is the controvercial one? It's the one where there's two girls (and I mean girls, they look like about 16) driving some big tanker through the snow. The song's a bit boring.. .."theyr'e not gonna get us.." in a high pitched whine over and over again.. it sucks :oP    Well, the Rivery Clyde is big and wide and the area down there is a bit boring. There really isn't much to look at... but maybe it was the wrong end of the Clyde.  Oh my god! Someone has made a video clip with "McDonald's, McDonalds, Kentucky Fried Chicken and a Pizza Hut". oh God, it's awful! There's two chicks, 1 guy and a big blue dog... and it's No.1 of some chart. It's soo bad. Who's sick idea is this?? I swear this is some form of torture!   Well this post is just getting a bit too long and my tummy is rumbling... OH! I just remember what's on TV tonight... the Eurovision Song Contest. I thought I'd just watched some bad music... now's there's a whole show of them! (what's happening to me???) I think I'm just a little tired after walking for about 5 hours.  will post soon and I'll try not to make them so long :o) -gede
