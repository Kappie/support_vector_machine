Some weeks Tuesday was the best day.. $3.00 pitchers of PBR all night long at Moes and Hoes. Some weeks, Sunday was the best day because of all the NFL sportsbooking options. Hell when I was 11 I thought Thursdays were the best days because I got to fuck around at Hebrew School and eat a Kit Kat bar. But now, without a doubt, Fridays are the best fucking days on earth. And you know what day is even better than Friday? Payday Friday. Pay me, bitches!  "I know you don't smoke weed, I know this; but I'm gonna get you high today, 'cause it's Friday; you ain't got no job... and you ain't got shit to do."  If you dont know that quote stop reading, close the browser, never come here again. How damn good does it feel to geek out of work on a friday at like 4ish and its sunny as hell outside and you have a fat load of cash waiting to be spent over the next 2 weeks. I feel like Dave Chapelle when he leaves work in Half Baked and as soon as he steps outside he's like "FREEEEEE!!!" Of course, I'm no custodian...janitor, if you wanna be a dick about it.  So most Fridays I try to skance out a date with a girl who wants to get hella money spent on her. I mean, she gets to have a good time, I get to have a good time, its a good situation for all parties. When that (most of the time) fails to happen, I turn to any other activity besides a bar. Concerts if there are any, cool shit going on in this town, anything to spend some money and get fucked up and do something different. But some Fridays are meant for doing something chill...something to relax, get a little extra sleep in, because Saturday and Sunday are going to be crazy yo. What is a way that you can do something a little different from the standard weekend and still spend as much money as your heart desires?  Road Trip. And not just any road trip... not a trip into tents and camping and nature and all that shit. Fuck that shit. I am cruising down to where the gulf of mexico crashes into the white sand dunes, to where you can smell the salt in the air as soon as you cross the bridge, a place where dreams are made and shattered in the blink of an eye, where the donuts are warm, the hot dogs are rolling around on an endless loop just waiting for some freeloader to scoop one up on his quick bathroom/snack break, a place where grinding out 3 hours of sleep in the backseat is just easier than getting a hotel room, where the weather doesnt matter and time stands still because there are no clocks anywhere in site. Thats right mother fuckers, I am going to  urlLink Biloxi Grand Casino  this weekend.  Wish me luck! (Although its not about luck in my game)
