There is truly a new regulation under review that would require new aircraft to be quieter than lawnmowers.  I don't need to tell you how ridiculous this is.  This gets lumped into the same ridiculous pile as "Two Foot N Numbers."  For those of you who don't know, an N number is the aircraft identification number unique to each aircraft.  All aircraft in the United States begin with N.  For example, the aircraft I soloed in for the first time was N968SP.  Anyway, a group of concerned citizens wanted to put two foot high N numbers on the underside of general aviation aircraft so that they could identify noisy aircraft and sue the pilots.  Hey, I got a tip for you folks.  If you don't like the sound of small planes, don't build your house at the end of  urlLink Westchester County Airport's Runway 34 .  If these folks had their way, half the airports in this country would be shut down, and then they'd wonder why it suddenly takes three weeks to their  Sex and the City  box set shipped out to their place in the Hamptons.
