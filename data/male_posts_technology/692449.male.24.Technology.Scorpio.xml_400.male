According to the UN, the money could have helped prevent 77,000 infant and child deaths, 800,000 induced abortions and maternal deaths as well as 2 million unwanted pregnancies. Congress member Carolyn Maloney of New York accused Bush of putting politics above the health of women. She said, ''This is simply pandering to the right-wing mullahs of this country.”
