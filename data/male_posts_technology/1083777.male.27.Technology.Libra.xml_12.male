Another Spaniard, this time of the French Ag2r squad, Mikel Astarloa with 7.98 litres.   The race’s lightest rider is the Russian Alexandre Botcharov at a frankly puny 54.5 kilograms, while the heaviest rider is Sweden’s Magnus Backstedt (Alessio-Bianchi) who will fly down the mountains thanks to his gravity-embracing 98 kilograms.   But the big Swede is prevented taking first prize in the tallest rider competition. Instead, the title goes to a Frenchman: Guillaume Auger of RAGT at 1.96 metres. French fans must be going crazy: there’s a second win for them, too, thanks to Ag2r’s Samuel Dumoulin who obviously never ate his greens, measuring just 1.58 metres.   Among the Tour’s 188 starters, average height is 1.79 metres, average weight is 69.9kg, average lung capacity is 5.74 litres, while the Tour peloton’s average heart rate is 51 beats per minute.
