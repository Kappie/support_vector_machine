Granted these are words i'm saying right now and don't know 'bout the future, yet i've read so many journals that just rant  rant  rant about garbage! This journal is not just about the personal troubles I go through (anymore), its about progression  progressive thought. This journal is my voice to persons who know me not and to those who only thought they knew. It will become the simplicity that explains where sometimes my conversation may seem erratically deep.      ...is it just me or is it time for some college football lol? 40 more days until Clemson starts the 2004 campaign. I predict a 2nd place finish behind a overachieving Miami squad, third for FSU who for the 2nd year in a row won't be able to stop the roar of the Tigers.      The YMCL @ church is hosting a Madden 2004 championship tournament this Saturday. I considered myself an early favorite until Earl W. confirmed he would be there. Him  his boy Greg have been up on sports games since the days of NBA Jam. I'm pretty solid in Madden and can safely say that nobody in the church outside of Earl (aka Easy, who very rarely even comes to Mt. Olive as it is) can lay a finger on me. so the real game will be between me  him for the championship. Be nice if I could beat him on my own system...be even nicer if I could win period.      My CD The Singletons - Pour Out Your Holy Spirit arrived today. I bought it used off Ebay for only 7+ bones...great deal! This album will be getting plenty of spins in my cd player! One of the undermarketed gems of the gospel music fare in 2002, its filled with beautiful, spiritually enriching tracks from the production of Fred Hammond. I give it a high recommendation!    I place the soles of my feet
