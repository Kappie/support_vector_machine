When exactly did Manchester become the centre of England?  The reason given for the two grounds that have been chosen is the fact that they are the biggest in the country.It's all down to FA greed, the games could be shared with other cities such as Birmingham or Liverpool.The only problem is the FA will not get as much gate money.So what's a few quid compared to keeping a fresh atmosphere which you would get if the games were spread around and giving more people their last chance to see England in a quality game outside stinking London.It's only fair the games should be held outside London because when the new Wembley stadium is built the rest of England will never see another international game, but that's another argument.  urlLink BBC SPORT
