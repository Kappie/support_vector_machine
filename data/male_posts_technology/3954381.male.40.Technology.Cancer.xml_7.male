I can currently attract chubby chasers but who wants to be with someone that is into the one thing you would give anything to change about oneself. Besides as soon as they learn that you are actually going through a "ReInvention" they are out of here.   As for hooking up....well let's just say that's being put on hold as well...Meaningless encounters are actually ok in my book but I just want to focus a few months on myself to improve myself overall. Maybe by Christmas I will be in decent enough shape so my self confidance will allow me to have some fun.  Of course, that doesn't mean I won't be online, or even in a chat room......but that will be background white noise....and if someone should, by chance, actually contact me and want to meet me...well far be it from me to disappoint them. :)  Sorry this entry is boring......but I am pretty tired from the weekend and walking tonight. Oy tomorrow is a PT night; it was bad enough when Jose had to take my measurements in the beginning, and despite being smaller (I am convinced) now that I know him a little better I just find it a little embarassing and humiliating to have to strip in front of him and allow myself to be measured around the circumference as though I were some big ass pumpkin in the county fair.
