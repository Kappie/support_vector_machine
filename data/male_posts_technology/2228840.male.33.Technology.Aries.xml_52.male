The city could have gone crazy with celebration... but they lost. I could have written a happy blog... but they lost.  I'm not going to get into the game this time. I just don't think I have it in me. This whole city was holding their breath, waiting for the  Big Moment  to arrive, but it never did. Now, we all just feel deflated.  However, it's not over yet... This crushing loss was only Game 6. Monday night will tell the final tale of the  2004 Stanley Cup Finals . The Flames are undoubtedly already on their way back to Florida to prepare for the winner-takes-all  Game 7 . I just hope they can do it...  Until then...
