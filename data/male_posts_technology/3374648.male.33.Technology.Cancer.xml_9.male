I finally had to take some action about something I thought was just part of me, but in fact is a growing and potentially serious problem.  The problem - I have a temper.   It's always been bad, and I always have had a short fuse. That hasn't necessarily been a problem in the past, but these days I find my fuse increasingly short, and the consequent rage brighter and hotter then ever before. It's been getting progressively worse over the last year.  The main consolation I have is that I'm not a physically violent person, and I've never raised a hand to a woman in my life. Nor have I - or would I - ever smack my children.  Not that it's much of a consolation when I'm terrifying my poor new wife and my stepchildren, shouting like an ogre and prowling the rooms of the flat.  As my darling wife puts it, 'when you're good you're very very good, and when you're bad. . .'  This is not something I want to be. And especially with the people I love most in the world.  SO - after a weekend of tears shed on both sides, I realised that I can no longer blame others for my personal failings. It's always been a case of 'you shouldn't say that to me/do that/ignore me/be sarcastic/insert piss-poor abdication of responsibility here', and I've never taken a long, cold, objective look at the face in the mirror and admitted the truth.  I have an anger problem. I am on the dangerous borderline of being an abusive person and I need help to stop.  These were my words on Sunday morning, spoken out of the depths of desperation and fear - and, finally, recognition. No more excuses. No more shifting the blame. It's down to me to seek help and work on fixing the problem.  The result was that first thing this morning I was in front of my doctor, opening myself to her scrutiny and (unspoken) judgement, something I would never have done before.  And the amazing thing - she told me that in my area (Oxfordshire) there are NO Anger Management referrals available through the NHS - they're only handled through Thames Valley Police and the courts.   Meaning that if you recognise you have a problem and ask for help, you won't get it. However, if you punch your wife in the face, then you're entitled to a free course!   Anyway, I don't want to get into a rant about that, as it just shows up the inequities of the current system. And I don't have private health insurance, sadly. So we talked about other options.  Well, the only other option (apart from a two-month waiting list for a referral to the counselling service, which I've also taken) is - you guessed it - Prozac.  I'm now a member of the Prozac Nation.  I thought I would feel scared - I certainly did when I contemplated the possibility of it before going to the surgery this morning. Before today, the idea of regulating my body's chemical generation with something like Prozac would have been anathema - while I do smoke and drink, I've never used controlled - or overtly controlling - substances since a puff of a joint 17 years ago.  But I was surprised to find that now, with the bare choices in front of me, I welcome the chance to perform exactly that regulation. If I'm not capable of controlling or moderating my behaviour through normal methods, then this is my best hope of support as I try and learn to make changes.  And I don't want to risk the most important things in my life - my wife and children.   My wife is an incredible person. She works harder than just about anyone I know, holding down two jobs, working till ten most nights. She is always there for those who need her, whether it's a customer in her day job needing help with their bike, or a member of  urlLink  Babyworld  with a problem.  And she's always been there for me. When things were hard professionally, and I was on the verge of a breakdown, it was Lou who helped me through over a month of depression and physical illness. She helped me through the loss of a close friend through the same professional debacle.  I adore my stepkids - my article for Babyworld, also posted on this blog, outlines just how much I love them.  I will not allow my personal problems and demons to take my family away from me.  So Lou, if you're reading this - I'm sorry for who I become at the wrong time. I am sorry that you seem to have married a Jekyll and Hyde character. But with your love and support, I will make the changes.   I will make the good person I am most of the time the whole of me, and work every day from this moment on to be the man that a good heart like yours deserves.  This wasn't supposed to be a love letter. But I think that if I'm going to write about my problem and my progress, I should recognise and write about the person who also has to face it.   And I love her. With all my heart and soul.  And for her, my children and myself, I will beat the demons.  For Louise xxx
