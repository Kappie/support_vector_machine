I mean, there should be ceremonies and tributes, and I will be among the millions tuning in to watch. But I will bet that every TV station (both Canadian and American) plans to cover these ceremonies repeatedly from 6am til mindnight.   Now, I am all for "complete coverage" of important events, but there should be an element of viewer choice in the matter. I should be allowed to tune away - watch something else. Why should every TV channel from 3 to 33 devote a dozen or more programming hours to the same event? What's the point? What's the difference between one network covering the event and dozens?  Yes, I understand it's in a competitive environment, this is an opportunity too good for the TV networks to turn down. Hundreds of millions of people will watch some part of the ceremony that day. And the programming doesn't cost the networks one penny (unlike the Super Bowl or World Series, which costs hundred of millions of dollars to license from the sports leagues). And you can say that any network that has any "news" credibility will have to cover it like any important news story - why should CNN get all the glory (and ratings)?  Anyways, this has nothing to do with the tragedy itself, but the asinine way tv networks all "need" to be there to cover it, leaving us the viewer with no real choice (but to turn the TV off I guess).
