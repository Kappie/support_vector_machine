Our volunteer troops were too soft and the Iraqis were just too tough. As with most things that are based on facts and figures and not opinion they were wrong. They told us that federal programs were cut under Bush one. Actually the growth rate of some programs were slowed. So that 10 Billions plus 2 Billion became a cut. I don’t think Dan Rather knew math well enough to know that was not a cut. Some democrat told him it was a cut and neither Mr. Rather nor his staff was smart enough to know. All of the big media folks hang around with liberals so they don’t know what the rest of us know. People like Dan just read a script that is written for them. They don’t know a thing, they don’t write the script or research it. They just read it. They are either villains working for the enemy or the village idiots and being a charitable writer I will give them the benefit of the doubt – they are stupid and lazy.      Next we were told George W. Bush was stupid. The man has an M B A from Harvard. We have some graduate of Carolina in Liberal Arts that can’t do math telling us that Gore, a divinity School dropout, is a genius and a man with a Masters from Harvard is dumb. This is not difficult to see through.       Next we were told we stood no chance in Afghanistan. The Russians had found it impossible. We would also. There would be 1000’s of casualties. It was another Vietnam. By the way, Every war that a Democrat does not start is another Vietnam. As usual the press was wrong.      Now we are hearing Iraq too is a Vietnam. Who we are turning the country over to is the official question of the day, everyday. To me the question is not, “Who is George Bush turning Iraq over to?” It is instead, “Who would John Kerry surrender to?”       With the Death of Ronald Reagan the press is trying act like Reagan did not win the Cold War and his tax cuts did not help the economy.  With the tax cut tax receipts actually went up, not down. But a Democratic Congress spent money faster than it came in. The good economy we are told came from Bill Clinton’s actions. Which brings up the question how many affairs with interns does it take to get the economy moving. We are being told Jimmy Carter was a great President. If he had beat Reagan he might have surrendered to the Soviet Union or even Iran.
