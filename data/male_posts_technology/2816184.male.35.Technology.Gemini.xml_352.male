I am no leader - I just like a good mystery is all... so why don't you grab a seat and humour us with your presence and intelligent brain.... and maybe just maybe you migt be able to help us put together the details of this very bizarre puzzle....   {Insert entire story here the whole deal.... every detail - all of it }  Soooooooooooooooooooooooooo   if you didn't hire those goons to kidnap Zara and bring her to the abandoned Electrimas building - why did we have to escape by stealing your van or else they were going to bow us to bits?
