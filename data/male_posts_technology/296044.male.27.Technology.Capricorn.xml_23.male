So do you ever wonder, when it's time stop living up here, and start living down here?  Oh my God.  I want to smack whoever wrote that line.  Anyone know what I'm taking about?  8 Mile.  New movie with Eminem in it.  Yeah, today's topic is how people try to be cool and turn out being more cheesy than Cheesy Bread.  (Good stuff by the way)  So let's take a good current example.  8 Mile.  I have not seen this movie nor will I.  You know, I'd love to give Eminem a chance and see what kind of actor he can be, but when the preview for the movie starts with the line above, I lose all respect for it immediately.  I assume Eminem has some contacts in Hollywood, and said something like, "You know, I think you should make a movie about a guy on the streets who tries to do something with his life"  Oh, cause that's never been done before.  Especially by a music star.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.  On the other hand, movies that I've seen lately that don't suck:  "The Ring" - A bit cheesy, but imagery is fantastic, if you like pyscho stuff that makes little sense.  How many surrealists does it take to change a light bulb?  Answer: A fish.  "Signs" - No one I know seems to understand that this is A MOVIE.  For Godsakes, stop taking it so damn seriously.  It's just about having faith.  It's good.  Now shut up.  "Austin Powers: Goldmember"  - Totally dumb funny.  That's it.  See ya in a few.
