Fighting back yawns, eyes squinting to see the text and numbers , that are symbols of companies , transaction and stuff.  Yeah the dreaded night shift , graveyard shift. i am working today and tomorrow night. No matter how long i slept during the day , i have not been able to combat the long hours of non sleep.  Thankfully my partner in this graveyard shift have given me the permission to sleep as he knows and he saw the my swollen eye bags. But even then , i am quite hesistant to sleep during my work and will try every way to stay awake. Every now and then the software reminder of our daily task list , emits a police siren signaling the beginning of a new task....rings and echoes in my ears and my mind , waking me up from a blissful sleep to reality    I am somehow reminded of how hard is it for the disciples to stay awake and pray in the middle of the night before Christ is crucified... The night that they were supposed to be watchful , alert and in prayer. I guess it signifies our attitude even in the end days, that we are watchful for God's return in prayer and aletness.  What's with now..is that this monday...Addressing this to Melissa, Wai Nyan , Siew Ching, Yunn Hann and anyone else in Simply ,. are u guys free on 8pm for dinner together and then later talk .,,,juz talk...  If you are , please email me quick and i will again remind u guys in church tomorrow.
