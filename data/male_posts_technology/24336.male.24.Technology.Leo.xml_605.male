The starting QB and the starting RB, plowing directly into each other.  Too bad I was the taller of the two as my nose connected to his forehead.   The blood started flowing immediately.  This week, I jammed my middle finger on my right hand before the game started.   That wouldn't have been that bad but I was starting QB!  I couldn't feather out my floating passes like I wanted to and the team can't catch bullet passes.   I gave up five interceptions, I believe.
