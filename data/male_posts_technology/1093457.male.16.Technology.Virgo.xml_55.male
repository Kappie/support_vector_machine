And about skating, just tell me the date your going and I will tell if I can go or not. Its much easier that way. I don't usually go out anyway. I'm not socialble, really. I am out next weekend, hopefully I'll be in Croydon with Angela spending my vouchers. Or maybe I will buy a train ticket and go all the way down to lands End and back.
