Those fun memories...the fun...the sad...the happy...the romantic....It has been torturing sometimes to think about as it is so sweet that you can smile to yourself and still feel happy about it and on the other hand you feel the sudden emotion of sadness overcome you the next moment.   It's more than five years already. The feeling is so strong those time. But although I have already move on....from time to time i cannot help myself by not remembering it or recalling once a blue moon. I am a human afterall.  Meanwhile I feel like out of job.....damn it....I feel so unease at home doing nothing but packing my room sorting out some admin stuff for my company....but i earn shit.....No one say it is easy to start off your own....  And this is just the start of the uneasiness...i guess there is more to come. We shall see to it.
