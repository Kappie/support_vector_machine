Courtney and I tied the knot officially on May 28, 2004 at about 11.00 am at the Justice of the Peace in Beaumont.    Afterwards we went up to Toledo Bend Lake and stayed there until Sunday (I was working for double-time on Memorial Day so we couldn't stay longer).  Everyone has asked if it felt any different being married and honestly it doesn't at all.  We ahve been together long enough all ready, I suppose to move past the "I'm living with someone blues" and we have a baby on the way to boot.    On a lighter note I am going to actually start updating this blog more and more often with pics and such of my day to day life, this is much easier than upkeeping my website since I am w/o a pc at the house now.  (My motherboard fried and money is tight, in other words I can't justify a new board for myself with the baby on the way.)  P.S. here's my baby!
