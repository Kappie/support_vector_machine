"But eventually all Everton's hard work produced the goal they deserved when they finally took the lead on 35 minutes as Li Tie surged from his own half, won the ball and chipped it on for Radzinski, who laid it back to the charging  Chinaman ." Ok I'm no expert in the English language but  Chinaman  sounds a little racist to me, shouldn't the correct term be  Chinese  ?
