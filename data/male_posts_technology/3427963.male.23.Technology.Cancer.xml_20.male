Well, dont know leh, but i feel that writing blog is the electronic way of writing a diary or a journal of some kind. It definitely make me feel a lot better during my down days where i would post all my problems and thots and hopefully share wif the world and get some advice in the midst of it. I feel that its nice to share ur thots wif someone who would bother to visit ur blog stie and read all the shit u have typed and understand ur feeling at that moment of time. Well, at least u know that u'r not alone in this world to have had this problem.....agreed?? We are human after all and sometimes we succumb to emotions and feelings without knowing. well, at least i know i am one of them.....  Was on a crowded bus, way home from bugis after passing cheques to frens, and this guy who sits beside me, toking on his hp. the irritating thing is how he use the phone. using his nokia hp, everytime he speaks, he have to bring the phone from his ears to the front of his mouth and speak into the mic of the phone.....how fucking LAME can this guy get man....y?? scared the other party cannot hear izzit?? or is the other party hearing impaired? y have to listen to the phone and bring in front of his face to speak?? no wonder everytime i listen to phone calls, it always sounds so loud.....wonder wat this ppl been thinking leh.....yr 2004 with such advance technology and ppl have to insult the technology of the information age.....how sad.....i think the inventor of mobile phone will kill himself if he sees how ppl are utilising his invention like that. and thats not the onli person i saw doing that lor.....well i mean the mic of these mobile works so well that it picks up even the background noise of the surrounding while using it lor....and also hor....u seen ppl using handsfree set while holding mobile phone in one hand?? can someone explain to me what is the meaning of HANDSFREE??? Idiots leh these ppl.....total insult to technology.....i jus hope i wont see anyone holding their mobile phone in their hand while using bluetooth handsfree set.
