I am doing this for myself!!! .. anyone out there .. ? 5.	Read every Blog you can. Drop subtle hints like “PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE LINK TO MY BLOG”, so you can get some feedback on your writing. 6.	Receive your first “BLOG COMMENT” this is a BIG day! You are now established. All Hail your Blog! 7.	Decide, since your Blog is now famous, that it needs enhancements.

Run out of good material and start posting your hands on a nightly basis.  12.	Really run out of things to say and start talking about your Cat Felix. 13.	Really .. Really .. Really .. run out of good material and start doing lists. 14.	Go on an amazing tilt, lose all desire to play Poker (Not to mention your money), and stop Blogging, citing “Amazing amount of work lately” or “My Cat Felix Died and I just cannot Blog anymore”.
