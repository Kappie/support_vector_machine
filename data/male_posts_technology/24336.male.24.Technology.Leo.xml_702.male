There is no end to the number of Starbucks available and there is a healthy dose of Tully's as well.  The only place I've enjoyed so far has been Caffe Ladro, and they are only located in Seattle proper.  Well, today I found out about a place in Redmond called Victor's, located at 7993 Gilman St.  I will have to give it a try soon!
