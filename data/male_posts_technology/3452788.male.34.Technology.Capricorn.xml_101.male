       
      This is the new blog location for silly things that I find funny. I didn't ask if anyone else thought they were funny. Besides, this blog for depressing and morose brooding, not silliness.   I am just getting started with the funny stuff.  For example, why do they call it "Ovaltine"?   Anyway, the site is:  urlLink Mildly Ironic or Amusing Stuff
