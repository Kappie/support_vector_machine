I just want to say for the record money sucks.  Or rather, that being out of money sucks.  For me, money = confidence, at least the confidence of being secure in your position in life. When money tides roll out, you start to notice the rocks that you're narrowly avoiding, that will cause you to sink to the next lowest lifestyle. We're Working class anyway, which is a pretty big group of people who make almost enough to live on without working ourselves to the bone, and so we also have good reason to dread going further down the monetary based caste system of america.   when the budget works, life is good, I'm usually more pleasant, I sleep better, and don't feel bad if I go to Burger King for a lil meal here and there.   It's when the budget breaks that I feel like a 10 ton gorilla is sitting in my pocket where my wallet was. That ten ton gorilla makes me hesitate spending any money, even for food. because I know if I buy food, then I can't afford a bill, or if I pay that bill, I'll not have much in the fridge.   I never was good at carnival tricks, but since I got started out in the real world(read: not sheltered military world protected from such things as rent and power bills) I've gotten pretty damn good at juggling.  I don't think there's a single working class citizen out there that hasn't gotten a "last chance before we repo/disconnect/cancel/eviction your (insert reason for bill here)" once and a while, and I'm sure more than a few have had it happen that the company actually goes through with it. but if it can be helped, a working class person will avoid the disconnect/repo/cancel at all costs. because as soon as you get disconnected, usually they need an insane deposit, and 2 months up front. and if you couldn't afford the bill initially and it got cut off, then how are you going to afford to turn it back on? rob a bank?   So you learn to juggle, the art of letting one bill slide into being late or even into the next bill you get from that company, so you can pay other bills and still eat. Then the next month you pay the late+new bill from that one company, and let the company you paid the month before slide. and by doing this you really only pay for a handful of stuff at at time, while the other stuff becomes late. then you pay the late, and let the current slide, this prevents a disconnect, because the disconnect usually only happens after 2 months of unpaid bills.   The problem comes when even with juggling, your still leaking money from somewhere, those bill-balls start turning into bowling balls, and later flaming machetes. you end up getting tired of the juggling, and you just wish you could let all the balls drop without repercussions. Right now I'd say that I'm at the bowling ball stage, but I've been here before, and so my juggling skills here are not too bad. I'm pretty sure I'll live, but it won't be comfy for another month my guess would be.  See, I think this post came out really well, better than the other 4 drafts :P just be glad I didn't torture you with those. They were incredibly boring, and well, I figure if you're going to post anything it had better be at least semi interesting, and not some detailed ramble that gets more than the point across. :P  Anyway, Even Everquest was tragic last night, check out my Ziggurscamp Blog for details  urlLink Ziggur's Camp   try not to feed the stupid people Phoenix
