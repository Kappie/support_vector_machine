What, I've been watching too much Dawson's Creek again?  Oh.  Ok.  Minus that part about burning wood and the Potter B then.)     4.  When you go to sleep at night do you fall right to sleep or do you lie awake for a while  thinking about all the people you killed for no real reason that day, regrets, bills, Bill Clinton, and/or pie ? 5.   If Gloria Estefan had you chained up in her basement where she and her Miami Sound Machine were singing and doing the conga for you for weeks causing your ears to bleed when suddenly one day Gloria decided to run upstairs and call Ricky Martin to come over to do a duet and one of the poor burnt out members of Miami Sound Machine took pity on you and handed you his cell phone, who would you call to come rescue you?
