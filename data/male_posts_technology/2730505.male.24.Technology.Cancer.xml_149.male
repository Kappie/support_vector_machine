That's not really an issue except it's fucking summer and there are places to be on certain weekends and things to do on certain weekends.  Friday we went to 602 North, there was some crappy band, we played darts and shit it was cool.  I learned that it was Stacy's 2nd to last Friday there so I will probably be back next Friday to say good bye.  She always took care of me and my friends.  It was a fun run but as we all know, most things come to an end and this is one of them.  After 602 we were bored as hell so we went to Cadillac Ranch.  See the thing was, the last time I was there was the weekend before I first saw Meghan at her apartment.  Yeah, that first visit to MI.  I dunno it was still a ghetto place to be but there were girls there our age so I was having fun.  On our way out I ran into this kid Jerome who I knew from college.  Haven't seen the kid for a while, actually since fucking graduation 2 years ago.  He was with a few Filipino girls so that's a possible future hangout buddy I suppose.  We stayed there till about 3:30 AM and got home around 4:30 or something.  What a long night.  Saturday we went to Milwaukee.  It was Jerry's cousin's graduation at Marquette.  See that town is a little weird.  It had the feel of a big city but there wan't any huge buildings/sky scrapers so it was like having the Bulls with out Michael Jordan or something like that.  It might take me a while to get used to but eventually it will happen right?  Milwaukee was fun.  We went and partied it up with pretty much everyone in Jerry's family as well as a few girls from there (actually one girl was from MSU, go fucking figure!)  It was a fun time drinking with people you don't really know.  Oh and again, I was the only brown kid there, hehe.  I made it there in an hour and 10 minutes and I guess that's pretty fast.  We started drinking at 8:30 PM and didn't stop till about 3:30 AM.  I was still wide awake so instead of sleeping on the damn couch, I figure we'll be home in an hour and a half on easy driving anyways, might as well go fucking home.  So at about 5 AM we got home.  Before that I almost blew by a state trooper on the on ramp to 88 from 294.  Yeah, good thing for the cop vision.  Fun night and Summerfest never looked so good in Milwaukee!  I will be back in that town sometime.  It was a good time.  I was trying with one of the servers but I got too distracted by other things that she left before I could get her number.  It's an hour away, I can do that right?  But then again she was still a student.  Maybe I should look for a professional.  That might prove to be a challenge considering that it's summer and the clubs/bars have more girls in theme.  Hmmm, Fun Fun Fun.  It will be a good summer.  Remember it's my year right?  Year of the Monkey!  Today I woke up to Vicki calling me.  We talked for a little while.  She said that she wasn't a good swimmer.  I said that that's not good because if we ever got married we were going on our honeymoon somewhere where there's going to be water.  Besides, if she does go to camping trip this summer, she better have fun in the water with and everyone else.  I made my steak and rice lunch for tomorrow.  I think for breakfast I will be making steak and eggs and for dinner it will be steak again.  Yeah, I suppose you can say that I pretty much bought half a cow.  Yeah!  I should stop by the store tomorrow to go buy more steaks!  hehe.  I'll go try the Atkin's diet or someshit.  Cubbies won again today.  4 in a row!  Hell yeah!  Swept the Padre's!  wOOt!  Ahh, yes  Hope that everyone had a great weekend and wish all of you (friends and random readers) a very good week ahead!
