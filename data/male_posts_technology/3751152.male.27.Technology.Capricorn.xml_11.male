No, it appears that there could be something wrong - they aren't quite sure yet what but I have to get an ultrasound either tomorrow or Wednesday so they can check it out.  Joy.  What does that mean? Well, they figure there are a few options - either I have a simple infection or there are pieces still left inside (which apparently could be from the one sac or perhaps therein lies the possibility that there was twins) OR it could be both.  Gross and stuff eh?  Yeah.  So if it is an infection - I get to take drugs.  And to jump the gun a bit - they've already given me the drugs.  So I get to take these orange horse pills for the next week - whee!  If its the "pieces" option then I get to have a D   Yeah, I know - WTF is that?  D actually stands for "dilation  curettage" and basically is the scraping of the lining of the uterus.  And that means I get to go under anaesthetic too!  Its like I said - the fun never stops!  So thats the spiel.  Now as we wait for the votes to come in to see who our new Prime Minister will be, I'm going to work out.  Later!
