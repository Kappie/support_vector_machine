I'm trying to get this shiny new uber-high-paying job in network security, and I don't remember the hardest exam from college being this bad. I can't even remember how many questions the interviewer asked, but there were two I flat out didn't know, maybe four I didn't give the best answer to, and another two I think might have been wrong. But, I kicked ass on the rest of 'em! I'm mean really kicked ass. I was snapping out answers faster than the drag queens at Zigfields snap up dollars from the dancefloor during the end-of-show free-for-all fist-off. So I'm in the top 5 and scheduled for another in-person interview. Woo hoo!  Andre and I went to Lizard Lounge last night with Dillon and our newfound fag hag Elana--beautiful, wispy-thin Asian girl dressed in a tight red number with stilletto heel boots. Wow, she actually got more looks than Andre did--at a gay club! That's saying something, cause Andre is one of the most beautiful creatures ever created. But, we all looked like stellar Eurotrash, and he even said I was the cutest he's seen me for awhile--and I thought my hair was a disaster. We started out with drinks and Sake at Dragonfly. Despite the fact that I always think Austin Powers is gonna leap out of somewhere in Dragonfly's pure-white 60s interior, I just love those barstools that bounce. Dillon wouldn't give up the philosophical conversation (I love him for it, but sometimes I just wanna be vacuous), so I finally told him I wouldn't respond anymore and we left for Lizard. Still, later on, he waxed philosophical about the four of us on the big red sofa. Elana pretended not to understand (maybe she didn't, the music was pretty loud) and he finally gave up.  The Israeli guy tried first to hit on Elana (don't understand that one), then on me, then on Andre. Andre finally gave him the bad news that I go home with him only, and still he comes back to tell us now that his (not very handsome) friend wants to go home with both of us, and maybe the girl too. What a bunch of whack jobs. By the time I got back from the lav they had split. We left soon after, dropped Elana at Fox and Hound, and Dillon at the Fireplace. I was hung over this morning.
