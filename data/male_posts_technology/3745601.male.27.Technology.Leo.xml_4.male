It's not like I am looking for Ms. Perfect.  I do have expectations.  I'm not going to just jump on anything that comes my way.  On the bright side, my hairstylist is very attractive.  The downside of this is that I know she at least has been married.  I don't know if she is separated or divorced. (Hopefully the latter)  Maybe if I know her a little better, I will ask her out.     urlLink          urlLink          urlLink          urlLink          urlLink       With reviews like these, how could I be without a girl?  Try doing a search on available women in my area with whatever online dating service you prefer and you will see. (trust me, I know I have searched them)
