  Turns out that Macromedia did a pretty good job creating an editor that produces standards-compliant HTML, CSS, and XHTML. Interesting enough there is no Adobe GoLive or Microsoft FrontPage "Task Force" at  urlLink WaSP . I would imagine this has to do with the fact that the other software publishers do not work with third-party organizations and developers as much as Macromedia.
