I’m trying to be the best boyfriend I can be, but please tell me if I’m wrong for being a tad bit irritated.  Sometimes I’m at her house. She’s with her mom right now till she can get back on her feet. When there are several family members there and some friends as well, I get a little bored. I think about playing some Warcraft III w/Frozen Throne Expansion, or going and seeing  urlLink Rob.  She most of the time guilt trips me into staying with the typical, “Oh, you’d rather play a game than see me,” or “Oh, you’re going to see Rob, tell him I said hi” and then acts mad. There’s a little more to that, but I’m not saying.  Today I work 7am to 6pm. I’m working 4 ten hour days and getting a Friday off, which is awesome…well, will be awesome Friday…I had to take my rental car back as well as have someone pick me up and take me to get my car. I had Enterprise bring me back to work and then had her come and get me…well, her cousin was supposed to be taking his mom’s car to the same place, so I was going to ride with him, but since they didn’t need an estimate, he didn’t and my baby took me in to get my car. The first 10 minutes were silent until she lost her temper at someone driving 45 in a 70…we laughed and things picked up from there…we joked a little and then made jokes on how we piss each other off and laughed some more…I got my car, chit-chatted with the guy there about my new tires coming in tomorrow. She jets off, a little ways down the road I notice she’s not in sight…at one point I had to hit 110mph to catch her…  We get to the house and we’re sort of doing the boyfriend/girlfriend thing at lunch…as I was making possibly a “Trip to the hospital burger,” I hear her saying something like, “I don’t know if I’m going to be able to come or not.” Since I had no idea what she was talking about I was a bit curious…apparently she decided to go see her friend, who lives about 2 ½ hours away and didn’t clue me in on this…that’s the part I was talking about being irritated at.  My point is that Rob lives about 8 minutes from my house…her friend lives 2 ½ hours away…How am I to be the one guilt tripped into things.  I’ve since talked to Rob on this and feel tons better…  I think I pen too much on my baby to vent, though I do adore her, we need some time apart…not in big bundles, but a day here and there to let the hearts yearn for one another. I do feel the borderline of love, but maybe that’s something my heart needs time for.
