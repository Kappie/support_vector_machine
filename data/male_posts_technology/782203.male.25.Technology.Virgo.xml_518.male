So I started cussing like crazy at my friend , using words like cu*t and the f words etc. etc. Then she replied that she could actually see the words at her end, they weren't censored so she was pretty shocked and confused as to why I went all vulgar all of a sudden. I kept apologizing, and I lost the game on purpose just to make it up to her. Ok Ok she whips my ass at that game every time.
