Eliot's solution* to this is not to turn up to school unless he feels like. Quite right too.  Happy birthday David, it is officaly the 18th of May, so you are now 17. Hurah.  General studies exam? Well, err, I haven't a clue, I just wrote lots of crap.   * Max: You're probably looking at this and thinking that I've got an aprostophe there where I shouldn't have. Well I should, because the solution 'belongs to' Eliot, you use an apostrophe to indicate this.
