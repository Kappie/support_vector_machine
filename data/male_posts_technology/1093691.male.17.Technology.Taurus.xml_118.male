It is so fucking annoying and i wish i never chose it, I have my bag stolen at the end of the lesson by tom greenhouse so i had to go get it, i had my hair pulled bout 20 times and i had my ruler nicked not only that i had my computer nicked and i wrote about 4 lines in the whole lesson. Plus when i went to pupil services some kid had thrown up about 3 times all down the corridoor. NOT NICE  It was all chunky and manky but there you go ! Bye for now, i may blog later. And no Tom i havent said anyting to the teachers and i dont intend to.
