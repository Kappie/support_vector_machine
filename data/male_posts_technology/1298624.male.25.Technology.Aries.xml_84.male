They have come together to make war upon my ideals. Why? Please tell me why do they do this? Why do they have to create this vortex of "stupid" around me?  *sigh* So in other news, I heard there is a way to post pictures in these blogs. I have to figure it out cause I'm thinking that would be heaps of fun...HEAPS, SAYS I!   The acquisition of music [that I like] has reached an all time high this past weekend. So far, all of it has interested me and has earned a place in my ipod.   I swear, if one more person calls me who cannot speak a lick of english or do not possess the complex faculties to change a password, the online community will suffer tonight.  EDIT: I hate it when people ask for my extension. Why do you need my extension?! So you can proliferate these four numbers, which serve as the only means to contact me, to people of below average IQ!?!? WHY?!   *runs away*
