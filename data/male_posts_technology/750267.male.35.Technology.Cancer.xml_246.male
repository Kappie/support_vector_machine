Josh is looking for a good celebrity scandal for 2003. So far, what Hollywood has given us has not been much in his book. His essential point is this:   Is it a scandal when a short order chef makes a stack of pancakes? No. And it is not a scandal when a professional-grade boy toucher touches a boy. He's just following his job description. Get him out of here.   In Josh's eyes, Michael Jackson's latest legal problems are not a scandal because they are not shocking. Why? Because many, many people already believe that Michael Jackson is a pedophile, even before the current story surfaced. So, in general, most people's opinion of Jackson have not changed much over the last month or two.  To take this theory into the arena of politics, why didn't the country get into a great uproar when story after story came out about Bill Clinton's multiple infidelities? Paula Jones, Gennifer Flowers, Monica Lewinsky. Only the Republicans cared about those things, and they only cared in order to gain more political power. Why wasn't Clinton forced to step down by some great public outcry? Because, everyone KNEW he was a filanderer when they elected him. One more allegation? Big deal. Take a number. Tell me something I don't know. If you recall, what almost got him impeached was not the infidelity, but the lie about the infidelity. Clinton was not immune from lying scandals, he was immune from sex scandals.  What about George Bush? In the last month or so, it looks like he's earned a similar "scandal immunity". George Bush lied about WMD in Iraq. Yes, we know. He lied about the reasons for the war. Yep. He lied about the timetable for the war. Check. He lied about the cost of war. Sure. He lied when he said the war was over back in May. You got it, Pontiac. He keeps blaming Iraq for September 11th - another clear lie. Yawn...  I think George Bush can now lie about anything, and it won't make front page news. The same way Clinton (and Schwarzenegger, I suppose) could grope women and get away with it, George Bush can now boldly lie without apology. So Bush lied about encountering a British Airways jet on his way to Iraq? No one cares. Bush lies - everyone in the country accepts this as a fact. His popularity ratings are up.  Now if you catch Bush in a sex scandal, or a money scandal, or something other than a lie, you might be able to stir the pot. But Jeff Probst has already handed him the Immunity Idol for Lying, and so he won't get voted out for that in 2004.  For Democrats, I can only offer this opinion. I don't think he has immunity for the war yet. If the war turns bad, or does not improve considerably, he might be weak there. But don't bother reading  urlLink Al Franken's  or  urlLink Michael Moore's  books -- the lies (and the lying liars that tell them) are old news.
