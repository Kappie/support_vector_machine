Although you need to be careful that you don't drive like that once you get back onto the real road. Yes.   Muffy and Adele's Engagement Party  Had a smashing time there. Lots of cool people, lots of food, nice venue. A good time.   Mandarins  Does anyone know how long the average Mandarin lasts before it goes off? If so let me know.
