Argh, should start revising for my exams really!  I'm just sitting at school listening to The Rasmus, I've taken James iPod again.. He has the album on there, so hehe.  I'm bored, everyone else has gnoe down the shops but I couldn't be bothered to go dwon there...  I have another 2 hours before my next lesson.
