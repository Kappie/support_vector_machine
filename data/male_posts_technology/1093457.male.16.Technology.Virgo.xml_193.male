Right, so if I get up at 8am, that gives me plently of time to eat, have a shower and perhaps make a start on some homework. Did that work? No! I woke up at 9am (8am GMT to what my alarm was set) and I had half an hour to do everything in. Crazyness. Anyway, the clay peigon shooting was brilliant! I did actually shot a fair few, but that shotgun does kickback quite a bit. Spent the rest of my day doing maths coursework, oh how exciting.
