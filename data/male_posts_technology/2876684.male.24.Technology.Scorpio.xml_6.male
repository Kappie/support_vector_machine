Shihan took us through a MONSTER first session mostly doing fitness and lots of fighting techniques. I couldn't bounce on the balls of my feet though (which is a typical karate thing to do when fighting) because of my freaking shin splints; actually I did bounce, but I just didn't leave the floor to minimise the pressure on the shins.  Then he had us doing bagwork for 30mins during the second session and I was just wasted. I don't care who you are, but if you go flat out for a 3 minute round on a heavy bag you WILL be tired. Luckily the rest of the session was relatively easy going, concentrating on counter techniques - the highlight of my evening was when John was supposed to defend my spinning back kick and after jamming the kick our legs tied up and he ended up on the floor! I couldn't help but smile to myself. :)  The train ride home was a bit uncomfortable because the train wasn't air-conditioned but I guess I dozed off now and then, which helped to shorten the ride a bit. As I was about to get off at Penrith this guy (who boarded the train with about 9 others at Mt Druitt) came over and started asking me about my iPod and he wanted to have a listen and I obliged, but obviously being wary if he tried to do a runner with it but he didn't. He gave me a friendly slap on the shoulder as we parted ways to indicate "you're alright". Maybe he initially thought he'd have a little fun with me I don't know - I find people to be generally nice if you are nice to them... this guy maybe crossed the boundaries a bit by "invading my personal space" on the train, but he didn't do anything to cause me to break his legs. So yea, I guess that makes him alright too?
