I just don't want to be telling myself "you still have plenty of time" in fifteen years. :)  And sometimes I get scared of that.  It's this stagnancy phobia of mine.  After living in Small-Town Mississippi for twelve years, one becomes VERY afraid of being "stuck."  And as I gaze up at the walls of my parents' basement in which I currently reside, that fear becomes ever more potent. :)  But underneath the worry I do hoard an almost obscene level of optimism that everything will turn out as I wish.  I only get worried when reality's timeline for me is not exactly in line with the one in my head. :)  I am, for the most part, a very happy monkey. :)
