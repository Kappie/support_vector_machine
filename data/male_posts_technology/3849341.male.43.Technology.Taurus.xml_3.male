I have been thinking quite abit about "The Family Unit". What was God's design and purposefor"The Family Unit". What is interesting is how you may know truth, but until it resonates inside of you it just seems like words sometimes, at least it seems that way for me. God truly wants to reflect his Glory through "The Family". In fact, I'm coming to an understanding that "The Church or The Body of Christ" is really just Families interwoven together. If The Church is dysfunctional, look at the families that comprise it. The church can only be as healthy as the Families which together comprise it. A local Church, a smaller part of the whole church, that is dysfunctional, and which is comprised of dysfunctional families is incapable of bringing healing to individuals or families in need. Whata dysfunctional churchdoes have tooffer instead is backbiting, gossip, disunity, envy etc(Yum,Yum I have tasted some of that nasty rotten fruit)...... We, me, you, anyone, can not expect a local expression of Christ's body to be healthy and life giving when the families are unhealthy. We, "The church", maybe best served in turning inward to God and allowing him to bring the wholeness (Holiness) into our individual lives, our individual Families first before we worry about saving the world. We have so little of God's Glory in our lives and Families that the world, the lost, have no clear view of God's Glory. My friend Karl and I joking talked about this lack that we Christians have. Every time we brush up next to God, and a little bit of his glory rubs off on us, we run around Shouting for everyone to hear" Hey look I have been close to God his glory has rubbed off on me, See, my pinkie is still glowing". It's going to take more than our pinkies glowing to change our lives. We settle for so little of God's Glory in our lives and our families' lives. Start from within let his Glory, his spirit overwhelm our lives, our families lives, and the lost will ask something similar to theShulamite's friends ask in The Song of Solomon " Where has your beloved gone....Where has he turn aside that we may SEEK HIM with you (SOS 6:1). Sorry for the rant, I was just going to say a couple of thoughts and this all came out. Sue me..... :)
