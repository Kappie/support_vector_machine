It was a small class and he had us on the bags doing 3 minute rounds and Shihan himself was holding a big pad. We were moving around between rounds and by the time I had got to Shihan I was exhausted, but he's got this way of making you go that BIT further - anyways without going into details, halfway through the round I was almost throwing up! (Anyone who's done anything physical beyond the point of exhaustion will know how that feels...)  But yea everytime I go through a monster session like this, a lot of self-doubt enters my head... I dunno, maybe it keeps me grounded and doesn't let me get ahead of myself. *sigh*
