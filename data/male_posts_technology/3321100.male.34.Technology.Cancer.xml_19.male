So I drunk, white wine, pink wine, red wine...OUppPPSsss Sunday morning, the bedroom turned over my bed many time before I could not stand up. And Sunday was a great day, because it's our Trial Motorcycle's day. I don't know if you know this mechanical sport, but it's my favorite sport. So imagine you take a very light motorcycle, a big rock, a young and very beautiful and courageous pilot (me for example), and you just explain to the pilot that he MUST climb the rock or this two favorite friends will laughed about him all the week. So it was a very funny Sunday with sun, forest, mountain, friends, BBC again, NO WINE, and a lot of philosophical discussion about the word, the Internet, you (I often talk about you ;)), and why rocks are so great this Sunday....  -->
