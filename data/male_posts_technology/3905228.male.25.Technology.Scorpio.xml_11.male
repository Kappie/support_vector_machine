Saw someone Flirting with Danger, yielding to emotions, trying to seek sanity and was almost rekindling something then came the deathblow- May be this is what God wants, Dunno if that is answer to my afternoon prayers to him, to show that individual the right direction if that has to be rekindled or not.  God, Thank you for proving once again that u r there in my life - for me and my people. All I pray to U now is to guide and take complete care of that individual who means a lot to many of the fellow humans including me.  I know U'll do that not only for me but also for that nice, kind hearted soul who might be low now. But as u made me realise Y'day on y one faces hardship, hope that the pain that individual will undergo now soothes, all I want to tell that individual is life is full of ups and downs and upto what I know is if one goes looking, one'll find lots of ups and not many downs.  God alleviate that nice of pains.  I'm actually looking forward to meet all of my folks this weekend in KMU if things r going fine. From 6 members ,we've become Nine now, dunno if Nanamma can make up this trip,God alleviate her pains too, let her not have a painful end,   Awaiting to meet my elder sis.  Order of the Day : Prayer for well being of all of mine and all of nice hearted souls on earth.  Yet another prayer from me, Keep my girl away from pain and worries, she might be taking her time to commit to me but she means my other half, keep her happy too. Hopefully she comes to me soon, sooner the better but u know what it is ! God, U know what it is !
