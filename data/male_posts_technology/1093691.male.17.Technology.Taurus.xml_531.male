After the exam I got the bus into croydon with michelle cos I was supposed to be meeting my friend Sarah but Michelle ended up tagging along, and what an amusing day it was! Michelle made it her policy to try on the most ridiculous outfit in every shop, and boy did we laugh a lot! Quite a bit of a relief after the exams, and I'm happier now cos I know that Sarah is going to get on with my friends at ma party! yay! A week to go, h ehe! Gtg, I've just dropped ice cream on me keyboard so I bette clear it up! Be!
