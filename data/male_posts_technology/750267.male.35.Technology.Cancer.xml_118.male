When the mail comes next week, we'll see how much my four hour ordeal was worth. I'm not expecting much, but it was nice of American to respond so quickly. It didn't seem like a form letter either, since some of the email directly addressed my complaint.    "Please accept my apology for the difficulties you and your wife encountered when you traveled with us."
