Developing software for so many years (I am exaggerating a bit) bread a habit in me to automate everything that I can. Yesterday while refactoring a solution, I had to complete two simple tasks: (1) Add 3 new Registry items  at two places (2) Extract 10 tables from an MS Access database to a new DB  The first task was done in a minute, but my problem was that I had to apply the changes in two places. But unfortunately regedit.exe does not have Copy nor DragDrop so I decided to search for an alternative. I spent probably an hour googling to find a good free Registry Editor. After downloading and trying 2 or 3 tools I found the very best. It's called  urlLink Registry Explorer  and it  urlLink integrates neatly  in Windows Explorer. The best of its  urlLink features  are definitely Copy and DragDrop, but I also like that I can add a registry key to my Favourites. It has also search results which regedit lacks and though its UI is sometimes a bit ugly, I will probably forget regedit. If only it had Undo/Redo features and automatic refresh (by hooking to the registry update operations) it would be the perfect registry editor tool.  So the fact is that I wasted quite a lot of time to save just a minute of repetitive work. But I think it was worth. I will be probably more productive in the future. And my colleagues will be, too, since I let them know about the Registry Editor.  For my second task I knew I could create a new .mdb and then copy and paste my tables. They were only 10 and there were no relationships to complicate things. But I found out that in the "Table view" MS Access limits me to selecting one table at a time. Hmm, not very exciting! So I spent 20 minutes browsing an trying various MS Access commands, but found no quick solution to do my task. Then I got the "mad" idea to code this by myself. I thought that using ADOX, I could do the job quite easy. So I started a VB6 project and added a simple form and a class that does the work. I succeeded in creating programatically a MDB. I succeeded in getting all the table schema I needed from the source DB. But it appeared that there is no simple way to copy the structure from one DB to another (unfortunately, it took me 30 minutes to find this out). I was disappointed and decided to make a simpler thing (?) : to write a macro in the source MS Access file to export the tables. I had found a sample with DoCmd.TransferDatabase, which was the thing I wanted. I took me 30 minutes struggling with VBA and macros to make it work. But as soon as I was finished, a shocker hit me. I discovered the "Get External Objects" command under the File menu which solved my problems in seconds.  So it appeared that for my second simple task I wasted another nearly 2 hours to save 5 minutes for stupid CopyPaste. BUT the truth is that I learned quite a bit about (1) MS Access (2) ADOX (3) various SQL techniques for table schema copying.   The moral of the story  My reluctance to do repetitative tasks by myself cost me more than 3 hours. I was obviously ineffective and wasteful. If I had tight deadlines I would have been sorry for taking this approach. But now I have enriched my experience in many areas and I am able to solve similar problems quite faster. The chances are that it will pay off...
