I knew before that IE was just flat -bad- at standards support, but I had no idea how bad.  I can understand why people write  urlLink rants  about IE now.  Let's just ignore IE's poor  urlLink security track record .  MS Apologists will say that the existence of patches proves that MS is fixing problems.  This may be true, but to me the sheer number of "critical security patches" out there for IE would indicate that they released a crappy product which has more holes than a screen door.  Let's also ignore that  urlLink IE's CSS support  is buggier than a beehive.  It is interesting to compare  urlLink Microsoft documentation , with  urlLink actual standards .  Notice how the MS docs conveniently ignore some property values, in this case "fixed".  IE doesn't even  urlLink support HTML 4.01 .  This is insane.  IE is the only browser so buggy and generally crappy that it provides its own  urlLink special tag , that web authors use to work around IE's bugs.  I just can't take it anymore.  My personal websites will no longer support IE.  Trying to write web pages that are actually functional, that comply with standards, and that render in IE is just too much of a pain in my ass to bother with unless I'm getting paid.
