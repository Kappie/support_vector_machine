I got into this discussion with one of the guys there about basically everything, and I learned a lot, including that Photothop takes eleven seconds (one-one-thousand...) to start up.  That was really exciting.  I mean really.  And they had a widescreen (about 23" I think) that it was set up on.  The entire thing was gorgeous.  And the salesman did a really good job of selling me on the whole thing, even though all he did was say yes to all my questions.  I think that I've decided to go ahead and get a Mac when I've got the money.    Also something really amazing he showed off to me:  Expos√©.  He opened up a ton of apps and then hit F9 and magically they all tiled together.  Amazing device there.  I was totally raving when I left.    Hehe, and I got two hang-up posters of the G5 and the Cinema Displays.  Woo hoo, I can hardly wait until August when I have the money for one.  *grin*  peace out
