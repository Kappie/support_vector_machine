As I slumped into my cubicle yesterday I was a bit perplexed to note two large packages on the floor next to my computers.  I opened the first -- a cheesy bag for my help in this years company conference.  I then shifted my attention to the large brown box with  urlLink Amazon.com and a smile  on the side.  I opened it hessitantly, but that couldn't surpress my shock.
 
 Let me give you some background on this package:
 
  Rusty:  Tell me you've already pre-ordered this!  [Referring to the newly released Unicron Transformer repleat with glowing eyes and fist] 
  Sword:  No, I'm waiting for somebody to give it to me as a gift.  ::hint, hint::
 
 I was kidding at the time.  But when I opened that package there was none other than the planet consuming planet himself:  urlLink Unicron .  Thanks,  urlLink Rusty .  He's awesome.  He's the subject of many of my coworkers' jealousy -- I received more than one threat that he'd go missing if I left him alone...so I had to hire a baby (planet)-sitter while I was in meetings.  I guess toys like Unicron are the fruit of six years of friendship?  Just kidding.
