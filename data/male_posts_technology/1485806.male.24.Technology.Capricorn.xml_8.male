I broke the same tooth...when i was running around wet chasing my bro and then i slips and bang my healthy tooth into the marble... Did a root canal to fix that but now...tooth extraction and even the trip to the dentist scares me.The sad part is that i am going to Aussie tomorrow and there is no way i can smile the way i smile in photos anymore...hahh..... Come  back to Malaysia and have to endure another few trips with a new false tooth....imagine the odds of getting a false tooth when u are in the age of Joshua. haaahhhhh.....Argggg.....................................
