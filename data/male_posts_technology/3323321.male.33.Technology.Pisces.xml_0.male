I just watched 60 minutes (yesterdays show) and realized that our own individual lives are just parts of this larger scheme. I can make a decision to go fight for my country, or I can be lazy and do nothing and bitch about the way things are going...  I haven’t done either and think everybody needs some sole searching before they can complain...  You might not be happy with the man in charge but he was elected, and you might not be happy with the situation in Iraq but our soldiers enlisted...  I am very proud of everyone who fought for America, and our freedom, but there are those who fight for an unknown agenda and I feel for them. 60 Minutes just ran a clip for 11 minutes of pictures of everyone who has died in Iraq and I know that’s not a lot compared to other wars, but I feel as though they where unnecessary deaths and their families probably agree.   I would like to say THANK YOU and good luck to the rest over there!!!  I also want to thank all of the people who can support these people without passing judgment upon them for doing their jobs. If you don't support our current governments decision than vote and become vocal in your local communities. Don’t hate those that think different, and might support our government, but become active and make responsible decisions without judgment on other individuals.  Once again THANK YOU....  -Casey
