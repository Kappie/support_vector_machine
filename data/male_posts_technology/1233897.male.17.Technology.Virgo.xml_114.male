I'm desperate for You. And I............. I'm lost without You.          Surrender - Marc James     I'm giving You my heart and all that is within I lay it down for the sake of You my King I'm giving You my dreams, I'm laying down my rights I'm giving up my pride for the promise of new life   And I surrender all to You, all to You And I surrender all to You, all to You   I'm singing You this song, I'm waiting at the cross And all the world holds dear I count it all as loss For the sake of knowing You For the glory of Your name To know the lasting joy Even sharing in Your pain   And I surrender all to You, all to You And I surrender all to You, all to You
