It seems as if she's struggling to figure out who she's is.  It's tough some times.  Toying with work.  Significant discussion with the delivery and SBLS team today, but I'm not sure what to tell them.  The group needs a serious motivational speech -- morale is really down.  They've been beaten up quite a bit in the past 18 months.  Well, it is off for the shower and a strong day at work.  I wish I could get the damn VPN login to work properly.  That's part of the problem with working in such a large company, the support is B-R-U-T-A-L.  I don't know how many people I hear about that have problems with computers for days and weeks at a time.
