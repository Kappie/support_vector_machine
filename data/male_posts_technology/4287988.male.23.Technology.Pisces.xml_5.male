Well last week I got pulled over for speeding and found out that my license has been suspended since July 14th.  Then my father took me off of his insurance and I had to get my own but didn't quite have the money for it yet.  I figured if I was just driving from home to work and work to home I should be ok.  Well today when I got up it was just starting to rain.  I was a block away from work and decided to stop and get gas but the gas station I stopped at was closed so I cut through a parking lot to get to another gas station.  All I could see was the lights hitting the rain on the parking lot well then before I even knew what happened I ran smack dab into a pole.  Wonderful!  I've never been in an accident my entire life and the week that I find out my license is suspended and I have no insurance is the same week I get into my first accident.  I'm not going to complain to much though.  I mean luckily I didn't hit anybody else.  Then I'd really be screwed.  Well, my father came out and gave me a ride to work and he's going to have the car towed to Mike's, our mechanic.  Now all I got to do is explain to Jaime about how bad the car is.  I called and told her I hit the pole but I don't think she realizes how bad the car is.  I never thought hitting a pole would do that much damage.  I'm glad that I wasn't in a real accident as something really bad could have happened to me.  Well we'll see what happens.
