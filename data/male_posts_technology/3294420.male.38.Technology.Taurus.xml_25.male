Today we visited the mean opthomologist...she's not really mean, it is just what she has to do to the poor baby.  Anyhow, the good news is that her eyes are fine.  No retinal issues at all.  Our next visit is in six months.  At that point they will check to make sure that her eyes are focusing right, no lazy eye, etc.  For that appt. they just play with the baby.  No eye drops or painful procedures.  I hear the beginnings of a cry so I'm going to cut this short today.  Cheers,  Gina.
