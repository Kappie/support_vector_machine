Searchforlight.org 2. Yahoo 3. Blogger 4. hotmail 5. Rediffmail 6. Google (very often to download images of flowers)  Then thanx jax for ur useful info on House hunting and rentals.  Hei i went and saw two houses and my god as u have told me we had a nice interesting experience. My god, i really wonder How people manage to live in such houses and also was getting some insights on how my home should like!  Ofcourse not like the ones which i saw.   Hei kavi did give me acall yesterday and updated about our circle of friends. Hope her to be enjoying there!   My cousin sis have come here along with my her family. So planning to go to ISKCON this evening. So starting a bit early. Will mail u interesting if any when i am back tomorrow. Bye  Ranjini
