They are getting new flooring installed in the hallway, and kitchen / dining room area, so a refrigerator, a stove, a trash compacter and a dish washer had to be transported to various and sundry locations within the abode.  Everything but the 'frige was pretty easy, except for the part where I might have broken the dish washer 8(, which while easy, sucked.  Afterwords we ate KFC, hung out, and then I went home...  And played Crystal Chronicles with my roommate / best buddy Cory until 1:30 in the morning.  I'm such a delinquent.
