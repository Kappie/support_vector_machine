Hope i get it because from what Faith told me it seems like a great working enviroment very casual and friendly! Well just have to see how it goes.....but dun wanna get my hopes up too much cos did that way too much the past few months and i just got really disappointed when those opportunities did't materialise.   I ordered Canadian Pizza , ate too much and now my stomach feels so bloated and feel like puking ...dammit !!
