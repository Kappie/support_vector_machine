Politicians at the Provincial and Federal level are all talking about "accountability".  "Government Accountability" is to politics today as "Synergistic Technologies" was to businesses during the .com boom.  Both of those phrases sound really good but actually mean nothing.  Government accountability to me means that they must answer for and defend any actions that they take.  When a government official is questioned about spending public money and the word "inquiry" comes up in the response, they are not being accountable.  When we accept that response, we are not holding them accountable.    Every dollar of public money that is spent must be justified at the time of spending, not when someone notices that money is disappearing.  If I want to know why the Governor General needed to hire a private jet to fly from Ottawa to Calgary for a presentation when an Air Canada flight for %50 of the price met her time requirements, I should be able to get that information immediately.  This is the beauty of the information age, instant access to data.  All government expenditures should be published and made accessible at the time of spending.  A website should be kept up-to-the-minute with all of this information.  This way every Canadian will know exactly where the money is going and why.  We deserve it, it is our money.
