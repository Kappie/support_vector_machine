It was clean fast and much better than the greyhound.  It even had an on track movie.  We arrived at about 10:30am and by about 12:00pm Clair and I were off to start on the house.  We spent about 4 hours there and it did not seem like we got much accomplished, however neither of us have done construction in quit some time.  At about 6:00pm we headed back home and went to this really good Mongolian grill place for a late birthday dinner.   The next morning we left for the house around 7:00am and stayed until about 6:00pm.  We accomplished a lot more that day.  By the end of the day we had all of the exterior pony walls (I think that is how you spell it like the animal "pony") done and some drain pipes for the gutters.   We drove back home today and arrived here in Seattle at about 1:30pm.  At 4:00pm I had to leave to work at UPS.  But the day is almost over and I am looking forward to next weekend where I get to go and help with the house again.  I will try to get some pictures of it next time.
