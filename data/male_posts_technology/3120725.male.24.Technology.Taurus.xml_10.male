Our hero was born on July 6, 1946, in New Haven, Connecticut.  His birth was trying and extremely painful for his mother Barbara, fortunately she deserved it for not getting an abortion.  During his 104-hour birthing process his umbilical card had rebelled and become an unpatriotic terrorist sympathizer, this have a lasting effect on his future.  Luckily his mother’s O-B-G-Y-N (yes you must spell it ask any woman) was world famous for rooting out lefty liberal body parts.  His parents decide to name him George, mainly because that was his fathers name and also they were very lazily people.  At the age of 4 his father, while on vacation from his government job, took him to a rail-yard where a train backed over him.  He was operated on for two days by Americas top neurosurgeons, they managed to save his life, but had to removed the part of the brain that prevents most humans from making up words.  After his father paid for him to graduate from Yale University, he jumped from failed business venture to failed business venture.  He finally realized he needed to move into a job sector that rewarded ineptitude, so he ran for Governor of Texas.  He easily won the governorship main because Texans are Mexican or retarded.  His tenure as the leader of Texas was bathed in the blood of state sanctioned ‘tard killings; under his rule no IQ was too low to prevent an execution from going forward.  With his popularity with Southern handicapped-hating voters at an all-time high his puppet masters decided have him run for President of the United States.   He managed, with some help from his brother Jeb, to squeak into the White House.    By now you must realize this is a joke and I’m speaking of mein leader George W. Bush.  If this has offended you in any way, please understand that I really could fucking care less, in fact you should step outside and run into traffic.  Before any fuck-off republican cock whores email me about what a liberal douche bag I am, understand this I hate all politicians.  Democrat, Republican, Green Party is doesn't matter, they will all sell your children to Chinese pedophiles if it means getting re-elected. Any one and everyone in today’s political arena is corrupt on some level, just so happens that our current President is more crooked than the hair up John Ashcroft’s ass.
