Maybe it's cause I'm all warm and comfy in a bathrode - Wikiki day at school so I'm wearing swim trunks, a hawaii shirt, sandals and a towel. Understandably, I'm bringing a change of clothes though since it's predicted that it'll be cloudy and cold all day. Whatever...  My hand's starting to heal up... I drove myself yesterday. Speaking of driving, it's funny how many people from school I meet on the road on the way to school... at the intersection of 229th and TV highway yesterday, Gwen and her dad were the first stopped (in his spiffy new X5), then Rachael Z. and her mom, then me, then Brent freezing his butt off cause his mom had said that it would be a nice day... He took that to mean that the morning would be nice too so he lowered the top on his Wrangler (lol).
