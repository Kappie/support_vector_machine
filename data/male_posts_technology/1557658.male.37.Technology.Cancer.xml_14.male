Just shows to go ya, kiddies, make sure to put more than 20% down, or don't be such a softie and raise your rents!  Anyway, the property value appreciated almost 50%, so I'm a happy camper. And happy to be rid of that hefty mortgage payment, almost 3x the amount of the payment for my condo! Whew,  that's  a weight off my shoulders!
