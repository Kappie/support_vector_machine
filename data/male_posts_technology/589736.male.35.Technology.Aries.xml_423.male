You know it used to be considered sensationalism for journalists to give opinions or slants of their own on the experiences of others.  But then I guess just reporting the facts doesn't sell newspapers, enthrall television viewers, or attract Internet users to your website anymore.  I am not excusing the actions of the air marshals in regard to Dr. Rajcoomar.  I really don't understand from reading the article how they believed him to be a threat.  But as for their reaction to the actions toward Mr. Feuer, what would you expect?  If they had asked him to calm down, pretty-please with sugar on top, would be stupid.  They can't take chances in situations like that.  They would have aslo HAD to warn the rest of the passengers to remain seated and not to move to be sure their would be no accomplices taking action against them or others. But wouldn't you know the ACLU would step in--even though no one was openly worshiping God or trying to keep pornography out of the lives of children.  But then peoples' feelings were hurt weren't they?...
