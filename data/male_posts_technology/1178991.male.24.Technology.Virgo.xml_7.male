I know a bunch of stuff that I like and dont, but I know there are more objective ways to measure and evaluate that - what UI experts do and such.  So, I want to come up with an idiots guide to web usability.  Here are my first links to interesting material on the subject - I will just edit this post to add more links in the future.   Websites    urlLink Common Ground  Common Ground: A Pattern Language for Humanâ€“Computer Interface Design.    urlLink Interaction Patterns  - This page contains information about resources related to pattern languages for interaction design (of which user interface design is a subset).   urlLink Task Centered User Interface Design    Books   urlLink http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/020172149X/qid=1080950103/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-8238258-6554329?v=glance=books=507846">The Design of Sites : Patterns, Principles, and Processes for Crafting a Customer-Centered Web Experience
