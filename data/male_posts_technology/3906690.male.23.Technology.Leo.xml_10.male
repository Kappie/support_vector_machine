Usually my writings are source codes for programs, documentation for source codes, and all that has to do with creating Software. Since I started this blog, it seems I've been posting on a daily basis, about what I do...or whatever I write about at that time. I've been posting for the past 3 days, I'm sure sometime in the near future this blog will be ignored and abandoned.  Oh yea, something worth posting :P. Turns out "Somehow" the bulls got out of their pens yesterday evening (Wednesday night). My uncle asked me to help chase them in. I was being all cool about...handling them how they should be handled...and here comes my uncle with the whip *CRACK*. I was standing near the entrance to one of the pens and the herd of cows/bulls ran my way. I jumped out of the way just in time, another second and I would have been gored. That would have sucked...wonder what that would have felt like *shrugs* I still have years ahead of me to find out. The rest of the time I was being more cautious. I bet I would make a good rodeo clown. Yea, my uncle went crazy with that whip though...I was just like "Easy..." Right now them bulls/cows are people friendly. Anyone could go up and pet them. But more of them whippings, hell they’d go crazy and wouldn’t be people friendly anymore. And that wouldn't be good.  Another Something...  *DEMOLITION MAN* The damage has just begun a fist to the mouth a kick to the jaw bleed once bleed twice bleed mother fucker bleed have you lost your fuckin mind? what you do fight yourself beyond empty feeling dead as the day before now look at you torn to the flesh torn to the bone torn and splattered face it you were born to lose I beg you to stop before you descend into your grave fuck it fuck you I thank you punk everyday you shall fall feel the pain up until my final hour at last the end Copyright © 2004 SJohnson
