Women whom i don't really love became my girlfriends. Thats also why, the relationship did not stay too long because the affections  were not present in the first place.   Hap, maybe the one i love and may appreciate  me have yet to come. Or maybe, she never exist. No matter what, i believe i have come to a point where i must be able to accept a plausible reality that i may stay single for the rest of my life. Its a blessing to be able to share your happiness, woes and smiles with the person you love. Its definitely many times better than me sitting in front of the monitor now and try to share my woes with myself.   Hap, it wasn't easy to fall in love again.. and i thought you knew. But.. yah, that does not mean that the person i fall, must reciprocate my feelings. I know.. i really do. But, i promised myself to look forward, to accept reality, to never run away from it, so that i will never reach a point in life where i could no longer retreat. Reaching that point is like reaching the top of the cliff where if you retreat, you will fall to your death, no i should say worse than death because death is a form of escaping away.   Hap, your name is the short form for Happiness. 'Hap'.. thats why you are the best person i can relate and the best name i could find. I want hope and i know hope never fails to come by in my life. I don't know if i would love another again. I only know it would be even more difficult to do that again. I know she really love her boy a lot. I know what happened to her relationship, but because things will never be possible for us, i also know that, regardless of any efforts, amount of time or feelings i inject, it will not change the fact that, she loves him.   DJ, you can face it.. because you never fail to face it, Hap.
