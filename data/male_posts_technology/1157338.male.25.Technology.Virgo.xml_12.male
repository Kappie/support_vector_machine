The air conditioning in our office at SST is apparently broken for the one single room that I happen to work in (we're upstairs and have a seperate air conditioner from the rest of the folks.  it's gotten as hot at 91 degrees F inside here today, and I'm about sick of it.  Having had a heatstroke this weekend, I'm kinda fearful of being in this heavy heat all damn day long, but so far, no problems.  Aside from that, my day has been dull.  Tired of a lot of things right now, wishing I could just go and curl up in a ball for a few days and come  out refreshed.  I realize that's not gonna happen, and such is life. Still sucks tho ;)  Our 2 dogs got out of the yard this morning, and we got another ticket for Dog at large (2nd time this has happened since we lived here, first time was like september last year).  Pretty annoying when you just did a lot of work on a fence and they still break out.. fixing that fence was what gave me the heatstroke in the first place. Bastards.  I'm thinking I may leave work a bit early today, with all the heat it's hard to think about much of anything, and I've had enough shit on my mind lately that's kept me from being able to focus as it is.  Mostly money stuff, you know how that old rot can be.  I'm thinking about writing a few programs and selling them on eBay, maybe a movie collecting program that I'm writing for myself, and perhaps I'll do that budgeting program for my church that dad wanted.  The game is still going strong btw, we should hopefully be finished with the public demo at the end of this month (July) or the VERY beginning of August  the site is still at  urlLink www.devilwhiskey.com  if you missed the link before now.  Good stuff, and we've come a long way with it.  Hope those of you who are reading this will enjoy.  Oh, and if you see me around, make me enroll in a grad course NOW. I haven't enrolled yet, and I'm realizing that I really should.  Phil.
