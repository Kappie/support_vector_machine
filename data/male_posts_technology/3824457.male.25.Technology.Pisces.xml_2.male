Its bizarre how that actually calms me down.  Maybe its just because it reminds me of when I didnt have to worry about shit.  Except getting cig's and having the money to pitch in for pizza when we gamed.  I miss those days in a wierd way. Now I have a million and one things that I have to concentrate on.  I always feel like im jumping through one hoop or another. As tolkien put it "I feel thin, like butter scraped over to much toast." Not all the time but enough that it is nice to sit and listen to silly 90's music and just forget all the crap going on.  I hesitate to even make a fucking list because it might be to overwhelming sometimes. I wish I had the stick-to-it-edness that my dad has had for years.  Somehow he finds the energy to come home and continue working untill he goes to bed.  Even though his job is a manual labor job, which i would imagine he would want to come home and crash from. I just feel that sometimes I am being pulled in umpteen directions all at once.  And the fact that several people in my house have the TV on constanlty doesnt help.  For some reason I am  sucked into the TV like a moth to the flame.  Even if its some crappy ass show that I dont like.  Its kind of odd actually.  And with cable there is always something at least moderately mediocre on that can drone away.   Given the choice I would take the radio over TV in a heartbeat.  I can sit and do nothing and listen to it.  Or it can be the background as I do work (like at my job).  It gives me something to kind of putter about to.
