Front and centre in all his glory was Bill Gates stating blogging and business was an ok mix.  I couldn't resist - out I went to check it out (what the heck is blogging?). http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3734981.stm  After a few searches on who was hosting, and little time to spend (since I was at work) I decided with Google cause they are big and innovative and at present, the underdog.  I figure you can't go wrong.  So here goes - I am hoping it will catch   Enjoy!
