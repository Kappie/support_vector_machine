However so many times I catch myself wishing that I were smarter or more talented or in some way more equipped than I am.  God's reply to me is in v. 27...  "But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty; and the base things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing tht things that are..."  God intentionally made me not as smart or as talented... and why?  "... that no flesh should glory in His presence." (v. 29)  He did it so that I would recognize the power of God in my life.  And I do.  Have you ever given someone advice that turned out to be exactly what they needed to hear?  Have you ever done some little task at work that turned out to be praiseworthy in the sight of your boss?  Have you ever gotten a better grade in a class than you thought were possible?  Don't compliment yourself on these things... praise God.
