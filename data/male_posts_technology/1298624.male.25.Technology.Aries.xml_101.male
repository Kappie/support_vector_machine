I never knew the death of Ronald Reagan could stir such emotion in me. It was like the final curtain call for the 80s. A flood of nostalgia gripped me firmly until the funeral ended. It was like watching someone you knew from childbirth just die in front of your face. It was almost as if I knew him. For me, he personified the pride and honor of the presidency of the United States. It was Ronald Reagan alone who made me feel proud and honored to be an American citizen. I know he may not have been the best president the U.S. has ever had, but the real question would be who? Who was the best president of the United States? Conflicting opinions for sure and I'm sure it's a question that will never be answered. Personally, I think Reagan came pretty damn close.  Work is work. Nothing I can really say about that other than the fact that it's getting worse. I realize that I am complaining and maybe I should just stop and try to find something that makes me happy about going there. I have options, I mean, it's not like I'm stuck there. But I guess it's just the politics of the place. The little arguments and disagreements, plus the increasing annoyance of some people's attitudes. There I go complaining again. I really do have to stop talking about work. I think I'll lay off it for a while. Talk about something else.  Alex and I will be doing some free-lance work for Stewboss and Paul's game server hosting company in the coming months. I hope it's something that we can easily work around in. I have to admit that I've never done this before, so it's going to be a learning experience. What I'm truly scared about is the fact that they might ask for stuff that we cannot provide nor even possess the technical knowledge to implement. Here's hoping that these people aren't looking for something revolutionary.  Sleep time then. I've been a post/comment-whore in other sites. Sorry about that. When I get my trigger fingers going for typing, I don't stop.
