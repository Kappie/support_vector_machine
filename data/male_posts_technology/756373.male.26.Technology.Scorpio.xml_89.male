Abdel-Salam also stressed that the role of the United Nations should be enhanced and its system modified to prevent domination of specific countries.   He was referring to the veto power wielded by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council; the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain.   Dissouki, was of the same mind.   "The International Law has recently tilted towards unequal treatment of people, as some agreements turned into valueless pieces of paper when they came against the interests of such a super power as the United States," he lamented.   Islam, on the other hand, deeply respects vows, treaties and agreements and warns against the serious consequences of their violation, Dissouki averred."  You have got to be kidding me.  I'd spend time shooting this to bits, but I think anyone with half an ounce of common sense wouldn't  need  me to. I mean, sure, let's implement Shari'ah Law globally, let's legalize beating/murdering our wives and children if they 'shame' us, let's make global priority the complete extermination of the Jew, let's flush hundreds of years' worth of scientific advancement down the crapper and go back to believing the world is flat. And behead anyone who disagrees. Seriously. You'd have to be smoking some  really  bad crack to even  contemplate  taking that seriously.
