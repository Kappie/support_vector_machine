However, they are limiting the invites which will drive up the demand even more.  urlLink Jeremy Zawodny's blog :  "You'd think I was giving out free money or something. They're not pre-IPO shares, just gmail invites." I put in my request to get an invite if Jeremy has any left. My guess is I'm too late. If anybody reading this has invites, then send one over. My contact info is listed  urlLink here
