My mom had gone out on a walk with Cynthia, her friend who lives locally in San Fransisco, and had just come back when we my sisters and I were waking up. We left our car at the Cynthia's and walked down the Fisherman's Wharf where we caught a tour ferry and rode around the bay for an hour and a half. Then we walked up to Ghiradelli Square, had lunch and stopped in at Cynthia's house for a while. She has a projector, screen and surround sound system in her bedroom! :) :) Exiting the city, we drove down Lombard street (the windiest street in the U.S.).  It took us over 6 hours to drive to LA (well, actually Vernonia - an LA suburb that Six Flags is located in). It's interesting: we've driven  exactly  1000.1 miles from my front door to the front of this hotel... We've got a picture to prove it. :)The hotel that I'm staying's within sight of Six Flags in a major way... it's like the only thing you can see looking out the windows (hehe)  Btw, my sisters and mom are trying to sleep so they kicked me out of the room and into the bathroom where I'm finishing up this post now ;)
