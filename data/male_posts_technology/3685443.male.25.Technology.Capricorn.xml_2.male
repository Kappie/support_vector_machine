I have seen anything from begging to offers of children, virginity or votes, just for a mail account(a big one mind you).  I'm not sure if its just because everyone else wants one ("Tickle me" Elmo anyone)or its just an elitist thing.  On the upswing there is a  urlLink site  that is trying to distribute these accounts to the troops.  So there is a positive swing of things to wanton greed.  Oh well I might have to wait till the official release to get one.  I'm not going to waste too much time on getting into the beta.    Matt
