The more and more that I watch the DNC the more enraged  I become enraged and determined not to vote for Kerry. Is this because I hate Kerry? Not at all, in fact I think his heart means well but I feel that about Bush. The difference is the heart of the president is strong and unwaening while that off Kerry is open to every demographic (Vote for the War, Bush is a liar, Life begins at conception but abortion is not murder). I guess it depends on the day you catch him speaking to potential voters.  	Currently the polls are even. I believe yesterday George W. Bush was up by 1%. This is scary folks! Seriously seriously scary.   The other day I was asked what the difference is between the democratic and republican parties. I responded with a few, yet selected quotes...  Republican Comedian Dennis Miller- I think of the two as checkers and chess. Kerry is a chess man, he is smart, likes to plan his moves slowly then take action, only to find out you may have made the wrong move and cannot take it back. Bush is a checkers guy, he views the threat and  jumps the bastard before they have the chance!  Democrat Comedian Whoopi Goldberg- Waving a bottle of wine, she fired off a stream of wordplays on Bush's name in a riff about female genitalia the closest thing I found to an actual quote is: "...an unsubtle anatomical double-entendre enjoining voters to 'keep Bush where it belongs and not in the White House.'"  Republican VP Dick Chaney-"Go Fuck Yourself" Democrat Senator Kennedy-"The only fear we have is four more years of this administration."  I'll throw in another  Democrat Jesse Jackson-"In the dark, a president chooses tax cuts for millionaires, but job cuts for steelworkers, firefighters and police. The president talks of homeland security, but wants to let AK-47s and Uzis back on the street. Hope comes in the morning for those Appalachia, where coal miners are dying every six hours from black lung disease. Hold on, hope cometh in the morning for our children who were sent to war in Iraq on bad intelligence and worse leadership. Sent to fight a war that's foreign to our values, that leaves us weaker and less secure, sent to a war in Iraq -- the wars of mass deception are more apparent than weapons of mass destruction. It is a moral disgrace, a moral disgrace. America deserves better."  OK Miller Vs. Goldberg: Intelligent commentary that actually complimented the candidate while supporting the President OR Vulagrity that borders on humiliation. Chaney: Did he say the right thing...yup! He was speaking to a man who talks shit about him behind his back and then tries to kiss his ass face to face. The man   deserved it. Was it right on the senate floor? No! All in all though I think it was better than a blow job in the oval office. Kennedy: Hate Rhetoric, what could one expect from someone who should have been put in jail for murder years ago. Jackson: Well we know Jackson. Point by point:   * Tax Cuts: We all got a tax cut. This free ride for the poor shit is over. Everyone had an across the board cut = more tax returns (not cuts) for those making more     money. Those who work at a minimum wage job becuase they could not get into college do not deserve anything special.   * Cut jobs for steelworkers: How? Many have been employeed to redevelop Iraq. How many were hired to help with the demolition of the WTC? Could it quite possibly be that     the Unions are to blame for this? Labor unions are notorious assholes. Not only do they employee many arrogant people, but they over severly overpaid and over compensated.     I would not hire any organized labor union.   * Coal Miners Dying:Umm, most of these people are unionized too...lol. How can you stop black lung in a career that basically supports the disease. Unfortunately this is industry in this     country. If we got rid of the industry would Jackson bitch about those laid off?   * ...morning for our children who were sent to war in Iraq on bad intelligence and worse leadership": Ok I love this one! First off the intelligence came from George Tennant, FORMER CLINTON     CIA agent not the presdient. Intelligence also came from many of our foreign leaders from Russia and Britian. Kerry voted for this war. If Kerry voted and did not review the intelligence then he should be repremanded.      If the intelligence were wrong it was their fault not the presidents'. Beyond pointing     fingers though, we need to look at this at a broader scope. Ok no back to pointing fingers. There are recorded tapes where Clinton stated Sudan offered him Osama Bin Laden and he rejected the     offer...this is fact! OK back to the war...the poor children (many of which he notes are black further in his speech (or was that Sharpton)). They are given a job, they acted upon false intelligence but in return      outsted a dictator who murdered hundreds of thousands of people, disobeyed every UN resolution and invaded other countries. They did their job and ousted Suddam. It is unfortunate that many of our soldiers died (greater than     1000, which by the way were almost weekly casulties in Vietnam) but Mr. Jackson you fail to say that many of those poor children went into the military thinking peace and hoping for a free education. You think that the minority     of soldiers are there to defend this country? Nope. They went in for a free education not suspecting 9/11. I have sympathy for the parents but not the children. Many of the minorities that entered the war went for a handout and     ended up actually working. Shame.   * moral disgrace: I think the only moral disgrace of this country would be a president who cannot make a decision and stick with it. At least the Democrats could have nominated     Howard Dean...he had morals and convictions. More on Mr. Kerry later.     Tonight...Why Kerry should be charged with war crimes!     -ttyl
