When you consider someone like your elder brother, you want to be there to wish him. I don't have siblings and my friends mean the world to me. Jagdish had come from New York to spend his Birthday with him. We had chinese for lunch. Later in the night we went to dinner and then Jillians. Dinner was at Kushboo in Lexington. They serve real good Indian food. The night at Jillians was alright. It is a terrific place but it was I who was spoiling the night for myself. My heart was heavy all along, really heavy. It felt like I a dark wave was sweeping over me. There is so much more to what I feel within me but I'm not going to pour it out here because I want to keep these postings as honest as I can. It does not prick my conscience to not write it all out here. They are dark feelings that would sink within me for the rest of my life.
