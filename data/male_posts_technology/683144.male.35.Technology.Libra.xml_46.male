How well do Gmail's junk filters work? Let's find out! Spam my shiny new G-mail account at prattboy@gmail.com Give my address to spammers, newsletters, annoying people, whatever, and let's see how long it takes!"  I could redirect some of my spam to him but I'm guessing he wouldn't like that too well ... I currently receive 1000-2000 emails per day with 98% of it being spam.
