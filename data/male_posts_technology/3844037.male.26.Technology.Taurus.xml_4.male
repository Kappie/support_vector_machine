A great little tool that looks very impressive. Pop in a HD and away you go !  Load the HD with a few games and you get reduced loading times and (hopefully) no need for a mod chip (experiment pending :¬)  I noticed lots of shops have sold out of the network adapter and it cant just be for FFXI (if you know what i mean .. wink wink nudge nudge)   urlLink [Unofficial PS-2 / HD Compatibility List]  - Check your HD is compaitible .. must be more than 40gb and less than 120gb .. Western Digital ones dont actually fit into the whole so avoid them like an long-coated man near a public toilet.  Watch this space for a update once I get it :¬P   [mRg]
