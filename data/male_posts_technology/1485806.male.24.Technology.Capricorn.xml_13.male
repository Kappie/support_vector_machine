In my plans, if i don't get a job in another 2 weeks time, i will strive even now to get a part time job in a cyber cafe and start going for my MCSE classes to further improve my technical skills.  Not that rejection hits me very hard, because hey i have receive rejection many times before and well i have grown stronger. Wonder the email Jobstreet sends me , they says my experience and qualifications as outstanding really outstanding.  Hmm...got to work on my interview skills better. I have put a lot of effort into it and it is not working very well.Gotta do more research , i guess.   Now gotta do research on where to get my MCSE training and to get a car and accomodation...hmmm...gotta put more effort. Anyone reading this...gotta pray for me...i am really desperate ..
