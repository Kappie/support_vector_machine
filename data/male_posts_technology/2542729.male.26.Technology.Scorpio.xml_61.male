I need to be working out...used to have washboard abs now my stuff is kinda rounding out. There's a PT test in August and if it were to be taken this weekend, I would fail 2 out of 3 events. City of heroes breaks up families folks, seriously. Its expensive too if you're a college student, which is a significant portion of the target audience. And for those wondering, no i'm not back in college...just saying.       In other news, drama drama, drama. I'm taking serious consideration into leaving the youth choir for good. Noone's dedication to spiritual, artistic perfection is as strong as mine in Mt. Olive. Outside of my former piano teacher Sis. Diana, nobody comes close. All a guy like me asks for is the freedom to try. To do things differently than how they've been done...to create...dareI say it....CHANGE for the better. Nobody listens to me though, its all political. I hesitate to compare myself to Jesus on  any  level but I remember that even he had trouble ministering to people in his own town. Sometimes (like now), I need someone to minister to me, to keep my spirits strong. To keep me level  spiritual-minded. Perhaps I don't deserve my own choir right now...maybe that is why I don't have one. On a number of different scales I am far from prepared. My grasp of even general music concepts fade more  more each day, i'm becoming disenchanted by the futility of a doomed world, and even worse...well that's bad enough.        In improving news, I got my Logitech digital camera last week. It captures surprisingly crappy pictures indoors but with adequate lighting outside, it takes pretty decent snaps. Also this weekend is drill weekend and i'll finally be able to get the paperwork rolling on a transfer or otherwise. I'll get to see my worthless drillmates again, my cluelessleadership, and...surprise...deal with more politics!! YAY RON!! But seriously, this belongs in the "improving" news column       In good news, the new website is in the works. To those who have no idea what i'm talking about yet, good. I'm not fully launching and advertising it until its fully operational. But...the urlis apparently "hidden" somewhere in this post. Can you find it?
