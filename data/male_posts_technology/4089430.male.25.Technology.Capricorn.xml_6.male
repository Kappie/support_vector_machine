To make it a real challenge though, we've cut the budget by 90%. This leaves roughly $1,000 to build up the floor, put in a new subfloor and laminate, re-route plumbing and ventilation, double the cabinet space, add a dishwasher, replace the outside door, and paint everything. I've been collecting free items to help in this, but it will be tight.  I started removing the old cabinets yesterday. One of the screws got stuck while taking a big one down; the head stripped out and bent over, utterly rejecting my poor drill. I got so frustrated that I tried to pry the screw out with my hammer. It didn't budge, but the hammer did and the cabinet did. In fact, the back face of the cabinet is still hanging on the wall as we speak, and my hammer is nodding in effigy of the stolid screw.  So I gave up and proceeded with sanding the finish off the cabinets I already have. This gives me great pleasure. One moment I'm staring at an ugly old cabinet, then minutes later it emerges from its cocoon of dust with long beautiful blonde hair, er, wood. I love the smell and look of raw wood just waiting for me to paint or stain it.  Actually, what I find most rewarding about this whole renovation process is cleanliness. For some reason, a rental dwelling just feels dirty after so many years, no matter how much cleaning you do. We've scrubbed the old cabinets several times now with all sorts of cleaners, but they're still sticky and grimy. I ripped up the floor a few years ago and put down new vinyl tile, but the ookiness seems to have oozed up from the floor boards. There's no way to get rid of it, except to get rid of it-- sand the surface off, replace the subfloor and baseboards, paint everything. I can't wait; it will actually feel clean. I won't mind my children crawling on the floor, or touching the cabinets.
