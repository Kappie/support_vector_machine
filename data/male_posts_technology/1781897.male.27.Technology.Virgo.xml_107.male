First He Said:  From: Rando Sent: Monday, July 19, 2004 5:28 PM  To: E Subject: RE: Weblogs  Hmmm, I just noticed your meeting is in SC-E1… sneaky!!! :) Playing devil's advocate, I would think that it would be more efficient to book some rooms here, and for just you to walk over rather than making us all walk over. But I'm just saying that because I'm a lazy ass. :)    Then e Said:  From: E  Sent: Monday, July 19, 2004 5:31 PM  To: Rando  Subject: RE: Weblogs  I gave you the opportunity to make the meeting at a time/place that was convenient for you and you asked me to do it. I'm here, and so is the consultant who is working on it with me. You are the only one NOT in Bldg E so I'm going to have to decline. It's not that long of a walk. Wear some good walking shoes tomorrow!    And that Douche Bag actually Said:  Ha ha ha… good point. I most certainly can't blame you (unfortunately). :)  I'm happy to walk. (Really)  See you tomorrow,  Randy         BEATDOWN!
