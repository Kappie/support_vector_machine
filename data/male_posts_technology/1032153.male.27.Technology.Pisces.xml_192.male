On the other hand, my taxes are compulsory (try not paying them),  and they go to people like you who I do not support. So people in glass houses shouldn't through stones eh what! I mean you have an absolute cheek to even bring up the issue of Maxim's funding. Your pay, the pay of your secretary and all your office is from the people of New Zealand. Sort out your own backyard before you go digging in another man's. Start being accountable for what we pay you. It ain't really your business where the finance for the Maxim Institute comes from, suffice to say it is voluntarily given by people who do not like the way your government is taking this nation.
