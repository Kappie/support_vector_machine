Saturday I went out to my mummys for the day which was cool.. Only problem was my mum went down to the shop and my sister was asleep on the couch so I decide to go raid the fridge (As all good children who go to visit their parents house for the afternoon are obliged to do.. It's a tradition or an old charter or something..) and I see this lovely looking Pasta, Tuna and Sauce dish.. One microwave and 3 minutes later I am eating a tasty piece of Tuna loving pasta..  Mum Comes back and goes into the Kitchen, looks at the battlefield that is the kitchen sink and turns to me.. "Michael, (Mum always uses my full name..) You didn't east the pasta did you?" HeHeHe.. Turns out she meant to throw it out the day before :) This leads to problems I will deal with when I get to sunday..  Then after mums I head into town to meet up with Bubbles and go on the great birthday tour of 2003. Into JRB's (GAH.. HATE HATE HATE.. IT BURNS MY EARS..) for a while.. I start getting this allergic reaction type itch to leave very early in the evening.. Then onto the Q-Bar to hook up with the ever beautifull Shelly and her friends and sister.. As Bubbles said the similarities were un-canny.. Anywho.. That was fun, Q-Bar had surprisingly good music considering but OMG was it hot in there (so take of all your clothes.. etc. etc. etc.) but it still wasn't quite shooters so after some gentle persuasion (Bubbles, put the bat back..) we all move to Shooters..  Shooters was GREAT fun.. Some of the Salsa crowd (Helena, Vicky, Agnello, and Flat top dude whose name I never remember, sorry) were there.. I love it when Agnello comes to a hip hop night because he is just so much fun to dance with.. He really is doing it just for the fun of it as opposed to a lot of ppl there who are doing it to be seen.. It always makes for a much more fun night when he's around..  There was a bit of a scene at one stage where Richie and Shelly had a bit of a falling out and I tried (foolishly) to try and smooth things out a bit.. I think it all got sorted out in the end though.. Ended up sleeping on Shellys couch which was interesting.. My Neck still hurts a bit but the night was worth it :)  Then on Sunday I had to get from Shellys to my mums in 30 minutes.. NOT an easy thing to do on a sunday.. I was only slightly late and had an interesting afternoon with my dad and my sisters.. On the bus into town with my Dad I ended up talking to him about various relationships I have had in my life (including the time I was in a "threesome Relationship for four months.. Not the kinda thing you normaly tell your dad about..) and we talked about how similar we are when it comes to relationships.. Scary thought really.. My dad has three kids by my mum, another one by another woman and one from his current GF (and is planning another one).. For a greeny he isn't helping the global population problem much, is he? The final thing we came up with is that we both have a huge problem saying no in a relationship.. We aren't good at being the person who causes hurt, so much so that we will get ourselves into a situation where we really aren't happy but it's easier to be unhappy ourselves than to cause someone else to be unhappy. I have actually started to curb this tendency in myself and have gotten much better at being straight with people than I used to be. Time was that when I wanted to get out of a relationship I would engineer a situation where the relationship was unworkable.. Horrible way to behave? No question about it, but I was too immature to find a better way to deal with it.. Now I am in a situation where I am much better at saying that I have a problem with a relationship, but still find it difficult to explain what the problems are.. It's also much more difficult being honest about things like this than it is to be a prick and just let the relationship slowly die a death.. How can you convey to someone that things have changed and it isn't something you can change back without that fact hurting them? I think I also have wierd issues with knowing things are going bad and just not wanting to wait for it to get to the stage where they are really bad.. It's all a bit wierd really and I am straying WAY off topic.. Hmmm Then end of the conversation was basically me and my dad are very similar but I think I have managed to get to a point my Dad hasn't achieved yet where I amn't willing to continue making the same mistakes\problems that I have in the past...  Back to the rest of the day..  After that conversation with pops I got into the Capitol and by this stage my Tuna episode from the day before (remember that?) had returned to haunt me.. And how. I had gone into town for Janets B-Day drinks and spent 4 hours of discomfort watching other people drink while the only thing I could stomach was bloody water.. Grrrrrrr. Then I was half way home in the pissing rain when I realised that Bubbles had my keys and I had to go to his place first.. By the time I get there I am soaked TO THE BONE.. I cannot impress upon you just how wet I was.. Think swimming with your clothes on and you are still thinking too dry.. Spent a couple of hours drying off in bubbles place before crawling home dazed, confused and exhausted. It was a BAD BAD DAY from about 4PM on..  Monday was quiet.. Went into town to watch X-Men and ended up meeting Helena. Went for Food and Coffee and chatting and then she came to see X-Men with me..  I still find it difficult when I am with Helena.. I still feel strongly for her in both a physical and emotional way at the moment so it is very hard to keep things on a friendship level. Especially difficult when you spend enough time together that you start to feel comfortable again.. I still have this Helena shaped hole in my life, but it's not something that I can easily fill\fix..  Wow.. what started out as a simple short blog has turned into a monster.. It's also strange feeling to blog regardless of the consequences.. Hoping I haven't pissed anyone off.. Nothing said here is meant in a hurtfull way but conveying the emotion behind a sentence is very difficult to do.. I'm in a strange mood this week and it's just all coming out of me today.. Consider this my way of "clearing out my closet".  Anyway, I may blog more later.  Mike
