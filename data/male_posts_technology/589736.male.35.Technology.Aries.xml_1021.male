I assume you are joking in interpreting my post as implying that I want a sandstorm to wipe out the US Army.  The irony of Paul's quote re: the sandstorm, on the eve of the current war, is that it could apply to both sides.  That's as far as the implication, such as it is, goes.  It seemed an appropriate attempt at humor, perhaps even commentary, given the title of our blog.
