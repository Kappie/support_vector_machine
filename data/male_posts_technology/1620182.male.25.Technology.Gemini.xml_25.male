Maybe it's my relaxed state of mind.  I'm not sure of the source, but there are about a million thoughts buzzing through my head right now.  When I say a million, I'm only slightly exagerating.  There's everything from the lawn watering schedule to the sticky white rice at How May's to  urlLink Amtrak  going out of business to Tony Blair and " urlLink communitarianism " to the multi-national demographic that is the greater  urlLink Washington DC metro-area  to what Donald Duck is going to say next in  urlLink Kingdom Hearts ...  Craziness.  I have a  urlLink friend  whose eyes light up when I get this way.  He used to love to sit and watch me start my rapid fire idea engine.  It's his theory that I'm like this when I'm relaxed.  I tend to think he's right.  If that's the case, then I've been working too hard all my life.
