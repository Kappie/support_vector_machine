So I spent almost all of Sunday and almost all of Monday on my back with a heating pad under me.      I did win $700 on the Tyson fight Friday. That was niiiiiiiice.      U.S. men's basketball was embarassed today. Good. Nothing like sending some of the best to play a game WE invented only to lose to a bunch of pasta-eating paisans! Congratulations, fellas. Way to represent.      Oh, by the way, "the crush" is officially over! Seriously. I really don't know what the hell I was thinking anyway. Yeah, yeah, yeah...I hear you.
