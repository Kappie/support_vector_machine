Well the "has.it" guys shut down the free service because some people were abusing the system.  I read the all the info and I am pretty sure I am not abusing it.  You can reach my page (somehow you made it here!)  urlLink www.members.tripod.com/cwfldk   On to the good news!  Ms. Ann turned 22 yesterday.  I made her some cup cakes.  I am pretty proud of my first cup cake venture.  Also, Dawson's Creek and West Wing start tonight.    I don't have too much else to say.  I change desks at work some time soon.  I guess that will be fun.
