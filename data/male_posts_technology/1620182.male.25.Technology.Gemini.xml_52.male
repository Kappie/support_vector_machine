The great thing about living less than 1 mile (that's 1.609344 km for those of you on the metric system) from my office.  I can practically roll out of bed and be at my work station.  Heh, heh.  Work station.  I should just call it my "station."  Then, when there's an emergency, my boss can yell, "All hands to their stations!" and I can sprint from the kitchen back to my "station" to defuse the "situation."  Ah, to dream of a more exciting work day.  
 
 I don't  really  have a work station, per say.  Instead, it's more of a cubicle, lined with various corporate propoganda and miscellaneous toys I've received as gifts over the past 2.5 years.  There's the ubiquitous "magic" 8-ball, the model BMW 328Ci (far inferior to my  real  330Ci), the Ken Morrow bobble-head (don't worry, I don't know who he is, either) wearing the wooden elephant mask from India, a stuffed cow holding a football with a "Go CAVZ" sign around his neck, and the clock made from a baseball.  Wow, where did I get all this junk?  This isn't a work station.  This is a playstation.  I wish.  ::shrug::
