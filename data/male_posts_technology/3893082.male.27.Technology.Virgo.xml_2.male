Probably has to do with the fact that I got fooled by an email scam that should have been a very obvious scam had I stopped and thought about it! Well, I stopped and thought about it but with the wrong head!    Aside from that, I feel like causing a lot of trouble today and am thinking that I am going to take my frustrations out on the exercise equipment down at gold's gym! At least then I will be doing something productive!     Oh well, live and learn right...    Blog at ya'll later....
