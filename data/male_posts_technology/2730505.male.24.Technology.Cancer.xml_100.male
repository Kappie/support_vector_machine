It's Monday and so far this year Mondays haven't been the best day of the week.  It usually involves someone or talk about someone or an apparition of someone or whatever about someone.  I hope that that doesn't happen this Monday.  Anyways, Friday was blah.  I was stuck watching baseball till late that night.  We didn't go out till 11 pm - 11:30 pm.  We proceeded to go to I forgot the name of the place but we only stayed for a beer.  We then went to Bar Louie in Naperville.  I didn't realize that it was such a damn corporate chain.  IT was pretty cool.  It was almost like a miniature Alumni Club.  It really was a restaurant that becomes a bar at night/on the weekends.  Not bad not great.  So I was beginning to like the place.  It was climbing the ranks of possible Friday night hangouts until a fight broke out and a girl passed out by the bathroom area.  First the fight.  In the end there were two people with messed up noses.  It was bloody and ghetto-like.  Why can't people just get along?  I just happened to look up as the bigger guy is being held down by two little guys and the third guy rocks the bigger guys world with a couple of punches.  Eh it was entertaining for about 5 seconds as the place became a little jumpy.  Promptly after the clean up of the blood everywhere.  There was a chick by some speakers near the bathroom and she just abruptly passed out.  It was just that.  She was leaning towards the speakers and then, BAM!, she dropped to the ground like a sack of potatoes.  It was actually kind of funny because she got up and everything was alright so no one was hurt in that incident.  The promptly shut the bar down after that.  It was retarded.  They were supposed to be open for another couple of hours.  Eh, I guess that is what happens when there are fights.  It was just a little too ghetto for me.  I mean it's freakin' Naperville.  It was supposed to be a nice town.  I guess there's bad shit everywhere you go.  Saturday was just alright too.  Got up a little late but I was still able to make it to my Dad's birthday party.  That was good since I was able to eat some food.  I then played a little baseball with the cousins and Meghan called.  went and saw her for the night.  It was just one of those things.  I did make it in record time though.  3 hours to East Lansing but total time was 3:15 to her apartment.  not only did I have the eastern time change going against me, I had to go to some sort of service in freakin' Barrington at the Willow Creek Community Church.  I guess it was cool.  Not my thing.  I would have preferred to have had mass and then left.  Whatever.  We watched the ending of a Chinese movie that I didn't quite catch the title.  We tried to watch the end of the movie but we were both distracted with each other.  We finally finished the movie and got some food ready.  bought some frozen pizza and corn on the cob popcorn.  The popcorn was damn good.  Smelled good tasted good.  It was good.  After that, .... yeah.  The we watched another movie.  I haven't seen Breakfast at Tiffany's.  I really don't have much to say except that Audrey Hepburn is good looking.  That's it.  We finally got to bed around 6:30 - 7 AM Sunday and tried to sleep.  Slept till about 12 PM.  ...  Left her house around 12:40.  I got home around 3:45, about the same time that it took me to get there.  Ate some food and went to the apartment and passed out till about 9.  woke up, ate some tom yum soup and ice cream after a brief hello good bye with Meghan.  Reminded her to do her Econ homework and went to bed.  Yeah that was my weekend.  I thought it was a good balance of friends, girlfriend, family and alone time.  I hope everyone had a good Easter and have a great week.
