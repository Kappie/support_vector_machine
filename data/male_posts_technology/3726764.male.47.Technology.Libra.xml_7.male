I have the ac on already. Here's something I've noticed about my typing: when I type the word "becasue", the 'S' always ends up ahead of the 'U'. Even when I think about it. It's just one of those quirky things about my fingers. they have a mind of their own. Saturday, I spent a couple hours trying to figure out how to add my photo to my profile and/or blogs. I downloaded that "hello" program but still can't figure out how to post my pic. If anyone ever reads this and can give me some pointers, I would greatly appreciate it. I scanned through a few blogs of other people too. Jeepers. Many of them had comments on their blogs. Maybe mine is so dull it doesn't merit any comments. No big deal. I don't really write this for others anyway. I gotta get to the school today and see if I can get into the class I dropped this Summer, this Fall with a different teacher. It's a wonderful day in the neighborhood. Enjoy it!
