I believe that's why David mentions his vows to God in Psalm 56:12.  Anyway, I connected a few passages to the fear of the Lord, including Ecclesiastes 5:1-7, which mentions fear, God, prayer and vows repeatedly.  In it, Solomon commands us to keep quiet when we go to God's house, because He is up in heaven, and we are here on earth.  I also pointed out Matthew 10:28 where Jesus commands us to keep it short when we pray as well, and not to be like the Gentiles, who think they'll be heard for their many words.    Hands shot up like fireworks all across the classroom, naturally.  "But God is our Abba, and he wants to hear what concerns us!"  "But we should bring our feelings to God, even if we don't know what we're feeling!"  "But I don't always know what I'm praying about when I start praying!".  It's like these passages were traditions of men or something.    Anyway, the most coherent argument against being sparse and careful with your words in the presence of the Lord was that God is our Heavenly Father, and cares about what we care about.  This is obviously true.  What I would like to ask (and then answer in the next paragraph) is why that truth means we should feel free to gush before God, and not think carefully about what we say to Him in an attitude of fear and respect.    And like a lot of things, I think it comes back to our failures as fathers in Christian families.  Too many Christians believe that the two options for fatherhood are 1) hard, stern and cruel, or 2) soft, indulgent and sentimental.  We all know number one is not the right option, so we aim for number two, and think that that must be the character of the Lord.  Think of every picture of Jesus you've ever seen in a children's Sunday School classroom that doesn't contain the cross.    But as others have posited, number two is just as wicked and ungodlike as number one.  God is not an indulgent Father, but instead He disciplines us in godliness to show his love (Heb 12).  He is indeed the Father from whom all Fatherhood derives its name (Eph 3:15).  Therefore we should treat passages like Eccl. 5 and Matthew 10:28 not as seeming contradictions to our ideal of fatherhood, but helpful passages to teach us how to be (and treat) fathers here on earth.
