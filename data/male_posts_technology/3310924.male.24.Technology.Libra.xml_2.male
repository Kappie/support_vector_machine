What is equally amazing is how much they can impact your mood when you are awake.  It was one of those kinda of dreams this morning for me... the kind where you think that you should get therapy after you wake up.  Scarry isn't it?  Anyway, I am going to post more later, I just was thinking about this stupid dream and wondering if really there is anything that I can do about it.  Later...
