I haven't been hit that hard in a while, I almost threw up after getting knee'd and kicked in the gut by Shihan for not covering up - not to mention John was smashing my legs out from under me!  Dammit I'm always so hesitant when I fight I realise and it's a mentality from my non-contact sparring days. I need to get rid of that. Like right now.
