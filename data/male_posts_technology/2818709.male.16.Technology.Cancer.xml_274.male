So i am an Indie Geek. harrr! Now all i need to do is buy some jeans, and i will be indie. rarrrrr!    i am an indie snob!      urlLink  How indie are you?  test by  urlLink ridethefader   You're just too cool for school, aren't you? You're pretty narrow minded  and opinionated with regards to music (and probably most other things  as well). But you're allowed to be, because you really  are  better  than everyone else. You take pride in obscurity.  You probably prefer vinyl too, you elitist bitch.     Biznitch. Fear my music that you havn't even heard of. *shakes fist* All the kick-ass bands? Yeah. I liked them before they were cool. Now I have to find new music, you fucktards.
