Great warriors lived in the village, and they all owed their allegiance to the chieftain. Life was good, but very hard.        One day treacherous orcs came to the villiage. Through devilry most foul, the chieftain was forced to make the villiage swear allegiance to the newcomers. Afterwards the chieftain left the villiage and killed himself.  The Orc, along with the other warriors, were honorable, and upheld their oath to the usurpers. One by one the warriors fell. The last warrior is The Orc.  One day men came to the villiage. They killed the usurpers, and the women, and the children and took the men as slaves. The Orc fought bravely, but was subdued and enslaved.  The Orc has sworn revenge on the murderers of the usurpers. His master was murdered, and he is honor bound to avenge his master.  One day he will avenge his masters. Afterwards, having no master to serve, he will travel into the wilderness, committ suicide, and die with honor.   -----   The Orc follows a strict code of honor. This code might include the following commandments:  - Never suffer an elf to live. - Never run away. - Never take prisoners. - Never owe debt. - Never defy master. - Never touch a corpse. - Never show friendliness. - Never break an oath.  [NOTE 1: While all the items in the code of honor appear rigid, note that every item can be followed with the clause "by choice."]  Should the group encounter The Orc, he will be reasonably cooperative as long as they all have the same goal. This doesn't mean he'll be friendly, or nice, but he'll suffer that they live. Though he lives to die, he doesn't have a death wish, nor is he stupid. He is going to make sure that he lives to kill his master's killer and to finally kill himself. As long as the group is directly pursuing that goal, he'll suffer that they live.  His race is one of suffering. They suffer mountains dominated by dwarves. They suffer being slaughtered by men. They suffered the thievery of the elf god who stole Gruumsh's eye. They are damned to live in cold mountains, wrapped in stinking animal hides, eating rotting flesh. The Orc sees this as a punishment undeserved, but stoicly accepts his place in the world.  The Orc stands 5'10". His skin is deep olive, and his hair long and black. He is finely muscled and compact. He wields a gigantic greatsword, three times the size and wieght of a normal weapon (in game terms I increased the weight by 3; instead of weighing 15 lbs. his sword weighs 45 lbs. The only game effect I can see is the sword requiring a certain strength to be useable).   -----   [NOTE 2: My fucking internet decided to be a fucking dipshit. I got logged off and it erased my first post before I could get it up. GOD DAMNIT!! I've had to write this fucking thing twice!!]  [NOTE 3: I edited this post, but the fucking blog/internet decided I didn't.  Fucking shit.  This is probably why I don't do this more often.]
