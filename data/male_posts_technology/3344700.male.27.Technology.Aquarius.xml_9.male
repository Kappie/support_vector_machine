Microsoft says that the aim of this new version ASP.Net 2.0 is to reduce the amount of code required to accomplish common Web Programming tasks by 70% or more. But I feel this needs lot of thinking for programmers..Even though coding task is reduced!!!  I found a nice article on this latest version in MSDN Magazine June 2004 Edition. Here Jeff Prosise provides a broad overview of what we can expect in ASP.Net 2.0, with more focus on selected areas and sample programs to highlight the key features.  I found it very interesting and amazing..   urlLink An Overview of the New Services, Controls, and Features in ASP.NET 2.0
