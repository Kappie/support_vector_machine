One reason that I do not believe in religion is because I notice that in the olden days religious leaders used to use censorship, fear, and propaganda in order to keep their followers obeying their orders almost like a militia or a corrupt government and they prevented improvements by banishing anyone who dared to believe that they had more intelligence then church leaders as another way to stay in power for longer. Another thing I do not like is in every religion there tends to be a reward that will be given to a righteous follower in the after life which seems ridiculous because if it really were true and we knew for sure that we would be getting a reward when we die churches would be packed and nobody would commit crimes and people might even try to kill themselves on purpose or like the Islamic cultures where the Muslim men become suicide bombers so they may be known as martyrs.       don't get me wrong now, to everything negative I believe there is a positive and "modern" churches definitely give out a good vibe because they help people that cannot help themselves, they build a sense of community, people that attend church tend to make the world a better place, and it helps promote social interaction between people which does not happen as much anymore.    I myself could never possibly believe in a greater power that controls the universe, I personally believe that all of us organisms living on the planet earth somehow evolved from small bacterias that began to evolve to better adapt to the changing of the planets characteristics.  **Anyways its the weekend now and its late so I'm going to bed and catch up on some much needed sleep and who knows, maybe ill dream about some sort of greater power telling me something and I will create a religion called "Brophism" ...lol well L8R!!**
