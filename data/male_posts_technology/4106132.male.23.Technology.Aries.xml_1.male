I'm very lonely, though I know that I have friends that I can contact if I want to. I dunno what's up with me. I've really been looking forward to the frames gig on saturday, but now that it's come about, I really don't feel like going out with my mates  am even considering selling my ticket. What's wrong with me?  ...oh yeah  Utd lost 1-0 earlier which really doesn't make me feel any better :(
