I picked up the discovery from the   SFW   and she is claiming that I do not deserve to be the custodial parent because I have a siezure problem, was verbally and mentally abusive to Jimmy and that I use the TV as a baby sitter for Karissa!  She has some nerve I tell you!  I mean if that is the case then she has bipolar disorder, has been equally verbally abusive and has a violent nature about her!  I think the police report from her striking me proves that!  The entire time she lived with her brother you know who babysat the kids?  Hello TV!  I am so pissed off about this and some other things I cannot go into on her right now.    I talked to Karissa today though and she and I talked about how she went to the beach and played in the water and stuff.  She told me about her coming here and how I should not be sad and she did not want me to be sad!  Of course she was saying some things and must have had a great look on her face because everyone was laughing at how cute she was.  This only inflamed me more as I was already dealing with stuff from earlier in the day.    Then I got   SFW   on the phone and she says "what are you getting Karissa for her birthday?  I am just curious so we don't get the same stuff."  Then she proceeds to tell me " WE  got Karissa a couple of barbies, a mermaid barbie, a fairy barbie, and some books and stuff.    This pissed me off as well because now she is rubbing in the fact that her and   FS   are able to buy presents together and I have to scrape together pennies and stuff to get Karissa presents.    With each passing day I think the life of bachelor is the way to go because in the end I will have more money and I won't have to worry about losing my money, home, and family because I gambled on love and lost!  Maybe that is being cynical I don't know but at 20:14 on June 29, 2004 that is how I feel right now.
