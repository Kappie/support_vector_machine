The Fed moves about $1.8 trillion a day on a closed, stand-alone computer network. But soon it will switch to a system called FedLine Advantage, a Web-based technology.  Proponents say the system is more efficient and flexible. The current system is outdated, using DOS — Microsoft's predecessor to the Windows operating system.  But security experts say the threat of outside access is too big a risk.  This is a no brainer to me. The good news is that the hackers will be busy with this and will leave my pc alone for a while.
