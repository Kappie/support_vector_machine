I was surprised to see Darryl from BVCC drop in as well. Then Bridgette came. After class started the twins Darrel and Daniel arrived too (later I found out one of them got his slippers stuck in mud and was 'trapped' there for over an hr while he waited for his brother to go home and grab another pair of slippers). 3 sec after Richard started warmups, he asked me what belt I was. Told him 5th kyu, then he wanted me to take the warmups. That's when I kinda freaked. Told him I'm not familar with taking warmups but he said we all needed to start from somewhere. So I took them thru what I could remember, with some pointers from Richard. Ar ... it still feels weird to me lah. Made mistakes here and there probably coz I felt nervous. Never thought I'd take warmup at all one day. Still dun really want to lah. Dunnoz, figured I'm not the kind to take up too much dojo responsibilities at this stage, just enjoy being one of the foot soldiers so I can train. Anyways, I did take the warmup slow and easy because I felt that usually we were just rushing through the motion of it too quickly. Of course, I didn't make them do any killer warmups that Eileen or Sunny did. Haha ...  We did gyaku and ai hamni nikkyo today. Went through very slow processes but it still felt like we all learned something today. Hah ... Richard brought his toy gun again tonight as a prop for nikkyo techniques. Farny man ...  Btw, asked the twins to come early next time coz I really dun wanna take warmups anytime soon. Doh...  Like to share some things Richard said as well which I, well, never exactly quite thought over before. He mentioned that uke and nage when practicising are on equal standing. No one is better than the other. A senior needs to bring himself down to a junior's level and the junior to that of the senior's (mabbe not in terms of technical stuff, but could be in terms of attitude, observations, etc). As a senior I why should I feel good at being stronger than a junior? No basis for feeling proud of that as an achievement. To me it's ego at work. Something we need to rectify and eliminate. All of us have heard this before I'm sure, that we should help each other when it comes to learning the technique.  A point on ego that Alvin Khong told me a few months back. When I asked him how long he has been training, he said "Since the year xxxx, you go and calculate." He says he don't like to keep track of the no. of years he has been practising Aikido. It's only to boost your ego. Why would you be counting up the no. of years of training anyway? Counting up to what? To tell people about it? Makes me so ashamed man. Before we had that conversation I'd always tell people, I've been training xx no. of years. Now I'm trying to adopt the same attitude by saying "since 2000". But I gotta admit in mind there's still the thought that's counting, more out of habit than anything else.  Daphne and I had a talk about something last week on 'False Humility'. It's like when people praise you, and you just say things like "No lah, no lah" "Dun have lah", etc. She says I have a problem about listing out my flaws all the time. She said I need to be more accepting about my strengths. True I think. Told her it's cause I hate it so much that people who dunno me gets a lot of false impression about me. Simply HAAAATE it. I rather people see me as I am, even if it means seeing my flaws first. But it's true, I tend to refuse compliments often. I think there's nothing wrong with simple "Thanks" for the nice comments afterall. Something I need to look into. Heh :)
