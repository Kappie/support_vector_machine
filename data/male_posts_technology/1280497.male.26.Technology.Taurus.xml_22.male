I would sit downstairs in the house, eating pretzels and drinking Diet Coke (which, honestly, is not the drink I think of first when I'm thirsty) as I did my homework. It's cool to eat something or smell something and have that thing take you back a long time to a place you haven't thought of in a while. It makes you wonder what will make a kid that's growing up right now think back fondly on his/her childhood...will it be the smell of McDonalds, or Carls Jr.? Wendy's? It's tough to say, though I doubt that the answer is "home cooking"   I realize that Diet Coke and pretzels don't fall in the category of "home cooking" either. I'm not lamenting the state of this world. I like this world.
