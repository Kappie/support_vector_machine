Given his obvious lack of brains, I suspect his "program" probably just clicked endlessly from the same IP address - something Google is sure to trap.  To pull this sort of thing off, he'd have to have some sort of worm that makes zombies of thousands of computers, each of which clicks just once on any given Google ad.  (And not too many ads from one IP per day, either.  You can bet Google limits that too.)  Frosting on the cake is him actually showing up at Google, expecting to discuss the terms of his extortion.  Amazing.
