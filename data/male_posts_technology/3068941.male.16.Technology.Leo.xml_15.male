So  I had to re write the entire script to fit the formatting, it sounds like a bad thing but it turned out to be good, there where some parts that made no sense or that where just completly random, or just sounded just plain STUPID. So I did a lot of that today. This weekend I had to do LOTS of school work, I ha behind 3 weeks in my phsycology calss and I only have 3 days of school left. Do, yeah, that will be taking up alot of my time. I am also trying to find someone who has a good camera and is willing to let my filming team to burrow it. I also have to finish the sctipt in a month so we can cast and shoot it before I go to Germany at the end of July, then there is a website that I have to help make, that will take a wile, but will be worth it($$ need i say more). But the Indo film will be my personal top o' the list project. Thats all.
