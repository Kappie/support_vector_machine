Received a Gentoo Linux CD set (generic install, Pentium4 specific, AthlonXP specific) and a Gentoo t-shirt. Hope the guy who created Gentoo Linux gets enough support to repay his debts.His product is amazing. Too bad he left the developement... F**K!!! My freedom day has moved further away ... I thought i would be free at the 1st of July but apparently it won't happen until the 20th of that month ... 20 More days of service ... AAAARGH!!!! Had a few moments to work on my software project with minimal results if any ... I need more time ... maybe i should move it to one of my servers so as to work on it over the internet ...  Over the next few days i will have many "social obligations". I hate loosing my time like this. Stil haven't received my Hackademy Magazine... Why does it take so many days for something to get from France to Greece ?? It is three hours to travel from Athens to Paris on airplane, but it is almost two weeks since i made my order. Maybe i should start investigating the possibility of mail loss...
