After the 1995 bombing in Saudi Arabia, which killed five U.S. military personnel; Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished.   After the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 and injured 200 U.S. military personnel; Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished.   After the 1998 bombing of U.S. embassies in Africa, which killed 224 and injured 5,000; Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished.   After the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, which killed 17 and injured 39 U.S. sailors; Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished.   Maybe if Clinton had kept his promise, an estimated 7,000 people in New York and Washington, D.C. that are now dead would be Alive today.   AN INTERESTING QUESTION:  This question was raised on a Philly radio call-in show.  Without casting stones, it is a legitimate question.  There are two men, both extremely wealthy.  One develops relatively cheap software and gives billions of dollars to charity.  The other sponsors  terrorism.   That being the case, why is it that the Clinton Administration spent more money chasing down Bill Gates over the past eight years than Osama bin Laden?    THINK ABOUT IT!  It is a strange turn of events. Hillary gets $8 Million for her forthcoming memoir.   Bill gets about $12 Million for his memoir yet to be written.  This from two people who have spent the past 8 years being unable to recall anything about past events while under oath!  Incredible!  THINK ABOUT IT!
