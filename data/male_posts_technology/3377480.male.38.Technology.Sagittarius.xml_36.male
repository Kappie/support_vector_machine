Dad and I argued for ever, not so much with each other but ourselves on how to get it square.  Both trying to remmber geometry.  I passed out from the heat about 2pm,  dad went in and took a nap, as he was falling asleep, he had a brain storm, so him and the my son went out, and squared it up.   Me i was really passed out.  The heat got to me (something about wearing or not wearing a hat, I will wear one for now on) Katy woke me up about 4:30 said, "your dad and chase have the pool squared up!"   I believe the walls are within 1/4 of an inch of being level and square. most are dead on, one corner gave us fits, its probably within an 1/8th of an inch from one corner to the other.    I checked after the concret collar was done yesterday and it looks right on.  close enough for me anyway!
