I must admit I feel like i have turned a corner in poker.  On my last trip to foxwoods I lost.  And while that may seem like a bad thing, I actually learned a TON on that trip.    First, I have successfully memorized  urlLink Mike Caro's Laws of Tells .  No joking, while I was there, I was able to read tells all the time.  And in several instances (lets say 7) I was able to act accoriding to the tells.  5 out of the 7 times, they worked distinctly in my favor, and on 2 times I was fooled and got burned.  But no tells are ever perfect, and I truly believe I was running that table and totaly in control for several hours.  The painful lesson I did learn however, was that after a few hours, I get sloppy and tired.   And I need to learn to just get out.    Hence my online poker regiment.  A set time limit of 2 hours.  A set limit of a max and a min money amount. (if I hit either, I leave).  All of these are just ways to keep myself disciplined.  The amazing thing is, it all seems so simple to me now.  If you play tight (meanign only stay in with good hands, never bluff, never chase..etc)  You can just wait out a pot.  Last night I only saw the flop on about 34% of the hands I was dealt.  That means I folded before the flop on 66% of the hands.  I was playing nice and tight.   Oh.. and I also won 16% of all hands that I was dealt, which means I won about half of the pots I played in.  And it turns out, I left pots early when they didnt work out.   Only about 2 times did I stay to the river to lose the pot.  Very good night.  Lets see if my strategy holds up.   Tight play.  Short Time Limits.  Follow my own rules.
