It's very crude technically. It embeds a gif file (click thumbnail to the left for full size) which looks like a normal marketing HTMLised email (even down to the bad grammar!) which looks like it has a valid link in the standard blue, underlined text. The whole gif is in fact a clickthrough to the spoofed login site.    What concerns me most about this is how exactly have the phishers got the email addresses of MBNA customers? I smell a breach of the Data Protection Act. I'll give them a ring tomorrow and see what they say.
