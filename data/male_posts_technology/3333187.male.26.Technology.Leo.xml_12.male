LOTR Return of the king, Last Samurai and Buffalo Soldier are all Fantastic films. But on a sad note found out that DEAD-END and Starship-Troopers 2 SUCK HAIRY WET RHINO BALLS! But hay three out of five... Not bad.  I have also learned that is quite painful floating around town for about three hours is hard... On the up point, The Day After Tomorrow is actually good. Not the be all and end all for all films, but dam good summer flick.  I found out watching a whole day a cartoons, e.g. Dave the Barbarian (it ROCKS!!) is not very good for you. After the fifth hour you begin to act like the characters.. Not a good day for all involved in that one. And if you watched the show you'd know!!  I have also learned that staying up till four or five in the morning watch crap on TV and sleeping till eleven or twelve is the best cure for insomnia!! But side note on this, you tend to wake up a bit groggy and not here the beeping of the alarm that was set the night before. Well I guess that the noise for that dam thing going off is cure enough for that one!  All in all Great couple of days off. And now I'm back in work, but two days left till the weekend again.. UP THE FIG-NEWTON!!
