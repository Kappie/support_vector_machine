I'm gonna use this thing to do the normal, usual, "Today I...", and the uh... other one... to talk about uh... other things ( ;) at some).  Soooo, to start.  I've started construction on a new computer that's going to totally rock... well let me rephrase that, I ordered a few components. I will begin the construction as soon as I recieve them. I was planning on getting a laptop, but I decided a desktop was more economical for me and what I'm using. So here are the basic stats of the computer I'm building:  Motherboard -  Intel D875PBZ Motherboard   Processor -  Intel Pentium 4, 3.2ghz with 800mhz FSB and 1mb L2 cache, includes Hyperthreading   Ram -  1gb (2 512 sticks) Corsair 184pin Dual Channel DDR400   Hard Drive -  Maxtor 200GB 7200RPM IDE Hard Drive   Optical Drives -       .: Sony Black 52x32x52x16 Combo Drive (CD-RW/DVD-ROM)       .: ASUS Black 52X QuieTrack Technology CD-ROM Drive   Power Supply -  ASPIRE ATX-AS500W   Video -  .: nVIDIA GeForce FX 5700 256mb DDR ram  .: nVIDIA GeForce FX5200 128mb DDR ram, Dual-Head   Monitor(s) - ( 3 of them! )  SCEPTRE X7g-Komodo V 17" LCD Monitor   Sound - ( 1 ,  2 ) Creative Labs Sound Blaster Audigy2 ZS Platinum PCI Sound Card (THX Certified)  Speakers - ( 1 ,  2 ) Logitech THX Certified Z-680 5.1 500watt Speakers  That whole thing is costing me around $2,600. Not too shabby if I do say so myself.
