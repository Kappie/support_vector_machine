The company indicated that you have 90 min plus the length of the call after it ends. So, 9 AM call ended at 9:35. 9:35 + 1:30 = 11:05. 11:05 + :35 = 11:40.  I finished the damn thing at 12:30, an hour late... sigh...  Yet, I'm not sure if the soreness in my body from being so tense and adrenaline-driven for that long is worse than losing out on the cash. If I were able to do the thing in 2 hours, it'd be good money. But who can type over 50-55 words a min.  I mean really??  I need a nap, and I'm supposed to start another one at 2.  Must. Drink. Coffee.
