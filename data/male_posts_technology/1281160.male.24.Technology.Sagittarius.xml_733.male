When my brain takes the topic of working hard and growth it coerces me to think about the technological growth.   Putting myself as an evangelist I am captivated, but conversely there are blues. Let me put it elaborate.   Technology yields growth and makes me lazy. Technology gives wealth and keeps me away from the rest.  If there wasn’t an idiot thing called Tele Vision I would have interacted more with my family. If there wasn’t a stupid device called mobile, my passion towards meeting people would have been more. If at all there was Edison I would have slept at the earliest. If there is no such thing known as computers I would not have had much of my Indian brothers without work.  Two or three plastic cards, a mobike, mobile, billiards or snookers, coffee day; my like and dislike isn’t a matter of consideration. I am forced to have these. Aren’t we missing the pleasures of meeting our loved person after years of separation? (Curse webcams, VOIP’s, Internet, e-mail etc.) When was the last time you had food with all your family members present?? (curse hot packs, refrigerators..) tell me one pleasant moment you and your loved one chewed the fat without being disturbed by a mobile call?  Isnt there a difference between a machine washing your dear one’s clothes and you doing it for him/her? Isnt there a difference between automatic oven and your loved ones palm?   Simple pleasures in life will make a huge difference. As Murtu puts it “we are marching towards making of a materialistic world”. We are playing for the sake of playing and not for the sake of pleasure.   In future if I am blessed with a whole Sunday with my dear, It makes sense for me to switch of my mobile, TV etc., and prepare a cup of black tea and say “I LOVE YOU DEAR” instead of taking her to a coffee day and order for two capacinos.       Somewhere we need to draw line between artificial good things and real good things.   Test it by yourself…..  Chutney from mixer grinder and chutney from the stone grinder.  Taste  will tell you which is the real good thing.  (tring tring….) it’s a call in my mobile and am returning to the dubious world.  Bye  Bala
