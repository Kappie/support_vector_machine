And what about hypochondriacs who waste valuable space? Should they be treated?    I think with the NHS they should simply take a step back, look at themselves and then sort themselves out. There must be a logical way to sort out the long lists etc... somewhere. Hypochondriacs - well ok so they do waste space, sometimes. Maybe sometimes what they say is true. But they are still entiled to hospital visits. Perhaps it should just be a case of making doctors etc.. more efficent so that they can spot these people, check them out throughly but get them out quickly. Smokers - I don't like smokers. I hate it. Its the thing itself I hate but the people I dislike are todays generation. They all know the risks, they all know it could kill them yet they still go ahead. They are dumb. But those from our parents generation and before, they didn't know and now they do they can't stop. Its a fair argument. Its hard to quit it if you've been smoking for years. They should be entilted to free health care. It isn't their fault. Techically it is for smoking something that is damaging but they didn't know. My gran died from lung cancer and brain tumor. Created by smoking. I had to watch her die and I wish something could've been done about it but it couldn't. I don't blame her for smoking, I don't even blame the cigarette itself. I blame the fact that back then, she didn't know. Maybe it was cool, maybe it wasn't. Maybe it's just something they all did but the fact is she didn't know the dangers, couldn't give it up. Thats fair. Wish she'd have known, wish she would've stopped but hey, I can't do anything about it now.   But back to the question in hand.  Smokers should be given free health care. There should also be more warnings etc.. for us today. Maybe we should even take a lead of out Dublins book and become a city where you are not allowed to smoke in public. In your own home etc.. fine but not in public.  Then again. If your mum or dad had been smoking and you believed they shouldn't get free health care because its their choice, what if they became ill and weren't allowed in hospital. Even though something could be done to save them? You'd have to watch them suffer, maybe die. Its not nice. Would you still feel the same way? Even if they didn't know the risks at the time?
