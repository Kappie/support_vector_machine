You pick up your coffee and then naturally move over to the condiments counter where they have cream, sugar, honey, stirrers, napkins, etc.    Right in the little basket with the packets of honey, someone had thrown two dirty stirrers.  And the trash was about two feet to the left of that.    I worry about this world.
