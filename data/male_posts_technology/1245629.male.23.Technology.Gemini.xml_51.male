But once, I had a chance of  catching the news alert tool wrong red-handed.   Below are few of the excerpts...    From: Senthil_OR Sent: 21 November 2003 14:10 To: mike.magee[at]theinquirer.net Subject: http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=727    http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=727   Why is this article on Friday November 21, 2003?   Can I know the reasons?     Google picked up this story - it's a glitch on their part I   think... it's   not resurrected on our pages...    Mike    Thank you Mike for your reply. I checked with the home page of theinquirer and made a search at page 2 of the inquirer and could not find this one.  I have sent a feedback to google news alert team.  Senthil    Yeah - don't know what the problem is... the news alerts are useful but oddly I don't have Dell in my news alert system so didn't notice it. Another reader did though - sent me a screen shot.  It's not there, and hasn't been there since 12799-727 stories ago...  Mike        Hi Senthil,  Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Google News is highly unusual in that it provides a news service compiled solely by computer algorithms without any intervention from human editors. Occasionally, this leads to an outdated article appearing in Google News and Google News Alerts. We are working to improve this, and the information you have provided will help us do so.  We appreciate your taking the time to provide feedback on Google News and hope you will contact us in the future with additional observations and suggestions.

It is a very old news and it was not featured in Friday November 21, 2003 edition of www.theinquirer.net  as per the author.  Kindly check this issue.  -Senthil
