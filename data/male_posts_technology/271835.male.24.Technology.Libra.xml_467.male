If an artist gets legal threats this site will set up a BitTorrent stream for their music and distribute it for them. Unsurprisingly the  urlLink Metallica / Jay Z  mash up referred to on Tuesday has been banned already - and yes Banned Music has a stream for it.    Will we see one of Bungers' works on here one day?
