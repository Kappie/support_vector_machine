As many of you might not know,  Mobile Suit Gundam  is a televised Japanese anime series that was aired in 1979. The idea of Mobile Suit came from the powered suit of  Starship Troopers , a novel by Robert Anson Heinlein (my all-time favorite author). The original  Mobile Suit Gundam  takes place during the One-Year War in the year Universal Century 0079 (U.C. 0079). During this time period humans live in orbiting space colonies called Sides. The ruler of Side 3 declares war against the earth for the independence of the colonies. The story is about a crew of Earth Federation Space Forces on a space ship called White Base that fight against the Principality of Zeon using human shaped weapons called Mobile Suits. The crew of White Base fight Zeon using an advanced Mobile Suit called Gundam, that is more powerful than any weapon that Zeons have previously produced. In the process, the Gundam's pilot, Amuro Ray, and the other draftees are exposed to the harsh conditions of war, participate in many brutal battles, and experience the tragic trials and consequences of the conflict.  (from wordiq.com)   Given that the people of Japan have been bombarded with the concept of Mobile Suits as future military hardware for the last 35 years, it's no wonder that the Gundam Pilot Academy was started in 2002...   2-22-02---- First Mobile Suit Pilot Training Simulator From Mistubishi - Banpresto - Sotsu Agency From   Newtype Asylum  : February 22, 2002: Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (Japan), in asscoication with Banpresto and Sotsu Agency, has produced   Gundam Pilot Academy   (tentative title) - the demonstrative version of the first ever mobile suit pilot training simulator in history, which is currently on exhibit and free testing for customers at "The AOU 2002 Amusement Exposition" (International Exhibition Hall 2 "General Zone") from February 22-23, 2002 at the Makuhari Mess, Chiba City, Chiba, Japan. The training simulator - with simulates the cockpit of RX-78 Gundam during the classic 'Jaburo Invasion' as shown in Gundam 0079 animation series - has a maximum of four players capacity, in which the MS piloting and shooting will be handled by the two front row players, and all four players will experience the training inside the simulator, which is equipped with 100 inches big screen image with picture generating equipment powered by high-speed processor, and the 24-bit digital sound source for high quality stereo surround sound; Each pilot's seat can experience the training fully in front, rear, left, right, plus shakeing up and down with maximum acceleration of 0.5G, all courtesy of a 6-axis electric motion base which are used in actual operation simulator for airplane.     And then only a few months later, Mitsubishi made it back in the Japanese news by The National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) granting Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. a prime government contract; developing the H-IIA Standard Type Launch Vehicle:   urlLink http://www.jaxa.jp/press/archives/nasda/2002/11/h2a_20021120_e.html   Hence my name: Mobile Suit Pilot X  I know this is old news but it's a "theory" I've held for a while now.  Anybody else see a pattern developing here? It's a lot of dots to connect. :)  I'd move to Japan if it weren't for their complete ban on private ownership of firearms. At any rate,  Go spacenoids! ^_^
