It was a chaotic day on Friday, as I was informed by colleagues, when the payroll system failed. All the blames went to everywhere except  /dev/null . Heh It was too, a day which I wasn't around to get the flames. It was pointless for me to be there tho, where all I can get are punishments of the sins I didn't make. But then, I was too, one of the people who had to be held liable of all the wrongs. Darn programmer! Darn the program! Darn everything else!  As of today, lots of employees didn't show up. They're like this,  urlLink complainants . It's 7th of the month and they're already complaining like shit as if they didn't get the pay for months. When I was with former employer, we are used to late pays. It's normal for us to receive our paychecks after the second week of the month, yet we're still grateful. It's not that we're too  urlLink complaisant , but we understand the  urlLink circumstances  faced by the people of the payroll.  Me? I did not intentionally  urlLink absentiate [ hackword... no definition ]  myself from work back then. I know. I have my responsibility. And... I also know, the limit of my body. I'm prone to rain-enabled disabilities. Heh... that's the term I coined up just now. It's a group of syndromes caused by polluted rain. As for me, the result is, I'd find myself unable  to wake up... err... collapsed, without even a dream.  Thanks to increased  urlLink susceptibility  to acidic rain.   Today's a working day again... and here I am... at a place I now  urlLink despise . Hahaha....  I'm counting to my day of  urlLink extinction .   PS:   I'm in the mood to place definitions of the words I use. Lucky t you.
