But the concept of them being terribly good for you is a little silly, unless you're making them special and with none of that powder they put in normal smoothies, with the sugar and the flavoring and such.   And those boost scoop things, well, that's just wishful thinking. Although I guess protein boost is a decent way to get another 15g, if you're really hurting for it.
