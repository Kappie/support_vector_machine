MALE COMEBACKS TO FEMALE COMEBACKS TO MALE CHAT UP LINES    Man: Haven't I seen you someplace before?  Woman: Yes, that's why I don't go there anymore.  Man: Really? I heard it was because everyone there calls you a fat slapper.    Man: Is this seat empty?  Woman: Yes, and this one will be if you sit down.  Man: Probably because you will be on your knees sucking on my co*k.    Man: Your place or mine?  Woman: Both. You go to yours, and I'll go to mine.  Man: That's cool, cause after I'm done shagging you in the back of my car, I don't give a sh!t where you go.    Man: How do you like your eggs in the morning?  Woman: Unfertilized.  Man: No problem, I can always shoot my load in your face.    Man: I would go to the end of the world for you.  Woman: But would you stay there?  Man: Probably, cause you seem like a right clingy bird that is impossible to get rid of once you shag.   Man: If I could see you naked, I'd die happy.  Woman: If I saw you naked, I'd probably die laughing.  Man: That works for me....as long as you are still a little warm when I shove it up your @rse.    Male: Would you like to dance?  Female: I'd rather die.  Male: I think you mis-heard me. I said your arse looks fat in that skirt.   Credit to  urlLink Dan  for the above...
