I got to hang out with my family including my dad, which surprised me because he usually is not off on Fridays.  I go to introduce Ann to everyone...and introduce everyone to Ann.  I got to tease Kelly.  Eat lunch with Jaclyn, Kristin, and Cara (yes she brought the book back).  Then I get home Sunday and the Bengals go 2-0 beating the defending Super Bowl champs (bizarro world) then I spent the night watching ppv wrestling...doesn't get better, heh?
