I considered blogging about my interest in playing on a hockey team again, after watching game 7 last night, but that's boring.   Then  urlLink this article  surfaced on Drudge.   The NO-DONG missile. It may be childish, but I  giggle  release a deep-throated HAH! whenever I hear that. Hats off to North Korea for the worst name for a weapon since the scud. You'd think that with North Korea vying for world attention, they would research what these names would translate to in modern English.
