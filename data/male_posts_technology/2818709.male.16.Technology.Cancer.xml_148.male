"In a single day at the Battle of the Somme in 1916, 100,000 British troops plodded across no man's land into steady machine-gun fire from German trenches a few yards away. Some 60,000 were killed or wounded. At the end of the battle, 419,654 British men were killed, missing, or wounded."  ...  Something's wrong here...  100,000 - 419, 654 = -319, 654  Where'd the 319, 654 troops come from?  were like, 1599 generations of babies born and killed in one day?!?!??!  I mean, if this were current, like last year, there probably would have been about 10,000 women in that force.  Back then, there were probably only about 200. Most of them were probably nurses....  30 x  1598.27 = 319, 654  I'm serious...if they were sending babies out on the battlefield, they must have been pretty desperate.  Let's take a moment of silence to remember the babies.  Silence is golden, so...  Babies = Silence Silence = Gold  Therefore,   Babies must be equivalent to gold.  Babies are golden?...Damn, i want to father some kids. Sounds profitable.  [Remember the babies, for they are bling.]
