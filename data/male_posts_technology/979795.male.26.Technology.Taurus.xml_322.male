Got my RSM to vet through it and got my S3 to sign it. Took me a long time and I felt so tired when I left camp. Must've caught a cold entering / leaving aircon offices and the weather's been all hot and cold in the late morning / early afternoon. Was so tired on the MRT and bus journey home I was practically asleep 95% of the time. Wasted leh, there was this really adorable kid standing in front of me in the MRT with his mom, aunt and sis I think. I was kinda awakened by him and he kept staring at me with a bewildered look as I slept. Imagine, me just waking up with a sleepy look on my face with this little boy staring at me all the while and poking my lap now and then. Well, maybe not quiet a poke coz the MRT was really cramped but it sure woke me up. Haha ... really adorable fella. The cute type you can just pinch his cheeks and just go "So cuuuuuuute."  Was suppose to go for the Combined Training this evening. But when I got home I felt so sick that I decided to grab a nap first. Slept right past training hours and even dinner time. I guess it wasn't exactly a bad thing either because I really felt refreshed after the sleep and my mind is a lot clearer. I'd really hate to be too sick to take my grading this Sun. Anyway I hope everyone else there will be enjoying their session. I really really wanted to at least take a look but the weather wasn't very forgiving either. There was qutie a heavy downpour then as well and I felt even colder than usual. Better go for water parade within the next few hours.  Neo has been bugging me for the web address of the 302 that had messaged me. Kept on and on about it it's starting to be irritating. But of course lah, I know he don't really mean anything. Anyway, I'm just kinda let the matter rest and forget about it. Got a long week ahead and lots to clear up before the year ends. Tomorrow I promised my mum to stay home and do some spring cleaning. Might as well stay home instead since grading's on Sun.  Oh had to point out something today. This Robin kept harping on and on about running every weekend at ECP. I said it's a great idea but I can't for this week. He just had to try and convince me again and again. I got a bit impatient and I had to sms him back telling him to just start learning how to take 'NO' for an answer. Didn't sound rude, but I made sure I expressed my opinion really firmly. Think he took the hint, but still messaged me back saying he's going to make it a point to train every week and aim for the full marathon in 2004. Didn't reply his final sms but I was thinking, it's of course good that he has goals like that. But setting too much too soon won't get anyone anywhere (reminds me of me intensifying my Aikido training lasttime too). I personally would love to be able to participate too but I would probably want to be able to complete the half marathon at a better timing and more effortlessly than I do now before even attempting it. I mean, it's not like I can complete 21km that fast now either. Anyway, I respect his decision and I don't want to have the I-know-it-all-or-better-than-you attitude when I talk to him.
