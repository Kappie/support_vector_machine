You walk the mandatory 50 ft away from the building and step into the shade the temperture falls to a humid yet lovely 10 degrees cooler.You light your ciggarrette. As you puff away you think to yourself, 'Whats everyone bitching about? Its not that bad out here." It becomes a little hotter as you sit on the bench puffing away till it gets to a humid yet slightly a little too warm. You feel slightly suffocated since people with asthma really shouldnt smoke especially in humidity so you do your lungs a favor and put out the ciggarette. You step outside the shade and WHAMMO! Gods sick twisted little mind thinks that it will be funny to make the temparture go up to a stifling 98 degrees with max humidity. Its like a punishment for smoking too long when your not supposed to have that break. It's 50 feet back to the door. You think you should run, but your feet just cant. You trudge to the doorway, hair falling and laying flat on your head trapping the humidity on your skull, your bangs start leaking sweat into your eyes and your makeup starts running in turrents. You now look like crap. Coworkers will know you went on an illegal break and now you stink. You get to the door, you forgot to punch the handicap button five feet away and this door is heavy. You try to tell your arm to open the door, your arm rebels. Your tell your feet turn around, the buttons right there do arm a favor. Your feet say 'Fuck you and the arm, We just walked 50 feet.' You stand there in a debate with feet and arm looking like an idiot staring at all the nice AC'd people inside while God is up there laughing at you with Michel and the boys. You picture Michel putting back Hard Lemonade say 'Crank it Jesus, Crank it some More!' It gets hotter. Finally the arm gives in and you walk under that mandatory whiff of AC right by the door. Feels nice yet now the running makeup and sweat under your armpits freezes into a stinky sticky gell.   Is smoking worth it? Must be because I'm about to have another. God ... Bring It On!
