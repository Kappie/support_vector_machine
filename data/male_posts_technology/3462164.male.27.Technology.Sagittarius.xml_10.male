The bad news is that Startrek 11 is going to be a prequel concept. It will focus on the Romulan Wars, and follow a crew of new characters that have never been seen before. This is such a bad idea. Startrek fans don't want to see a movie about a bunch of characters we have never seen before, we want to see more movies with The Next Generation crew and Deep Space Nine crew. Doing a movie with new characters means they will have to waste time introducing the characters first. Also, they can't do the Romulan Wars justice in a movie, or even three movies like they are thinking about. It is much too big a conflict. If Paramount moves ahead on this, it could very well kill Startrek.   Now for the good news. First, production on Season 4 had begun. The first episode is titled Storm Front, and it will pick up where the Season 3 finale, Zero Hour, left off. Fortunately, they will not resolve the cliffhanger in one episode, but take three, which is what I was hoping for.   More good news is that Manny Coto is taking over more and more responsibilities from Brannon Braga. This should lead to Season 4 being even better than Season 3.   While William Shatner has not yet been signed tomake an appearance in Season 4, another Startrek alumnus has. Brent Spiner, who played Data in Startrek: The Next Generation, will be in episodes 4-6. He will play the grandfather of Doctor Noonien Soongh, creator of Data. To add a twist to his character, Spiner's character will be against the development of artificial intelligence. Having the likes of Spiner and Shatner do guest appearances on Enterprise will be great, but I hope that they don't get to carried away with it. If they bring back to many old faces, it will be more of a gimmick to attract fans who have left the show in the last few years, and it won't make the shows any better.   As I am writing this post, Trekweb.com just posted that the season premiere of Enterprise has been delayed from September to October 8. To make matters worse, the show will premiere at 8 PM, even though the rest of the season will be at 9 PM on Friday. UPN obviously doesn't have the slightest clue on how to promote Startrek. The majority of their commercials were horrible last season, they have moved the show from Wednesday nights to Firday nights, and they can't even be consistent from week to the next with the time. In the likely even that UPN doesn't order anymore episodes after season 4 concludes, hopefully Paramount will find another network to pick Enterprise up, or put it into syndication.
