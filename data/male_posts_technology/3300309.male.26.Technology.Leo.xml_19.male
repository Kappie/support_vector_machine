I now have an e-mail address  where all my thoughts can collect and appear on the web, my mind, deconstructed  and distributed in the most convinient form yet.          I used to think e-mail was pretty convinient, then  I got my own website, a database back-end allowing online creation, posting and  editing of my information. Now this...amazing and so scary at the same  time.          Where this goes, who knows, perhaps that's the  point of this whole blog idea, to see where it eventually ends up.          Until later.          Jody
