Between meetings and fixing user problems the day is just over.  Good.  We are FINALLY getting some glorious sunshine and I managed to con about 15 boys and girls to come down to the local park here in abingdon for a kick about with both an english  and an australian football.  Funny how everyone just thought it's like kicking a rugby ball . . . . . except that they keep toeing it and hurting themselves :- ).  Just came off a glorious weekend.  What was so special?  I spent both days away from work.  The last 7 weeks have involved me doing 6 day weeks which is great for my bank account, just not me.  I spent Saturday in southampton with a great Australian friend Bel.  We walked around, had a meal and she took me on a tour of the "Jewel of the Caribbean" which is where she works as a croupier.  This "Ship" or “Big f*ck off floating city” that I affectionately call it is bigger than big.  14 stories containing gyms/restaurants/23 bars/health clinics/shops/theatres and anything else you would ever want.  Just fantastic.  The price, I can hear you all ask. If you want to go ritzy [but not the best], you're looking at about US$20,000 for 7 days.. .. .. .. .. each.  pretty damn exclusive.  Oh and that doesn't include booze :- ).  So that was wonderful. Sunday started quietly with fixing up my friend Phil's boat.  A bit of varnish and it was looking good, so good in fact that we celebrated with a pub crawl of beautiful yet ridiculously hard to find pubs in oxford.  If you are in oxford or have any inclination to go.  I heartily recommend the following pubs:  The Trout [how many pubs come with their own peacock?] The Isis [only accessible by a mile long walk or a boat.  DEINATELY no roads] The Victoria Arms [A forty minute punt ride from the centre of Oxford]  After doing all three we then moved onto a barbeque at another work friends house and that rounded out the weekend just lovely.    Thank goodness it's work time otherwise I'd never get a break :- )
