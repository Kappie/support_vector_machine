I had, a few months ago, been unsuccessful in shipping a few cans of Altoids to India. (Why Altoids? Coz my momma digs the citrus flavored ones. That's why!). Mailed the package out, and it came right back with "REJECTED", or something of that nature stamped across the box.  Today I try and send out a box of CDs to my cousins, and JEEZ do I have to jump through hoops of fire. First I have to make sure that every bloody CD I shipped was manufactured in the US (What? They still make things in the US anymore?). Then I had to list em all on paper; names and estimated values. An hour later, I was informed that it was not possible to sent packages to overseas P.O.Boxes via DHL and so I'd have to ship via the "standard" route that would cost me a penny less. Yay.   :-/  I hate customs and duties and tarriffs and the like.
