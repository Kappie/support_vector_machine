So, changed the color, also added the , oooo,what shall now be known as rock my sloth section, where you the user can say things to the sloth, and each other.  Good times, gotta scare up some work, and also today=day one of the serious plan to quit smoking.  Plan developed by Lisa entails smoking a lot today, and then scaling back over the next 2 weeks, Lisa will be using Zyban (lame) and I will be using hard work, perseverance, and exercise (awesome.)  Also, Tiffany now has a dream job at a bar.  Way to go pal!
