Just before I was going to call for a cab at about 12:00 o'clock I got a call from the engagement manager that I have been selected for this project and I have to move to dallas in couple of days. Now everything was packed and I was ready to go so I had to unpack some of stuff. And as it goes i will have to stay here in Kenosha for another couple of days. About this project, this is going to be a challenging one in the sense that I am only resource from Infosys and we will be looking to create an impression so that we can penetrate more into this account.  The other four people who were interviewed were not selected by the client so this is going to be a one man show for some time now.Dallas is a big city and am looking forward to that now. To find out about Dallas I have checked following portal,  urlLink  City of Dallas Portal  . Also, I bought a laptop couple of days back from CompUSA, Chicago. It was a very good deal that I got so I finally bought it. Its an HP Pavillion zv34250 plus, 3.0 GHz Hyperthreaded, 512 MB (expanable to 2.0 GB) RAM, 60 GB Hard disk, WIFI enabled 54g (802.11g/b), One Firewire port (IEEE 1394), DVD +/ CDRW and 15.4'' WXGA screen machine with decent speakers. I guess thats it for now. Till the next log byeeeee.    Neeraj Sharma
