Its not a particularly steep hill, but nethertheless, this big brand new PHAT BMW was trying its hardest to climb the snowy road. Anyhow, it was doing this outside my house for a good 15 minutes. Along came an old, battered Citroen AX or something and went up the hill just as if it wasn't snowing. Useless car designs.
