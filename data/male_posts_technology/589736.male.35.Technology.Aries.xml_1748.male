I submit to you that we are not 4th century BCE Greeks, therefore the notion of the Republican form of government proposed by Plato (or at least written about by Plato) has no place in today's society.  I may have my information incorrect on Plato, as I don't remember much ancient history, but the specifics are not that important to my point.  Just because a concept is old does not mean it does not have modern relevance.  Where do you draw the line?  3,000 years - there goes the Ten Commandments 2,000 years - there goes the Republican form of government 1,000 years - there goes the Magna Carta 500 years - I can't think of anything except for the discovery the New World. 200 years - there goes the US Constitution 100 years - there go workers/consumers rights (labor unions / Sherman Anti-Trust laws)
