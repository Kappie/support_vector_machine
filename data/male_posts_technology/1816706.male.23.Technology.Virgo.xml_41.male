I was out there earlier this morning and the lifeguard came by to post up sharks sighted signs... just after I got out of the water.  Tiger sharks too I think they were saying.  No worries though, they said it had been the first time a sign like that was put up there in something like 15 years, so hopefully it'll be another 15 years before it happens again.  I also hiked this mountain just behind Lanakai beach too and got some great views and some great pics.  I have quite a few pics to upload... just as soon as I find that password.
