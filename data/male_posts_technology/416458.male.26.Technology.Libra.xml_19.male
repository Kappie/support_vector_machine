I'm finally taking some days off, the first since ... well I can't remember when. The Craig is finally gone from my sofa to a better place, in fact a much better place, I'm somewhat jealous.  So I'm just in the office trying to recover my sense of self from the chaos that is the office move around. Just something to instill fear and uncertainty in the staff. Our CTO is the only person that hasn't change position, so in this case the world really has revolved around him.  Well I'm off now to see my nephew again....
