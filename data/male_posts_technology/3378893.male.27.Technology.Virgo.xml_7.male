In particular, I'm working on a basic genetic algorithm (GA) program.  Eventually, I hope to start exploring new territory where no one else has been.  I am helping a graduate student, Matt Settles, with a project on neural networks.  My part of the project is writing a program that evolves a neural network by adding.  I'll be using an algorithm that is a hybrid between a traditional genetic algorithm and something called "particle swarm optimization" (PSO).  I still need to figure out the details of the later half.  After I'm done playing around with my basic GA program, I'll start working on a PSO version.  That's it for now.  I've got to get back to work.
