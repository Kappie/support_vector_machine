I'd like to ask you something. If you're reading this, could you comment on it telling me WHY you're here? Why are you reading my useless posts? It's a waste of time, is it not? Ah, I don't know, Maybe you're like me and you're bored outta yo' mind. I'm not entirely sure. Well I'm off to Best Buy, seems they've got a hdd there with my name on it. SEE YA.
