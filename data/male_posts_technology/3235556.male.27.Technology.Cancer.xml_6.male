After reading some of the opinions of the public regarding indecent behavior on network TV, I'm begining to think that Americans get dumber and dumber every day.  Well, with me being the anti-government-control person I am, I do feel a need for the government to take a little control here.  The old "change the channel if you don't like what your watchin'" routine doesn't work for me.  Network TV is supposed to be aimed at a general viewing audience, meaning everyone between the ages of 2 to 100 should be able to sit down and watch. Granted, much younger audiences are very limited to their viewing content simply because the subject matter is way over their head, or the material may be too scary or shocking to them.  For example, some news programs while showing a story on a particular type of surgery may show video clips or photos of that particular medical procedure in progress.  It's not that this material is lewd, or indecent, it's simply not understood by a very young audience, and could possible scare them or shock them.  At which point the addition of a parent or legal gaurdian to the scene can educate them, or prevent them from viewing at that particular time.  There are certain moral codes that all creeds, religions, races, and cultures can come to agree on at one point or another.  Many of these moral codes may include laws or reservations against violence on TV, public display of sexual immoraility/provacation, and use of profanity.  In my opinion, network TV needs to be controlled to a point where all programming is decent and acceptable for all audiences, with exception to the above stated regarding younger audiences.  Children are not always under supervision, and even so, are not always under supervision of a competent adult.  Nothing can stop a un-supervised child from flipping through the channels and seeing Janet Jackson show off her chest during the superbowl.  That content is simply not suited for network TV.  If you own a TV, you have no choice but to pick up the network stations, but cable can be controlled and even removed, so why must this garbage content be broadcast on the only stations some of us may be able to pick up?   The change needs to not only include sensorship from the 'home front', but from the broadcasting stations that the garbage is being transmitted from.  As far as heavy fines for an offense, in many cases the offender is only slapped on the wrist.  Penalties need to include being taken off the air, and being subject to public persecution and boycott.  If there's no audience, theres no tv-show, simple as that.
