But properties can be used to validate a value before being assigned to the private variable.  My personal idea is, when validation is required, have a separate private method to do validation and call that method inside the propertyâ€™s setter and else where.  i.e:   Private m_name As String   Public Property Name() As String Get Return m_name End Get Set(ByVal Value As String) Dim validValue As Boolean validValue = ValidateName(Value) If validValue Then m_name = Value End If End Set End Property  Private Function ValidateName(ByVal p_name As String) As Boolean If p_name.Length   Or should we set the property in side SetName method? What is the best practice to use in such situations?  Please send in your ideas
