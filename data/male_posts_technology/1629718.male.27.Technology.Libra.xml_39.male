He Blows My NaDS!       urlLink     Another joyful addition to my useless sack of ramblin crap on this earth of oh god loviness for the fine thursday of hell almighty! Since it's only 4:16 here, I have a few more hours before grabbin my bag of stinkin ass laundry and hope that it cost less then a cheap hooker on a nyc street side.   After all you can only turn your pants inside out 2 times right? or will anyone justify that you can do it another way...  Today I heard the suggestion from a college student here in ADA that when they can't afford laundry they do it in thier bathtub? What the hell is this crap? How do you dry it I kindly asked ... Oh easy, you put it on the cieling fan and flip in on high , thats after you secure it with clothespins..wow this cheapskate really took some though into this, maybe i should save him the hellish view of living life as it is and bash him with a glass picture of koolaid on his forehead. After all the is Ada right?  So here goes my fanmail i'v saved up for a few months, yes todays the day to unveil why not couldn't be a better day!    urlLink     Dear Wicked,    After reviewing your website I noticed you put alot of self gradification into how good you are, what about all the rest of us? Why do you take credit for the design of the website when it's truly the work of someone else? And why are you tapping on poor people when you know your one as well?  -Jack ( urlLink Jack1@xx.com )  Dear Jack,   After reviewing your email it reminds me of how much better I am at self gradification and how much your religious view of how people are classified as poor and inexperienced relate to beer drinking / guzzlin hobo's kicked around by us better people on New York City Streets.  We all need to talk highly about ourselves, even though in due time it seems that you are 10, you will grow up, and as for ripping off websites, sure copyright it, but even elvis can't keep free people from sucking his funds dry for old lp's. Move on, and why your at it get off comcast, they suck.  -  Dear Wicked,   I thought you cared alot about your past? What happened to your daughter you loved so much and tried for? What about now?  -B (referred by your xwife)    urlLink    Dear B,    I surely how do honoribly shall bow before you and the rest of the world to express the flaws in the judicial system, and how much paperwork can do if someone gets off their fat ass and quits flying trips back and forth to california, one could afford a reasonible meal for the family. Funny as it seems, I do love my daughter, I send her things, and yet through many months of sending items , I haven't YET to recieve a colored picture of barney, more less a audio cassette tape or a video. So maybe one wouldn't be poor if one got a job? Oh wait! That'll never happen! Best wishes! I'll be playing my Xbox and watching my big screen tv thinking of you! As for my daughter, I'll continue to send things, as for the things i'll ever get back like a normal parent should, i'm still waiting. As for trips it seems like i have to do the 100%. Seems like someone doesn't own a car as well. Have a beer on me! Buddy!  -WCKED   urlLink     More to come....
