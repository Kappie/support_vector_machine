Python was the first computer language I ever learned, and it really spoiled me. It's a wonderful, fast, and interactive language, with every feature you could ask for.   It's easy to read, and it's easy to modify.   It's fast as it needs to be.   And the devel tools are nearly all completely free. And platform independent too.
