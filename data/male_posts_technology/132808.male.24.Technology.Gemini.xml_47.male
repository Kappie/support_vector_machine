The Packers have not done anything significant as of yet with free agent signings  but the real question is  do the 49ers not want to have a good team this year?  OK I know Owens was becoming a pain in the ass but he is one of the best recievers in the league and now he is with the Eagles and then they let Garcia go and his is with the BROWNS....I mean who in thier right mind signs with the browns...and on the bomber front eWe should get rid og Kahari and go for the player they just added a few agos to thier  Neg List... Kordell "slash" Stewart., yeah he is already a has been in the NFL but in the cfl he could stand out.   And another re-signing of some importance  we have Stoddard Back .  As for DVD's if you are looking for some suggestions as to what you should buy next first you need to comile a list of dvd's that you do have so people do not name them already.
