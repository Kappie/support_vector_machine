I did not think that was appropriate. But maybe tomorrow I will forget everything about it, except how I have this blog now to remind me. Also, my teeth are numb, this is my best:) And I think my lips are numb too, but I can't tell to sure. Well, I guess I need sleep, after all I am lopsided as I post this post.  Good night
