It contined the whole www.polarhome.com plus five months backup from all member server. Server will be recovered, but there are some damages that can not be repared.  Please note, that 12 member servers as redhat, debian, AIX, VAX etc, are not affected with this crash. They will continue to operate as usual, but some services will not be available imediately.  Q: How can such things happen to polarhome.com A: First: polarhome can not appreciate a real backup system that could satisfy polarhome current needs (about 60G compressed) therefore one HDD had been used for such purpose. Second: polarhome operates on home equipment that can not survive more than 4 years in such work environment. First died Ultrix box, then RedHat's HDD, then FreeBSD's, now gate's... which one is next? It is running out of control. There are too many users and to high expectations towards polarhome. But it will not change the reality. polarhome.com is not a professional system and everybody have to be aware of it... and on non professional eqipment shit happens more often. :(
