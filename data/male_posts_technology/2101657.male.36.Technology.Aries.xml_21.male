Basically it's an accelerated class for working people, to be able to take classes at night. Usually the classes are 2hrs, 2x a week, for 8 weeks.   The class I'm in, Introduction to Programming, is still 2x a week but it's only 1:15 a night, and runs through the 1st week of May.  I think having the full four months will be helpful.  I've done programming, for fun, and for a living.  Last time I programmed, was as a student learning C++.  After taking C++, I decided I actually liked COBOL better.   This class should be fun, as we'll be learning to program in Visual Basic.  This is something I've never done. I'm enthused about the class, and looking forward to a positive experience this semester! :-)
