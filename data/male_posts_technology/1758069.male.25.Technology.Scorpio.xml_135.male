This would not be the first time Rush has shown his true color (hint=ultra white). Since he’s now off the tube, and in trouble for drug abuse, I thought he might want another job to supplement the dimishing audience of his radio show. Here’s my picks:  Super-villain in a Steven Segal film Model for Big Boy Weapon of Mass Destruction (drop him over Iraq) Colombian drug lord’s bodyguard Elephant trainer World’s largest laundromat dryer Filling hot air balloons Wine press Sumo wrestler Test subject for frightening new drugs Sea World attraction Thanksgiving Day parade float Mongolian war monger Imperial Wizard of the Klan Buoy Steamroller Easter Island head World War II Revisionist Body double for the moon
