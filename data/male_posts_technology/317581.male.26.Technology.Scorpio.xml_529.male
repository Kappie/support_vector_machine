I mean they all suck in their own little ways: Beautiful people are always being hit upon by everyone. So they become more and more jaded by the people they know, especially if they date other very attractive people. It seems that most un-attractive people would date attractive people and love them, but an attractive person would become attracted to someone that is not attracted to them, thus creating an interest in why that person isn't interested in them. The attractive people will often find themselves in unhealthy relationships due to their constantly falling in love with people that aren't attracted to them.   For un-attractive people, or even socially challenged people there's can be a more worthwhile struggle: Instead of having to fend off suitors, they must deal with the constant barrage of rejection. They must constantly bring themselves back from the rejection and try and try again. They more easily learn that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and that they ust be willing to compromise for love. They struggle everyday with either trying to find love, or maybe giving up and trying to find other things to fill that void. (See video games)  The cute people I think have the best and worst of both worlds. The arrogant beautiful people not giving them the time of day, and rejecting them. The non-attractive psychos stalking them. And their want to find someone attracted to them, that they too are attracted to.  In the Te of Piglet, I read that a man had 2 wives, a plain one and a beautiful one. The story goes that a traveller came and stayed with the man and by the next day came to realize that the beautiful wife was left ignored, while the plain one was treated with honor and affection. When the traveller asked the boy of the household why. He replied "The beautiful one knows that she is beautiful; the plain one knows that she is plain." The moral being to put away your pride and act upon your Virtue.  I don't know if I'm explaining this very well as I'm trying to form my opinions based off what I'm reading right now, but I think the gist is explained. And in case you were wondering, yes, I am cute :)  Lost but in peace- Tim
