I felt that I got a bit of a good warmup and even though I didn't do anything that was really fantastic, I felt that I was actually making sorta some small (but primitive) progress for my ukemi. Hopefully tonight I can get more practice as well.  School's ok. I'm getting some work done early before it piles up too much towards the end of the term. Hope I can keep up and just drive myself a little bit harder towards the next few wks. I know some of my deadlines coming up so I should really be planning out the phases of my work properly and early now.  Timetable for this term seems quite alright. Though I expect things aren't goinna be finalised till next Fri. Anyways, so long as I got time for my work and Aikido, everything else should fall in place nicely ... I hope.
