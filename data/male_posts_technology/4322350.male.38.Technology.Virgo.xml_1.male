Why don't they cover the things I want to read about? If the campaign only listened to me, I just know they'd win.  Maybe someday I'll write a short story, or even a novel. That's funny, you should write it down. Yeah, in college, some, but not really anymore. See now, that, that, that would be a good movie. Johnny Depp would play Al, and maybe Geena Davis could be Gloria.  I still have to work all day, and I already have too many hobbies, but every single thing I've said so far rings true to me on some level. So, here's my blog. I hope you enjoy it, but mostly I hope I enjoy it.
