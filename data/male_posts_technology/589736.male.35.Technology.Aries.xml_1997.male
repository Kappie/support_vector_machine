We've been to the moon, kicked around the dust, and gotten the t-shirt.  What's the point?  I wanted there to be a larger goal - Mars.  So, I was initially happy about the recent announcement.  But, the more I think about, the more I question it.  Don't get me wrong, I still am in favor of it, but I'm not sure that we will see the benefits of the initial establishment of the NASA with all the new technology, which is what everyone in NASA seems to be touting as a reason to do this.  Computers are already improving at a rate that puts them ahead of the software designed to tax them.  We are constantly developing new and better materials (plastics, polymers, ceramics) and other electronics.  I don't see where the demands of this new mission are going to have much trickle down into daily society.  Sure, there will be localized job benefits to the areas that get work on certain aspects of the project, but unless we get our kids back where they should be in math and science, those jobs will go non-Americans.  So, I am in support of the mission, with some reservations.  How about the rest of the blog?
