So this morning, half-asleep in the shower, I realize I am all out.  I had to use Anne's 'poo, which was scented with passion flower or strawberries and gorse or something like that.  Ugh, I've been violated!  I feel like I was accosted by the Queer Eye guys in my sleep.  Not only that, I have been obsessing over repeatedly saying "methylisothiozolinone".  I don't know what it is, but it's a wicked cool word.    BTW, I want to market a line of guys hygeine products, plain packaging with military-type stencil writing, with no smell or color or perfume of any kind - just soap, just shampoo, just toothpaste, etc.  Anyone with connections to the big companies, let me know and let's make some money.    Yesterday at work, I was working on someone's computer, when one woman asks two other women for  a feminine hygeine product .  The scary part is, I didn't even flinch until about 30 seconds later, and thought  HEY, GUY IN THE ROOM !    This is on top of my recent depression spiral.  I always end up feeling like a drama queen afterwards, not strong and manly at all.  Dammit, I need to barbecue some meat and tear apart a car to feel better.    I want to market a line of guys hygeine products, plain packaging with military-type stencil writing, with no smell or color or perfume of any kind - just soap, just shampoo, just toothpaste, etc.    OK, the truth is I like women more than men.  I enjoy their company and enjoy talking with women, because they are in general smarter, more genuine,  and less preoccupied with genitalia than men.  Men are always trying to be the "top dog", pissing on stumps and growling at each other, and it bugs the crap out of me.  I love women with style, grace, and personality.  I love the way some women just smell perfect and sensual all the time.  I just don't like the perfumey smell when it is on me.
