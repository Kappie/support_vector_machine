I wrote 8 page review with the following topics: overview, how to use, why to use, design considerations, extending it. It shaped pretty good, the structure evolved in such a way that, I think, I made my points clear. I gave up the idea of creating a new project to demnostrate all the potential of the framework (and its simplicity of use :) ) . The current usage of the library is good enough to get the idea, so I just inserted a link to the Visual SourceSafe database (it's funny but that was the first project in my company to use VSS and I am not sure if everyone has a client installed yet).   I am ready to listen to suggestions and comments. I hope I attracted enough interest, especially with the MSDN-like documentation, so let's see what will happen. In the meanwhile I am going to watch the movie "THE MAGDALENE SISTERS" and the gigantic England-Potugal clash.   We are singing for England !!! (but not putting a penny on it)... :)  Oops, I almost forgot! If you are interested in the DAL review documentation and probably in the source code drop me a line to e-mail it to you.
