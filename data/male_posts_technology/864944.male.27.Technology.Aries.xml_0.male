Well, now having a moment to collect myself, it would appear that the months between now and december will entail a herculean development effort here at work.  I am sure I will derive some sick pleasure in that :p   Ok.. so this weekend looks to be a blast.  I have some new games to play (Battlefield 1942, Mafia, Asherons Call 2)  and i have a shindig to attend on Sunday night to watch the premier of the Sopranos at my friend Chris Shattuck's  I expect to see a bunch of old Abuzzers there and i look forward to an evening of good italian food (Chris is an excellent cook), good socializing, and a GREAT television show.  I don't think I will update these much on the weekends, but we'll see when inspiration strikes!
