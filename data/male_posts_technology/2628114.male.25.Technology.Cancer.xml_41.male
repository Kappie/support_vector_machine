Update for 4/10/04 All fears of not being able to finish the marathon went away today as we completed our longest run to date and reached the peak of our buildup period for the marathon.  18 miles is what I completed along with Consuelo and Lisa showed us both up by doing 20 miles at a pace you could consider suicidal.  We ran from Brad and Heather's house down through Mayberry (Loveland) to the bike trail, ran north for 7.5 miles (8.5 in Lisa's case) and back south and home for a grand total of 18 glorious miles.  We kept a good pace (~10 min/mile) for the first half, then Lisa broke off from us, Consuelo and I both walked for 5 minutes and tried some GU and took off again.  Consuelo and I stayed together for a couple miles, but when he started feeling a little worse, the yellow majesty of my shoes kicked in and I felt better than I have in a long time on a run.  I took off around mile 11 or 12 and carried a wonderful pace of around 9 min/mile.  I was able to go all the way until mile 16.5 where we were all going to meet and finish the run together.  What happened next was the coolest set of events on one of my runs so far.  In an attempt to fill up my water bottle, I had the owner of an ice cream shop hook me up with possibly the best tasting ice cream I ever encountered.  He extended credit so that I could sit and enjoy a scoop of ice cream while I waited for Consuelo (who unfortunately hurt his knee) to hobble along and Lisa to come sprinting up at an unbelievable pace.  I can still almost taste every bite of that ice cream.  Lisa went ahead of me while I waited for Consuelo to ensure he was okay and finish my ice cream (did I mention how good it was?).  After I gave Consuelo some directions for H's house, I took off feeling completely refreshed after a 25 minute break, water, and orange sherbert.  I finished the final 1.5 miles at a sub-9 minute pace.  I would never have expected to feel good after an 18 mile run, but I did.  It was great to come back to visit with everyone and we were all treated to a steak dinner after our run.  This was after I went back to pick up Consuelo, stretched, and went to the store to buy refrigerated pie crust.  All-in-all, it was awesome.  I am now confident I will finish this marathon.
