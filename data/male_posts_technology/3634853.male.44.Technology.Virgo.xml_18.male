Sometimes all I need is an opportunity to vent. This blog won't be very specific, just things going on around me and thoughts I'm dealing with. One of the first things you should probably do when putting one of these together is consider your audience, and I'm here to tell you that I have done that one bit. :))  Anyway, let's see where this takes us.
