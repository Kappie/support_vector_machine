As luck would have it, my sister called and said that her elliptical machine was ready for use.    I went up to try it out Monday night.  The elliptical machine is sweet with all of the major functions of the machines at the rec center AND a fan to boot!  If only I could figure out how to use it.  Even though I worked out for about 35 minutes, I easily spent 10 of that fiddling with the controls and trying to figure out why the machine kept going to the hardest imaginable setting.  I did fully realize the benefit of using the arm controls along with the legs.  For the longest time, I always thought people were being sissies for using the arm things, but they totally work out your arms.  Once I finally figure out how to use that machine it will rock!  Since it wasn't that hardcore of a workout, all the body parts felt good and somewhat underused (except for the arms).  My knees continue to feel good as I continue to reduce swelling while feeding my ibuprofen addiction. :)  I still think I will hold on running until after my backpacking trip Feb 6-8.
