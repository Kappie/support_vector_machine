I hoep you had a lovely day and I will give you your present at your party. Which I am looking forward to greatly. I have a skirt. Which is like a belt. Heehee.  The history exam was ok I thought. It went well. I have noticed something rather amusing in the history exams. Everyone does it including me. On each question no one just sits there and writes it all. Everyone tends to just sit there and not write or anything while they try and figure the question out. Its actually quite funny to watch. All these students with papaers open, only about 20 mins into the exam staring into space. LOL. How amusing.  Could Tom and Max please blog.
