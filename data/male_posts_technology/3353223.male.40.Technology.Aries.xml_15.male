No matter, a quick phone call and all that was sorted out. By 13:30, the insurance assessor was appointed. With a bit of luck he will manage to give my car the look over today, failing that, ... tomorrow.  Then I will have some idea of what this is all going to cost and whether it can be repaired or the agreed value paid. I reckon the damage is not too bad, so I guess that the car will be repaired.  Hopefully this will all be over before Pauline flies off to the UK next week.
