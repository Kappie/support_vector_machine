Well, sorry I had to share this piece of news online but I just couldn't understand it. My fitness was definitely improving and I was surprised the way my body reacted to the run. Anyway, I took lotsa water and that kinda helped. Did a few more reps of 8 directional exercise just to take my mind off the discomfort. Also watched Steven Seagal's Above the Law just now. There were some cool moves but being a movie, I really dun think he was being very Aiki on tele. Well, that's Hollywood for you lah. If I'm not wrong, there's a stream of Seagal's movies for this month. Woohoo can take note of his techniques and scutinize them. Ikkyo!!! ..... Nikkyo!!!! .... Sankyo!!! ... Rokkyo!!!! ... Kotegaeshi!! ... Iriminage ... and a whole lot of other moves that I really have no idea about. Could be a combination of some other variety.
