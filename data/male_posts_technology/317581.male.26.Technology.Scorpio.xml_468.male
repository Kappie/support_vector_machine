I want to fulfill and be fulfilled.I want to love and be loved. I want to heal and be healed. I want to take the pain of the world on my shoulders and have no one hurt anymore.   I wish I didn't hurt you...  OK, enough of the dark ranting.  The next time you see me, I'll be a happy camper. well, maybe.  peace-
