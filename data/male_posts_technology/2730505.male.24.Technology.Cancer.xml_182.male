Could've done it last night but eh, tired.   urlLink TEKFREEK  is getting better.  He's been managing to get a couple of kills every other round or so but he keeps on dying.  He's getting better that's for damn sure.  Played with a lot of Chicago people again.  It was fun.  I hate being the bad guy and booting people.  I should just start appearing offline and making a room for just friends to avoid the random people.  Played with  urlLink PORKCHOP55  again but she was kinda being wierd.  I don't know what is up with that but whatever.     Here are my  urlLink stats .  Doing alright, getting a better hang of the maps and I also wrote a little thing about maps that I've managed to do good in.  It's is located  urlLink here .  It's not eerything but it's something for other people to use.     So the Taste is starting this friday (6/21).  That should be a good time.  Going to try to go this weekend if it's not too hot.     Cubs won again, fuck yeah!  hopefully by tomorrow they're going to be in first or at least tied for first
