Over in Japan, some piddling closure has been given to the victims of another doomsday cult:    Death by hanging for the lot of them!    -Including their   urlLink bloated leader .   Gentle reader, you might be surprised to learn that our friends in Japan occasionally find that a person has done something so irredeemable that they must be hanged.  Stranger still, the condemned only dances on the end of a rope when they are ready to.  (in the zen sense)    I can only hope that an exception is made in this case, and some truly repugnant characters are dragged kicking and screaming to the gallows.  Tomorrow, a treatise on freehand deck building, and a discussion of the doomsday cults here in Skinner's Mudhole.
