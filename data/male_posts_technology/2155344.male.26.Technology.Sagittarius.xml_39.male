Ate lot of good food, very good wine , discussed all the issues we ever had. Felt good. Came home, called arjun , then arvind's mom  dad and then my dad. Got everyone's best wishes and blessings. Whole of saturday we spent so lazily :) just ate left overs from fridays and then went for swimming. Came home and saw "The missing". SOOOOOOO BORING. Mr.Ganesh made me see it. Just wanted to spend some time with him cuddling up so i didnt mind that.  Apporom, today I was so tired so i ended seeing  more movies, the medallion and then "White Oleander". White oleander is such a sad but a moving story. I heard the most of the book on cd. Its so depressing that i decided to see it as a movie and return the cds back to the library. It most definitely made me think a lot about orphan children and their horrible life at foster home. Arvind was very happy with me today, I let him play starcraft for 4 hours. can you believe it?  We grilled some vegiees today and ate it. Such a hot hot day. So we went for a long walk late in the night and came home.  O yeah, our router went kaput on friday due to electricity failure. :( so we are trying to find a soln for that. Other than that, what a  wonderful weekend.
