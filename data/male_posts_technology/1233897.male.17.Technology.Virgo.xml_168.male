(lol) I really don't have any idea if i'm even doing anything that day yet or not. ;)  This is an amazing J.E.W. song: it's written to Jimmy's girlfriend who died in a tragic car accident way before J.E.W. ever became a band. (At least that's the more popular of the two stories of how the song same to be, and it makes sense.)    Jimmy Eat World - Hear You Me     There's no one in town I know. You gave us some place to go. I never said thank you for that. I thought I might have one more chance. What would you think of me now... So lucky, So strong, So proud? I never said thank you for that, Now I'll never have a chance.  May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads, The sleepless go. May angels lead yo in.  So what would you think of me now... So lucky, So strong, So proud? I never said thank you for that. Now I'll never have a chance.  May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads, The sleeplss go. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in.  And if you were with me tonight. I'd sing to you just one more time. A song for a heart so big, God couldn't let it live.  May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads, The sleepless go. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads, The sleepless go. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in.    One of the many thing that's awesome about this band is their dedication to their fans and to their music, not to the money - This is an actual Q I got from  urlLink http://www.jimmyeatworld.net/history/faq.html , a division of the official site.   Q.  How does the band feel about mp3s / bootlegs / napster / ebay / file sharing?   A.  I can't give an actual quote from the band, but I will tell you this. The band gave away all their songs for free on their website before Self-Titled (Bleed American) was even released (and they are still there!) . The band seems to not have a problem with sites that offer live mp3s to fans for free. On the other hand, the band said they hate when people sell their stuff on ebay. So I guess you could say that the band is cool if you are trading stuff between music fans, but they do not want you selling anything. Hopefully people can be trusted to purchase the CDs that contain the songs they download, if they are available.   Goodnight my beloveds, may God watch over your sleep, and when you're awake, may God direct your life.
