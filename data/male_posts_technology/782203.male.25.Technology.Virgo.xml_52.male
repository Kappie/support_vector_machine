Cos Xing wants to meet us both at once regarding the job offers he has for us; He's looking for a web designer for his company website so i recommended her to him. And his friend Marcus just started an IT company so he's looking for people to join him so i'm gonna meet him later. Kinda nervous cos my previous two off the net meetings were not really what i would call successes ...met Sharon which went horribly wrong and Indu who told me within 10 minutes of meeting me that my dressing was really  DULL   : (
