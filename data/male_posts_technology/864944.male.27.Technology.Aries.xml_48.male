Work is crazier than ever, and now the weekends are all jammed up too.   Don't get me wrong, its wonderful to have so many friends (and my own sister!) settling down with their loved ones, but man.. when it rains is sure does pour.  So My weeks will be crazy mind-numbing work, and my weekends will be a pretty persistant buzz of friends and partying.   WOW.. What the hell am I complaining about?!?!  :)   My first adventure is a bachelor-y round of Paint Ball with Paul.  Oh yeah.  That i can dig :)   Then I'm having my folks up later that night and I plan to cook dinner for them.  Good times.  Sunday?  Workign on stuff around the house I'm sure.    And then next weekend is wedding 1.   Time to press my suit :)
