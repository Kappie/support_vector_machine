Well, I was pretty scared the first time I went in there. I really, really didn't want to go. I have no problem with gay men, but drag queens terrified me. It just didn't seem right, being able to fold and tuck things away that shouldn't be folded or tucked. But I got over that.  Anyway, the night was good - the food excellent and service very quick (unlike BIGA..). Although there were a little too many brussell sprouts, it's not Christmas y'know.  The show consists of various show songs, (Chicago etc) which were pretty funny. The main guy is completely rubberfaced and it's like watching an episode of  Spitting Image . I got harassed, as always seems to be the case. Jo stuck us right at the front so I was prime picking for being serenaded by little orphan Annie. Except they had thoughtfully changed the words to "Your son will come out tomorrow.. bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow, he'll be GAY!" So I turn around and the entire club are looking at me wondering if me and the drag queen are having a moment because I'm being sung at. Fuckers.  Later on we went upstairs to the club which was both different and a good laugh. There was even that dude that you see around town with the blonde woman's wig on, bopping away and having a whale of a time. Fair play to you, Sir.  I did what I usually do when I've had half a bottle of Jose Cuervo and there's a empty podium in front of me. That's right, I danced like I was on fire and scared people. (although Capt. Kirk told me he'd had several enquiries into my sexual orientation and availability.. I feel both flattered and ill at the same time)  To anyone who had to witness me doing the flames with my arms to 'Disco Inferno', I'm very sorry and I hope you can forgive me.
