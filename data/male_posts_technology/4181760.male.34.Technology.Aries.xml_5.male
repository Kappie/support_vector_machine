No evidence has yet been presented that Bush lied or manipulated intelligence to falsely justify a war. This sort of behavior furthers my belief that the Democrats have no platform other than 'Get rid of Bush'.       The invasion of Afghanistan and the deposing of the Taliban was masterful – one of the finest military actions in history. While many on the Left completely (and perhaps suicidally) opposed taking action after 9/11, Bush inserted Special Forces into Afghanistan within the next couple of days. In a region that had never been conquered, he created an unstoppable combination of local support and US military might. His only real mistake was in the measured diplomacy so many lauded him for – the short time spent negotiating with the Taliban for a peaceful resolution gave OBL the time to slip away. This was perhaps inevitable, as OBL had moved often and secretly ever since Bill Clinton passed on both the offer to bring OBL to America and the many chances Clinton’s CIA had to kill the terrorist leader.       Those with no knowledge of geography or military experience place the blame for losing Bin Laden at Bush’s feet. Those on the ground will tell you differently. The mountains between Pakistan and Afghanistan cover enormous amounts of ground, made up of incredibly difficult terrain that our foes knew and we did not. OBL is an immensely popular figure in the region and has both a friendly populace to aid him and people around him with undying loyalty. But our men in the region tell you something else with the confidence of men with God and the US military on their side – whether tomorrow or a year from now, we will get Osama.       The focus was on Iraq well before 9/11. President Clinton had made regime change in Baghdad official US policy. For a decade, Saddam’s forces had fired almost daily on coalition aircraft. Saddam had tried to assassinate a former US president, and his intelligence services had been involved in planning attacks on US interests abroad, including the attempted bombing of Radio Free Europe in 1998. By 2003, the CIA had accumulated 78 reports from multiple sources documenting instances where the Iraqi regime had either trained operatives for attacks or dispatched them to carry out attacks. Contrary to Michael Moore’s ridiculous assertion that Saddam had never so much as threatened Americans, the CIA reported that Baghdad by the late 1990’s had trained over a thousand Iraqis in terrorist camps to conduct attacks on US and coalition targets. Attempted bombings by IIS agents occurred near a US facility in Manila, and another bomb planted by Iraqi agents was discovered in the US Ambassador’s residence in Jakarta.       From 1996 to 2003 the CIA summarized 50 intelligence reports from multiple sources where Iraqi agents planned for or attempted attacks against US or Israeli targets. During this time, Saddam also offered substantial financial support to Palestinian terror groups. As far as Al Qaeda is concerned, the CIA declared in 2003 that “We have reporting from reliable clandestine and press sources that direct meetings between senior Iraqi representatives and top Al Qaeda operatives took place from the early 1990’s to the present.” Additionally, there were a dozen or so reports of Iraq training Al Qaeda operatives in combat and the use of weapons – conventional, bomb-making, chemical, biological, and radiological. In 1998, a delegation from Saddam offered UBL safe haven in Iraq should he be expelled from Afghanistan.       One final bit of trivia: both the mastermind and one of those who carried out the first World Trade Center bombing were Iraqi. After the successful bombing, the Iraqi operative, Abdul Rahman Yasin, returned to Baghdad.       9/11 was thoughtfully planned and carefully executed. It was a massive attack that screamed of state sponsorship. One of the camps that the CIA had reported on was Salman Pak – which included with its facilities a mock-up 747 used in hijacking training.       On 9/11 with four planes down, the twin towers in rubble, and the Pentagon ablaze, only a fool wouldn’t have asked whether Iraq could be involved. The really shocking thing is the alacrity with which Richard Clarke discounted even the possibility that Iraq could be involved. The man who took months to determine that Al Qaeda had attacked the USS Cole knew within hours of the attacks that Iraq couldn’t have been involved.       Perhaps George Bush had the intent of invading Iraq all along. If so, it at least wasn’t his first priority – as no one has suggested that any steps were taken towards this goal before 9/11. It might be more fair to say that he would have been glad to take out Saddam should the opportunity and reason to do so arise. The Democrats agreed with this idea, and their president had signed this as policy into law almost 3 years before.       The idea that there was significant dissent about Iraq’s WMDs is a revisionist canard. There are dozens of quotes even from those most actively against the war acknowledging their basic acceptance of Iraq as having WMDs. In October 2002, Jay Rockefeller, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence committee – a person with direct access to the exact same, raw, unfiltered intelligence available to the administration – said:    "There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years. And that may happen sooner if he can obtain access to enriched uranium from foreign sources--something that is not that difficult in the current world. We should also remember that we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction . . . But this isn't just a future threat. Saddam's existing biological and chemical weapons capabilities pose a very real threat to America, now. Saddam has used chemical weapons before, both against Iraq's enemies and against his own people. He is working to develop delivery systems like missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles that could bring these deadly weapons against U.S. forces and U.S. facilities in the Middle East. . . ."        There are similar quotes available from John Kerry, Howard Dean, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, John Edwards, Hans Blix, and even Jacques Chirac. There was dissent over some details of WMD reporting – the uses for those aluminum tubes, for example – but not one serious analyst or military expert went on the record stating significant doubts suggesting that Saddam had destroyed all of his unaccounted for weapons or stopped pursuing WMD programs.       It is easy look back in hindsight and say, “oh I knew all along” but those voices simply were not raised. The voices that were raised called for inspections instead of invasion, but the inspections process was one of the worst Keystone Kops farces in history. The only times the inspectors found anything was after defectors came forward – at which point huge secret programs would be uncovered. More recently, defectors would be the source for minor inaccurate reporting used (the mobile bioweapons labs being the only real snafu). But given Saddam’s history, no one serious thought that he had either disarmed nor that he would fully disclose this time around.       The choice was easy. The best intelligence available to the administration showed a clear pattern of hostility and planned aggression towards the US. The best estimates and analysis of Saddam’s past behavior and intentions indicated that both stockpiles of weapons and programs were, to paraphrase one Democrat, “a slam dunk.”       And there is no evidence the administration fudged, exaggerated, or manipulated any of this intelligence. The just-released Senate report on pre-war Iraq intelligence completely exonerates the administration of even the hint of impropriety. In addition to stating that the few dissents from the general consensus of the intelligence community never made it to policy makers (something laid wholly at the feet of the CIA), the report states clearly that there is no evidence whatsoever that anyone in the administration pressured anyone in the intelligence community in any way.       Additionally, the “Special Plans” office of the undersecretary of Defense that some characterized as “second guessing” conclusions by the intelligence community, did no such thing. All this office (which was never staffed by more than two consultants followed on by two experienced intelligence officers) did was put together a comprehensive list of the reporting of Iraq’s links to terrorism and present them back to…wait for it…the CIA. This office documented various reports that had been left out of more recent finished products. It was then up to the CIA to review the recommendations made by this office and then decide whether to update intelligence products.       None of this will blow the tinfoil hats off of any die-hard, Bush-hating, conspiracy theorist, but then it is hard to take seriously someone who thinks Cheney’s mere presence in a building indicates a conspiracy to secretly falsify justifications for war – especially when that same conspiracy nut sees dozens of contacts between Saddam and Al Qaeda as not amounting to much.       Taking the WMD claims now, the Senate report has been characterized as scathing, and rightly so, but it is important to note where it finds agreement with the administration.       Both the Senate report and recent reporting in the Financial Times have shown Joseph Wilson to be flat out lying about many things. One: his wife indeed did get him the job – not really something a secret agent would be doing, but then she had long before relegated to desk jockey duty. Joseph Wilson also never met with any current Nigerian official on his trip, but only met with limited contacts in the private industry and former officials. Mind-blowingly, when Wilson reported back to the CIA, he recounted that in 1999, the former Prime Minister of Niger (who told Wilson this directly) was approached to set up a meeting with a delegation from Iraq interested in “expanding commercial relations.” The Prime Minister at the time believed that this was an overture by Iraq to purchase uranium. Later, Wilson claimed to the Washington Post to have seen forged documents that he had never seen. So the author of the original “Bush lied” conspiracy, the one that started all the rest, is nothing but a liar himself.       The WMD findings are hit and miss. While the stockpile reporting tended to be based on analysis and estimates, these claims were about weapons and materials unaccounted for. Some of these materials are now being accounted for – samples of the very same sarin and mustard gas shells claimed by the administration have indeed been found. And unlike the overly optimistic predictions of so-called experts, the chemicals in these weapons are no less viable or deadly for their age. The combined chemical weapons found in Iraq could kill tens of thousands of people, used properly.       As far as programs, Saddam has hidden his biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons programs, not divested of them. These are not guesses, but confirmed finds. Saddam hid the components of his programs throughout Iraq, to be reconstituted after sanctions were lifted (something actively sought by France and Russia). Saddam could have been producing chemical and biological weapons in quantity within months, and had he obtained the nuclear materials he sought, could have had the bomb within a few years.       The collective big picture about Iraq is as strong and clear today as it was before the war. Saddam supported and consorted with terrorists, including Al Qaeda. Saddam had unaccounted for weapons of mass destruction. Saddam had hidden programs for weapons of mass destruction, which he had no intention of declaring. There is no denying any of these facts.       This is why the left cannot be allowed to regain power. The intelligence about Saddam may have been flawed, but it painted the same picture for Democrats as for Republicans. This is the one issue – our security and survival – on which we should be fully united. We were, before the war (or to be precise, before the election season began). Leading Democrats who castigate the administration now used the exact same language about Saddam as did the president and vice-president in the months before the war.       If Democrats had merely opposed the Iraq War, that would have been bad enough. To ignore intelligence describing a grave and gathering threat after 9/11 would have been so irresponsible that no liberal should have been allowed control of government for a decade or more. But they didn’t just oppose the war. In fact, they supported it – for selfish political purposes, thinking that in a time of war, this would get them reelected. They did the right thing, but for completely inexcusable reasons, shown clearly by their abandonment of principle as soon as their seats were safe.       And the current Democratic presidential ticket represents the worst of the worst. Rank and file Democrats may be ignorant dupes – and clearly are, shown by the frequency with which they repeat easily rebutted inaccuracies over and over - such as the lie that the administration has ever questioned anyone’s patriotism.       John Kerry cannot claim to be the same. He had the same access to intelligence as the president, and supported the war. Kerry made the same claims about Iraqi WMDs and terrorist ties as the president. The fact that he now uses words like “misled” should automatically disqualify this man from any office. 30 years ago he despicably slandered honorable people with unfounded charges for his own gain, and he does it again today.       The Democrats inability to recognize our common threats and goals proves that they are incapable of leading the country in a time of war. Their willingness to lie and mislead the public about their own positions and statements shows that they have only their own naked interest in gaining power on their agenda.       We have real decisions to make. In the face of apparent threats, how aggressively should the US act? Can we address terrorism without de-fanging the sponsors of terror? Should we assume that regimes that have dozens of friendly contacts with terrorist groups to be no threat? Can we defeat militant fundamentalism in the Middle East without fostering democracy there? If not, are we prepared for a hard road – since places like Iraq and Afghanistan (and Syria, Iran, and Lebanon) will never achieve democracy without the spilling of blood? Is it better to wait out the Middle East and hope things work out before Iran becomes a nuclear power, or should we intervene now?       These are incredibly tough questions. We are not done spilling blood in the Middle East – our blood and that of both enemies and innocents alike. It will take decades for successful democracy to take hold in Iraq and Afghanistan – and without outside intervention, the other countries in the region may never get there. Do we impose our will at the cost of blood, treasure, and the hatred of the world? If not, are we content to lose tens or hundreds of thousands of innocent American lives – surely the cost once the inevitable happens, and terrorist groups obtain WMD capability from tyrants we allowed to stay in power.       John Kerry defines the term 'silver spoon', never having to grow up and live for 5 minutes in the real world. His defining moment was Vietnam – an experience that turned him into a self-promoting liar, hungry for power at the expense of the good names of his comrades in arms. George Bush’s defining moment was 9/11 – an experience that made him unwilling to accept the threat of future mass murder by tyrants who had no business being alive, once they declared their enmity to the United States of America.       Nearly half of this country claims to be planning to vote for Kerry-Edwards. Do what you can to wake them up to the reality that 9/11 wasn’t a fluke. Or be prepared to face much worse days yourself in the future.
