Must remember that. Camera. Camera. Camera. Right! Um. Well work today was ok as per usual, nothing really exciting happened, and I didn't even get to do the trolley again (having been so chuffed with myself last week). But it was ok. Got a couple of good books from the library to take to Asutria, including George Orwell's "Animal Farm" which I hear is a historic read. Other than my toilteries and my lunch, I all set to go tomorrow! Should be fun, but I'm not really looking forward to a 24 hour coach journey now I know what it's like (havign done it for Prague). Well I sholud go cos I haven't got much else to say, I won't be back to next Monday probably. Then on the friday, I'm off again! yay! So have a good week y'all, and chat to ya when i get back (apart from Tom who is on the same trip, duh). Byeeeeeee guys! Oh Jackie hope you had a good holiday, tell me all about it when I get bcack!
