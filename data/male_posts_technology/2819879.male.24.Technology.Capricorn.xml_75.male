And even better, by screwing them over, it makes you richer~  Appearence can be deceiving...  Honestly... I feel so sorry for Taiwan's MMO players.  In so many ways, they are just victims of the plot of the evil importing company.  Forced to play a game that lacks depth... the only fun you get is human interaction.  But that's the jewel of MMO.  If L II is a single player game, I wonder if it'll sell 1/10 of what they have sold now...
