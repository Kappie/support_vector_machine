It is estimated that around 80,000 patients are treated every year.  Among them around 90% of them are very poor and cannot afford treatments in private hospitals. It costs 2 lakhs for each patient and the hospital bears the entire cost. To manage the funds the hospital has come out with a scheme where it has planned to sell 1 Crore coupons of each Rs.20. With this, the hospital believes that it can generate Rs.20 Crores. I humbly request you to buy at least one coupon, which can save a life. Twenty rupees may be insignificant, but this small contribution can make a huge difference to a lot of cancerpatients, most of them children below the age of  10.
