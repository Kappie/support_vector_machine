And we'll lower the cost of living for everyone, not just in America, but we'll give the world an opportunity to see what it's like to save and have a better lifestyle, a better life for all. We're proud of what we've accomplished; we've just begun."  - Sam Walton (1918-1992)   How anyone can read that and not drop to the ground laughing while pissing their pants is beyond me.  Wal-Mart is actually responsible for degrading the lifestyle of America, it's true read the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Workforce report.  Wal-Mart pays it's "associates" a poverty level wages, $13,861 is the average annual wage for a Wal-Mart employee, $14,630 is consider the poverty line for a family of three.  "Associate" is Wal-Mart slang for "slave", and this is not libel it is documented fact that Wal-Mart has repeatedly force employees to work off the clock without pay, therefore making them slaves.  They have been sued in the following states for not paying employees: Colorado, Texas, Oregon, and Minnesota.  Wal-Mart store managers blame this on the fact that Wal-Mart corporate office puts pressure on managers to keep labor cost low.  Here's an idea hire illegal immigrants to do all the manual labor, they're cheap and they can't complain when you lock them in the store over night.  Oh, wait, no you already did that and it back fired on you horribly.  I know maybe you could start to sell babies, or even human organs, big market for human organs.    Hold on a second Wal-Mart does some good right?  Wrong Wal-Mart does no good and any money they might donate to "charity" or other cause is tainted.  Any company that will not give employees the time to satisfy basic human needs such as taking a fucking piss, is on the "Axis-of-Evil" list, I already wrote GW Bush and had him add Wal-Mart.  This quote taken directly from the congressional report reveals the underlying and core problem with Wal-Mart and it's Draconian labor policies.  "The Committee on Education and Workforce estimates that one 200-person Wal-Mart store may result in a cost to federal taxpayers of $420,750 per year - about $2,103 per employee.  Specifically, the low wages result in the following additional public cost being passed on to taxpayers."  So you can get you guns, censored music, and child made clothing at low, low prices, but in the end you pay more supporting the Wal-Mart employees.    Wal-Mart uses patriotic colors and images in advertising, but Wal-Mart is the leader in selling non-American products.  An estimated 50-60 percent of it's products come from overseas, "In 2002, the company bought 14 percent of the $1.9 billion of clothes exported by Bangladesh to the United States."  Wal-Mart is nothing but zombies in blue vests forcing the Nazi-like "Culture" of Sam Walton down Americas throat.  So go to Wal-Mart's website and tell them to put a new Wal-Mart on Super Slammin' Sam Walton's grave.
