This was published as a Father's Day special on thw website my wife works for -  urlLink Babyworld , which is a fantastic pregnancy and parenting site. And yes, I'm biased....   You can find the original  urlLink here      How to be a Wicked Stepdad     So you’ve met the woman of your dreams.           You love her, she loves you, the sex is fantastic . . .. and you want to spend the rest of your lives together.             Just one problem, then. .    . . you have to meet her children.             You’re going to become a STEPDAD.                        Congratulations, and welcome to my world. You are about to embark on a journey that is every bit as terrifying, exhilarating, emotional, life-affirming and life-changing as becoming a father through the traditional route. Trust me, I know.             I’m a Stepdad to two gorgeous children – there’s my ten-year-old stepdaughter (teenager attitude, 40-year-old’s cynicism), and my six-year-old stepson (a hurricane in football trainers). And I love them. I adore them both just as if they were my own children.             But let’s be honest here – you don’t want me to just wax lyrical about my two. If you’re reading this, then you actually want to know what it  means  to be a Stepdad. What will you lose? What will you gain? And, most important of all – where do sex and beer fit into the whole thing?             The fact is, there are loads of myths around about being a Stepdad. And while there are loads of books which purport to teach you how to become a father, few if any teach you what you need to know when the kids are that bit older.             So what I want to do is talk about a couple of the myths I’ve heard. I can’t claim to offer the magic bullet that will turn your Stepdad-ship into The Partridge Family. But I know a few things I could have done differently, and maybe they’re things to look out for.             You have so much to look forward to. You will feel close with them. They will come to you for affection. And I promise you – when they first introduce you to their friends as their Stepdad, you’ll burst with pride.             Being a Stepdad is easy               A (former) friend originally made this particular comment to me. His view was that I had ‘taken the easy way out by getting an instant family instead of doing it properly’. Hmm. Complete. Pillock.           Let’s get one thing straight right from the start. What a Stepdad undertakes is not easy. In fact, it’s bloody hard. While I wouldn’t for a moment belittle how hard it is to be a father from birth, people often assume that it’s somehow a doddle to be a Stepdad ‘as the children are older’.             I personally challenge anyone to have a first meeting with a truculent ten-year-old, who’s grumpy because she wants to be out with her friends, doesn’t want to meet you because she doesn’t know why Mummy needs  another  new boyfriend, and isn’t afraid to answer back. . oops. Sorry. Rant over, but you get the general idea.              It will take time for the kids to accept the idea that you’re going to be around for them. They’ve probably already seen someone they love go away. They will expect you to do the same. But give them time, be consistent and reliable, and they will get to trust you. And believe me, once they do, you and they will bond just as tightly as if you were there at the birth.             The point I’m trying to make here is that you’re not just proving to your new partner that you’re reliable. You have to prove it to the kids as well. Their trust is as important as hers. Don’t forget it.             So it’s not easy. Sometimes – and I can guarantee this – you will wonder why you ever gave up your own home and lifestyle for the living hell you’re experiencing. Steel yourself for the inevitable scream of ‘You’re not my dad!’, which will come at some undetermined future point. Because it’s worth it.             Every downside to being a Stepdad – every time you feel mean or nasty, or they tell you that their father lets them watch that Cert. 15 movie you won’t let them see, every time they divide and conquer and turn you and your partner against each other – they’re all outweighed by the good times.                  Fathers make it difficult.                 I believe this one is a myth purely because of our own male insecurities, guys. I know we don’t admit to having any – but hey, you’re reading a parenting website, what does that tell us?             Personally, I think it’s good if the children are still in contact with their natural father. My two see their father every other weekend, and both my wife and I encourage them to do so. The kids look forward to it, and so does he.             But fellas, you don’t have to try and be better than their father. You don’t need to try and beat him at (parenting/driving/Christmas/football/sex/insert pointless pissing contest here). Look at the facts. You’re with her. He isn’t. That’s all you need to know. It’s good for a brief mental ‘nyaah nyaah’ – but leave it at that.             Bear in mind you’re bound to get a bit of the green-eyed monster when he comes to pick them up, and they go leaping up to him screaming for cuddles and kisses. It’s only normal to feel a twinge!             But there are a couple of things it’s worth bearing in mind, guys. First – the kids probably see you every day. They don’t see their father that often. There’s a degree of excitement and anticipation to consider when you see it happen. Second – and I’ll probably be flamed to a crisp for this opinion – but do try and remember that children are both perceptive and manipulative. They will pick up on your twinges – and endeavour to play on that to their benefit. Benefit such as McDonalds, extra sweets and guilt toys.             And when you wave them goodbye, try and remember that by the time they come home, they’ll be as pleased to see you as they were to leave with him.             Oh, and there’s one other BIG benefit to the kids visiting their father. Remember beer and sex? Now’s your chance. No teenage babysitter to get home to, worrying if she’s got smashed on your vodka or left dubious stains on the sofa with her lumpish boyfriend. No small child wandering into the bedroom at six in the morning asking for breakfast or help with the Playstation.              For an all-too-brief window of opportunity, you and your partner can play at being single. Don’t waste it.             And bear in mind, guys – if their father wasn’t around, you wouldn’t get that. Ever. So maybe he does have a use.             Being a Family                   One thing I can’t stress enough, gentlemen – your new partner and her children were a family before you came along. The likelihood is that they may have managed for some time without a man in their lives. You coming along does not make an incomplete family whole. Well, not at first, anyway.           In fact, there will be times when you will feel like an intruder, coming in and spoiling something that was running smoothly. That’s natural to feel that way – your partner will have routines established and, whether you like it or not, you do actually stick a fairly hefty spanner in the works.             You’re unlikely to get regular lie-ins (though if you’re as lucky as I am, your partner may let you sleep in for an extra hour on a Saturday morning while she spends time with the kids). You won’t just be able to whisk her out to the pub for a drink, or nip out to watch the latest movie.              There’s dinner to be made – and I can guarantee that it’s going to be made earlier than you’re used to eating. Keeping the house tidy turns into a never-ending exercise like painting the   Forth   Bridge  .    Homework needs to be done, and helped with. If there’s more than one sibling, you’re going to have to act as peacemaker and referee almost constantly.              Try and remember that no matter how much instruction your dad gave you, or how much you think you can do it – your partner has been doing it longer than you. She knows what she’s doing and if you try and get her to change, you’ll just get in her way. Try and change her routines and methods and you will definitely annoy her.              Which may put the kybosh on any activities after the children have been put to bed.                   That would be bad.                    Especially as you’re unlikely to be getting  that  as often as you’d like as well.             So don’t jeopardise it, guys. Be prepared to do the hardest thing you’ve ever done – and change  yourself . Learn to fit in with the routines already established. Be there to help with the chores and homework.              And please, please please please. . . . DON’T assume you can do it better than she can. You can’t. Watch how she does it, try and handle things the same way, and don’t be afraid to ask for advice. You’ll need it – I did, more times than I could count.             Because as I said at the start of this article – it’s worth it. Every change you make, every sacrifice to your old single lifestyle, every time you prove your reliability, every time you finally manage to explain perimeters or areas for the umpteenth time – it’ll all come back to you in spades.             A few weeks ago my stepson went on a football course. There he was, with several older boys, in his oversized tracksuit. . . . and when I collected him he said ‘Hi, Dad’ and gave me a hug and kiss.             When my stepdaughter went away with her school for a few days, she called up and spoke to me – and told me she missed me and loved me.             After lots of false starts, my frequent bad temper and all the mistakes, I’ve learned enough to love my kids – and they love me back.              In the final analysis - that’s what being a Stepdad means.
