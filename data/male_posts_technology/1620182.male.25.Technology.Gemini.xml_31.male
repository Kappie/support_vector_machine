I wish I were in my  urlLink car  blasting down the highway to reach some spot where I can just leave it all behind -- some tranquil oasis where the ebb of existence slows to a standstill.  Instead I'm sitting in my cubicle being almost as effective as  urlLink Neo  after a night chasing the  urlLink White Rabbit .  
 
 I blame my current state on  urlLink my cell phone.   During the chaos that was my aborted move to the beautiful  urlLink commonwealth of Virginia  I managed to wash one last load of laundry before my departure.  That load of laundry happened to have a pair of cargo shorts in it, and in those cargo shorts was one (1) cell phone.  As you can probably imagine, cell phones don't take too kindly to the soap and water normally associated with the inside of a washing machine.  I just hope it didn't suffer.
 
 After spitting and sputtering for a good week, my cell phone was suddenly resurrected from the dead.  The buttons didn't want to work as well, but I was happy.  My cell phone was working.  It kept working for a good week before the LCD panel started to fade.  Two days ago, I was unable to see a thing.  Obviously, this isn't going to work.
 
 So I ordered a new cell phone today.  It's the  urlLink Sanyo 8100 , replete with all the bells and whistles.  It has a built in camera and my plan allows for all of those goodies I've been denying myself over the past two years: wireless web, wireless instant messaging, text messaging, oh my.  The only problem is that it doesn't arrive until Friday, which is much to long to make someone wait for such a toy.  So, in eager anticipation of my new play-thing, I have lost the ability to work.  You can understand why, can't you?
