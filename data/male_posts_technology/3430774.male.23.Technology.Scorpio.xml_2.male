Because of her invitation, i got my Gmail account now :) Initially wish to register with the name of "stephenlim@gmail.com" but end up with "stephenlcc@gmail.com". Hmm... personally feel the name is not bad, at least much much more better than the one suggested. Well, the first impression to me when i logon to the gmail is : Hoooorrr, it is similar to previous yahoomail in term of user interface, Blue and White...    Hehe but however, in just a second i am attracted with the features integrated. Although 1GB already become the significant winning point but in fact, there are some others new or maybe useful features such as SEARCH message, Achive message, Labeling, Filtering and etc. After all, i found out that the limitation of attachment only up to 10MB. Which is quite low at present proportional to its size. :P   Hmm.. this morning once i login with my Yahoo Messenger and wish to share my happiness to my friends so status my gmail account. Wah.. manatau, in a short time i got sooo many messages regarding gmail. Wah, then faster change my status to avoid more incoming message! Otherwise my boss will think i am chatting in work, dangerous~ Hmm, these people ah~ usually i online didnt see they greet me pun~ :P At this point, you might imagine how the gmail leverage the email world. Everyone asking me to invite them but unfortunately i havent got the invitation links. Well, below are what Gmail's help mentioned about  HOW CAN I INVITE OTHERS TO JOIN GMAIL?      Because we're currently only offering Gmail as part of a preview release and limited test, we don't have details on when Gmail will be made more widely available.  As we make way for more accounts, we may periodically allow you to invite others to join Gmail. When we do so, you will see an invitation link in your inbox.   If you do not see the invitation link, that means that we are unable to provide you with additional invitations at this time.   To invite someone, click on the 'Invite a friend to join Gmail!' link in your inbox. You will then be asked to provide an email address and a personalized message to your invitee.   The person you invite will be sent a message that includes a link to join Gmail. That registration link will be valid for three weeks and can be used to create only one account.      Hmm.. today is just all about google! Using gmail, Google-ing, Sharing gmail with boss also :P and notice the INTECH article about GOOGLEWAR (  urlLink http://www.googlewar.com  ). What it is? Just click on it and find out how creative these people are. The concept is key in two different terms and googlewar runs a separate Google search for both subjects, lists the number of Google results they each garner and declares a winner with high count of result. Suggested search terms: manchester united vs liverpool, Bush vs Kerry, Olympus vs Canon, Steve Jobs vs Bill Gates, Star Trek vs Star Wars, Jacky Chan vs Jet Li, Faya Wong vs Sammi Cheng, Coca Cola vs Pepsi, Nokia vs Samsung, Microsoft vs Linux, all you could suggest for a match :P Very funny to have this kind of webpage! Haha... :D   Well, time now is about 1am. Tomorrow still working... time to piggying lor~ :D
