After a fantastic World Cup, he's going while he's still fairly at the top of his game. And I'm glad for that. It would've been sad if he had chosen to let his career drag along like some other cricketers have done over the years!!  I wish him all the best for his future ventures. I sure do hope that he utilizes his experience for the benefit of Indian cricket in some way or the other.
