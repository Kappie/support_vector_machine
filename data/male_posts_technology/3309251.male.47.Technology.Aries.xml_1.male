Dave had mentioned that his neighbour's 1982 Rabbit vanished over night but the peculiar thing was, the tires were left behind.  Big Mike mentioned that he had heard of a 1992 volks disappear from the IGA parking lot the other week, with the same MO. The car was gone but the tires were left behind. Bizarre.  Having a 1999 Volks myself, I was developing a healthy interest in these mysterious car thefts.  Why would someone want to steal a car and not take the tires?   I would find out the truth, sooner than later.
