It's been a week plus since i have last blogged and indeed there is something that have happenned that hindered me from blogging. I have from my last entry ..been very dry spiritually and from there that is  where the time of backsliding begins. To many people, backsliding seems like a process that you simply go away from God. But to me...that is also true but most of the time , it is a choice . So from my dry relationship with God , slowly i started to withdraw from people , from God , started to give up my dreams, my passion . It is very easy to do it and later the standards and whatever principles that have been shaping my life, I also have easily let it go and even welcome some of them . Particularly temptations.  I thank God for His continous faithfulness and saw chances / opportunities to work in  instead of seeing me a rebellious and good for nothing sheep that does not requires His Grace which He have died for. I really want to appreciate God for His Holy SPirit continues to prompt me that He have come for the sick and not the healthy . His Grace is forever sufficient for every need and hurt. God's presence continues to linger even when I have sinned and it is like a perfume that will never go away.  Like i Said, I recently had an accident which involves my front section of the car literally smashed by another car . After that my dentures broke and furthermore , my handphone refuses to call or receive call from anyone. and in all this  I have to put off my savings for the guitar and I have to spend all these money to procure. I always encourage people that nothing that happened is a coincidence and God is always in control.  Well guess what , i figured that God is using "His Burning Bush" in modern context to gain my attention to what is important...not the challenges that He have allowed but more importantly my time and relationship with God. So one day i decided to wake myself up from this condemn life that i was leading .  And I decided to turn back towards God one fine day and am willing to face God and my consequences of my actions simply because God's presence in my life is worth fighting for and worth it all to go thru. Though sooner or later , I knew that I have to face my consequences and what the heck ../? But I hold unto to the belief,...yes i will face my consequences , but I also believe God will help me to overcome it all and the overall results a refreshing touch and a new relationship with total dependance will be established.  After even writing this blog , I stood up close my bedroom door, slowly starting to pray in the spirit ...started to pray in strong tongues...and then i started to kneel and really just cried out to God ....and the rest is an experience that words can seems to express..SO i challenged you guys going thru the same things that i went thru just a few days ago , have u decided yet...ultimately it is ur choice that will determine and not allow circumstances to change you.
