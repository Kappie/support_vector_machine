Recently I have gotten drunk on a couple of occasions - and well the first few or two times I think I enjoyed myself - those evenings went smoothly - everyone had a good time - I had a good time - no complaints. Afterwards I slept pretty well - I wouldn't even say that I was cranky at all.  Last night however - completely different story. I had a few beers - some awesome Chicken and Steak - who could ask for more? Cranky Shaun could - holy cow! I dunno what exactly it was but my attitude went down hill very fast. I became so moody. I was a little whinny baby. And for what? I dunno - and then today it just continues... I have a bit of a headache - I feel so upset about drinking last night - like it was the worst thing I could have done. I tried to fix it with some retail therapy - of course they have nothing in my size. The whole shopping experience was a bit of a chore - then I decided to get a hair cut - get rid of the black which is now just pissing me off - holy uneven dye job - it's all gone now - I'm back to my beautiful blonde! So it looks like I'm heading in the right direction - things are picking up - what else do I need - FLOYD! Pink Floyd - the Dark Side of the Moon - what a great album! Who needs mind altering drugs or alcohol when you've got floyd!   Anyways - I guess it's just good that I am aware that I am in a terrible mood - and I have found something to help me out of it. It's ok to be a baby every now and then!  Conclusion - Not To Drunk - the test is on!
