Hmmm...oh yea...that was the day of the big SRP thingy. That's where we did the gist of our administrative paperwork  such.  That's where pieces of D-company had us held up because the computers went down  they weren't able to finish processing all their people. That's where I was the absolute last guy from HHC in line to obtain the new ID card. Oh I loved Friday...  I was too exahusted to even consider going back out like the night b4. I wish so bad that lil mama could have been there. A number of us went out to the bowling alley to chill out...the big PX was conveniently located right next door, conveniently equipped with outrageous prices. Only thing was, she would have driven two hrs just to see me for 1. Not to mention she had to work so it was just a blown opportunity that neither of us could have controlled :-(  Yep, so that was Friday in a nutshell...not much else to report of note. In unrelated news, I just finished creating two love song compilations for my baby...every track special to our relationship in some way. I think of it as the soundtrack of our affections :-) Arite, i'm tired of typing...
