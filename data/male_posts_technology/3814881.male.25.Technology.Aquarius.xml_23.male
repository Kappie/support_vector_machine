This is actually the sixth time I've been involved in a good inductive study through the book, and I've started to accumulate a mass of materials.  I've jokingly said a few times that if I were to turn my notes into prose, I'd have my first book.    Only one problem:  since the first four of those studies were in college, working with the semester time frame, and the other two haven't gone much longer, my notes get pretty sparse after about chapter 12.  How interesting would a commentary be on only 54.5% of a book?  Not very.  I'll keep the notes as is.    But I will put up some interesting observations on here from time to time.
