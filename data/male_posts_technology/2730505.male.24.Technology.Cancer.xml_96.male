Well, I was getting my bucket of balls and proceeded to the hitting area.  $6 for a bucket, fucking ridiculous.  Anyways, I was at the hitting area and proceeded to stretch and warm up.  I hit a few balls lightly to get a hand on things again.  I wouldn't want to strain something playing golf.  That would be retarded.  So I got warmed up and things were coming back to me.  My swing was still there, just a little loose and rustly.  My 9 iron was right on target.  There's was a 100 yard marker and I was getting it consistently within 5 feet.  not bad.  I then moved to my 7 iron and was going for the 150 marer but couldn't quite get it close enough but it was going straight.  I was surprised since I haven't swung a club in what seems like forever.  I then moved to the 5 iron and was able to get it to about 150-170.  not bad.  not that accurate though but still straight.  I moved to the 3 iron but that shit is just impossible for me.  Long irons aren't my friends.  So I picked up the 5 and 3 woods and was able to hit those 200-220 off the mat.  not too bad.  I was feeling good about that.  I was able to hit it straight and somewhat long so yeah, not a bad day so far.  I then picked up the big guy, the driver and boy that was a challenge.  I was hitting the thing so horribly.  Just terrible.  Slice here, a hoot here, I would hit worm burners, top the damn ball.  Yikes.  It was bad.  So this kid comes up and he's beed playing so he's like "I bet I can hit the ball father than you can." And I didn't want to play since his dad was there not paying attention to him.  He offered me a challenge and I took it.  Oh well.  It was a young kid.  9-10 maybe, he could hit the ball though.  He busted out his driver and hit that ball 175-190.  Not bad at all for a little guy.  So I stepped up knowing that I was having problems with the driver but I still chose to go with the driver.  Stepped up, placed the ball on the tee, properly set my feel, looked at my stance and posture and proceeded with my backswing and BOOM! 250.  yeah, but barely 250, it was like 220 in the air and then more with the roll.  It ended about 250 from the driving mat.  I won that one.  he was a little surprised but wanted to move on to the accuracy challenge.  We wanted to see how close we could go towards the 50 yard marker.  he went first and yeah, he was damn good, he hit it just short of the marker but the bounce put him about a foot from it.  Not bad, actually that was great and I had a feeling that I might actually lose this one.  So I stepped up and took a crack.  It was a little over and the bounce didn't help.  I was about 5 feet from the thing.  So I said I would take another crack since there wasn't any rules on not taking it.  Took another swing and hit the fucking marker. Yeah!  The kid left me alone after that.  I then went back and practice my driver in hopes of perfecting it before next weekend's game.  After a whole lotta of driving, pitching short game work, long iron work, I felt the need to work on my putting.  That was sorely needing help at the beginning because I had forgotten how much to move the club and how hard to thit the ball.  It was a pain since the green was wet and it was getting late so there was little light to judg the breaks on the green.  I was getting better towards the end of practice but I ha to try the across the whole gree shot that I always do when leaving the driving range or the last hole.  It was about a 60-65 footer and it was hard.  There were probably 5 breaks on the green and you had to hit it just right so that on that last downhill break it won't be coming into the hole HOT.  Well enough of that, here's a damn picture.
