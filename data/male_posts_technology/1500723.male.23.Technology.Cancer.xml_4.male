Microsoft's next-generation OS, Longhorn, is conceived as a unified interface for a PC, its local network, and the Web. For it to work, Longhorn needs a sleek search utility. If Microsoft can't buy Google, it'll resort to its time-tested strategy: copy the best technology and integrate it on the desktop.*                                           -- Courtesty ( urlLink Wired )   Hope  urlLink dashboard   on  urlLink gnome  does a better job than  urlLink M$ search  on  urlLink Longhorn .
