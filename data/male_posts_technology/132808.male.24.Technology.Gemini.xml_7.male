I don't think so, think so, think so!!  How many playmakers does this team have if it's two best players, Zach Thomas and Jason Taylor, do not get a sack or pick, and yet SIX other players go ahead and either intercept a pass or sack the QB?  Sammy Knight, Pat Surtain, Sam Madison and Brock Marion are bar none THE BEST secondary in the league.  And only Green Bay's anemic secondary could make Jeff Blake look like the next Brett Favre, and only Green Bay's weak-ass recieving corps could make Brett Favre look like the second coming of Jeff Blake.  Favre to Freeman?  Yeah, if it was '96.  Maybe Green Bay should sign Terrible Terry Tate.  Triple T, baby!!  He'll give them the injection they need.  A special dose of pain injection!!  Get on the Pain Train baby!!  All aboard!!
