Yes I did just call you a string cheese head.  *glares around suspiciously*  First off, dearest beej, that commenter must have been you or a real person because (1) typing like that would make Teh JaQ faint into a convulsing horrid mass. And (2) I do not talk like that...and Teh JaQ can vouch. Mwah.   Second off, JaQ!!! You kicked ash in math today, haha you were all over that book like...syrup...on...Landon? or pancakes.  Yes, pancakes should do. *evil grin*  Third off, BEN!!!! Oh my FREAKING god...you and your tang bottle are kinda scary.   For our only reader, Krystyna, he had a Tang pack and ... was playing...with the straw...and *censored*-ing JaQ with it.   Double ew.   Any ways skank.  Eh. That was it.  Sally: Kiyoshi! What happened? Kiyoshi: It's nothing really... Sally: YOU HAD BETTER TELL ME RIGHT NOW UNLESS YOU WANT THE [poop] KICKED OUT OF YOU TWICE IN ONE DAY!!!  Hahah laters! ~Kariney~
