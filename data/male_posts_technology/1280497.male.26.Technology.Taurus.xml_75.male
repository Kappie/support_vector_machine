The house we live in now isn't any nicer than it was when we went to Commencement exercises yesterday, and the yard certainly doesn't have less dandilions growing and sending more seeds into the soil. Something big did happen, though, and although it's less climactic when you already have a full time job, there's still something magical about putting on the cap and gown and standing at the edge of life.   There are certain rote speeches that university officials are required to recite before sending graduates into the world. First, there's the "you oughta be grateful for the people who helped you get where you are" speech. Second, there's the "standing on the edge of the future, going into the world" speech. And finally, there is the "Please don't blow air horns into other people's ears" speech, the idea of which I definitely endorse. I mean, what do you think you're accomplishing by being one of seven people in an audience of 7,000 that happens to be cheering at a given moment. Is it the anticipation of hearing your own relative's or friend's or whatever's name read aloud in front of people, or is it just your way of fighting against the man?  Excuse the mild rant.   There is something to the whole event that made me feel all good inside, despite cliches. Perhaps it was when I got to see some of my dear Russian professors, who have taught me a lot about, well, Russian-related knowledge. Here is what I like about my Russian professors: they were always available to talk to in the office, and they have interest in ideas.  At least, there was never a time when I felt like they didn't care. That means a lot to me, and makes me respect them more and more.  The cliches work for my feelings right now; I feel like I should donate to the school, continue to learn even when I don't have a grade waiting for me, and always show gratitude to those who have helped me get where I am today.   I am grateful, and I do feel as though I have been blessed. I don't think it's commonplace to respect and truly enjoy 95% of a department's faculty. I enjoyed my time at BYU in large part thanks to them. I hope I can do a good job of thanking them. Cliche or not, that's what I have to do.   (Saturday, 12:12 am) Update: Here is a brief list of suggested improvements to the BYU graduation festivities:  1. Let students get their picture taken with a live cougar. Or just have a live cougar roam the Marriott Center during the ceremonies. 2. Assign half the audience to be shushers (that is, people who hiss "shhhhhhhhh!" whenever people cheer and clap) and half the audience to be cheerers. The cheerers have one second after each person's name is read, and the shushers have the next second. It would be more orderly that way.  3. Call people out of the audience to give a few words. About the speeches that were just given--instant feedback. 4. (Related to #3) Show people's reactions to different comments, like they do at the Academy Awards. 5. Have hot dog vendors
