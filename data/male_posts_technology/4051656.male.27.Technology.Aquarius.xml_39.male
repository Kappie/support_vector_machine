It is ironic that tourists coming to Washington to celebrate the freedoms embodied in the Declaration of Independence are so eager to give up those freedoms with no questions asked.  Freedom is not defined by safety.  Freedom is defined by the ability of citizens to live without government interference.  Government cannot create a world without risks, nor would we really wish to live in such a fictional place. Amen brother.  "They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety." -Ben Franklin
