It reminds me of the scene in "Mystery Men" where they have vanquished the enemy, and are asked who they are. The Phoenix says, "We are number one! All others are number Two, or lower!"  The pastor at the very, very large church was under the impression that Jesus didn't mention other religions, and therefore people who worship based on these other religions cannot possibly get into heaven as a result. He wasn't talking about Jews, he wasn't talking about Hindus, or Buddhists, or Muslims, he was talking about Christians. Nobody else! And anybody who doesn't believe that Jesus is your personal saviour can just go to Hell!  Now I know this is difficult to grasp, so hold onto your socks. How can you be a Christian and think this way? Remember the Good Samaritan? The turning of the tables? Jesus confronting the hypocrites of the church? He was attacking people of his own faith and culture, and presenting those with other faiths and cultural backgrounds as the correct guides! It turns out they were the better Jews than the Jews themselves, even though they did not practice Judaism.  I think the same way today. I heed what Jesus said about going into the closet to pray, and try not to display my Christianity. I am constantly reminded of my failures, when I see a 70 year old Mormon going out of his way to help others while I sit and watch. Do not discount others and their cultural beliefs just because they do not proclaim Christ their personal saviour. You may wind up on the outside looking in! Remember Jesus said, "There will be those who come before me and say, Lord! Lord! Look what I have done for you! And verily I will say unto them, I do not know you." It could be that the best Christians aren't Christians at all.
