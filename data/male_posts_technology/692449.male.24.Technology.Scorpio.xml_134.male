Okay, here we go:  It turns out that there is  one  hit for the term "Molecular models gone wild" on google.  The page is for an artist (the term comes up because it was the title of a Boston Globe review of the lady in 1990).  The wierd thing is that the artist's name is  urlLink Nancy Lorenz .  As in, you know,  urlLink Lorenz .  What a creepy coincidence, eh?
