It started with that song "Ain't We Got Fun." I don't know if that is the actual title, but it was the repeating part. That, and the strumming on the ukulele as the song ends. Each day it got worse. The "Ain't we got fun" bit got quieter and the ukulele got louder until it boomed like  urlLink Nigel Tufnel  had it turned up to eleven.    When I began to wonder if my medical plan covered lobotomies (forgetting that I don't actually have a medical plan), it shifted to what was once called negro spirituals. Fortunately I'm not a hummer or a singer. That'd be just what I'd needed, to be caught wandering the ethnically diverse cube farm in which I work singing about how I'm gonna jump back, turn around, and pick a bale of cotton. Otherwise, it was a marked improvement.    Then the tune switched to "Hey, Jude." Just that - "Hey, Jude" followed by a few piano notes. I said to myself "Now, this I can handle." I must have said it out loud because it only happened one morning, then theman who lives in my medicine cabinetswitched the channels back to "Ain't We Got Fun." Normally he's cool, but lately I think he's been nipping on my after shave.    Anyway, that's the latest from my brain. If anyone knows a good back alley lobotomist, please leave a comment.
