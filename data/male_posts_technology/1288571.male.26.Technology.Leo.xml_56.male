Anyways, today there was no way I could wait so I get to the washroom and think "BONUS! Completely empty!" and I take the stall furthest from the urinals (says the men's bathroom code). Get in, do my business, only to look up and find that theres NO GODDAMN TOILET PAPER!!  Now the most frustrating part about it is that I'm sure one of the main duties of the cleaning staff and/or janitor is to make sure that all stalls always have toilet paper. Well someone fire someone now!  Anyways, so now what? I don't want to pull my pants up over my ass just in case you know? I mean, I was almost positive that it didn't get messy back there but I didn't want to chance walking around at work for the rest of the day smelling like shit.  So there I was, holding my pants up at the front to cover my wang and my ass hanging out at the back, moving as fast as I could from my stall to the next.  Fortunately no one came in and caught me, but I tell you, its for exactly these reasons I HATE pinching a loaf at work.
