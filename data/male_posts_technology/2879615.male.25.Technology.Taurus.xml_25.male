Now, I'm not a priest (at least I haven't been for several years ever since my wife died in a car accident and I lost my faith) so I don't know whether using graphic violence to encourage use of the Blog is justified, but I have to respect Mel Gibson for some courageous posts.  They may be somewhat anti-semetic, but if you ask me those jews deserve it for what they did to the Blog.  I just hope that someday we can all come together and realise that the only way to heaven is through posting on the Blog.  By the way, I'm trying to write a book involving dreams and restaurants.  So if anyone knows anything interesting about either of these things, let me know and you may find your name in the acknowledgments when it gets published.  I've already got a deal worked out with the publisher of Collier's magazine.  Speaking of which, I read in Collier's that most people who reference Collier's magazine in their Blogs aren't even sure what it is or how it is properly spelled.  But one thing is for sure--it DOES exist.  Collier's says it does.
