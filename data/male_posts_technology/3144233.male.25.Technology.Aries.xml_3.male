The very kind Rose ran it and we managed to get most of our kit relatively clean and dry.  We'd have thought that packing in the mornings would be a very quick exercise by now but it has been getting systematically slower and no one can work out why.  Setting off the weather seemed to change it's mind every few minutes by eventually settled on "a bit dull", at least there wasn't much wind and rain. Leo was feeling his legs a bit and everyone was finding it all a little heavy. After around ten miles we got to a village, which seemed a bit like a ghost village as the only sentient life was a cat. We found the village pub and knocked on the door. We're constantly surprised with how nice and helpful people in the grim north are as she let us in, hung up our water proofs and made us tea. After vegetarian paella we headed off again and felt a fair bit better.  The scenery has gone from the stunning hills and views of the lake district to field after field of mud and poo, so it's all a bit of a trudge.     After about 5 miles the bottom fell of my (Ed)'s boot (see picture) and Joel had to get zealous with the duct tape as we only had an atom of super glue left in the tube. We are still unsure about what to do about this but hopefully we can fix it tonight. We have arrived at a campsite, which is fully equipped with tech computers connected to the Internet. Seemed quite strange but I'm glad for it now.  I have a blister the size of Belgium on my toe.  See you all soon.
