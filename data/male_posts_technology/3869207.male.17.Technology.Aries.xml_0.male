Besides being a small time pretty boyandapparent liberalschmuck ;) Alex also was my room mate in NewYork whileI was at theInvitational Academic Workshop at West Point. Here's the pics to prove it, courtesy of the Register and my now fixed, but stillbroken laptop, which had all my vacation photos on it.     Desmoines RegisterÂ©
