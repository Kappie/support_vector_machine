Michael Lawley, my ex-boss, was all up-to-date with this graph layout stuff, much more so than me, so perhaps he'll tell me why its not the best one there is, but I just can't stop marveling at the way it moves. There are also google and amazon browsers linked  urlLink here .  Now, what I'd really like is a browser/editor like this for  urlLink EMF , currently my favourite MOF tool. If only the Eclipse/EMF editor development stuff were a little less opaque to me, I'd rush out and build one...
