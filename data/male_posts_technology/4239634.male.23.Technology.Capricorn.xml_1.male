I've not been able to meet up with him for about a year and a half already, as he was away in australia doing his degree. Its kinda amazing actually, that one year could just fly by like that ...Anyway, realised that he wanted to become an insurance agent with AIA. Its really weird, the paths we decide to take in the end after our education ...Some become dentist, some doctors, some going into network marketing, some becoming teachers, and ....you get the picture...Anyway, decided to ask him to recommend me a couple of insurance schemes that I could take up ..  After that. he had to head back to office, so I decided to go down to city hall as I had an appointment with Anthony in the evening for dinner. As it was only 2.45pm, I decided that I could catch a movie whilst waiting... Found myself watching Twin Effects II ..There were quite a few special effects, but I found that movie's storyline just average. Luckily it was only $6.50 ...  The movie ended at around 5pm, just in time to take a slow walk down to cityhall mrt to meet Anthony for dinner. We decided to go to Marina's food court for dinner. A change from the one at suntec, however it was closed for renovation. We ended up eating at Millenia's food court. We sat and chatted there for quite awhile about the 'birds and bees' ...after which we took a walk around Millenia. As we walked, we found ourselves at Riz Carlton Hotel. The decor inside that hotel was "WOW"..... even the toilets had hand towels ...A rare opportunity to use the toilets of such a posh hotel. ..hehe ...From there, we proceeded for home ...  After reaching home, I felt rather bored ...so I decided to try my luck to get Frank out for supper ....Managed to get him out to a coffee shop beside S11(our usual haunt for supper).  Decided to call it a day finally....Feeling rather tired now ...wonder how tomorrow would be like .. I'll proberly leave it till tommorrow ...for itz experience ........  DiLloN
