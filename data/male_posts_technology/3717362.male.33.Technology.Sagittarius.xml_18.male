(Not to say that capt'n Dave isn't notable -- his issue is whether to play, not who for.)  Last I heard before the deadline, the team was offering $2M and Cullimore is looking for $3M.  That's where talks stalled leading up to today.  So, coming off the Stanley Cup win, the team will gamble, letting one of their most important defensemen test the free agent market.  This happened last year with Vinny Prospal, the team's scoring leader the previous season, who ultimately signed with the Ducks.  I thought the team blew it by letting that happen.  I thought they took a fair step backwards during last year's offseason overall.  But then, Prospal ended up miserable in Anaheim, and was hoping to get traded back to the Lightning before this year's trade deadline.  And all the Lightning did was win the Stanley Cup without him.  So, I guess there may be a legitmate reason Jay Feaster is the Lightning GM and I'm not.  I hope that Cully pays attention to Prospal's experience and gives consideration to more than just the salary.  He's been with the team longer than just about any current player.  I'd hate to see him leave.  Oh, and don't you just love seeing ads for Lightning Stanley Cup Champion gear on all the hockey related web sites??
