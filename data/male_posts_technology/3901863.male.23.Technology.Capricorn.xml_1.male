There is a tower in the campus and from the tower u get a hillside view that is amazing......It is a treat to the eyes. The breath of fresh air gives a feeling of ambience.  The campus is a good 15-20km away from calicut city (after having been brought up in bangalore, calicut can come close to a town...!!!). The canteen is also good - food is decent. Hostelwise the rooms are single occupancy furnished with a table/chair/wardrobes/cot/bed/fan/ lights .... Pretty well furnished. Each hostel room has a balcony from where you can enjoy the scenery even more.  With a network interface card, I can get internet access 24 hours. There is a computer center that is open 24 hours. The library is also amazing ....open 24 hours and has some 25000+ books, subscribes to all leading journals of all parts of world and has a digital library also with several e-books. The setting is perfect for a rewarding period of study.   THe profs are good - head of marketing is prof nargundkar - who is author of marketing research text book - it is text book in all iims. Our finance head prof Uday damodaran writes for leading business magazines. Our operations head saji gopinath is visiting faculty in asian institute of management, thailand. All profs are either Phds or fellows in management from some iim -a or c or b. Some have taught at abc or in B schools abroad.   We also get a lot of visting faculty.eg Equity research is done by UTI capital markets, project management by Wipro - all electives in second year. Electives are given based on CGPA and so CGPA is important. Average work ex of my batch is >21 months which is good.....  Every year has 3 terms, term 1, term 2 and term 3. Between terms there is a 10 day break. For the  term 1 my subjects are: financial accounting, microeconomics and strategy, organizational behavior, quantitative methods for business, Information technology for business, marketing management, social transformation in india and managerial communication. From seniors, I learnt we are lucky to have some real good profs. Prof Tapan K Panda for marketing (he is one of the best profs in marketing in india after nargundkar who also teaches here), gopal chowdury for quantitative methods, Dr Barokha (formerly univ of southern calif) for accounting, dr cyriac (formerly XLRI) for organizational behavior and dr sumit sarkar for microeconomics.   First year subjects are compulsory. Electives are in second year allowing one to specialize in one/more of finance/accounting/systems/IT/operations. That is the catch -  i can take electives across streams - not necessary to major in a particular stream....  I find a diff b/w university and IIM evaluation systems. In universities the CGPA is dependent on the final exam only. Here it depends on the tests/assignments/quizzes/mid-term/final exams. eg: each assignment has a weightage of 5-10% and the final exam weightage could be 30% -varies depending on profs.  Professionally,  I feel the stage is set for a rewarding period of academics. Personally, it is the first time, I am staying in a hostel and away from home. I miss my parents and home a lot - making up by calling home once or twice in a day :))  Of course I miss working in the software industry and the fat paycheck I used to get at the end of every month....  IIMK is like a resort infrastructure wise. You will never get bored at IIMK. The place is a 100 acre campus with the best scenery. It has ambience about it and you are in a relaxed frame of mind all the time. Some good beaches are nearby. I plan to visit them......... There is also a good gym. I need to focus on acads - mid term exams of term 1 in aug mid and final exams sep mid :o. My future is in my hands:))  Life moves on!!! Will post more new blogs
