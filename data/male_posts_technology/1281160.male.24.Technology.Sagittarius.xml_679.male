Great to hear from Kavi after a long time.....yes kavi as u said it's very difficult to manage ur worklife and family in one-go.....but a lot depends on ur life partner! Xavier...i read the piece of story in the link.... it was well-written, narrative and simple in language.... Most importantly I was able to visualise things....it has a great take-off....but the momentum can be fine-tuned a bit...a few sentences can be rephrased....like... "The soldiers seperated...." other than these it was really great to read....kept me intact until the end...  this weekend we went to Birmingham along with one of Boomi's friend....a new shopping complex was opened recently called 'Bull Ring'....had the usual set of shops that we find all over UK.....everything under a single roof.....it was so much crowdy like T.Nagar Ranganathan street....but the interesting part was a  shop called ' selfridges'...it has everything and anything u need for a house...clothes, books, music Cd's, bags, cosmetics, decorative items, electronic goods,entertainment and what not....it even had a restaurant....English, Chineses, Itlalian.......just amazing but a bit messy as well! Watched ' Bad Boys II ' in a nearby cinema complex...horrible movie...it was dragging on, on and on.... oops...i forgot to tell one more thing.....I have resigned my job....right now i'm under notice period...so will work until the end of this month!....looking forward to staying at home for some time before my next assignment!...Boomi is just waiting for the d-day.....so that nan oru nalavadu Boomi ya torture pannama thaniya samaikarthukku.....
