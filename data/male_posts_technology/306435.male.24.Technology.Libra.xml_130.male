That is about four and a half more weeks than I got at Liberty Mutual.  Square D is a very organized place.  I crashed on Friday night after working for three days.  I slept most of the evening.  Saturday I went to Oktoberfest with Marissa, Kristin, and Elizabeth End.  It was packed being that the  UC/OSU game had just ended as well as a Reds double header.  Good times.  Marissa met up with this guy she is dating from work.  He had been drinking all day so I will hold off judgement.  The Reds final game at Riverfront/Cinergy was today.  It was on tv.  The game was horrible, but I the after game festivities were great.  No stopping Tom Browning.  Cats won again.  4-0.
