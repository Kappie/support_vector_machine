We ate @ Sen Bar its an Korean restaurant along Exhibition St, between lt Bourke and Lonsdale st. We had  Dumplings  OMG! the skin is so thin.. its handmade(as said by Inge), the first bite is so divine that your eyes will close in absolute bliss.  Rice Cakes  Its hot. its what i i can say.. BUT.. we brave the 12deg cel weather for good food. Ah, all in a day's work...  calamari with chilli, onion, carrots(hot)  Its hot too.by the 9th squid portion i am eating, i was already feeling beads of perspiration, falling in on my forehead.But... Ah, all in a days work. Absolutely paradisaical.  mini steamboat  Well, this consists of mushies, carrots, radish, marinated beef, rubbery "dong fen"(chinese) and some other stuffs which i can't remember off my head.  And to make our dinner a 9.5/10, there was this Korean wine(13.5%)alc, its brewed with ginseng,and some other herbs. can't remember 'em all. But its nice. The reason why -0.5, coz i bump my head against the counter while trying to pick up scarf that dropped on the ground.  Crown Casino  We took a cab that cost us $6.30 in total, shared by the 4 of us, so each of us shared and we saved 80c, if we were to take a tram to crown.  Green tea, Sesame ice cream  OmG! ABsolutely sinful, but what the heck. i am goind to do my usual routine of pushies and sitties later when i get home. Tactic employed: Breakeven Okie. that's all for now.
