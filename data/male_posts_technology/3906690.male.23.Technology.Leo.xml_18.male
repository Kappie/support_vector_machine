My aunt's dog was being tough when we got there...next thing you know they were fighting. I was like "whoa" because they came toward me. Anywho, I jumped in and grabbed our dog’s collar and tried to tug back on him...but damn, tough lil guy...finally got them apart and the other dog went after our dog again, and they're fighting, again. I had my nunchaku with me...so I waited for a good shot and *CRACK* swung it at my aunt's dog, all while thinking *you fuker, that’s for starting shit with my dog*. It finally took off...I sent our dog home, and that fukin dog ran after our dog again, but backed out when it got really close to "Jimboy."  Dogs, pretty cool animals, although some can be...I don't know, I mean I've had my experiences with them. I used to have a Rottie, went by the name of "Jesse." A retired police dog. She was cool and all, then all of a sudden something happened, and she didn’t make it through that "something." One time we were playing basketball and it just so happens the ball bounced right into her territory and she got happy and playful, and I ran after the ball and just as she was about to bite into the ball I moved it out of her way and she ended up biting skin off the side of my stomach. Hurt like crazy but in the end I was like "It's ok 'pubby'..." and petted her. Oh and I was ok :P  One of my friend's raises dogs, mainly pitbulls. He takes them to shows, and fights. He's talking about buying a couple from this person down in Alamogordo or whatever. One of my cousins is also in that hype, I guess he just wants one for the heck of it, not for show and stuff like that. I've been thinking of getting one myself, but im not really ready for a dog right now, besides they are $425.00 a pup. I don't have that kind of money to be playing around with...I have school to think about before anything else.  Anywho, work is good so far. I'm hoping to reach 40 hours by the end of today’s(Wednesday) work day. Right now all we're doing is going to each location given and searching for oil and gas spills. More cover up jobs. Well I shouldn't say cover up. It is a requirement that all leases be cleaned at all times. Cover up refers only to huge spills and leaks...I better keep it a hush :P.  What else to say...I've neglected my guitar. By now I probably suck...hmm, every time I say that, it seems I only come back playing way much better. I mean I’ve practically outplayed all guitar peeps in this community. Most of these peeps have been playing long before I even started. I also hear by word of mouth that some people are intimidated by my playing *grins*. I hear all this stuff...makes me look good, guitar playing wise. But I always seem to not take it all in...I mean of course there are a lot of great guitar people out there. I just have to get out there and put my skills up to anyone.  My friends band, War Eagle Society will be playing in Window Rock, AZ on the 14th of this month. I was hoping to ask him if I could make a guest appearance and see what others think about my skills, others meaning peeps who haven't heard my "stuff" yet. I doubt I will be making this appearance on stage with his band though. If I do, I have to bust @ss every day until then to put together a piece, or to master one of WES's songs, and I don't really have the time to do this because I need that time at work. Oh, Soulfly is going to be there as well, one of the reasons I'm going. A music fest of some sort I guess. I can't wait to see this  Anything else?...all is good so far. I saw my brother again...I try not to go out to where he's at, just because of the constant blaming, it sucks. To this day I'm still questioned about what happened, mostly by close friends and other relatives who are now finding out about what happened. All has and is slowly turning well. Whoa, the time...well I need to rest for tomorrow...gotta trade my time for money.
