Seeing in her eyes that she did care about me.  Getting to the Rec in time to climb.  Adequately explaining my point of view in person.  Looking forward to spending a long time creating a portrait of your good side.  Deleting the post completely.    Downers:  Seeing her brokenness and rage.  Seeing the tears run down her face.  Knowing that I hurt you.  Knowing that I will never match your ideal.  Not pulling that 5.8 as cleanly as I used to be able to do.  Knowing that my dreams will torment me tonight.    Hopefuls:  I know you agree with some of those things.  I hope you can use it to better yourself.  Getting back down to par climbing.  Hoping to meet your impossible ideal in a dark back alley one day.    Funnies:  Imagining you smashing those $50 flowers with those $100 tiki torches is actually kind of funny. But then I imagine your tear-stained face, and I'm ashamed. I'm sure you'll be amused to know that I've yet to pay those off my credit card.    I leave myself open to you.  I will put up no defense.
