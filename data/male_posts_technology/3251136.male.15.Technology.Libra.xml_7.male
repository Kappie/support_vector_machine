Eg:"U bully me i tell my mother 1 ar"."teacher!teacher!look at kelvin!he take my bottle!"."Wei..dunlar..i gonna tell teacher bout wat u did to me jux now"."U're not gonna catch me..bleahh"."donkey kelvin,stoplar..stoplar..plslar..plslar". Wat a joke.  Sum of them will jux cry over simple matters.Kids of dis age cant stand up for theirself.unlike those teenagers during my father's age.They have to work while studying n most of them at dat time redi know difficult is life.Well..nvm..lets get back to the main point.  Wat realli amuses me is dat sum of my frens still behave like da form 1 and 2s.Ok.Not to mention their name..but realli!Sumtimes i c them acting like form 1s n 2s..i will like jux close my eyes n walk away from them pretending i'm not their fren..haha..dats wat i do.But of course sumtimes i have to correct them as their master..wahahaha...wat to do..my frens will alwayz stay like dat..cant blame them also..:)  Well..but still compare to my year when i was form 1,i think we're more childish.Before da new building came up and those renovation thingy in progress,we used to play police and thief in front of da staffroom,running aorund da courtyard,the hall,bus bay also,shouting like fools..HONESTLY...when i thought bout it now..its realli realli embarrasing!!!!didnt thought dat all our actions were seen by all da teachers....n da principal..which was mr chong by dat time..now our principal is mr chew...he's strict n doesnt let ppl running n shouting round da courtyard..which i think probably da cause of y police n thief is no longer being played by da form 1s n 2s dis year?...  until i became a probate sumwhere in june in form 1 if i not mistaken..i stopped playing police n thief wif my frens...have to duty n other stuffs..thank god i actually stopped being veri childish at dat time...unlike sum of my frens who r still am until now...but thinking a few years back..my form 1 and 2 years are still da my best years..i miss playing wif my frens!!!!!!!..haha..now?form 4..u wan play?can..can...finish da whole book of exercises n papers 1st..  anyway..wat i m trying to say here is..stop being chidish..esp if u're in secondary level...cause its realli embarrasing to behave like small kids of da age of 7-12?This is written specially fer my frens which still behave like small kids....haha..u noe hu u r..heh..
