I thought I might have heard the end of it after Moveon.org's ad and Bush's (oh, I never meant THAT!) ads that mixed in a little Hitler footage in case anybody forgot...enter that murdering bastard Kim Jong-il. Even the Koreans are jumping on the Hitler bandwagon these days:  urlLink http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3589766.stm .  Sorry, fellas...Hitler is so...well, so  last century.  Get your marketing people to get something more edgy, you know, to suck the kids in. Hitler just isn't doing it for me anymore.  It happens when you run something into the ground like that. How about we reserve calling someone a fascist murdering bastard for the real fascist murdering bastards, not the drive-thru clerk who tells you extra dipping sauce will cost you extra.
