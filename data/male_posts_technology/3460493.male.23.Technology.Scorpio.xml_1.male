That's Dance Dance Revolution for you acronym-less peeps (Did I just invent a word?), or that 'big machine with music and lights and jumping people all around it.' I don't have a PS2, but my girlfriend's brother has one lying in his room gathering the dust bunnies. I just felt like buying it, really spontaneous as usual. I just thought it would be good for a couple of laughs, but my girlfriend really wanted it, and since I was in a very giving mood today, I bought the game and two dance mats. I tried playing the game once in the arcade, but I blew $1 in less than 30 seconds. A truly pathetic sight.  See, let me explain my evolution of Revolution (nice rhymes!) in terms of what I thought of the game. At first, I thought " That's not gonna work, I won't be seeing that game in arcades in the next couple of months ."  Then, it was " The game's pretty cool and has hot music, but I'm never, EVER playing that in front of people! " Finally, it was " Ahh, what the hell, let me try it out once in my life. " My entire DDR career in the arcades lasted less than a minutes. I swore never to play the game again.  Here in the present, I just played it once to test it out in the PS2, then I tried it two times, three times, and when I least expected it, I played for almost two hours straight, gasping for air, completely drenched in sweat, just toally wasted (in a good way!). My feet hurt, my legs are going to be sore tomorrow, and I'll probably sleep 12 hours tonight. But in a way, I was so proud of myself, because that probably was the first exercise routine I completed in the past 9 months! That game really gives you a workout, and there's an article in  urlLink Yahoo!  that backs up the story.  Every weekend whenever I come down to my home town (another rhyme! I'm on fire today, baby!) I'll be playing DDR non-stop until I get better at the game and slim down a couple of extra pounds. At least in the gaming part I've become pretty good, almost mastering the 'Light' setting. In the next couple of weeks I'm heading to the 'Standard' difficulty and in a few weeks, maybe I'll be good enough for the 'Heavy' stuff. Plus, I need to trim a couple of pounds, like about 40! See, the problem is that I'm tall, and while I look a little pudgy, I'm not like South Park's Eric Cartman fat. Most people think I'm 220, when I'm actually 260. Trust me, I'll post pics in my moblog later this week to prove I don't look fat, I'm probably just a little big-boned :)  Well, time to hit the sack, I've spent all the enerygy I had for the weekend. Plus, today I had to wake up early to pick up my cap and gown for my graduation! Hooray for me! I'll also post thos pics when I have the chance. My girlfriend's going to lend me her digital camera, so this week you'll have at least 20 new pictures.  Anyway, everyone have a good night, sleep tight, and come back another day to read my blog! ( Please??? )
