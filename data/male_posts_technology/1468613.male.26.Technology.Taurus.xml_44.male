Well it sounds like Kaia and Marg are having the most amazing time in Italy (I keep on getting texts and e-mails from them saying how warm it is and the great food they're eating) and I am soooo jealous.  Kai is going to be here in 3 sleeps!!!!! Lest to say I'm looking forward to it very very very very very very very much.  Love u Kai!  see you guys soon (oh I know I'm being held to it!) and blow up a cask for me ;o)  -gede
