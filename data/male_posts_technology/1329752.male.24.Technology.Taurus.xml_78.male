It also shows how they outsmarted a syndicate engage in the same crime. Since then my passion and curiosity to know more about the technology and hi-tech stuffs started.  I was in my near 2nd year high school when I first encountered a personal computer at school. I grew up as an antisocial kid and was raised by a simple family. I know that the stuff was very expensive and they won’t care to give me such thing at that time.  The first pc game I played was scorch earth in a 14” sampo paper white monitor, which is next to my favorite: “Where in the World is Carmen San Diego”. The first OS I learned was no other than MS-DOS, the first program I wrote was in batch file and the first executable program I compiled successfully was in turbo basic. Few months later I learned more complex stuffs like pascal and started playing low level at debug. My first mentor at that time was a 4th yr. comsci student from Adamson whom is fond of assembly language. My 1st lesson about this guy is about “registers” which I then used to break password-protected units in the computer laboratory of our gay instructor (yeah he’s a gay). My interest regarding the subject matter expanded and later on…  Computer lessons became totally boring to me on my 4th year high school. I wanted to learn and to share more but I know I can’t get what I really wanted to learn at school. I started reading more books and other references.  The 1st school I attended college was a total hell. I took up a computer science course and there was no programming subjects. It was written on their curriculum that programming would start in 2nd year second semester. That made my life bored and concentrated more on extra curricular. At that time I was already thinking if there are schools out there that includes Unix in their curriculum. Since I can’t find any info I just bought some books (and lived theoretically).  My 1st pc was a primitive 2nd hand i386 Silicon Valley with a 50MB hardrive, 8MB RAM, a 14” colored monitor and a CPU weighing 50 lbs. It runs in DOS (I have improved playing “Carmen San Diego” because of this pc). After 6 or 8 months it died.  I took up a 2 yr. course on what they say, “Asia’s largest and pioneer in I.T based education” (eoww! Talaga lang ha?) but umm… I quite learned better stuffs in them though than the latter one.  My first Linux was a floppy based distro (Trinux) and then a RedHat 6.1 (Cartman I think). I bought it from somebody who’s selling Cd’s at IRC. Then I bought some “How-To” books. Well it was quite odd at first because I don’t have any idea how to run the thing.  My informal lessons on how to crash a system began when I met a friend from IRC named “dcoder”. The first .ph website I have browsed in was “findme” (a site giving commercial GPS services). Jay taught me the basics and how to be a badass jerk inside a penetrated network. From the Unicode era wherein IIS servers are being fuck up, the adrenalin rush grew even more not realizing the damages. Since then the evilness draw more and started defacing websites from Microsoft vulnerable servers to different vulnerable Unix/Linux platforms. Those accounts were used to scan and crack more systems, install sniffers, keyloggers, bnc’s, eggdrops, LKM’s, dump sites, possible zombie for DDoS or if it is a merchant site, then carding. The group was highlighted in the year 2001 – 2002 where I became one of those total “.ph dot slasher”.  If Jay taught me the offensive and dark side, another orgmate inspired me to switched and improve more in the defensive and the good side. It was “keech” (Maybe that’s the reason why I haven’t seen him deface a website since then hehe). He’s more of an innovator and inspired me to grow “mature” and not to live a “dot slashing” career forever.  After few more months of E.B’s I began to meet those other “elite” individuals aside from keech. Most of them are undergrads that have been very kind in sharing what they know. Then we’re sharing about more in depth security and administration, not just dot slashing. I wouldn’t pursue to learn and strive more on the good side without the help of these guys from the underground. They’re the best.  It was 2 months ago when I got too curious to commit credit card fraud (scamming). I have tried ordering goods online (ebay) and started paying it with "stolen" paypal accounts, shipped it here in .ph thru UPS and claiming it using a fake ID.  I’m getting gadgets with the expense of other people and I don’t like it, especially when my inbox is bombard with insulting e-mails:    "wrote: Kung akala mo naloko mo na kami kasi nasa america kami..well you're wrong! Isoli mo nalang yung phone ko o magbayad kayo., nakakahiya ka..Alam mo nung tumawag kami sa EBAY sabi pa..Philippines is a very dangerous country! Iam so embarass kasi Pilipino ako!!! and sana hindi ko nalang sayo binenta yung phone..."    I never thought that I have victimized a filipina. And that made me feel less and degraded. I know that it was sick but that’s the only thing I know to satisfy my curiosity. I’d like to try an online money transfer at that time but I think that would be too pathetic and besides, I don’t know how the process works (nobody would like to get jailed anyway right?). There came a time when I was spending almost 300$ a day for a video chat session. A camgirl wonders and suddenly asked me this kind of  urlLink  question  .  Right after the 4th successful shipment I stopped. I have satisfied my curiosity and decided not to have a lifestyle of luxury with a lifetime in hell. The underground scene is truly a matter of trust relationship. I’d like to thank those people who influenced me both good and bad. Well, maybe one of them was you...  Thanks for all =)
