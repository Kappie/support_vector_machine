I know only to trouble shoot the network and take care of the system requirements ,update patches and anti-virus.This is no big deal .Anybody ,who has a decent knowledge of computer settings can do it.I am not the person,who did the networking in this place.I just have to detect the source of any error in the network.  I have to do an extra job of taking backup of anything that the users do. Well,my mistake began when,I got a mail from the region office to update Windows2000 patches,he also wanted me to do it before quitting. I just did it.I applied the patches to all the computers including the branch manager's . The next day,the manager calls me to his cabin and says" where are the mails,Iam just gonna lose my fucking job".I am caught in a fix.i called another Outsourced System administrator in another branch office.He told me that ,I have to just uninstall the patches to keep the Outlook Express working ,but the mails are lost forever.  I called the regional Administrator ,he says"You should have  tested it first before applying ,and,did you take the mail backup?" Oh,my god!I didn't take the backup,i mean do I have to take the backup? Well it all simmered down to after the weekend and a letter to their head offices saying that it was all my fault.  Ok,I don't have any problems taking the blame,as long as,the company outsources to my company.  Well,I have learnt a lesson.Always wait for others to take a step,before taking yours .You may never know!!!
