One, Infy was announcing its first quarter results today and I wanted to stay back and watch the Boardroom discussion on CNBC.  For those of you who aren't familiar with this CNBC programme, let me clarify that what they show is not the actual Board Room proceedings but they invite people like the CEO, COO, CFO etc and ask them questions about the company  performance.  Anyways, this program was meant to start at 10.30AM IST and was to last an hour.  Having to drive down to ECity after all this would mean that I would reach office only by lunchtime.    The other reason why I chose to work from MG Rd office was because I had a dinner appointment tonight.  Now, let me not make this sound so formal.  Actually, I am to meet Damini later this evening and we planned to go out from "8PM to 10PM".  Apparently, she needs to get back home by 10.30 latest and therefore the timeslot, almost making me feel like its some kind of an appointment.  Thankfully, she stays closer to home and I usually drop her back on my way home --- giving us that much more touchtime.  Ahem!  Now, stop letting your dirty mind think in the devious way it normally thinks.  Sure, Damini is very pretty but she's not the kind of girl that I would like to be seeing on a regular basis.    So, having come to the MG Rd office, Iam propped up in one of those half-cabins and have been slogging my butt off, all day so far.  Its 3.15PM right now and I have this dying urge to take a few minutes to catch a game of bowling.  I have 31 unread emails but thankfully they dont sound earth-shattering.  I tried logging into my company intranet site a little while earlier because I wanted to complete some formalities for my parents' insurance policy, but the damn site wasn't working.  I guess I'll stop blogging for now and get back to my usual daily grind.  By the way, I was pretty kicked last night because Hazy called me and we chatted up a bit.  This was the first time she was calling me on her own, and considering that we dated last week and she called first, I take it as a good sign.  More about her later.
