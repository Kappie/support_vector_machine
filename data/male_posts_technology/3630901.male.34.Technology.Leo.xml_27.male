I hit it big with CTXS, ATYT, and BFUN.  Each of these tripled, at least.  Chris Lahiji had reviewed 12000 microcap annual reports and recommended a bunch. I chose a handful, and they really paid off.  This year, however, I'm down as much as I was up last year.  And after paying off the heloc, I borrowed against it again!  RCO was trading at around .70, and I bought more!  What the fuck was I thinking?  Averaging up?  Jesus.  Next time I think about averaging up I have to remember to sell.  Sell 50 to 80 percent of my holdings.  Take profits.  Take the fucking money off the table.  I was up about 20k unrealized earlier this year, and I got greedy, thinking I could make even more.  I was looking the wrong way, which I appear to be prone to do.  Nonetheless, I'm planning on putting myself further into debt (real debt, though), by buying a  urlLink 2005 Toyota Matrix   I think I might have a gambling problem.  But it could also be a "I don't give a shit" problem.  Where sometimes I lose a lot of money or make stupid decisions (both in present-sight and hind-sight) because I really don't care about the outcome.  Of course, I end up caring, a lot, later.  Linking the heloc with my brokerage account was probably not a good idea, even though I did make out great last year.  So anyhow, my portfolio currently consists of: RCO, ECGI, IBZT, CDED, AVR, EMA, and USTT.   They are all microcaps, and trading under a dollar.  I have too optimistic hopes, and they'll likely be dashed.  But maybe I like how my dad put it -- that my wife will take 50% of my losses if I lose money.  Maybe I should feel a little good about that.  I'd rather she share in the profits, but then again, fuck her.
