But the primary purpose was  a procedure for my son. The procedure went well, and he is doing great! This is the best part of the vacation.   My wife took the catering food over to the wedding and we left that same Saturday evening. We drove as far as we could toward San Antonia, Tx. My wife has an aunt and uncle living in New Braunfels, near San Antonia. We crashed out nearly midnight at a hotel then proceeded on the following morning after a breakfast in Cracker Barrel.   We made it to her Aunt and Uncle house around 2 p.m. Sunday. Monday morning our son had the procedure in Austin while my daughter and I checked out Austins Nature place. It was cool for kids. She was able to dig in the sandpit uncovering dino bones, ect. She didnt care for the Nature trail. The procedure only took 45 minutes ( amazing with modern medicine ) and he also was able to see the dino site. We ( wife, kids and one of her cousins ) then ate at Joes Crab shack for lunch. It was good. I had a cobb salad, one of my favorites.   We then hit some outlets on the way back to the house. MY son was already doing very well. I was impressed most with the Bible Outlet. I wish I had more time to go back there before I leave. I was looking hard at a book ( Debunking Dwarnism ) and probably should had grabbed it.   Tuesday we hit the Schlitterbahn. Talk about a cool place. It was a water park and a half. We didn't hit the Master Blaster due to the tremendous lines but i did manage to hit the Black Knight with Kell's cousin. We also hit the tubes, and some body slides. The kids loved the kiddy pools, pirate ship ect. We had a tremendous good time.  Coming back to the house we ordered pizza and was wasted with the sun all day.   Wednesday we hit Seaworld. We managed to see all the shows; Shamu, the dolphins, Viva, ect. Again the kids had a blast. It was very spread out and we had rented a double stroller for the kids. This saved us because we could move faster and it was less hard on the kids. That night I ran to Hastings and rented a game and a couple of movies for the kids. Kell's cousin rented Spiderman2 for the PS2. Yes, I  had to play it while here also. I was impressed with Hastings selection here. It is better than the one we have and I seen DeadZone season 2 there. I nearly grabbed it for only 39. This is the first time I seen it. I hadn't but may grab it before my trip here.  Today is Thursday, my 9 year anniversary. Kelli and I have plans to spend the night at the Drury Inn at the Riverwalk while the kids stay here. Since my son is doing so well, and the kids are looking for some time without us (pratically already asking when we will leave at 8:30 in the morning) we look forward to some quality time alone.  I recieved word my brothers in the hospital as of yesterday, last night. I didn't hear it from my family rather from Kell's aunt. ( The one in OK ). Seems he is passing more kidney stones and one is too large to pass. I get very aggravated at my family, because my son went through a procedure Monday and they have not yet called to check on him, knowing our cell numbers. Nor did they care to cal me informing me my brothers in the hospital. What can you do?
