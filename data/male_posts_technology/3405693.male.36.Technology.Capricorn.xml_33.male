It used to be we had our little group of alcoholic guys in the park, the odd street kid panhandling for pot money, dumpster divers recycling their loot on the streetcorner.  All comfy and safe, and this neighbourhood truly was a safe place to be at any time of day or night.  The community I live in is basically made up of a few generally tight groups of fringe dwellers who all look out for each other.    But lately things have changed.  The bums in the park are no longer alcoholics, they're crack and motorheads, the streetkids are all psychotic meth junkies and the dumpster divers are heroin addicts who have been rousted from the downtown east side.  What's worse, is now we have dealers and hookers plying their trade on my street.  Recently two people were shot outside my back gate; I even heard the gunfire and thought "That can't be gunfire around here can it?".  The dealers are verbally abusive to everyone but their customers, and it is actually quite frightening to walk around down here at night.  Now, I'm not a guy who's ever been afraid of crowds or groups of people, not even of little gangs of ruffians; for the most part trouble can be easily avoided in those situations.  But now...damn these guys kick the crap outta people just cuz it's fun.  And where do their morals kick in?  Do they have any, or has the meth completely wiped out their conscience?  Cuz these guys don't just punch people out; they stomp, run over, stab, shoot, blunt object beat and other fun games to their victims.  And they don't stop when the person's down...they stop when the authorities show up or they realize they just went too far and someone is SERIOUSLY hurt or worse.  Every day I read in the paper about some horrible beating, stabbing, shooting...all very close to my home, and it's messing with me.  When i'm afraid to leave my house after 10PM there's a problem.  So what's the answer here?  The cops do nothing...they tried to do something but the rich people on the West Side got their panties in a knot about the police tearing a little strip off some chronic offenders that the court system lets run wild.  So the community in the downtown Eastside said "We've had enough" and pushed them out right into my little neighbourhood, the Davie Village.  There was some talk awhile back about a little community action to clean stuff up but I think they got threatened away from doing it.    I have thought of a solution, but I don't know if it would catch on.  I figure if everyone in our neighbourhood whenever they saw a pimp or a dealer or an aggressive panhandler hit the motherfucker upside the head with a blunt object, eventually these skids would get the hint and move on.  The police do jack for us, cuz they can't, so let's show the scumsuckers who's neighbourhood this really is.  Of course this does nothing to cure the problem, but my personal belief is that the only thing that will actually cure the problem is get the warmongers outta office in the US and other parts of the world.  Seriously...this shit started to escalate right after Bush bought his illegal victory down there...not just the shit in my part of the world, but the whole fucking planet.  I view my neighbourhood as a little microcosm of what's going on out there, and it's a pretty accurate gauge.  I digress a bit...Yeah kick the shit out of these assmonkeys and eventually they'll realize they aren't so welcome here.  Tough to do business if your customers are afraid to come to you, but hey...that's exactly what these little fucks did to the local legit businesses...let's get them back with their own medicine.    Sadly, these guys are completely above the law because the system doesn't work as a deterrant or a recovery for people with now conscience.  Of course myself and my neighbours won't go around bootfucking every pimp or dealer we see; if that was in our nature we would be working with them, no?  So it appears that in reality the only choices real working people have in my neighbourhood are "Deal" or "Leave".  And that sucks.  I firmly do believe that when bush and his war criminal cronies get their asses evicted from the white house, the world will breathe a collective sigh of relief and maybe people will chill out a bit.  One can dream...
