A Melbourne court has heard that a man who tried to hijack a Qantas plane had previously tried to take over another flight and had flown around Australia looking for crash sites.
David Mark Robinson, 41, of Bentleigh East, is facing three charges including attempting to hijack a Melbourne to Launceston Qantas flight in May last year.
The Supreme Court has heard Robinson thought he was on a mission from God when he armed himself with wooden stakes, aerosol cans and lighters and planned to crash the plane into the Walls of Jerusalem National Park in Tasmania."
