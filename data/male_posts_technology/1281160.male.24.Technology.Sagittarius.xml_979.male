What practical purpose does the grandiose theory/discovery of a scientist really serve?   It seems we have answers for the above questions...and it's quite right also. But we're not becoming critical on a poet or a scientist...for the reason that we believe in their roles and the service they've done to the humanity.   The religionist/spiritualist is trying to manifest materially what he saw/arrived inwardly as much as the poet tries to manifest mentally what he saw/arrived inwardly..In a certain sense, the work of art  by a spiritualist is more practical and real than that of any poet/scientist...   It appears to me that the religion/spirituality evolved by Indian Tradition seems to have performed more powerful role/function in uplifting humanity than anything we know so far on this earth..Only that it works from different outlook than that of the modern..and missing which we raise doubts based on  the premise that 'it should function the way we (the modern) expect it to function?'   Before this grandiose outlook, all our fleeting doubts are not annihilated but enlightened and illumined..only if we care to embrace it!   To become more sincere in our questioning we can ask such questions to ourselves, because we know ourselves better than our tradition..and starting from oursleves may not be a bad idea.   1.What practical purpose does our  Living really serve? How does it helps to feed the hunger of the poor?     - Srini
