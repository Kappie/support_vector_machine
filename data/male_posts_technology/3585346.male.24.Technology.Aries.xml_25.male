Thanks to Amelia for this blog address which enable me to blog all I want! Anyone got some java script to test and I need to complete my project proposal! And I gonna go to my aunt office to check out her office PC which must be helluva sick.....thanks to so many viruses recently!  I thinking of changing my job....Should I or shouldn't I?  Damn....Show me the money and I go with you! Mean while I got to go for lessons.....
