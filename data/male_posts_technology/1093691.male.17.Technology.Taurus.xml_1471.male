And was worth it for the look on his face and the hugg i got. So i am happy, check my msn window for a pic of us in the limo. Eventually me and nicki will have a site back up ready and online so the whole picture sharing thing will be easy again. I hope you're all as happy as i am, or happy. Say 'HI' to Vee for me Jackie, Nicki, a plan for your woolworths theives, 'take a shot gun to work!' Speak to you all soon, Dave
