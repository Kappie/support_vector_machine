If you go to Circuit City, they ask you if you needed any blank tape, or a CD cleaning kit to go along with your mega-boom trunk speakers. If you go to Home Depot, they ask if you need any hydrangias to go with your pneumatic pressure washer. And of course, at McDonald's, no matter what you have ordered, they ask if you want fries.   Of course the idea is to extract just a little bit more money from you. It is only 45 cents, after all, or only another $5! Surely that can't cause you any grief! It is so easy to give in to suggest sales. I mean it must be! Consider my previous post about the 3 gargantuan shoppers. I think they skip the "Do you want fries" line and go straight to "How many Super Sized Sundaes should we pour on your biggie sized fries?"   You can find heaven in a McDonald's though. Anything on the menu is yours, if you ask and pay the price. Christianity is like that. All you have to do is ask, and you will receive God's blessings in abundance. And fortunately for you, Jesus already paid the price.
