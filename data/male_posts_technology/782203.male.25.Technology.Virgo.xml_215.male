I'm kinda glad I have this actually because for one it involves Java (woohoo!)  and secondly it sounds it involves way less research and more hands on work. But its gonna be pretty tough from the look of it but at least it will be challenging thats whats gonna do it for me.  I will be going down to NUS tommorow in the morning to some LT in Biz Ad cos we have a Sun Microsystems seminar thingy there, and in the afternoon we will be rushing to the office for training. Also gonna be appying for our Sun badges at the same time.  Not sure what I am gonna be doing this weekend. I am pretty sure I killed all the ticks on my dogs already.
