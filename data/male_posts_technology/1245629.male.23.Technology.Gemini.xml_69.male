Had the following discussion, which helped me get to this.  --] You are now talking on #linux --- Topic for #linux is Linux discussion.  Read lwn.net.  cut-n-paste != code reuse --- Topic for #linux set by mdomsch_hm at Sat Jan 31 03:28:46 [senthil_or] Hi posted at linux-testers.[drm:i830_wait_ring] *ERROR* lockup --] JerryDinh (JerryDinh@33f0f94f.23fa4838.amer.dell.com) has joined #linux [mdomsch] senthil_or: saw it, no idea [mdomsch] I had something similar on [= RHL8 with my Latitude C400 [mdomsch] but was fixed with newer DRM and XFree in RHL9 [mdomsch] RHEL3 should be fine in that regard. [senthil_or] Nope, I am using RH3 but still getting it constantly [senthil_or] Matt,one more thing. This is another problem X11 , posted here http://snipurl.com/4ax0 [senthil_or] have got any pointers ? [mdomsch] Red Hat XFree86 SRPM? [mdomsch] They may well have something in there to address this which hasn't made it upstream yet. [senthil_or] the question at google groups ( usenet) related to Xfree86 latest failing when used with Freebsd but Fedora/RH worked fine [senthil_or] agp0: trying to bind to stolen memory was the error, unable to figure out how to resolve [mdomsch] yeah, I read it. [mdomsch] "stolen memory" is system RAM being used by the video adapter as video memory [mdomsch] some is reserved by the BIOS at boot time, but generally only 1MB [mdomsch] which isn't enough for most video modes [mdomsch] So the i830 X driver needs to "steal" more (16MB or more) [mebrown] 855patch.tar.gz [mdomsch] in the SRPM? [senthil_or] ok..i see [mebrown] i have D500. google for 855patch. it lets you set the amount of ram to use. [senthil_or] Yeah, got the link - It offers good explaination of whats happend. Shall Try that. Thanks Matt!! :) [mdomsch] thank mebrown
