The DMCA might have changed that. But I never knew it was legal in Canada. Canadian law actually states "copying of sound recordings of musical works onto audio recording media for the private use of the person who makes the copy" is permitted.   Hey, I copy sound recordings for private use all the time! Yay for me!  One reason it is legal is that we pay a hefty tax on blank audio cassettes and CDs which go towards artists.  $70 Million collected to date.
