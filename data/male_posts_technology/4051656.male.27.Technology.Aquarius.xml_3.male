I, for one have been wondering how to do this for some time now, and  urlLink Xeno  has cracked it. Yay! The article includes instructions on how to make your other apps call your alternate browser instead of IE, and how to use Windowsupdate without IE. It requires some knowledge of registry editing, but if you've ever looked at the registry before and know how to change entries, you shouldn't have a problem. I'm still at work, so I haven't actually tried this yet, but when I get home, I'm going to implement the changes and report back in an update to this post.  Oh yeah, I found this article posted in my favorite blog ever,  urlLink BoingBoing.net     Update:  I remembered that I still use IE as an FTP client, so I haven't removed it yet. If I decide to do it in the future, I'll update with another post.
