Nicki, sounds like you had a whail of a time! My job is at a little DIY come homecare shop in Warlingham, I have been there for three weeks now and I'm enjoying it! Anywya, can't really type veyr well cos I've just burnt my middle finger on the sandwich toaster and it's gone all funny already, I will probably end up with a blister which is not going to be fun on the pad of my finger! Anyway, I really ought to do some revision today, so I'd better go before the Simpsons at 9.30! Bye guys
