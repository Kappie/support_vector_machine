I lightened up the place a bit, getting rid of the black background.  These new templates are a huge improvement over the choices available before  urlLink Google  took over. Yet another sign of progress marching forward.
 
 The most significant change has been the metamorphosis from being a catch all site to becoming a more personal blog.  Hence the pic of my beautiful mug to the right which may or may not be working right now.  No worries regarding guest authors and the like.  I plan the launch of a brand new blog, replete with superstar writers, in the coming weeks.  I just need to line up the superstars.   urlLink Interested? 
 
 You may have noticed the nasty banner that appeared at the top of the page.  This was an unfortunate side affect caused by my change in template.  I really didn't have the energy to dig through the HTML/CSS code to figure out how to cover it up again, so it's going to have to stay for now.   However,  I do plan on activating my  urlLink freeshell  account soon, at which point I plan on moving the entire site (which in turn will remove the advertisements).  If only Paypal weren't such a pain in the a$$ to activate...I'll keep you posted (so to speak).
