As of late, I’ve been desperately hanging onto the edge of love, cuz it’s so easy to slip into the dominion of hate. More than just hatred for others, but deep hatred for myself.   Each day the demon in me keeps lurking. Desperately trying to find its way to come out. It peeks through my expressions, my words, my actions. One can easily detect its ferocity through my ever gleaming eyes. Often, I try really hard to bite my tongue and resist the urge. But I just can’t help it. Its energy’s always being fueled by the growing hatred I sense; your hatred towards me that is.   You stare at me with a cold blank face. You never hear me out. My voice bounces back whenever I speak to you. And in spite, I let out cruel words like darts and daggers just to make it penetrate you. And I know it hits you hard. But what can I do, when I feel like that’s the only way you'd take me seriously. Instead of showing understanding for you (which I really do I have), I show my fangs and become a feral bitch. I know it in my heart that it actually makes matters worse, since you get offended when I become this unpleasant (what an understatement). But my head says stand up for what is right and correct, even if I have to stick it in your face. How do you ever reconcile reason and emotion? Cuz seems like I can’t at all, when it comes to this topic and I just keep falling into some deep dark pit of ugliness.    There is a perfect idiom for people like me in Japanese. Its called  AMA NO JAKU  wherein its literal translation is ‘Heaven’s demon.’ But what it really points to is my awkwardly defiant, almost wicked nature. I never back down when it comes to you and I keep telling myself its only because I strictly fight for the truth. I won’t comply if I don’t get a logical explanation. And I know I get so anal sometimes, but I just can’t let things slide especially when they are important matters that get massively screwed up on some stupid whim. I really don’t mean to contradict you all the time.       Bottomline is that I hate having to feel this way. I want to bask in the warmth of your unconditional love and be able to return that without expecting kindness in return. I want to be able to turn on some protective force field whenever someone starts mudslinging at me for no apparent reason. I want to be able to understand you and have you understand me as well. Above all, I just really want to be able to talk to you without any hostility between us.   Can we make that happen? Hmmm… I don’t know. Can I make that happen? I will try to control that malicious tongue and wicked eye I have. So best of luck to the demon from heaven. Cuz you know that demon is me.
