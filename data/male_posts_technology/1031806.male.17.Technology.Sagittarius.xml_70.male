Around 3:00pm on Friday, my dad picked me up from school, and took me to church to grab one of our projectors.  I then drove home and arrived about five minutes before Brady did.  Andrew and Steven showed up about half an hour later, and we set up three Xboxs (for HALO), the projector, and several TVs.  Around 5:00pm, most of the other people (Matt, the other Matt, another Andrew, David, Ben, Sasha, Jeremy, Adam, Cameran, Peter, and Pat) arrived. We set up the other two Xboxs, two Gamecubes, and an original NES (Ben's).  Networking the Xboxs turned out to be rather troublesome, and in the end, David and I had to go get another cable from CompUSA.  We got back, ate, and played a ton of LAN games (HALO) until Goody and Kevin finally arrived (around 11:30pm).  We then had some dessert, and opened random presents.  Pat got me a really tight airsoft gun. :)    Anyway, around 12:30, we moved two Xboxs and the projector down into the first story (mostly guest and storage rooms, the second is the main living area, and the third is where all out bedrooms are), and just basically stayed hunkered down there for about a couple hours while Ben serenaded us with the keyboard and techno stuff.  By about 3:00am, we were all feeling slightly hyper / tired - a weird state to be in.  All of us that were in the main storage area, were acting really weird, doing really stupid (or in Ben's case, amazingly good) techno dances and just generally messing around.  I suddenly go the bright idea to get out or camcorder, and videotape everything.  Before long, I got bored of it, and Ben and Kevin started messing around with it.  Eventually, all three of us suddenly ran out of the house, and up to the road, and proceeded to act out an impromptu skit about "nose cancer" (don't ask me, it was Kevin's idea).  This basically entailed us running around the 5 or 6 blocks local to my house, with trench coats, spotlights, and airsoft guns, alternately inspecting random vehicles, and pretending to be dead in the middle of the street.  (In retrospect, I'm quite glad some of my paranoid neighbors didn't see us.)    Once we went back inside, things mellowed down a bit, until about half an hour later, when I got the great idea of going on a walk.  Peter and Kevin joined me, and we walked a little over a mile to the Plaid Pantry to get some Henry Wineheart's root beer.  Then, we got the bright idea to go "nutria hunting" on the way back up to the house.  Now picture this - three 16 year old guys walking though a small park, closely encircled with several subdivisions, wearing trench coats, carrying huge spotlights, airsoft guns (which look like real handguns, except under close inspection), and root beer bottles (which look like real beer bottles, except under close inspection), at 6:00 IN THE MORNING, looking for nutria in the water.....  It's a wonder we didn't get caught.  And, once we got all the way back up to my house again, we decided, not to stop, but top go even further, almost the same distance above the house, as we had gone below.  When we finally get back, 2 hours had passed, and we had walked almost 4 miles.  I was one of only three people that slept that night, and I only slept from 9am to 11am.    By 1pm, everyone that was not spending the night the next night had left (everyone except Goody and Andrew).  We were so spaced out by that time, that we spent the rest of the afternoon mostly comatose, watching mindless movies, and playing more HALO.  Goody got to sleep around 11:00pm, and Andrew and I fell asleep, watching a Metallica / San Francisco Symphony Concert.    Zao, Metallica, and Queen are now on my "most downloaded songs list"
