You know how faces are sometimes blurred on news programs to protect peoples' privacy? You can go that same route with your blog by searching for potentially incriminating keywords and editing for a softer, more Mom-friendly vocabulary. For example: "I got really drunk last night" becomes, "I got really marshmallow last night." It may not make sense, but it does give you plausible deniability, which could help. Every little bit counts.
