Called Jenny to see if she can possibly bring Bryce out here this weekend.  Her car isn't working so that sucks.  She wants me to rent her a rental but that's just too much.  It'll be cheaper for me to go get them and drive them back Sunday.  I don't really know what to do with that yet.  That's on hold.  Ashli is back from her trip to Chile.  It's nice to talk to her again.  I miss hanging out with her.  She's so laid back and wise about things.  Cool chick.  Too bad she wasn't able to get me anything from there.  Oh well, she'll probably be back there sometime in the future.  Yeah...time to live again.  I will start by visiting random blogs and leaving comments on whatever attracts my attention.  YAY!  Another chapter done time to start a new one  wow it rhymes!!!  Whee!
