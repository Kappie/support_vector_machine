But couldnt think, since it look so personalised. any way good prediction man. Closely matches u.   Valli kolanthai, odambai bathrama paarthukko da.  sorry jax, Umberto Eco seems to be difficult for me. Ofcourse i think reading such paras will really be like reading a book in a language which u know least and trying to understand it with the help of a dictionary/encyclopedia.   Onakku purinja, engalukkum sollu so that we will also know some thing different like Arcane mythology. And rather than providing links for all the search results on semiotics, it would be better if u urself give us a simple definition, so that it will help us understand better, rather than going to all the sites and letting us know.   Hei today evening i am planning to go to Nithyasree Mahadevan's concert.  Hope to have a ncie time.
