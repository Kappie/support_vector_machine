       Gurgling, Bloating, Belching 

    

     

 

 

 I was in bed trying to read, but the growing sound of my intestines gurgling was becoming more and more distracting.  I finally had to close my book, boot my computer and make this post. 

 I was lying on my back, mostly reclined.  The gurgling was growing steadily until I was completely interrupted from my book by the thought that I was going to have a very rough night.  Upon sitting up, then standing to walk over to the computer I was able to belch and quiet the gurgling somewhat.  I'm tired and will finish this post and return to my book and my bed.  I wonder if the gurgling will return or if I can get some sleep tonight.
