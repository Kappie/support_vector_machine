Yesterday I took off work (and missed the AS conference) to go to the lake.  I had a lot of fun and spent probably eight full hours in the water.  I went sailing by myself on the little MX Ray ( urlLink click ) for the first time in a year and ooh it was sooo much fun!  I didn't capsize nearly as much as I thought I would (only 3 times near the end) considering the wind was so strong.  It was super annoying though because when I pulled the  urlLink spinnaker  the wind completely died and I drifted right into the shore near some dumb kids who were like 'Huh, what's that yellow thing Uncle Jim?'   We went out on the wooden boat for a good two hours and I burnt the tops of my knees something awful!  They really hurt but I  urlLink cbf  to put aloe on it.  Oh well, it'll heal.  It's not like I've never been burned before.   Also, I went buck-wild with my camera the other night and got some  urlLink pictures  that were pretty cool.  I used my step-dad's big-ass lantern and ran around in front of my camera on a tripod for 15 seconds.  Pretty fun blinding the neighbors at 10 o'clock p.m.   But I lost the original high-res of the ones I uploaded.  :(   One last thing - I'm in another  urlLink tennis  match @ BB.  Great fun, first time doing that sort.   Anyway, it's time to go home from work now.  Congrats to  urlLink Chris  and   urlLink David  for being so good at flash.  Props you guys.   -out
