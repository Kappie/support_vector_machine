I really need to move... *sigh*  I also tried to ring up the recruiting agency this afternoon to chase up my fortnightly salary and they were closed for the day. Why? Because they're based in Adelaide and today it is a public holiday in SA.  The gods must be displeased with me... but I haven't desecrated any temples/churches/mosques/synagogues recently!
