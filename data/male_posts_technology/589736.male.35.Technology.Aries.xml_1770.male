(ie, afghanistan)  i believe one of the major problems with protests at this point is that there is no clear message that can be chanted as you march.  like, "we didn't want this war in the first place, even though saddam was a horrible dictator, but there are horrible dictators across the globe, but now we hope for democracy, but that doesn't seem to be happening, and how can we afford this with so many domestic issues, and i need a slurpee because my throat is sore from so much chanting" it's an issue that cannot be solved by slogans or 10 second sound-bites.  which is scary - because i don't know if this country knows how to solve complex problems -
