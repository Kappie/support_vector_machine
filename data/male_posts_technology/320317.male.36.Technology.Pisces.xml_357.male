 I have gone to the Apple stores and checked out the new Macs with OS X. At first I really thought OS X was cool, but after playing around with it a while I have to say I like XP better, which I know use daily. This is for one main reason. Web browsing on the Mac with OS X is so slow. At first I thought it was me, but  urlLink I later found out , it wasn't just me.
