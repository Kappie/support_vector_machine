Completing 20 laps he came within 3 seconds of the lap record. Not bad for a guy who doesn't drive a car.   On a related note, Max "the black shirt" Mosely has decided to propose major revisions to the Formula one rule book. Since Max created the monster that is known as the six time world champion Michael Schumacher. I wonder what monster Max will create with these new rules. It is pleasing to note that McLaren's Ron Dennis has given up responding in any form or fashion when Max speaks. Keep up the good work Mr. Dennis, Max is out of his mind which is nothing new.  Watching the races from ten years ago, specifically the Monaco Grand Prix, this being the first race of the calendar after the death of Ayrton Senna, shows the quality of the talent in 94 and 95. No wonder Michael won, no Nigel Mansell, No Alain Prost, and No Senna. Instead of coming in fourth at best, he just needed a road car to bring him home the win. No disrespect to De Cearsaris or Martin Brundle intended.
