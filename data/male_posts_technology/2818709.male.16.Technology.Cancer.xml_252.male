But instead of "cactus diary" i would put "cactuar's blog"  Cause cactuar is kick-ass. and that thingi looks like a cactuar.  Or this one  http://www.blogskins.com/apply.php?sid=8852=Preview  but with a differrent pic. I want a smaller blog. This one's too big.  Ok, it's settled.   CHANGE *clotheswordsandgo*
