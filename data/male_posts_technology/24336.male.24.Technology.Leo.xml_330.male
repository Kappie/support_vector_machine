I live on South University, which is currently covered in canopies full of 'art'.  I work on Maynard, which is currently covered in canopies full of 'art'.  The places I eat, sleep and work are overrun, and the fair hasn't even started yet.  Life will get much worse when the tens of thousands of people begin to slowly crawl from canopy to canopy, either feigning a vague interest in the life work of an artist or exclaiming praise for the bravura.
