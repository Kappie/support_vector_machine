Let's start!   ..."the United States should not commit forces to combat overseas unless the particular engagement or occasion is deemed vital to our national interest"...  ..."if we do decide to commit forces to combat overseas, we should have clearly defined political and military objectives. And we should know precisely how our forces can accomplish those clearly defined objectives."  ..."there must be some reasonable assurance we will have the support of the American people and their elected representatives in Congress. This support cannot be achieved unless we are candid in making clear the threats we face"...  "Finally, the commitment of U.S. forces to combat should be a last resort." Well What do you think?  Who is the source of this quote?    If you guessed John Kerry, you are wrong!    If you guessed Howard Dean you are WRONG!    If you guessed Caspar Weinberger, Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Defense, you are RIGHT!    Weinberger gave this famous speech, "The Uses of Military Power" on November 28, 1984.   urlLink frontline: give war a chance: the uses of military force: 'the uses of military power'   In fact Reagan actually later used the items in Weinberger's speech to produce his foreign policy document.  I want to thank Syndicated columnist  urlLink Richard Reeves , for mentioning these quotes in his latest  urlLink article .    So lets recap now.  georgie shrub has chosen to not listen to his own father on issues of war and peace, and also to not listen to Reagan's Defense Secretary, and Reagan himself, who shrub tries to compare himself with, about the way to send troops to war.    Good work georgie, you always say you don't like reading books, apparently most of those books were history books.
