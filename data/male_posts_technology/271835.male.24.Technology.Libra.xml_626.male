This film deserves the widest possible distribution, said Moore, whose film won the Palme D'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival this past weekend. I had hoped I could achieve that with Miramax and Disney, but such was not to be the case. I'm thrilled to announce that I have an even better solution. BitTorrent! Except he didn't. The actual  urlLink piece referenced  is a spoof, as is every article they post as they are a satire site, but so many people have been linking and reporting it as real they have had to put a big, red disclaimer at the top of this one.
