Kishore, if I'm the ruler, who condemned the murderer, i wud have given a fourth option....that room will have "Kishore" in it....there r even chances for the murderer to escape from the other three rooms, but  he can't escape from Kicha's Kadis....  Nothing interesting during the week end other than going for a party...it was a pot leg get together......my contribution was "aloo kofta".....  Guess everybody is going to have a great time in Mahendran's sister's mrg....Have a great time guys....  Nice to see the site summary Xavier  Instead of uploading my photos in the groups album, I've uploaded it in my own briefcase  given rigths for all the blog members. U can have a look at those with ur own yahoo ID's  passwords at  urlLink http://photos.yahoo.com/vallichidambaram    Waiting for ur true comments. For Sindhu most of it wud be a repetition. I'm sorry for that Sindhu. But still got to show only what i have.  bye
