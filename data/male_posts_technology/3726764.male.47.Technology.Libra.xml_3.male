Caught a few nice bass, did some chores for Mom (a few more than my back wanted me to)and camped out in my tent. It was nice going to sleep to the sound of the loons howling across the lake and waking to the songs of the Purple Martens. The neighbor next door learned that Purple Martens eat lotsa mosquitos so he has 2 big Purple Marten Hotels in his back yard. Bats are better at eating mostitos but I'm not gonna tell this guy. Talk amongst the neighboring people is a black bear has been seen in the area a couple times. Mom said she heard it Tueday night. We went looking for tracks but didn't see any. Daniel Boone woulda fired me as a tracker.    Tom and Becky and their kids are flying into the cities tomorrow and renting a car for the week to go up to Mom's. They shipped out some of their stuff via UPS.The best thing about doing this instead of driving out is they don't spend 4 of their vacation days traveling in a car. Makes sense. They'll follow me up since Becky isn't really sure if she remembers the way or not. I'll be coming back Sunday. I need a full day to recouperate and prepare for my first day of Simmer school on Tuesday. Haven't decided if I'm going up the following weekend to spend a couple more days with Tom and Becky and the kids. They're a fun bunch and I really like hanging around them. Maybe it's because they both have a good sense of humor and obviously enjoy joking around and having fun. They're good at mixing it with seriousness. I sometimes think I don't take enough things seriously. But heck, laughing feels good.   Holy babbles, Batman! What was going to be just a short, quick post has turned into....well, lots more than I intended. More when I get back sunday. Oh yeah...I sure am enjoying the 80+ degree temps we've had the past few days.
