You make armies, economies, and you have to destroy the opposite team. It is so freaking fun. eh, I dont want to go to skool tomorow...I just want to play this game.  I haven't tried it online yet, but i am content even if i am playing with AI. What is amazing is that i bought this game a few months ago in a pack of strategy games and I have only tried RISK and AOE there are civilization and majesty left in the package...  These games are so fun and addictive, I wish i had time...  out
