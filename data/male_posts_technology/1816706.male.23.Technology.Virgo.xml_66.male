Shortly before I moved into my current apartment I was homeless and staying with my co-worker Dean.  I thought I would be nice and bring some beer, so I picked up 20 bottles of Budweiser.  Well after I picked it up, I put it on the roof of my car as I was getting in, and left in there.  Fortunately some lady yelled at me and I was able to save them.  While Heather was here, I left my wallet on the roof - long story short, I got all the stuff back.  Then on Kauai - just a bottle of water, but water none the less.  Then while I was back in Texas, my only pair of flip flops I brought with me.  And then back on HI again, another bottle of water.  Seriously!!!  I need to do something about this.  I need to get leaving things on the roof of my car.  What if I have kids one day!!!  I worked till 1am, I got up at 11:00am, it's now 11:30am, and I'm having a beer - natty light.  It's gonna be a good day.  Beach later, maybe a Mai Thai at Dukes.  Who's comin next?
