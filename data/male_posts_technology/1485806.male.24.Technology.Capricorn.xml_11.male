To See His creation acting , singing and undulating ...being more than they can be..brings Him Joy that is bountiful. How lovely our God is to create Us with so much talents .// Took a lot of pictures of the church antics and it s peoplel....  Hey know what Wai Nyan's dad is preaching this Saturday...that means must come to SIBKL to support ....hahaha...  Haaaaa.....(sighing) another day have gone past without any jobs in sight or at hand.  I cannot tahan with boringness and soon i will be growing fungus all over...I have to do something.... I wish that HR would just ban that rule of waiting the entire 2 weeks for employing someone,..i have gone to 3 interviews and still no reply or answer.  But God have a greater purpose i am sure...so i would choose to stand strong and even pS.Tony Armstrong shared yesterday. Do not quit for God's promises and Words will prevail.  Got no much to say today ...enjoy God's presence everyday
