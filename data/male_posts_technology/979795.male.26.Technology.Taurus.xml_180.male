Heard he was really tired from driving people around the whole day. The lift we got was quite uncomfortable with a lot of bumps and knocks here and there (but he was doing us a favour after all, so...). I did get a bit pissed off as he went over a particular deep hump and I knocked my head against the ceiling of the car. Seriously, if I knew that a 'free ride' meant having to endure such a thing, I'd gladly pay for a cab ride down instead. I'm not one to accept 'free lunches' but don't expect me to have to see your lian3 se4 (看脸色) and take such shit too easily. I kept looking at my watch and reminding myself that getting out now and flagging a cab down won't get me to the destination on time so I just kept reaaaaally quiet about it. Like I said, he was under no obligation to give us a lift and he did it out of goodwill, but I wished he hadn't tried to be a nice guy and had just gone about his normal business that night.   0100 to 0550 hrs  Took a coach down to Stansted airport in London, one of the smaller airports in the outskirts of London. Changed some Norwegian (NOK), Danish (DKK) and Swedish (SEK) currency. Rate was approximately £1 to 10 NOK / 12 DKK / 10 SEK. Around there lah.   0720 hrs  Boarded the EasyJet plane bound for Torp airport in Norway.   Time stated in Norwegian time +1   0945 hrs  Landed in Torp airport. My first impression of Norway: lots of low buildings and trees, clean air. Paid 120 NOK for a coach service to Oslo city where our hostel is located. Withdrew more cash from the ATM. Second impression of Norway: expensive country with a high standard of living. As we got closer to the city, taller buildings started to appear. Plenty of modern architecture dominated the Norwegian city landscape.   1250 hrs  Arrived Oslo city. We checked into the Ankar Hostel situated a few minutes walk from the city centre. It was a nice place. New too. We seemed to be the first group to be using our room as the hostel had just opened that day very day.  We approached a mountaineering shop for maps to our intended trail. Found out that we were too early in the season and around two third of the trail was still covered with snow. We were told the earliest possible season for trekking should be around mid / end July depending on the weather. This was in great contrast to what the Lonely Planet book said. Sianz. We had to revise our original plans again and re-plan our route. In the end we decided to go for the remaining part of the trek where the snowed has already cleared (supposedly the best part as well).  We made our way to the rail ticketing office to get tickets to take us closer to the starting point of our trek. Purchased a train ticket called "Norway in a Nutshell". Cost us 1657 NOK! Almost £165+. Have to try and call home to get more funds. Friends are paying for some of my expenses at the moment. What makes things worse is that tomorrow is a weekend. My parents won't be able to do anything till next week.  At the end of the day, I noticed that there's about 1 hr more of daylight compared to UK.  A coincidence. The 4th person in our dorm is a 5th year medic (medical student) also studying in the University of Birmingham. He had ended term early and had been travelling Europe for the past 7 weeks. We had a conversation with him till about 2am before we all went to bed. He mentioned a lot about his travels in Rome, Munich, etc.
