I go to a Men’s Sunday School Class and somehow the hour was spent on the influence of the Muslim religion across the world in addition to our lesson.  Received a major blessing from our Church today, in which I will dedicate a post for it.   After Church, we ran to my wife’s parent’s house to help move some furniture. When we get there we ate lunch and I ended up helping put in a floor. Has anyone seen these ‘click and lock’ wooden floors? Basically you have a tongue on one end and a groove on the other. You place them in a 45 degree angle and lock the wood together. There are no seams to it. It went pretty quick after we got past the door hinge ECT. I had to bring the skill saw to do some trimming on the edges.   We also moved the furniture from one house to the other ECT. As we finished up my wife’s Brother came with a friend and fought with her mom. It boiled down to she been asking him to put up a ceiling fan on the same room we did the floor and he did not want to do it. You have to know the history and I am not getting into it now. So I started on the fan and he and his buddy was finishing it up when Kelli, kids and I split. We ran to the house, I showered while she got the kids ready and we ran back to Church. This next week is Vacation Bible School here and my wife is teaching the Pre-K. We were going to have a baptism but the lady did not make it in. So everyone worked on putting all the rooms together for the week. I was amazed how this Church went all out on Vacation Bible School.   We got home nearly 8 p.m. and bathed the kids, and let them do a sleepover in the living room. They crashed watching ‘Kim Possible A sitch in time’ again.  We are trying to catch up on laundry and some minimal cleaning up since we seem to run all weekend.   So it’s now 11:30 p.m. and we are about to hit the bed since we start all over again tomorrow.  Anyone reading this and is a dad, Happy Fathers Day.  Gotta at least tell you, the kids made me some homemade coupons. I received a coupon for a hug, a kiss, and to listen to my songs in the car. heh heh I also received the book 'The Purpose driven Life' by Rick Warren. I been wanting to read it because everyone that had or in the process said it was a really good book.
