Just to think, only a few, short months ago.. we were outside, al fresco drinking, checking out the beav.. um... ladies walking in little more than a greyhound skirt (one inch from the hair, get it?) and tight tops.. and now.. well, like a pack of fickle geese they have migrated, to be replaced with kagool wearing stony faced ice queens.  Where is this mystical place that the summer talent goes for winter? I'm convinced that somewhere there's a bedroom wardrobe with a secret door at the back. Only this door doesn't lead to some farcical winter wonderland called Narnia, it leads to summer-talent-bikini heaven.  Now, you may say.. "Shut up about the chicks Toaster. Stop being so shallow." and you'd be right. But you have to look at the big picture. Less pie hitting the streets, means less men getting laid. Less men getting laid means more fighting and aggression. Aggression leads to hate. Hate leads to fear. Fear leads to the dark side. The dark side leads to..  .. umm.. well, i've haven't got that bit totally figured out.. but it's just not good, is it?    Summer talent at the Splash, sadly now a distant memory.
