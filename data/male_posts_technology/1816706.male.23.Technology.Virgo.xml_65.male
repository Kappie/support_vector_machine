It's a place I went to with my parents while they were out here last xmas.  It's on the top of this hill in a national park, and just a really cool place.  I always thought it would be a good place to take a date, and actually while we were up there, there was a couple getting married there.  But you do this real cool windy drive up to the top of the mountains, and at the top there is this great look out point.  It's one of those many things that makes me think that I am very fortunate to be in Hawaii.  On a side note, it's great having my old guitar out here, it sounds much better than the one that I was renting, and I really think that I am the best I have ever been at guitar, though not good by a long shot.  Still, it's fun to play and look at the ocean.  And for some reason I am much better in the morning than in the evening.  Weird.
