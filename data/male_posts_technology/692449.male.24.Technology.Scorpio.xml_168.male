I also found another pdf about a comprehensive energy strategy for the US that doesn't use fossil fuels. You can find the doc  urlLink here . I would argue that we need to move away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible I can think of several viable alternatives that already exist. Yet the oil companies have a strangle hold on energy policy. The sooner we move to a non polluting fuel the better. Unfortuantly capatilism gets in the way every time. I hate economics not because I don't understand it, but because I don't understand why we have to have greed in the first place. I wish people would understand that this endless cycle of economics isn't getting anyone anywhere. Learning, art, love, and beauty should be our values instead of greed, economic growth, and competition.
