She didn’t even read my last post but was making me Chicken and Beef last night for dinner.  I’m not sure how to explain this except to say PK is great.  She must be able to read my mind sometimes because she comes up with the same ideas as me all the time and I won’t have said a word about it.  I think if she ever comes to her senses and decides to leave me I will defiantly have to go into Stalker mode till she gives in and takes me back.     To any off the crew interested we will be going to Pizza Hut on Wednesday so let Acting Commander Baity, or me know if you are interested in joining us.  Rossborough’s re-quoted my insurance on my car last month in 2002 my insurance was £199.00 with no no-claims bonus and no driving experience and being 24 years old…. This year they quoted me £320.00 and I’m now 25 when insurance is supposed to be cheaper and one years no claims….  The guy on the phone could not explain to me why my insurance was now going to cost me another £120.00.  Anyway I managed to get cheaper insurance through Reeds and phoned up Rossborough’s to let them know I didn’t want my insurance renewed through them.  However when I looked at my bank statement it seems they were not taking no for an answer and have taken money out of my account to pay for the new insurance…  I really can’t believe it.  An insurance company has stolen money off me!!!!  To make matters worse I find out another Company I had a private pension through but cancelled have been taking money off me too!!!  Because of this my bank has closed my bank account as the direct debits that were supposed to be coming out of my bank bounced as the money wasn’t there.    Well I’m going to go now and scream down the phone at some people and see about getting my money back.  Jedi Master Danger signing out…..
