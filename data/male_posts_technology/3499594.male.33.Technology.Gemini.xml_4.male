I again started before 8 a.m. but this time actually got out around 5:20 p.m. I had a conference call this morning that was, putting it mildly, not pretty. The facility is freaking because we have continued issues on this lab upgrade. Not the fact we just got Micro's to post and was up till nearly 6 p.m. doing it. So with grace, I said we will work on the following a, b, c. So without further ado, after the call I called up Birava, (she works at the vendor((she and I are the one working on the interfaces))) and we start again. We two seem to be bonding after busting our asses together last week and this week. I have to admit she is new in her job as I am still kind of new in this lab interface. So it's been an education for both of us.   Anyway, we humped it working on the ORM's (orders from lab to the ordering system) issue. Seems that when they order, irregardless, it shows a time of 0000. Well we started to investigate this and low behold, this is happening on all of the facilities that was upgraded to the new lab system. Hell, it’s been a problem for the past 5 facilities and no-one even said anything. Grr, so we fix it right before 2 p.m. (our next big meeting for an update), it was drama again. That's why I asked is it already 2 p.m.? That meeting was hell compared to the mornings call.  She listed 3 issues remaining and wanted to hold off the live (bringing up the new lab system) next Tuesday. Well that didn't fly. The Lab Vendor already had 7 people flying out there for next weeks live and you know the tickets are non-reimbursable. So the facility was basically asked to hold off till tomorrow morning seeing how far we get today.   I ended up calling the same person at the facility to assist and we actually managed to correct all 3 issues remaining. Fortunately she commented on feeling better by the end of the day. We tested and fixed all we could with her, for the remaining time we had. Thus we were able to quit around 5:20 p.m.    After this I was able to eat. My lovely wife had supper waiting. Her day was hell as well. She had to run to and fro and ended up taking our son to therapy (as opposed to me), thus missing an appointment. Now she will have to keep it tomorrow and I have to take our son. But that's her, she's a giver.   My kiddos had to be at T-ball at 7 p.m for pictures. Only 2 more games to go. So they took their pictures and then the game at 8 p.m. With all the rain it was a muddy mess out there.   I didn’t get to see the game but my wife said it was good. My son made it all the way home. I think this was the only time, cool. Once they came home, we through them in showers, pajamas and into bed with a movie.   Now its 11 p.m. and I have to go watch Dead Zone since I missed it Sunday. :  ) Another late night. Bummer
