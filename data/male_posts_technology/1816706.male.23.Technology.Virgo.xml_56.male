No, just woke up, went to Luling City BBQ with the folks, which was freakin awesome! Got ready for Kennas wedding and went down to Spring to pick up Heather and Amanda's friend who've I've forgotten his name already. Well the wedding was great. Shit I was nervous for Matt and Kenna. I was fortunate enough to get to stand up for the wedding and it was just a really great thing. Good for them. After the wedding we went to the reception which was great, got to see a lot of people that I hadn't seen in a while, Nina, Julie, Arf, and spend time with all my other friends. Honestly, I was the best dancer there. I headed up both Conga Lines, and well seriously, who dances better than a 6ft 6 white guy. After the reception we went to Fox and Hound in the Woodlands for a little and then called it a night.
