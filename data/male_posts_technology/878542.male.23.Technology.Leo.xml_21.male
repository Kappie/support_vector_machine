The last two years I have spent largely reading, researching, talking to people about things thought to be important, and thinking about what to do. Launching this magazine, I hope to provide myself with a vehicle to effect change, give other people tangible support in endeavors I find important, and furthering my support for realistic and rational outlooks.   I also hope to use this magazine to help myself produce references for other people, share what I've learned so far, and provide myself with more opportunities to learn.
