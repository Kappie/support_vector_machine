I want to be held I want someone to say that it will be ok I want someone to call me and cry with me I want someone to say yeah lets go out, lets get you a life Have you thought of trying... would you like to try it with me? Let's have an adventure...  I want someone to be here and hold me I want someone to say that it will be ok I don't want to hurt anymore I don't want to hurt anyone anymore I don't want this feeling in me I don't want to feel and all I can do is feel  I want to talk about it, but I can't I want someone to love me for all that I am and for all that I will become, I want someone to say, you don't fit my mold right now, but we'll work on you getting closer together I want someone to want me  rejection sucks...
