This is understandable, considering the types of game that he usually likes.  He is more of a hack-and-slash type, whereas Gladius is a much more tactical game.  There is not really a walk-through type FAQ for Gladius that I have seen, so I may just start again and create one.  Later in the evening, SWMBO came downstairs to check on me.  She tried to pick up PGR2 again, but she had lost her touch.  I put in Munch's Oddysee so that she could try a platformer, but she was completely disinterested.
