On these pages I hope to pontificate, rant, rave and generally have a good time sharing with you my thoughts, feelings, discoveries and lessons about life, the universe and a lot of other things. I hope you enjoy what I write, but if not feel free to do whatever floats your boat and leave me in peace, but if you really must tell me how crap my prose is, then go ahead, that is why I have decided to enable comments on all my postings.    Right now I am listening to the Police (Greatest Hits) and being dragged back to my youth oh so many moons ago. I am stunned at how good they were, it is only a pity that at the time I was (or thought I was) a 'rocker' and sadly the Police just did not fit into that genre. Still, they remind me of those alcohol-free teenage discos at the youth centre in my home town of Thetford in Norfolk and I smile, it's only a pity that I never realized how good those days really were. That's not to say that days are not good now, just different, with two wonderful kids to take care of, days just cannot be so carefree again.     For now, sleep calls.
