The high point was at the end of one talk in Hyderabad one of the conference crew brought a birthday cake on stage (it was my birthday) and they had 3000 people sing happy birthday to me. Quite overwhelming. Thanks, everyone!  The peace movement is quite strong everywhere. I took this photograph of a chalk drawing on a street in London. Folks aren't exactly anti-American: they're anti-war. Everyone was hugely excited about Michael Moore's new movie. I'm a very liberal Canadian living in America: I got lots of questions. "   Reza, shared a very interesting note on his Sun Tech Days Experience. The post made me feel the missing out of the event. :(  JoG's Birthday on that day is a news. and BTW, Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 seems to have wom the Cannes Film award.
