After the work is finished, my clone would have to disappear of course. I enjoy being unique.  Question: let's assume science is finally able to clone a human, so I can order a clone of myself. How would you know which is the clone and which is the original? Probably by tattoos, piercings, scars, calluses, wrinkles, etc. Even a DNA-clone would not have those things... In fact, an exact clone would be "too new".  Another question: Do identical twins have identical fingerprints?
