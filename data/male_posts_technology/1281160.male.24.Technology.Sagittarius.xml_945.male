He is performing a one-man show in San Francisco to sell Winchester rifles. We slowly understand that he has been traumatised by the massacre of an Indian village carried out under the command of Col Bagley (Tony Goldwyn).Yet Bagley is not out of Algren's life. He and another army officer Zebulon Gant (Billy Connolly) persuade Algren to train the conscript army of the Japanese emperor who wants to modernise his country.Algren realises quickly he is against formidable odds.   One of them is posed by a band of samurai lead by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Early in the movie, Algren is wounded and captured by the samurai.  When Katsumoto spares Algren's life despite the harm he has inflicted on Katsumoto's men, the film begins to take a predictable turn. We now suspect the two foes are going to change their hearts towards each other. In one of the film's unbelievable sequences, Katsumoto even lodges Algren with his sister, Taka (Koyuki), the widow of the samurai the American had killed. Even then, things are not going to be easy for Algren. For he has to take a lot of beatings from one of his bitter foes among the samurai, Ujio (Hiroyuki Sanada).  Soon Algren goes with Katsumoto to Tokyo for a political showdown with the emperor (Shichinosuke Nakamura) and businessman Omura (Masato Harada), who wants to modernise Japan. But Algren suspects he is doing it for his own personal gains.In Tokyo, Katsumoto is arrested and offered the choice of taking his own life. Algren and the other samurais free Katsumoto and they flee from the imperial army. But they know they will have to confront the emperor's large and comparatively modern army. A big challenge to the two men is how to neutralise the big guns so the Samurai can have an advantage in hand-to-hand combat.
