After many observations, i feel like Ottawa is Montreal's nemesis. Its arch-rival, its competitor. It would be Shelbyville if Montreal was Springfield. Well, you get the picture...if you add bureaucracy to Montreal..it's Ottawa.  First thing about Ottawa is that the size of the city is about the same size...well ok..maybe not at the same places..but fairly similar....it's like a giant Old Montreal with no Montreal downtown....okok..so there's a lot of old buildings, and there's only one mall. And, sure they have their own Marché Jean-Talon..or Marché Atwater...in Ottawa it's the market. They even have their Crescent or St-Laurent street...ok so it doesn't have any clubs...but they have some restaurants on Bank street and Elgin.  Second of all...even after walking on the streets..i feel like the people are in competition with the people in Montreal...As i came out of the Tim Horton...i saw a bum begging for money that strangely looked like the one's hanging in front of the Guy-Concordia Metro station, near Concordia University..and guess what..near TIM HORTON Dun tun tuh! *Dramatic Music.  Let's not forget that the people here are soo...how can i say it in a nice way....let's just say that their behavior are very bureaucratic. For one, i have the impression that everyone works for the government..oh wait..Everyone DOES work for the government in Ottawa...ok..maybe not everyone..but about 75% of the working force in Ottawa does...:S Every freakin' building has the government's logo on it. Oh and what reflects the best about the federal government is the people that work for them... For the last couple of days...every time i walked in the elevator...they seem to not be able to know on what floor they work on. Here is a re-enactment. As i enter the elevator to reach my floor for my courses, other people enter the elevator too. My course is given on the last floor of the building. Me thinking: ok..so we're 10 people in the elevator...ahh that means we'll have to stop on 9 floors before i can reach my floor. As i observe the floors...i noticed that there were 14 floors light that were lighted.. me thinking: Hey....what gives...we're only 10...how can we stop on 14 floors :S..*sigh... Everyday was like that :S.... How sad...*sigh.  Even their YMCA is bureaucratic :S... me: Hi, i'm from out of town, but i'm a member of another YMCA...can i enter this YMCA too? YMCA clerk: well, if you present some ID, fill in this form and then i have to check with the database to see if it matches...you may. me: really? but i only have my hotel pass on me YMCA clerk: well actually if you have that it's fine too... me: ohh ok...cool YMCA: yeah, i was just kidding... me: yeah *chuckle... ...me 1 hour later leaving to the hotel.... me: hi. YMCA: hi...so can i help you me: can i have my hotel pass YMCA: no...! you have to fill the form B41. me: huh!??? *looking clueless YMCA: i'm just pulling your leg...i mean..i was just kidding me: ohh..sorry i'm kind of tired..i had a long day. YMCA: oh..*laughs.....well so you'Re from Montreal? cheer up...have a sense of humor... me: yeah...see what happens when you travel alone in a bureaucratic city...i feel like laughing all the time of course.... ok..i didn't really say that last one but..i was thinking about it.  Ottawa is nice..i mean it's really like a different version of Montreal with it's multi-ethnic city...and they have very similar places that Montreal has...though in a smaller scale.... Oh and i wonder where all the young people are...there are no young people nor kids downtown :S...I feel like it's GhostTown after 6.....i could get mugged and no one would even know...not even me :S  At least the market is nice...i was able to eat my lil panini with this guy playing some accordion...i felt like i was in Paris or something...living my lil life...like in the movies...then going for some desert in a place called "Oh So good"....they have all these amazing cakes... Heck they even have a Casino not too far away..well it's in Gatineau/Hull...but it's really in the same area :P like going to Notre-Dame island....you just need to cross the bridge...Literally.  But one thing for sure that i miss in Montreal...are the people...it's like always buying generic brands...you know you're meeting all these people..they are similar to the one's in Montreal..they all speak french and english...but..somehow...it's not the same as when you live all your life in Montreal..it's soo...not like the original....But..the weirdest thing i saw here..was a Paki guy working in a Japanese Restaurant and almost speaking with the japanese accent... -.-;;; i know...scary!!!
