Due to a birthday celebration on Monday night and a horrendous run Sunday, I cancelled my run Tuesday and decided to get back to morning running today.  It was great and much different than winter mornings.  My body was still just as tired and confused as far as why I was up so early and why the heck was I running but it woke up soon enough.  The temperature could not have been more perfect (perfecter?) considering I didn't even sweat until 10 minutes into the run.  As usual, the first 10 minutes was the hardest part of the run but it soon got better.  I could have used more sleep but my body felt good and my knees didn't hurt nearly as much as they usually have been.  Perhaps my ibuprofen diet mixed with consistent running is helping?  Who knows.  I covered another favorite shorter run through Twin Lakes park, Eden Park, and Mt. Adams.  It is very hilly, but very rewarding for the views and environment in which you run.  I either woke up all the other runners or it was just good timing in that, runners and walkers became more frequent throughout my run.  Go runners!  Enough for today, back tomorrow with another 4 miler or so.  For a final thought today, this is quite appropriate considering how I felt on some of the run today. Calm down, release your cares  The stale taste of recycled air  Have a great day!
