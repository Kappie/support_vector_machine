And since when is love obliged to any rules? Some say I'm running I know I'm falling back to you  Let's learn to give let's talk things out Let's give them someone else to talk about Some say I'm running But I know I'm falling back to you Martina Mcbride - Some Say I'm Running  well, you could consider me running.... running away from everything that is important to me. I don't think I can make a right decision... but then again, what is a right decision.  A decision that is made for yourself that seems to have the best outcome overall...  well, what happens if that outcome is not what you want but it is still the best decision?  how you may ask?? well, take for ex. a guy talking to a girl...  she has someone but she is flirting with you...  do you tell her how you feel about her and say hey, I like you and would like to kiss you.   just to get your feelings out there or do you keep your mouth shut and don't worry about it???  the best decision, I have chosen twice is not to say anything because they have someone.....  AAAAAHHHHHH, I just want to scream...   Especially my friend named Jen!  I love her to death and I couldn't picture being without her but she has told me several times in the past that there is no way we could ever date and then, the other night on the phone, she is sitting here telling me she has thought about us being together a couple of times....   what?? I don't quite understand??  Maybe it's because I am getting older and sooner or later, I am going to be what ladies want because I am the nice guy????  I don't quite understand it. Then, the is the two that got away. misty and stephanie....  man....  I can only assume that they aren't the ones I am suppose to be with ya know??  But, how do I know?? I thought I knew twice but....   ah well...  well, that was just me getting it out, thanks for listening. take care:) andrew
