Next time I'll just keep my mouth shut.  Oh, and of my 2 papers submitted to ISSRE 04, one was accepted and the other rejected. Since the conference acceptance rate was 1 in 3 (which seems high, to me), I guess my 50% is a good result. I now have to go back and work on both - the accepted one to get it ready for publication, and the rejected to make it more palatable for later submission.
