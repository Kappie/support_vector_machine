Here's a link to a  urlLink good article  summarizing why the Bush and Blair administrations are in a bit of trouble right now. I don't normally epouse the left of center views, and I'll punch you if you associate me with the green party. But this article is dead on why many people (both pro- and anti-war) are questioning whether they were misled.  Some are calling this scandal on a level not seen since Watergate. "What did the President know, and when did he know it?"
