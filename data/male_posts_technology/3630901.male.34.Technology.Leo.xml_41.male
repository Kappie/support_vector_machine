This is the first time I've been inspired in any way, about poetry, in the past 5 years.   S and I hit it off great this weekend.  I'll write more about it, maybe tonight.  But this total honesty thing is working out like I never believed.  I can talk to S about anything, and she can talk to me about anything.  I never experienced that before with anyone.  I have another date with her tonight, after work - go see Spiderman 2 then I'll take her to Bertucci's for dinner.
