As a matter of fact, I am so riled up about this, I am probably coming across as an uneducated redneck hillbilly.  What I would like to see is one, just ONE 'intellectual' actually point out all the negative traits that their pick has.  You know what the problem with that position?  It would require the person to see the truth.  Let us get a couple of 'truths' out in the open.  Kerry is about as trustworthy as a serial child molester being your babysitter.  Bush is about as competent as a kindergartener at rocket science.  This is the choice that we have in our next election.    Personally, I have no idea what either has for a platform.    Kerry has put more advertisements on t.v. than Bush.  However, he must think that people from WV are idiots as not a single thing has been said in them.  They are the 'feel good' type that say nothing about where he stands on issues.  Of course, if you could actually pin an issue on him other than LIBERAL, I will give you a cookie.  Doing some research on my own I have found that Kerry has voted for almost everything I support...  That being said, he has also voted against everything I support.    In the infamous (almost correct) words of Forrest Gump,  " John Kerry  is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get."   (substitution of  John Kerry  in place of  Life  is mine)  For each day that something new comes out about the Bush administration, I am astounded at the lack of leadership ability of the man in charge.  Sure we all knew that he wasn't the brightest bulb in the bunch by his speeches when he was first elected.  I would assume that someone at that level would know their weaknesses and surround themselves with people who were the best at their jobs.  Apparently, Bush did neither.  As for his platform... I dunno, raising money?  Bush = Gump
