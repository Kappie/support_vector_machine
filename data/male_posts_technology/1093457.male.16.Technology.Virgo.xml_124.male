If you havent already got a virus checker, you can download a good one off kazaa (like mine :), or I can copy mine to a cd for ya. (Norton Anti-Virus 2003). My fave guns'n'roses track is 'Dont Cry'. Kewl song. Heavy. I like almost everything 80's. Mostly the pop/rock part. New pop is just a loada bollox (capital fm, kiss, etc are rubbish. I listen to Virgin radio)
