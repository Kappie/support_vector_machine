We planned for a trek so as to return on Monday early morning....i.e. back to work in whatever shape.. ;-) We did succeed...and this blog will just tell you the experience during the trek.  Before I start, I would like to introduce the team. We were totally seven of us. Abhi, the leader of our pack...Gomes...the josh(enthu) machine...Major...actually a captain in the Indian Army...Mani...colleague, photographer of this trek and blogger..he introduced me to blogging....... ....Bharath...another colleague, huge guy..Viju...another colleague...the only girl in the pack..courageous one eh..!..finally me...RDX  Our route to the place from where we start our trek..was something like this....Bangalore to Belthangadi and from Belthangadi by Jeep to Navvur...which the ground zero for our trekking.  Just before we started off on our trek...we had to guarantee that we are not troubled by jignes(leeches)...atleast as less as possible. So...on guidance from the localites...we used the Hoge Soppu (tobacco leaves) as anklets and nashe(snuff) with oil also from shin downwards and shoe not spared. We didn't have much snuff so we had to do with how much ever was available.  We embarked our journey with two commoners (as directed by the forest dept). They were like the torch bearers at both ends. They suggested we use the roads...but we were insisting on beaten path and cutting across the valley. The very reason we tend to run away from the city is to be with nature...and roads are just transportation requirements or landmarks and not the preferred trek route.  Our target was ToLali where Lobo mane (Lobo's house) exists. It was about 10.5 kms from ground zero towards the peak...and yes...it was really tiring...atleast for that part of the pack who have nothing called exercise in their daily schedule. Unfortunately, I belong to that part and I obviously intend to change that.  So we were puffing and panting and needless to say sweating like a pig. We used to pause at quite a few points to ease our breathing and then resume. The best part of trek was waiting to be experienced...the visual beauty...the nature...in the best colour...green. I just can't find words and even if I manage...space would be scanty to express the nature. Perhaps all the great poets..and literary guys get their inspiration from such locations only. I forgot to mention the weather. It was wet, cloudy, sunny and rained whenever it felt like. Everything was highly welcome coz..pollution (air  noise) was miles away and we wanted to cherish every moment and every breath of clean and fresh air.  All along our route...we were struck by breath taking views...and suddenly something else caught our attention...well..we were hungry and Bharath couldn't take any longer I suppose. So we chose a place that was flatter than what we had seen earlier and upacked our lunches. The roof was the sky with cloud covers and then rain gods were involved in our lunch too...! After the sumptous mean we resumed our journey. We kept on encountering amazing scenaries en route. There was one mountain which we had in front of us. We actually didn't expect any mountain there to be so huge...so as to get lost in cloud cover. Well...when the clouds cleared occasionally, it was a breathtaking moment for all of us. We looked so very small...I was humbled actually. Such is nature I suppose...makes you know where you stand..in its view!!!  The team split into two midway with one leading the way coz. they were physically more fit and they also had to pitch a tent...just in case we couldn't house ourselves in Lobo mane. The unfit team followed them..of course led by on the commoners who were accompanying us. By the time we reached Lobo mane, we were dead exhausted. It was indeed a relief to see that place...!! We emptied a packet of Sunfill (what's that? ;-) Energy drink..just glucose with flavours).  Some of us were too tired to assist that part of the team which was pitching the tent. After half the work was done w.r.t the tent..an old guy came and asked us to move into the Lobo mane by paying Rs.20/- per head per day. Dirt cheap..!!!  Lobo mane has these special features...  - No electricity - No water inside...(we had water flowing nearby) - Firewood for making campfire to last for 3-4 days..!! - Obviously no furniture of any sort.  We settled easily into Lobo mane and got ready to get into warm and dry clothes. Later we cooked hot hot food and caught the very much needed sleep. The morning next day happend at around 7am for almost all of us. None of us wanted to get out of our blankets. Well, we had to go the peak and return to Lobo mane the same day. So, we forced ourselves into getting ready to move towards the peak. Had a small breakfast and set forth. We didn't carry all luggage...just a big bag that contained only necessary items and that was mainly food :-).  The journey was getting better with our progress. It was quite a tiring journey..but only for some distance. After a point, we were so used to the fatigue that we could drag ourselves forever it seemed. Well, the route was infested with Leeches in all closed and damp areas and we were basically running through in such areas. Btw, we still had the anklets around. We were lucky to spot a herd of sambar (stag family) grazing. I guess it noticed us however surreptious we tried to be....and was off on its feet. First time I got to see wildlife among my 3 Kudremukh treks till date. Excited I was but was too tired to enjoy that moment at that moment itself. Well...we carried on and reach a place were there were ruins of a church and close to it was a water point and we settled down there to prepare and have our lunch. It was a beautiful view from where we sat and lunched. Cold..very very cold water made our seating place a peninsula. We had a good meal and started towards the peak..Kudremukh. It was just a few minutes from there...route well inclined and covered with clouds.  I still remember the time we reached the peak...it was 1445hrs on 22nd of May 2004. It was a moment that gives so much satisfaction. Feels like, all your hardwork till now has paid off...and indeed it did. After digesting the awesome views from there, taking snaps etc.... all of a sudden 'common-pathy' struck us and we all decided at the same moment, we shall maintains silence and embrace the beauty of nature as peacefully as possible. Those few mintues were the best point of the trek. It was so peaceful...no sound of anything expecting wind blowing across with the cloud and the air was completely humid making it more like the perfect peace for penance...!!! What a moment...specially when you know that you are on the second highest peak in the state of Karnataka, India.  We reluctantly retreated our route and scanned another place near our lunch spot which was quite a scene...and Abhi was just dumbfounded...he was struck with awe with the place. I quite didn't understand what was so astounding there...but indeed..it was another peaceful place.  We then trekked back to Lobo Mane. It was a easy one this time...more so coz we were rejuvenated after the peak experience. We again freshened up and got into dry clothes and got ready for snacks and dinner.   The next day was a lot simpler than the previous 2 days. It was pretty easy and we found civilization along the valleys. This path is considered to be the most tread path for commoners and trekkers. We didn't have much fun until we reached the water point called Somavathy Falls. We got under the short falls and got our back aches eliminated for quite sometime to come. We also found, a jaara bande (slide) on the rocks with water and moss. We just have to place our butt and give a small push and joiiiiiii to fall into the small pool of water....no injuries at all....just fun. I hesitated initially but found it a lot of fun. Then there was another place where you can find two water holes next to each other separated by a ring like rock in such a way that a person can enter one hole use the ring and come out of the other. Awesome..!!!  Then, we had a heavy meal and started towards Samse(the other foothill). Reached Samse, almost drenched...and then caught a bus to reach Kottigere...then...a bus to Chikmagalur from Kottigere and another bus from Chikmagalur to Bangalore. We reached Bangalore at around 0500hrs and reached home in the next 1 hour and I was at my desk in office in the next 2.5 hours.  I shall post some snaps of this trek soon...  Looking forward to another amazing adventure experience...!!  (I took 3 breaks to blog this...have been quite busy... :-( )
