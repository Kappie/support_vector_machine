Yeah it's that cheap; my friend is pretty excited cos it means that he can go back every week to his hometown instead of like once a month by coach which takes like 8 hours. And the whole team were also thinking of going to KL for a couple of days to chill out next month so this will really save us some cash. The airline is probably gonna start next week. But don't know how they can still make a profit charging 15 bucks a person.  I have 2 really huge tasks due tommorow; I finished one of them but barely started on the other ....really need to learn how to multitask; gonna pull an all-nighter tonight.
