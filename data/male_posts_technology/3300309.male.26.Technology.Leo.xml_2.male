I'll also move over Dom's Zombie truck related postings to the new blog as well.  I would certainly recommend we all read 'Zombie Survivial Guide' by Max Brooks, it's currently out of print awaiting republishing in September but I suspect a few online bookstores as well as ebay will have it. You can also get an ebook of it from  urlLink www.palmdigitalmedia.com  for those with PDAs.
