First, that bunch of mewling whiner musicians using their celebrity status in an attempt to swing the vote,  urlLink aren't getting the response they expected.  Virtually every comment points out the irresponsible stupidity of the whole thing. Heh. Rock on.  And then,  urlLink this story  had me seething.   ''Morales, who is Catholic, was warned about eating pizza with meat the Muslim faith considered "unclean," Local 6 News reported. She was then fired for eating a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich, according to the report.   "Are you telling me they fired you because you had something with ham on it?" Local 6 News reporter Mike Holfeld asked.  "Yes," Morales said.    Holfeld asked, "A pizza and a BLT sandwich?"  " Yes," Morales said. ''   Sickening. I hope she successfully sues the hell out of them.
