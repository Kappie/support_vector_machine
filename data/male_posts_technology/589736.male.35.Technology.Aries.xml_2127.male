Wouldn't it serve you more to target people that might actually want to be in your group rather than those that absolutely don't want to be?  I know they will receive a higher number of virgins in the kingdom of god if they convert a true nonbeliever, but at what point do you cross the line from being zealous to being a public nuisance?!
