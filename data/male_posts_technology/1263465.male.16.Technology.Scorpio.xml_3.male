I finally figured out how to get the XML into Flash, so everything you see can be controlled dynamically through one XML file.  Also, all together in size it is only about 8kb.  Very quick to load.  Today is the Block final.  I think that it is stupid we have to stay for all three hours.  But, maybe it's just me...  I'll post and let the 2/3 period know what to expect.  All the reports from Monday were really vague.  Anyway, I got that job at the  urlLink College  that I wanted.  Yesterday I sent off my resum√© to  urlLink several   urlLink agencies  that  urlLink Brian  recommended, after saying that I couldn't work with him.  Oh well.  The job @ uni is great because they give me vacation time.    Peace.
