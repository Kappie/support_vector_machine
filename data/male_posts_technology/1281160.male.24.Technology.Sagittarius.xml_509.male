He can take wedding snaps, but cant be after us once the wedding is over na. Those which u feel like we have given pose are taken specially by a still photographer and we got it printed soon and brought it with us to Bangalore for our friends to have a look. but big album in which the entire event is covered is still @ Madurai.   Valli........ Madisar illa, just NorthIndian style. I like to drape my favourite outfit in this style. Coz it gives a rich look to the Silk sarees. Very often i tie sarees like this and it would make u look good, infact grand with very few jewels on you. So its a secret to reduce the weight of all those jewels but still look trendy and grand. U too can give a try. Its just the same as tieing ordinary saree but for paloo in the front.  Mahen did u see the snaps now? Ranjini
