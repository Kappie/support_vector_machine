I also played a little bit of   urlLink peasant's quest  , which I had already finished. Then I tried reading my textbook, failed miserably and then started drawing a nice pic of Harry Potter and one small characiture of myself. Since no one was calling I then browsed J.k. Rowling's personal website, which was pretty cool. I am glad the government has money to pay me to do this. I was considering banging my head on my desk for an hour or two but then thought that people might try and copy my "edginess", then banging your head on your desk wouldn't be just my "thing" anymore.  Oh well, time to go home.
