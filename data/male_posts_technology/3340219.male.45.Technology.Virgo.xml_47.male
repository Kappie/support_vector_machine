Make sure that there are    not multiple views and goals (e.g., 25% cost reduction in WAN    bandwidth by Dec. 27) both within your organization, and between    you and the lines of business you're supporting. All too often    there are different versions of project objectives floating    around. At the same time, make sure you are clear on which    business services are affected by the change, and how.  * Clarify organizational and process needs. For instance, you    can't do data center consolidation right if you don't understand    the relationship between that project and your WAN performance.    Applications and services perform across an ocean of    interdependencies. That also means checking your organizational    processes and tuning them for superior collaboration - so that    in this case the NOC and the data center can work as a    collaborative team, not as finger-pointing adversaries.  * Audit. This is one of the scarier but more profound    requirements for "doing it right." You need to follow up the    implied "IT process audit" above and then document what the    infrastructure is, what your service-level agreements are with    external providers, what your SLAs are with internal and    external customers, and what management tools are in place to    support the project at hand. If you do this right, you'll    discover many surprises in all areas - unless of course you're    one of the very few organizations that took the time to get all    this right before. I'll also bet that you discover tool sets    with conflicting information used by different IT groups to    blame each other for problems.  * Baseline, analyze and plan. We're into more normal territory    here, and while there's a lot to say about this phase, I'll    focus on only two things. A real baseline means understanding    quality of experience, which is complex - including not only    availability and responsiveness, but also flexibility,    cost-effectiveness, appropriateness, and other metrics. Planning    also means understanding usage patterns and trying to get at the    hows and whys of service behavior before embarking on the    if-then tradeoffs for optimizing infrastructure.  * Establish and promote. Once your plan is solid, communicate it    - within your organization and externally to your customers.    Believe it or not, planned change is a good time to build    rapport with your customers and promote your value to the    business.  * Deploy and validate. The key thing here is to proceed in    stages and to validate as you go. It's also important to note    that before embarking on this stage, you should already have    worked out timing for any changes to SLAs and contracts with    external service providers.  * Reassess and begin again. Change is ongoing. If your WAN    rightsizing project has gone well, for instance, something new    is likely to be demanded. Rather than wait to be kicked from    behind, look proactively to, as the expression goes, "make    change your friend" in providing better services for your    clients.
