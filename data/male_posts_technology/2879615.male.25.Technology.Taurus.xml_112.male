Sachs was there being self confident with the Dave, who found the strength to kind of ask me out on a date. A date?! I havn't been on a date in years; its kind of...nice. haha. So it was a good ole time at Silly old Slocums. Holla at Licky for confusing the HELL out of my stoned ass. hahaha. Umm nothing else really happened except I got drunk (but who didn't see that coming?) Umm the MM is iming Yast...gotta go.  I want to make out.   Smashy  PS can we discuss me and yast pointing at pedestrians in New Hope today? Bwahhahaha
