The road is now open for two seats to be filled at Williams in 2005.   With such limited talent available, Villenueve is the only proven talent remaining.   The machinations of Patrick Head are only to reinforce the prior blog entry, that the M. Schumacher sycophants Eccelstone and Mosely pay for the Canadians substantial $35 million annual salary.
