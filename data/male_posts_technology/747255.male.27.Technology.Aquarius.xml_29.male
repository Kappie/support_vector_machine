Realized I forgot to put my jeans in the drier last night so I'm waiting for them to finish now. It was such a wimpy storm though... it had started raining pretty hard a little while before the strike and I remember we both woke up... Angie looked over at me and asked if windows were open on anything... nope... and then a few minutes or something later KA-BOOM!!!! I think the flash and boom were so big it interrupted time or something. We both sprung up from the bed without bending at the waist! I ran to the window to make sure nothing blew up or was on fire and Ang went and grabbed Lauren. The next step would usually be head to the basement and check the weather from there but as we're in a 3rd floor apartment....  But since I was looking out the window I realized there was virtually no wind and no other lightning... a stray bolt I guess... but it was friggin huge. I wonder what it hit. Haven't been outside to look around yet. Every damn alarm in the parking lot was chirping, beeping, wailing, whatever... It looked like a carnival with all the lights. I sure could use a funnel cake about now.
