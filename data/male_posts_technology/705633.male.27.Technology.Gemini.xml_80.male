I have a superman style triangle of sunburn on my chest, my throat is sore, my stomach has threatened to go on strike and move into a Vegan if I so much as LOOK another fajita in the eye.  As Kirk said during our trip, wherever you go in the world.... there's stupidity:                                                            Also from today's Inbox..  Moods of a Women... (Sent in by Don P)    An angel of truth and a dream of fiction, A Women is a bundle of contradiction.    She's afraid of a wasp, will scream at a mouse, But will tackle her boyfriend alone in the house.    Sour as vinegar, sweet as a rose, She'll kiss you one minute, then turn up her nose.    She'll win you in rage, enchant you in silk, She'll be stronger than Brandy, milder than milk.    At times she'll be vengeful, merry and sad, She'll hate you like poison and love you like mad.    Moods of a Man...    Horny Sleepy Hungry
