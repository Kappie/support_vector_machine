I guess even they can't pass up free software. In other news, last night was wonderful for a little jog, with a big full moon, and temperatures in the mid 70's!  Unfortunately the Caldwell Natives were out in force.  One car full of them even managed to pool their intelligence enough to come up with "run forest run" which they hurled out of their window at me.  About 3/4 a mile later I got harassed by a pack of un-chained, un-fenced dogs, so I went home.  I still haven't decided which group was more intelligent, but I'm leaning towards the dogs. p.s. If anyone can explain why Idaho hicks dislike joggers and bicyclists so much that would be great.
