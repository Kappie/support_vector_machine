I like football when it's the World Cup and stuff, cos of the massive levels of patriotism, which is cool.... I've been trying to work out what it is about football that makes it our country's most popular sports..... anyone help me on that one?  Anyway, on a more academic note, last exam today, Drama, then a rehearsal for the Tempest, and then FREEDOM!!! .... until tomorrow that is
