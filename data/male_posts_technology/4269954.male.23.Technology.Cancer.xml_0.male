At 10:10am EST, it spiked to $20.90 and automatically sold.  Also, since I made such a great gain on PRGS, I decided to lower my limit order on WB... it sold at 10:45am EST for $46.14.   Today's Percentage Gain On Investments: 2.145%   Overall Balance: $26,188.25   Overall Gain On Total Investments: 4.753%   Average Days Per Trade: 1.33     So, after 6 trading days, I've scored a overall 4.753% gain on my investment.  In a regular savings account at Bank of America, the APR is 0.75%.  That means if you would have put your $25000 in 6  years  ago... you'd have the same return as my experiment.  Booyah.  -Bo
