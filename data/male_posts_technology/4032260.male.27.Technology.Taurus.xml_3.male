(Philippians 1:9)  I read this passage about a week and a half ago and I've been gearing my devos around this subject. Here are my thoughts...  Over and over in the Bible we are reminded to "love God" and to "love one another". This verse in Phillipians changed my perspective a little bit. The apostle Paul is praying that the Philippian's love will grow in knowledge and discernment. This tells me that it is preferable to love  smartly  rather than  blindly .   So what does it mean to "love smartly"? It means that we have a goal to our love. We have a purpose for loving. That purpose (as Paul summarizes in v. 11) is to glorify and praise God.  Paul lists four direct results of the union of love with knowledge: 1. Ability to approve the things that are excellent. 2. Sincerety 3. Be without offense 4. Be filled with the fruits of righteousness  So what applications can we draw from this? Suppose a Christian brother comes up to you and says that he very hungry but he has no money to buy food. What is the loving thing to do?  Up to this point, my default " loving " answer would be: "give him some food/money". It's quick, easy, and when I'm done I can walk away feeling quite righteous because of my unselfish charity.  However, if I were to love smartly my actions would differ depending the specific situation. Remember that my goal is to glorify God. We know that God desires His servants to be good stewards of what He has given us (time, resources, etc). If it turns out that this brother is just lazy and jumping from charity to charity getting free meals and squandering the money he receives, then the loving thing to do would be to confront him and point out his hypocrisy. I would even say that the loving thing may be to let him spend a day or two without food in order to shake him up and get him serious about his responsibilties.  Bear in mind however, the story of the prodigal son. If he repents of his ways then we are to forgive and restore him. (Repentance of the mind is reflected in the walk and is different than merely repenting of words.)  I'll try to keep you posted on additional thoughts and corroborating verses...
