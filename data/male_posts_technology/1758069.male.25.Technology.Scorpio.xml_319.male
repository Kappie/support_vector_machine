'tis happy hour roundye olde household and the lord of the manor, whom i pretend is i, 'tis frothy. and pissed. and feeling quite unappreciated. yes, unappreciated. and perhaps a bit lacking in an internal synonym database (unappreciated? anyone? anyone? beuller? beuller? beuller?).    when i look at all the male rock icons i hold in the highest esteem, i think of my opposite. on female artists - why do i think at all.    oh yes indeed it'stime to do the weekend wax-poetic... a verse for the masses:    the ragingburns like chinese torture  sensible like irish murder  headache as our native sons'  werevel and squeal in bloodspurts of kin  we deservewhat is ours
