Okay okay ...my eyes are lusting after another...must clean my eyes...i can't stop thinking about her...help me..  Hehe...my preference to own a Maton have been changed into Garrison...both from the reviews and me trying hands on with it in Mahogany..still waiting for the price quotes from them.It comes with a hard case as well.. BTW , this are guitars...I started wanting to own a Taylors and then later Maton but with my current work and ability to save some money, I now wanted to own a Garrison, especially the review in the Star 440Khz caught my eyes. hehe Now I will plan my budget and a bit kiam siap for let  see....a few months ...hahah my new year resolution.  Okay okay i am supposed not to be covetting...but hey i want a nice guitar...but of course given 2 choices if God were to bless me with a girlfren , well to the heck with the guitar...but currently...a guitar will do.  Okay okay back to the more serious side...my new year resolution is made up ...of course with the recent inclusion to own a Garrison...yeah that is to follow the seven 'nevers' that is preached by Ps Chew 's sermon about Joshua's 2 Key of Success.. In a nutshell, Fear God and Serve Him Faithfully.  All in all , I am ready for 2004 to CONNECT, RELATE AND RESONATE  FAITH OF JESUS CHRIST and the tag line is FEAR GOD AND SERVE HIM FAITHFULLY.  Not bad huh?  I am supposed to list down the seven "nevers" preached by Ps Chew to share with those regulars who are not from SIB KL.but now i am blogging in my workplace...so tomorrow loh  Ok got to work .... May the Grace of God of our Father, The Son and the Fellowship of Our Holy Spirit be with you until we meet again.  Fellow JesusFreak Joshua Tan
