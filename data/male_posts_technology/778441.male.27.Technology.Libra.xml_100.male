How would you like feast on  Kesaria Badam Shorba, Jhinga Samarkand, Gosht Korma Rampuri, Dal Dera Ismail Khan, Pista Murg, Aloo Methi, Subzi Peshawari, Raan Alishan, Kandh Kebabs, Kela Kebabs, Pista Paneer, Mushroom Korma, Pudina Parantha, Naan  and  Mutter Pulao . And then follow it up with sinful dessert delicacies like  Muzaffar Sewaian, Badam Phirni  and  Lemon Souffle .  Liked the sound of that menu?! ... Well, if you did, then you should have been present, yesterday evening, at the private dinner hosted by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the honour of visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin and his wife Lyudmila.  Just reading through that menu made my mouth water like an open tap! ... I could just barely manage to keep myself from drooling all over the keyboard!! ;-)  What say!?  cheers!
