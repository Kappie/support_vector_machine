IBM is alleged to have used Unix code in AIX 5L that SCO had licensed to IBM for 'Project Monterey,' an effort to build a version of Unix for Intel's Itanium processor. IBM dropped Project Monterey in 2001 in favour of Linux, but SCO has discovered e-mail that purports to show that IBM used code licensed from SCO for Project Monterey in the development of AIX 5L without a separate licence. Forbes.com first reported the allegations, attributing them to remarks made by SCO chief executive Darl McBride earlier this week on the sidelines of the company's annual user conference. A representative of SCO declined to comment, and IBM has yet to respond to invitations to comment."
