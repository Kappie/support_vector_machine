I posted a comment, but I found I misread the article after finding the story on AP (it was the pronouns!! I swear!)  My comments notwithstanding, the other commenters are sharing a great theme. IF you are 18 years old with three kids, it's time to change your life. Hell, please feel free to do so beforehand, perhaps after the second child is born. You may want to STOP spending time with the illegal immigrant (this label carries little water, but it's worth mentioning) drug-addled, armed man who you just recently filed assault papers against. If anything, this may serve as a horrible example of the repercussions of associating with said persons.   I don't like to use second-hand opinions, but the ideas of Bill O'Reilly's book (WLOFY) are ringing in my head. To paraphrase, he says surround yourself with people who are in a position to help you out, who care for your well-being. If you are associated with people who do themselves harm, you are putting yourself into a position to be harmed. A lot of blame can be assessed in this situation; immigration and law enforcement for not deporting/jailing this scumbag, family services for not righting this girl (first child born at  fifteen  years old), the war on drugs, the war on gas (see comments on Michelle's blog), assumed lousy/non-existent parents of the girl, etc. But the blame falls on poor choices by this woman influenced by a seedy environment.   What will it take until teens can see the connection of piss poor behavior with  incidents  tragedies? This sign on the Washington highway perhaps as a chilling reminder:     I know people like to use the sign builder in a more light-hearted manner, but my disgust at child tragedy coupled with my common sense head slapping is going to sometimes call for a sign. No morbid feelings intended.
