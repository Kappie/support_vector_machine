Not that I ever go out in london when I'm here as I always always get lost and end up asking some nice old lady directions just to find she has sent me in completely the wrong direction! I can almost see the blue rinse bi@tch laughing as I turn the corner.  I am currently sat in a trainning room learning about Supporting windows XP Not the hardest thing in the world its more like a holiday to me!!  But I have been put up in an amazing hotel "Thistle Hotel Tower" from my window I can see the Tower of London, Tower Bridge and the Thames its awsome!! and its all payed for by the bank.  Well better carry on the course Hope to be back by Friday night
