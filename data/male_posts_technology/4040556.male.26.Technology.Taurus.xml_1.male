It is a very thought provoking flick, and I would suggest it to anyone who is interested in the meaning of life, and learning how to live it to the fullest potential.  What the Bleep could be considered a hybrid-documentary, half of the movie is interviews and blurbs from some really smart people discussing Quantum Physics, the power of the human brain, and the nature of the universe, while the other half of the movie is a more standard story format following the main character on her journey of self-discovery and awareness.  One idea or suggestion that I liked from the movie, was when you wake up in the morning, "Make your day," by deciding what you want to do during the day, and then throughout the day taking notice of small happenings that are caused by us as observers creating reality. By creating and training our neural networks in this way, our brains will more-easily accept the idea that we can shape or even create our own realities.
