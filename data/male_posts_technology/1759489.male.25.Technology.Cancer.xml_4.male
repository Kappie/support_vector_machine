I saw  urlLink  Fahrenheit 9/11  a few days ago.  It was a little more gruesome than I expected it to be -- death, bodies, blood, and arms without skin resembling something off of the Terminator.  Moore chose to black out the World Trade Tower's collapse only to follow it with numerous gut-wrenchingly bloody scenes; I think I missed the point of this.  The documentary did, however, lower my perception of Bush from a dirt-bag to an oil-whore faster than the Patriot act could be passed through congress.  I suppose Moore wins then.      Speaking of the Patriot act, some poor artist in the States was  urlLink accused of bio-terrorism  after his wife died of a cardiac arrest.  Seems his art supplies had some bacteria on them.    For Canada day I went into the mountains.  It was a very Irish day with alternating rain and sun.  We watched the yearly Canada day parade in Canmore, which featured the first ever streaker in the parade.  We also went for a hike in Banff around the coal mining ghost town of  urlLink Bankhead .
