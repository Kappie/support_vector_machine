Of course, I'm stress-testing my PC (so it will be on all week long), but is it really better to leave on your PC 24 hours, 7 days a week?  The opposite side says "there's nothing wrong with doing that." PCs are suppose to be on 24/7 and they would (I guess) last longer than one that was constantly being shutdown and restarted. I do not know the facts or validity of this claim, but it got me thinking. There are certain advantages when a computer is left on. First, you can download as much as you want (which is pretty much a given). Second, you don't have to wat for the computer to startup (then again, my computer in it's current configuration starts up within 20 seconds). Supposedly, when you turn on a PC, just like a light bulb that fries out during it's last days, power rushes through all the components in nano-seconds. If this is done constantly (everyday I suppose), then computer components will not last very long.  Now the disadvantages. I'm sure I will have to install Norton Anti-Virus software if I'm leaving this thing on all the time. Consequently, I will be subject to more danger that our glorious intarweb dispenses. Second, I have a shuttle for a PC. Shuttle XPCs are, for lack of a better phrase, freakin loud. The goddamn fan sounds like a jet engine. The good thing is that I still get good sleep despite this noise.   So what is the verdict? To leave it on or off all week long? I have doubts about the internal components slowly frying themselves from the heat inside the shuttle. I will probably have to research better ways to cooling if I plan to keep this up and have my computer last a long time.
