Talk about overpriced so-called ‘designer’ tat!  I’m told by much younger people that this is supposed to look trendy and ‘with it’. In my opinion it looks neither! This is just another example of how the very fabric of our society is being eaten away by ‘yob culture’. If you told these people to wear a uniform they would say they are being oppressed, however by dressing the same are they not also wearing a uniform? Why on earth they would want to dress in the way they do beats me.  The very same youngsters (because not all of them are like this, just the lot that you see around the streets) behave in an appalling manner and always appear in ‘gangs’. I wonder if the baseball caps are to disguise them from the CCTV cameras? It’s funny, as all the kids you see in the local paper with Anti-Social Behaviour Orders against them all wear baseball caps!  Why the need for the designer labels, its not something I craved whilst a teenager in the 80’s and that was a ‘have now’ society. Do we as parents give our kids these things to make up for our own lack of spending quality time with the kids and expect money to be the answer.  Perhaps we are now reaping what we have sown all these years by letting the ‘little’ things slide so in the end society collapses in on itself as it reaches critical mass.    Beware the big bang!
