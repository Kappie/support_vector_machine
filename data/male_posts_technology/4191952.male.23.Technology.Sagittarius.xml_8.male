Call me an attention whore, I don’t care…I bet you don’t think I’ll run around naked…mwahahahaha…err…never mind.  I think being a musician has helped me appreciate music so much more than I did before. I’ve gone through so many different styles of music they were bound to all form a melting pot of music for my ears. Anyhow…I admittedly confessed to listening to “The Humpty Song, Baby Got Back, Daisy Dukes,” and basically anything remotely sounding like that…like a poser listening to good Charlotte and acting like it’s good, I stomached these songs like a tapeworm. The funny thing was, I started out on Iron Maiden at the age of 9…hmmm…80’s metal….what’s a good follow up to that? I know, awful ass music that should be buried alongside the landfill of “E.T, the extra terrestrial” Atari console games…so, I had a small moment of bad musical taste…  I suppose I could have quietly just written down my favorite songs and would have been just as funny as me babbling, but I’m bored…so shut up. Here’s a nice rundown of my top 20 songs of happiness.  20. Gone for Good –  Jonathan Sheldon  – Ex-Front-man of Naked 19. Learning to Breathe -  urlLink Switchfoot  18. Like a Child –  urlLink Zac Maloy  17. A Favor House Atlantic –  urlLink Coheed and Cambria  16. You Know You’re Right – Nirvana (RIP) 15. Raining on the Sky – Naked (RIP) 14. Asteroid -  urlLink Edgewater  13. Wish –  urlLink Bob Schneider  12. Hear You Me –  urlLink Jimmy Eat World  11. Fifteen Stories (Live Through This) – Mighty Joe Plum (RIP) 10. Devil in Jersey City –  urlLink Coheed and Cambria  9. Duane Joseph –  urlLink The Juliana Theory  8. The Somebody Else is Me –  Jonathan Sheldon  7. Shine – The Nixons (RIP) 6. Ten Million Years –  urlLink Black Lab  5. Don’t Cry – The Nixons (RIP) 4. San Pedro – Dollybraid (RIP) 3. Everlong –  urlLink Foo Fighters  2. Sister – The Nixons (RIP) 1. Time Ago -  urlLink Black Lab   I don’t think they’re even in that great of order, but I have ADD, so this was typed up in Outlook over a few hours and then posted into my blog. I do beleive I'll end up filling all my space in a matter of days...  Enjoy
