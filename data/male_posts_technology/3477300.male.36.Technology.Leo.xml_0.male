I was the one up walking it this morning. I can see I'm going to have to get used to picking up dog poo too. I've not had to do it yet, but somehow, I know it's going to be my job.      I always see those people walking 'their' dog - little shovel in hand - and I always think Who exactly is the boss of who. Anyone who's picking up poo can't really be the master can they?      Anyway, that person's me now.
