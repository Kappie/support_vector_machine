    
       Was officially the COOLEST FUCKING DAY ever. Blake, his brother, Ashley Sullivan and I all went up to Dixon res. to fish. Well, about 3:43 hours in, I decide to walk up to Kelly's. It's only about a mile or so. It was a really good walk. I walked across the street in front of where she lives, and call her to tell her, "Open your front door."  SO, SHE DID. In about the time it took me to get to her driveway. I think she was sorta kinda suprised. Turns out, we're (Blake and I) are insane. (Maybe because Blake was fishing with pudding. That was fun, though.) KEL, I WISH YOU COULD HAVE COME. YOU WOULD HAVE LOVED THE INSANITY.  ALSO: THIS FRIDAY: The plan is to GO CAMPING AT HORSETOOTH!! (FULL CAPACITY!!)  -beej
