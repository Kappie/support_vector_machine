You maybe a person who is strict, following the rules and if someone is irregular in his work, you fire that person. You begin to think everything should be perfect only then you live a life worth living.      But is that true? Should everything in this world, every action you do, every place you see be perfect. That was not the ultimate creator's plan. Let's take an example. You go for a vacation in some hill station. You go to the viewing point and look at the hill ranges. Its a beauty you think. What if the hills were perfect, is that, some rectangular, some triangular etc.. You would not prefer a sight like this. Now what makes you generate the thought that you do not like perfect objects in the world. There is a sense of feeling in our mind that reminds you of getting bored of similar, continuos and perfect things in Life. Perfection comes out when you expect something to be the way and imperfection boils up when the particular action or thing does not meet the expectation or the image you have in your mind. If you are slightly imperfect that means you have learning more. How was your reaction when first saw the diagram of a circle. You would have complained, why its not rectangular and not perfect...but internally you have learned something being imperfect and you would have really loved the diagram because its your first time and first time is always beautiful.      Another thought...The next time you meet a person, try to be perfect...try to be a person who follows etiquettes by the rules. Your guest might hate you of being perfect and monotonous. Why? Because they want to see something different. That is the whole psychology behind the idea of not being perfect completely. If you are, then there is no difference between you and the robot. GOD has made nature not 100% perfect. GOD has made a world filled with wonderful things like Human beings, Animals, Trees, mountains, great seas, cool places and the like. He has not made it perfect, but that does not mean the creator is clumsy...the creator has done this with a reason.       Why do you visit so many places around the world, Why do you explore unknown things, Why are trees and leaves not same across the world and why do you behave in a different way every other day? Imperfection brings a sense of not being a repetitive. If you behave the same way every day then you are titled as "not an interesting person". Take the example of "The Leaning Tower of Pisa". Will people visit the tower if it would not have been tilted a little? I think now you are trying to realize something. Perfection does not always lead you to a great Life. Well it may give you a high and respected life but it will not be exciting. That's what people talk about...the excitement of experiencing which is out of the normal, which your brain has never conceived before.       This brings us to another sub-discussion. Imagine you are given a Leaf which is, say, yellowish green and you are put the statement  (A) "Is the Leaf, Green or not?". If you are a perfect guy then you would say green, since it should be either green or yellow. That's how computers work, right...its base on 1s and 0s, true or false. Well that is perfect.  What would a normal guy with a tinge of imperfection do? He would say that the "Degree to which the leaf is green must be somewhere between 0.4 and 0.6?". Which means that the degree to which the statement (A) is true depends on a certain factor which determines how much its true or false. Well computers cannot do such reasoning because they are so perfect and we have the ability to think "FUZZY". In other words this imperfection was the foundation of "FUZZY LOGIC".       Lets come back to the less technical discussion.The point where both Imperfection and Beauty merges is seen here. The thing or sight you call beauty wouldn't be perfect...you would think it is perfect but it isn't. Because its the first time you see it and you never saw anything like that before, then it has a tinge of imperfection, as perfect things are already witnessed. There wouldn't be that variety, there wouldn't be that spice and there wouldn't be that sense of enjoyment in the Life you live.      So what message I am trying to convey is that don't expect everything, every event, every being and every action you do to be perfect. Its always okay to be a little imperfect. This gives you a oppurtunity to live a life full of surprises, to meet lot of interesting people, to visit lot of interesting places and a Life where you could do a lot interesting things.  Such is the beauty of imperfection.
