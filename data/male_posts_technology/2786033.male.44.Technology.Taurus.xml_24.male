I'm confident that free market/free mind/limited government individuals will always have the majorities and guns necessary to illuminate the earth, So I'm never really strident about any particular instance of asshattedness.    I'm also having too much fun finishing the yard and looking after Mrs. EU.  Well, as long as blogger doesn't charge me or drop me,  I promise to be as sporadic as I currently am.
