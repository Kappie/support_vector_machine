Most people think you're ineffective, but you are trying to    completely save the world from itself, so there's always going to be a long    way to go. You're always the one trying to get friends to talk to each    other, enemies to talk to each other, anyone who can to just talk instead of    beating each other about the head and torso. Sometimes it works and sometimes    it doesn't, and you get very schizophrenic as a result. But your heart    is in the right place, and sometimes also in New York.
