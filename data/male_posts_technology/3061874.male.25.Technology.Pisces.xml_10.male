But its just now it has started having a ripple effect. Even though technology behind might not be complex, but its merely the simplicity that makes it tick.  I favor the fact that technology has to made more accessible to people rather then people changing their ways to adapt to technology. There might be cases when we humans need to adjust to technology but where ever possible technology should try to seamlessly fit in an individual's life.  Its the simplicity of a technology which makes it appealing to the masses and we as technologists, entrepreneurs need to understand this fact more closely. In technology world, people often talk about having built complex systems but unless one can't simplify the complexity, one is still living in a complex world. The essence is to build systems doing complex tasks in a simple way.   We have moved from the world of huge mainframes, to workstations and now into smart phones. And with each move the number of people getting affected are much larger. The difference between simplicity and complexity will play a much bigger role in the coming world of nanotechnologies. What we need is to understand technology in relation to the way we work, use them in a simple and effective manner - which can then have a far reaching effect on our lives.
