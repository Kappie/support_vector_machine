COMFORT  Of all sadness there is none like this Far from bliss or happiness The world all around is closing in Turn around and see  It will never be the same again All anguish and sorrow and grief  Fall upon me as I try to leaf Through this book called the Pages of My Life  Necessity befalls me to throw on my burden Bear it as light, And amidst it all, prepare to fight or flee This coming darkness The true flame That again, shall imprison me. As I begin to burn, you need not think Of sorrow or grief, amidst the roar  For comfort this flame brings Compared to the pain felt before.  Good Night
