You can't just force me to go to some website. Explain yourself.   OK, OK, I'll explain before you go. It's a letter of opposition to the UN and the EU to show the worldwide support for the Israeli security fence. Basically, you're signing a piece of paper (along with millions of others) that says the fence should stay, after Israel makes some adjustments to ease *insert CNNReutersNYTQuotemark* Palestinian hardship *end CNNReutersNYTQuotemark* (Hardship? Such as the difficulty the fence imposes to get a suicide bomber even  near   a bus?)  I've told you enough. Go now, then return to post a comment or two.   Please?
