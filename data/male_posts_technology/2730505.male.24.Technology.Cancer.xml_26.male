He said that the engine was better than new, although I think it's just a line, it's good to know that it has a warranty added to the factory so everything is cool.  They're just going to put new oil in, start it up let it run for a while, take it to the detail shop have her all clean and we're ready to rock and roll!  Hell yeah!  I get my dildo shifter back tomorrow!
