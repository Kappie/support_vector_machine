But after I woke up from an afternoon nap, it seemed to have gotten so swollen and stight that I can barely keep it open. It feels so tensed and I'm not sure how I can relax it. Medication don't seem to be helping so I dare not apply anymore. It gets so tight now that tears can't flow out freely and I gotta use my fingers to keep my eye lids open while my eyes tear. Will be seeing the specialist tomorrow and I hope there'll be good news or a change in medication.  I hope no extension of mc is required coz I'd hate to make someone from camp takeover my sat duty. I also hope I won't need to be warded after that either. Really hope there'll be some good news tommorow. I doubt I can meet up with Marcus, Ivy and baby Zelda at the airport on Wed morning if my condition persists.
