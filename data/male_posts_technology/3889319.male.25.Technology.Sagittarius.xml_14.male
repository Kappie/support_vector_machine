Anyway, as always, I'm not able to understand any of these laws! Some are tending to contradict to each others, some are pointless, some are lacking the ability of enforcement and for all the rest, I never knew they exist!!  I.e: there is one law that "alleges" to keep the detective discreet by preventing them from mentioning there profession in their resume! Another prohibit citizens to insult a public/ governmental personality (policeman..) in public! Why the hell not. SHUT UP.
