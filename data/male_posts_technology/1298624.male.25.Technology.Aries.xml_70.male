It doesn't have to be a specific person calling, I basically know who calls the helpdesk all the time. Sometimes there are those people who just irk you. It's like they LOVE being idiotic and delight in making your day a living hell. If there's anything that pisses me off more, it's stupidity and ignorance.   First of all, if you're an employee of this most prestigious company, wouldn't you think that others would learn how to work with the machines that they use every freakin day?! Come on! It's not that hard to change a freakin password on the network! Shit, it's not even that hard to think of a password that you would remember! How come HR doesn't screen these people before hiring them?  "Do you have the ability to make your own passwords?"  "Uhm...well...I'm not certified, but..."  "Uh okay, we'll keep your resume on file and call you later."  That's how it should be. People who cannot make their own passwords and/or complain that they should keep the password they make forever and ever should be charged $5.00 for everytime they forget their stinkin password. I don't care if you don't know what to put for a freakin password! Think of something! Ooooh! Wow! There's an idea! Let's think of a word that you could remember day in and day out as you work at your cubicle for nearly all of your pathetic life. You don't think you would remember the single most important word that would enable you to make money and provide for your children, buy the things you want or pay a freakin mortgage bill!   *sigh* But of course, with the Security department, they charge employees $10.00 for a replacement of their lost badge. I say that's fair. The security of a password that you choose to access private company information should be held at the highest regard and careful scrutiny. It's company information! I would think that if this company held it's information priceless, then it would deem strict and financially punishing rules to enforce people to NEVER forget their passwords. I wonder if banks do the same thing if people forget their PINs.  But, oh well. People will forget and we will fix it. These people become lazy with the knowledge that they can depend on us to freakin change and/or unlock their password/account. Pisses me off.
