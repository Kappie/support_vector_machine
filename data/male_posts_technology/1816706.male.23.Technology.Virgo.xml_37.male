The good news is, I should be moving into a duplex with someone I work with tomorrow, so hopefully this is the last sliver of homelessness for a while.  The only thing I don't really mind about it is that I can cary everything I own on my back, or in the trunk of my car, so it's not that big of a deal.  I start Japanese classes this Saturday too so that'll be interesting.  I think I have also come to the realization that this isn't where I will stay indefinately.  Right now, a few people are planning on coming to visit me in the upcoming months (c00l!)  I also have a slight commitment to people at work.  But the more I thought about it, and after having finished this Neil Young biography, I feel even stronger about the "do whatever the hell makes you happy" idea.  Yeah I might piss some people off along the way, but you gotta make yourself happy first.  My job, while great for learning, is big time stress, I work probably about 60 hours a week now, and the pay just isn't worth it anymore.  I am thinking about taking up a 2nd job so I can save money, and come say Christmas time, cause I figure that's as good a time as any, I might be headin outta here.  Talking with my room mate last night, it looks like New Zealand is gonna be the next place.  Why the hell not right?  We'll see.  It strikes me as odd though, kinda funny.  I felt like I was stuck here this weekend, kinda like, what the hell am I gonna do.  Then I thought for a little while (long while) and remembered that there's nothing tying me down here, nothing I have to do.  And shit, I'm still enjoying Hawaii on the weekends.  Hoping to do another cool hike this coming weekend if I get some time.  But this girl room mate I had from Canada, great girl, friendly as hell.  She had been gone about 3 weeks and wanted to go back to Canada.  Makes me sad really.  By now she is in Australia and will be there the next 9 months.  I don't think it will be long before she realizes how much she loves it.  And even if she doesn't, you know how much she'll get out of it, how much experience she will get and how much she will grow?!?!  Unbelivable.  So those of you sitting at home tired of the same ol shit, go out and get a second job, or shit hitchhike across the U.S. to wherever you wanna live.  How cool would that be???  I think I might do that sometime.  Hitch hike to TX from California.  What a story!  You're not stuck wherever you are, you can pack your stuff, and just leave.  Do whatever you think is right, I bet you'll find the right direction.  I think my new modo is "just wing it."
