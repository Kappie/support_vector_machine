 I had a Timex " urlLink Internet Messenger " powered by Yahoo! using the SkyTel network. At first I really liked it, but it didn't always work as advertised. A lot of the time the messages would come in gibberish, plus the actual Timex watch kept loosing power regardless if I changed the battery. I like the idea as long as it works as advertised, after all I always have my watch near me, unlike my mobile phone. You can also  urlLink check out some other brands of watches  using SPOT.
