Although that's larger than the minute 376 bytes used by SQLSlammer, “the difference is really trivial,” Huger said.   Not only might such a worm spread faster than Slammer, its damage could significantly outweigh Slammer's damage, for it would have a much greater number of potential targets. The Windows Messenger Service vulnerability exists not just in enterprise machines -- as with Slammer -- but also countless home computers running Windows.
