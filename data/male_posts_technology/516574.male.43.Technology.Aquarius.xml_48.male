False - I voted for Bill the first time he ran; I've probably voted for other Dems as well, since I don't vote by party: my strategy in the booth is mostly based on the theory "If you're an incumbent, you had your chance - buh-bye..."   2. I think my taxes are too high.  Sure, doesn't everyone?...   3. I supported Bill Clinton's impeachment.  No (although I did wish Paula Jones had trained more seriously for her Celebrity Boxing match with Tonya Harding...)   4. I voted for President Bush in 2000.  No, didn't vote -- period...   5. I am a gun owner.  Not at present (unless J's hiding one from me); used to have a BB gun when I was younger, though...   6. I support school voucher programs.  No (but then, I don't actively oppose them as a whole, either -- this topic would probably fall under the heading of evaluating the particulars on a case-by-case basis for me: some yea, some nay...)   7. I oppose condom distribution in public schools.  No (but I do think  urlLink taste tests  are a little outside the acceptable norm...)   8. I oppose bilingual education.  No (but mastery of English should be considered a primary goal of the American educational system; any bilingual curriculum that subverts that goal, I would not favor...)   9. I oppose gay marriage.  Wrong -- I have yet to hear a non-faith-based argument against gay marriage that passes for anything approaching logical...   10. I want Social Security privatized.  Nope -- I could see partial privatization as a possibility, but doing it 100% that way always sounds to me like throwing the 'Security' portion out with the bathwater...   11. I believe racial profiling at airports is common sense.  Yes, within reason (and  urlLink there's the rub  -- finding and defining an objective criteria that most of us would agree is 'reasonable'...)   12. I shop at Wal-Mart.  On occasion...   13. I enjoy talk radio.  Yeccchhh, @#$ no! Gimme some  tunes , man!...   14. I am annoyed when news editors substitute the phrase "undocumented person" for "illegal alien."  Almost *all* forms of  PC  annoy me...   15. I do not believe the phrase "a chink in the armor" is offensive.  Agreed, and 'a  urlLink niggardly  amount' is likewise a perfectly acceptable term (to anyone who reads beyond a fifth-grade level...)   16. I eat meat.  Yes (mostly poultry, bacon and bologna, with a burger or chopped steak every once in an odd while; with adapting myself more toward the  urlLink Zone Diet  being on my ever-growing 'to-do' list, that should be increasing...)   17. I believe O.J. Simpson was guilty.  Certainly by the ' urlLink preponderance of the evidence ' (which is how the civil trial ruled), and for me personally, ' urlLink beyond a reasonable doubt ' as well...   18. I cheered when I learned that Saddam Hussein had been captured.  I don't cheer over much o' nothing -- I suspect I pointed my index finger in the air, drew a couple of small circles, and that was that...   19. I cry when I hear "Proud to be an American" (God Bless the USA) by Lee Greenwood.  Only when I'm forced to listen to the whole thing (which would require duct-taping me to the chair and/or nailing my kneecaps to the floor...)   20. I don't believe the New York Times.  I don't believe much of anything or anybody, actually (yes, I may have some issues with  urlLink faith ...Faith Hill, not so much [other than that whole married-to-Tim-McGraw business, but whatev...])   [...gee, did I cover enough controversial topics to get some flamethrowers?...]
