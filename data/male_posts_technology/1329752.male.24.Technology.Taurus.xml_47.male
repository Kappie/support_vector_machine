"And I know I've always Just been a friend But if you look my way I'll make sure you never hurt again"       my former asst. mngr. is really a total asshole and a total luser as well as the other hipocrites. because my present boss did not approved their decission to terminate me, they file an administrative case to the company law firm and signed sworn statements to use against me. some people even try to pressure my former colleagues to testify.  i know that they are having a not too good speculations on me. as long as i'm not doing anything wrong and i don't have any intentions of doing such, i won't care about them.  assholes...     "Do you know I exist Just to promise you this Endlessly to be true to you And if you answer my prayer I'd cross my heart and I'd swear Endlessly to be true to you And if you'd only see How beautiful you and I would be Endlessly"            i miss her so much. for me she's the perfect kind of girl. the one who's always be there for me and who never turned me down despite some of our different beliefs. pero i'm not into perfection naman kase eh. siguro that's the reason why we broke up.   well it's a nice thing that we're still good friends.     "I remember when you fell in love I could not believe That it was not with me  I sent a secret prayer up above And put my heart away So that you could be free "     just finished doing stuffs here at work. i'm indulging myself reading biographies of historical figures, novels and other articles. i don't want to get killed by boredom in this frigid place.  try reading this 2 good articles, it's entitled the  urlLink whore  urlLink  series...      "And I know right now, You're broken in two  But did you know my heart's been Broken since the day I met you "     thanks to those who tagged:  a sister like, a crush, a down hearted french instructor, some acquaintances, a friend, a geek  umm... who else? those other people in my list and yeah...    to the one i can not see, the one i can not hear, the one i can not speak and yet the one i care most...      "Do you know I exist Just to promise you this Endlessly to be true to you And if you answer my prayer I'd cross my heart and I'd swear Endlessly to be true to you And in my sweetest dream You'd learn to put your faith in me Endlessly"     thank God its friday. take care to all...  -out-
