And you know what, who says it really needs it.  I know it would be best to have blocks under all the supports but I've got them under the ones on the long side where the ground was noticably softer than elsewhere.  And as we thought about it, it made sense that the top would bow in as the pool filled.  The water first spreads out the bottom, after all, which would cause the top to bend inward.  So, the wife came back around to my original way of thinking (having now nearly obliterated my confidence in my plan) and I jam the boards I removed back under that one support.  It was still quite muddy there and the back neighbors were watering their lawn so it would continue to get muddy, no doubt.  It took a but of finagling but with a bit of digging out and a good amount of hammering into place, I got them in place.  And now the pool is once again filling.  By the time I get home today, it should be about waist deep.  Tonight's project will be laying out and "dressing" the power cord for the pump.  Oh, and I've got to pick up an additional hose to connect the solar heater and maybe a "first time use" sanitizing kit.    Man, just wading around in the knee-deep water last night while setting up the siphon (which worked far too slowly), was nice.  It's going to be quite motivating to get my arse home after work during Sacramento's notoriously hot summer days.  ...provided the pool doesn't collapse from our ineptitude.
