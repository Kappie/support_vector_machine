Here’s to all the awesome dishes we made ....ahh yes the Biriyani, the Fried chicken, the Stuffed turkey........it was so hard to take the wrapping all of those pre-cooked stuff…  But seriously, for two guys who didn’t know the first thing about cooking I think we should do some serious patting our self on our backs for how we learnt to cook. Can’t wait to impress the people back home.
