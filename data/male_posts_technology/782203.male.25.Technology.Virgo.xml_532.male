But its supposedly part of a National Day Parade (NDP) thingy so not sure if its permanent though. And to comment you have to register which is kinda annoying. Yep thats the government for ya, you can't say or post anything without them knowing who you are. Sigh times like this I feel like screaming FREEDOM like Wallace did in Braveheart as he died. I love that movie by the way.
