I thought that I might go to bed,  but rowdiness insued instead.   Adrienne and Dougare fighting.  Cigarettesrequirelighting.  So much for Monopoly;  Everyone is drunk but me!   Swiftly tothe fridge I go  To find a burtang, icy cold.  Yuengling porter; what is that?  Miller Lite- that's where it's at!   "Not so fast! You can't consume  The only Miller in the room!"  Said Douggie Fresh, "I do proclaim,  The final beer is in my name!"   "Dear sir, I apologize,  I simply did not recognize that  You're the owner of this beer!  Now, Sir Freshness, take it- here!"   Drunken laughter all around.  Not aburtang to befound.  Kimbofinds a bag of trees and  Rolls a blunt of ferret weed.   Autumn Lane is getting hazy.  Everyone is pretty lazy.  Once the hefty blunt is dead,  Lots of peoplego to bed.   Everyone but Craigy Craig,  Doug andlittle meare left.  Fuckinay, I want a beer!  Why can't I just have a beer?   Dougy sees that I'm perplexed.  Fresh can flex his mental pecks!  Freshness findsour shareofwealth  Hiding on the bottom shelf!   Now we can propose a toast!  Drink it even though its gross!  Keystone Light for all of us!  Drinking burtang is a must!   I'm so glad I got my beer!  Time for bed is drawing near.  Sadly, I won't sleep for long.  Drinking nasty beer was  wrong !   Maybe I just need to burp.  Ow! My tummy really hurts!  Every other beer is fine, but  KEYSTONE's where I draw the line.    Smoking makes your judgement poor.  I drank one bur and wanted more!  Now you know the reason why I'm  Suffering    Keystoneritis!!        Wed-nes-day at 6 A.M.  Vin just left for work again.  Finally the pain has left and  Now I need to go to bed.
