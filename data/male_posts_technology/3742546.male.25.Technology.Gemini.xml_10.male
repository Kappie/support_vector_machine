Aside from that, I've been pretty busy redesigning my webpage.  It's looking REALLY good.  It looks better than my last webpage.  I spent time with Joe and Joan together yesterday.  Then Joe and I had a discussion on the old RPG program that has been on hold for a while.  Then again, my Settlers of Catan program has been on hold for a few weeks also.  Hopefully I'll get this website finished soon so I can get back to some old fashioned programming.  Talk to ya then.
