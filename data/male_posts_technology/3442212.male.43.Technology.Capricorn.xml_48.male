Adam came over and with my and Matt's help, created two banners. They read:         DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER       and         MORE TREES, LESS BUSH      Well, of course those banners weren't getting near the site of the speech. So:     A friendly Kerry supporter named Mr. Shenk let us use his front yard to display our banners. Now comes the good part. After waiting around for about 45 minutes, the motorcade passed by us again. A few police cars, followed by a van or two, drove by. Then, a Bush/Cheney bus passed, followed by a second one going slower. At the front of this second bus was The W himself, waving cheerily at his supporters on the other side of the highway. Adam, Brendan, and I rose our banner (the More Trees, Less Bush one) and he turned to wave to our side of the road. His smile faded, and he raised his left arm in our direction. And then, George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the United States of America, extended his middle finger.      Read that last sentence again.     I got flipped off by George W. Bush.       A ponytailed man standing next to us confirmed the event, saying, "I do believe the President of the U.S. just gave you boys the finger."     urlLink  Read it all . Alas, the picture posted there isn't incriminating - I spent an hour or so attempting digital picture wizardry in order to look in the windows of the bus, but the only person we can see on the bus in that picture is the driver.    I am very forgiving of such hysterics on the House and Senate floor, or even in private in the White House because let's face it, government is a high-stress office job and sometimes you gotta vent.    However: An elected official "giving the finger" directly to registered voters has completely forgotten who's in charge here.    I am  outraged . I fear for my country. The thought of what that jackass can do in the period between losing the election and the inauguration of his successors terrifies me.    The terrorists have won, haven't they?
