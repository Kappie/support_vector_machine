We had a sex chapel (let's guess... yup) yesterday, and *will insert name when I remember it* from *will insert name of ministry when I remember it* came and spoke. It was ... yeah it just "was" LOL close to the end of the hour and a half, he asked us several questions along the lines on "Show of hands, who here wants to have great sex eventually" or, "Who wants to have sex lots?" LOL it was sooooo funny watching people kinda start to put their hand up then stop, then hold it up again... Don't worry, the entire thing was from a biblical standpoint (um, duh, it's a Christian school...) and it was all geared toward waiting to get married and stuff. ...But it was pretty funny :)
