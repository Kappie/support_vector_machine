Its not that I dont want to blog, or its not that I dont have info to share but,  its that I am in a crucial change process which may / not click although a career is assured but Where!!! is the question?. Obviously believing in the best and hoping the gr8, I made use of stealth technology in the chessboard betn 2 careers either Infy / nway @ HSS.  After MS, and deep search all ways(but not always)... finally goto into HSS on Nov 25 2k2. I started with a 3 months contract with the confirmation that I wont be confirmed thereafter, may be based on performance and mutual understanding the tenure will be extended. Fortune played in my life after 1.5 months of service: my responsibility increased, at that time I was very comfortable with clearcase (configuration mgt. tool) and a person (senior work wise) left the orgn. So I am very confident that they have to extend my tenure, they did so for another 6 mths with the confirmation that end of this period; if am doing good, I will be absorbed thereafter. After 9 months, fortune played in my life for the 2nd time, now, I am handling performance testing apart from my usual role and also supporting 2-3 projects. They came and convinced me by saying, everything is ok with me but the HR policy is something like they can take into their role only after 1 year contract period, nothing to worry, if u r maintaining the current level u r given the role etc...etc....   But, Ram Gopal cannot digest this, and on that day he applied for 3 orgn. although 2 clicked one out of which is onsite.  I didnt left coz. 1. I wanted to be in a reputed orgn. HSS is doing good, so HSS or better than that 2. I dont want stay in the role of Support engr. i.e, config. mgt, cc admin, build and release engr. I want to be a s/w engr. Testing / Develpt will do for me... as I am doing performance testing thru which I am very familiar with the test envt. and since I am handling Build activities I can walk thru code and grasp to some extent. I saw an Add for 1-3 yr. exp needed in infy. I just applied, moreover by that time its 9 months completed from my earlier attempt for Infy. I do prepared to the maximum I can. Only Kicha / Manny know this directly from me...Appeared on Nov 02 2k3 with full confident that they cant reject me... The test was bit easy. I did 5/9 puzzles. 4 should be certainly right. I was called for interview...(altogether 4 rounds) it was too.. superb... Did well. In the final round I am very much confident they will call me...the same above two persons and some more know this....but 15 days I have to wait for the result... oooh... its difficult time, anytime HSS can give me the confirmation letter, Thank God, Till Nov. 17 I didnt received my confirmation letter. by Nov 15 I have received offer mail from Infy. Immdtly I shoot the mail to my manager for my relieving letter from Nov 28 2k3 moreover my contract also ends on Nov 30. All 3 mgrs. spoke to me. Saying everything is clear from our side, You can continue as Senior operations engr. But as I said I am moving to Infy as S/w engr. and as they are aware of its value which will be better for my long term career than theirs, even though they tried to convince me... atlast left with my own will to continue wherever I wish with their wishes for me. By this time most of our classmates know the info.... But I havent published directly.  Atlast d'day came for me... and I reported in infy Dec 01 2k3, I am not very sure where they will put me, I joined as s/w engr. and I know I will be put in Unix Envt. (I like it) I was taken into Product Eng. and delvry Bsns unit. into a Cisco project... I was in trng. till date... now will be into projt. its for cisco networking domain, going fine... Kicha!!!!! HSSlla sugama leisure ah erundhavane.. inga vandhu vellay seya.. soluraengala da..... hmmm irukatum...  Continuation of this will be dealt later... i.e from Dec 01 2k3 - ....  appuram HSS digital snaps llam, angaey vitutu vandhutaen.. sorry Rini kkum anupalla...
