Let’s think about that.  The hammer is a useful and handy instrument.  It is essential and helpful tool, if nails are ever to be driven into place.  Each blow forces them to bite deeper as the hammer’s head pounds and pounds.  But if the nails had feelings and intelligence, it would give us another side of the story.  To the nail, the hammer is a brutal, relentless master---an enemy who loves to beat it into submission.  That is the nail’s view of the hammer.  It is correct.  Except for one thing.  The nail tends to forget that both it and the hammer are held by the same workman.  The workman decides whose “head” will be pounded out of sight…and which hammer will be used to do the job.  This decision is the sovereign right of the carpenter.  Let the nail but remember that it and the hammer are held by the same workman…and its resentment will fade as it yields to the carpenter without complaint.  The same analogy holds true for the metal that endures the rasp of the file and the blast of the furnace.  If the metal forgets that it and the tools are the objects of the same craftsman’s care, it will build up hatred and resentment.  The metal must keep in mind that the craftsman knows what he’s doing…and is doing what is best.  Heartaches and disappointments are like the hammer, the file and the furnace.  They come in all shapes and sizes:  an unfulfilled romance, a lingering illness and untimely death, an unachieved goal in life, a broken home or marriage, a severed friendship, a wayward and rebellious child, a personal medical report that advises “immediate surgery,” a failing grade at school, a depression that simply won’t go away, a habit you can’t seem to break.  Sometimes heartaches come suddenly…other times they appear over the passing of many months, slowly as the erosion of the earth.  Do I write to a “nail” that has began to resent the blows of the hammer?  Are you at the brink of despair, thinking that you cannot bear another day of heartache?  Is that what’s gotten you down?  As difficult as it may be for you to believe this today, the Master knows what He’s doing.  Your Savior knows your breaking point.  The bruising and crushing and melting process is designed to reshape you, not ruin you.  Your value is increasing the longer He lingers over you.  A. W. Tozer agrees:  It is doubtful whether God can bless a man greatly until He has hurt him deeply.  Aching friend---stand fast.  Like David when calamity caved in, strengthen yourself in the Lord your God (1 Sam. 30:6).  God’s hand is in your heartache.  Yes, it is!  If you weren’t important, do you think He would take this long and work this hard on your life?  Those whom God uses most effectively have been hammered, filed and tempered in the furnace of trials and heartaches.  Take time to thank your Master for any trials and heartaches in this season of your life.  And meditate afresh on James 1:2-22.
