Congratulations and thank you!    urlLink   How grammatically sound are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      I take pride in my ability to communicate.  While I don't dwell on each turn of a phrase or triple-check my spelling, I do try to make sure I show intelligence and care in how I come across with the written word.  When you meet me face-to-face, that's when all bets are off.
