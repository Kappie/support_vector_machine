Point Blank (for lobie).   What a week! Phish breaking up! I won't pretend to be a huge phan, but I am definitely more than a casual listener. What a turn of events, but maybe it's for the best. More TAB tours can't be bad.  Article of the day:   http://www.phishhook.org/board/viewtopic.php?t=386726=45bf6ccb108b4ed152ab5ee2b9ecc625  Even for non-Phish music diehards - good points on what it's like to follow a band so intently year after year. Long read though and it reads like Corky Thatcher wrote it.
