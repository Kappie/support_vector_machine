       
      Sunday evening after you drove off I briefly considered hailing a cab and seeing if I could beat you home and then acting like you'd imagined the whole thing. I would have done it too if not for the mocking I'd have taken...   The flight left mostly on time and I had unlimited legroom. Did you hear that? Unlimited legroom... I also had a seat that was very nearly as wide as my ass so, while I could stretch out as much as I wanted, I couldn't plug in the headset for the movies and be comfortable at the same time. So, I started watching the first movie and then decided that I really wanted to sleep (what with the exhaustion of having slept only 3 or 4 hours of the previous nights) so I took that pill you gave me. With the aid of the pill I was drowsier for the next few hours and very nearly fell asleep but didn't quite manage it. I did suffer some memory loss- as warned by the package - because I can't for the life of me remember the first two movies that were on, I only remember Somethings Gotta Give - movie #3 - and only from about 1/4 of the way on. Weird. I ended up sitting next to a massive, kilt wearing, rugby coaching Scotsman who was very nice. On the other side was the aisle which meant I got drilled in the shoulder whenever a fat Briton would walk by.   We arrived in Manchester to some confusion as to what those of us going to Glasgow should do. They eventually decided that we should get off the plane and go into the terminal. We got off and wandered the Transfer corridor for about 15 minutes until we got to a door where they handed us these blue plastic Air Transat boarding passes. That was it. No word on what to do or where to go.   I wandered back to where I could see the plane and found a departure screen with flight 705 to Glasgow/Vancouver and was eventually assured that I was in the correct location. Eventually everyone else from the flight showed up bitching and whining about the crappy lack of explanation.   We then sat and rotted for 90 minutes because of some catering problem on the plane and then departed and arrived in Glasgow an hour late. I grabbed the bus into Glasgow and then managed to successfully walk to my hotel using the Lonely Planet map, getting there at 9:40pm. The hotel was pretty lame and my room was tiny but I didn't care, the person at the desk guessed my name as I walked in and handed me a key before I'd opened my mouth. Exhausted I fell into bed. Nothing. Then panic because I didn't know what to do the next day. Then an overwhelming desire to head back to the airport and fly home. Then I calmed my ass down and gave myself apretty serious talking to. I decided to stop being a scared little boy and tried being a self-confidant 34 year old man-child. That worked much better. I fell asleep and didn't wake up until 3 a.m., body clock misfiring.   Upon waking I realized I was horrifically dehydrated, probably contributed to the body clock and waking thing. I guzzled the water I had and then tried to sleep. I then realized that I wouldn't be able to find any place to stay in Scotland, the country was completely booked. I then discovered that I'd end up spending $300 each night to sleep in this country with no rooms available. I further realized that Scotland sucked. I also figured out that I was just going to be sad and miserable the entire time. It is truly amazing what you can learn about a country while lying in the dark of your hotel room, not sleeping. Around 5 a.m. I cranked out the LP and tried to figure out what I'd do the next day, while delirious from lack of sleep and water.   By 6 a.m. I had decided on Edinburgh because I wanted to see a castle as soon as possible. I collapsed (if it is possible to collapse while lying down) and tried to sleep again. No luck. I read all about Glasgow and decided that at least Glasgow sucked (since I wasn't interested in any nightlife). At 7:30 I got up and put some clothes on, had a bit of a weepfest (holy crap I can be a loser) and then went down for breakfast. Turns out I was starving, still dehydrated, and also coffee starved. I came back to the room, got my things together and actually started feeling human again. Then I asked directions to the bus station and headed out to catch the bus to Edinburgh.   The bus ride wasn't interesting but pulling into Edinburgh was spectacular. Wonderful. The bus station is located in the heart of the city and is overlooked by the castle and a whole load of the other sights and sounds of Edinburgh.   I headed over to the Tourist Information center, found a room in a very nice guest house after only 4 attempts 10 pounds/night cheaper than my Glasgow hotel, and then walked the 1.5 miles to it. I caught the bus back (what a huge improvement in rooms and the ladies there couldn't have been nicer) and walked up to the castle. I liked it a lot. I then wandered down the Royal Mile all the way to Holyrood Castle and the construction sight of the new Scottish Parliament building. I then wandered through a park and started climbing the spectacularSalisbury Crags (this beautiful park with blowing grass, heather, a little lake, rocky outcroppings, more blowing grass, these little trees) I was about exhausted after my city touring but the more I walked up the hills the more energy I got. I had only intended a short walk (the exhaustion and all) but I kept climbing and getting more energy and more happy and more enthusiastic. Once I reached the summit of Arthur's Seat, I sat and wrote for an hour. The wind was howling so I had to move until I got somewhere out of the wind- I was freezing - but it was great. I then wandered back down (remind me to tell you my peeing story) and into town. At this point I was starving - having not really eaten after breakfast and having eaten all your cookies (thanks!) I found a cute place to get some food and coffee and wrote for another half hour or so. Then I wandered back to the guesthouse, exhausted at 9:30 and fell asleep after a nice shower, waking up at 1:30 - dehydrated again. I drank almost 2 liters (it was a 2 liter bottle) and fell back asleep waking up at 7:30, finally refreshed.   It wasa good day.   This morning I signed on for another day at the guesthouse (Alexander's Guest House) and had a nice breakfast there and now I'm back in the center of town about to attack the things I didn't see yesterday.   The weather is a bit Vancouverish. Really hot during the moments the sun is out but cool otherwise. I managed to burn my face yesterday in those sporadic sun moments but today is a bit thicker cloud so I should be okay.   I'm trying to decide where to go next...I'm leaning towards Inverness to see Loch Ness and go on a dolphin hunting cruise - I love dolphins. From there I'll head to somewhere I can climb in the hills some more.
