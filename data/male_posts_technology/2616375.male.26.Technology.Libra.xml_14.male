The nomination will remain open for the week of May 10th to May 15th.  This year we are using Infopath SP1 Form to invite nominations. The same will be available on the website starting Monday. The learning curve for Infopath form development is steep in the beginning. once you get a hang of it, things move really quick. Another feature this time is that the nomination will be concentrating on more experienced people who have made the Indian Programming landscape noticable in the world. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.
