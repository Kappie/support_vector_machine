Yup... ramg is right... western (MJ and Shakira likes) are entirely different from yesudass etc of India... but there r others also ... Elton John, Beatles, Bryan Adams and the young ones like Charlotte Church - these people are to western what yesudass is to Indian.  I still can't forget the song "Voice of an angel" by Charlotte Church.. really her voice is like an angel's... but I couldn't get that song after that anywhere... (jax, note down...)  Kicha
