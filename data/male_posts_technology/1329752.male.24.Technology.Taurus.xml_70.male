"Oh Shit Ooo-Ahahah, Ooo-ahahahah Drowning deep in my see of loathing Broken your servant I kneel Can you give it to me It seems what's left of my human side is changing Can you give it to me Is slowly changing in me"    i don't have grudges or anything bad about these 2 religious groups but i think they should start closing their tv programs because they're pissing everybody off. these are the "ang dating daan" and "ang tamang daan" tv programs that are aired every night. for those of you who belong to one of those i mentioned, please don't take any of the following words you'll begin to read personally. i'm sure anyone who will find these true well get pissed. these are mere products of my dick brain.. oopss, thick i mean.    "Looking at my own reflection When suddenly it changes Violently it changes I know, there is no turning back now You've woken up the demon in me"    if you're not quite into bible discussions and will watch for the first time how "ely soriano" preaches the word of "his God" then i'm pretty sure you'll be amazed. if you'll be able to watch "ang tamang daan" by "bro. michael" et. al. you'll get to experienced the same thing. i consider these people as talented, well versed and scholars in their chosen field. i never wanted to argue with them about my own religious belief coz' it'll be a total hell. yet preaching the word of God in their tv programs are completely senseless. apparently senseless in a point wherein the only objective of the show is to inflict a bad reputation to the other party. (perhaps spreading the words of their God was next to it). these people playing protagonist in the field of evangelical dissemination doesn't shed light on the facts that they should be. do you think God would be happy knowing people are uttering offensive remarks to each other because of him? well i don't think so. does it mean that if i can memorized and interpret every single words and period of the bible, i'm the best? i'm the scholar? i'm the chosen one? and yeah i can start my own religion? so whats next? aha! buying my own tv station and starting my own tv show together with my zombies (good idea). influencing others with my sweet tongue. preaching that i'm the one, the one chosen by God to spread his message. and then what's next? starting rivalry with other religious groups about my belief, about what is good and bad, about their own teachings etc. and then after that? people from politics would soon approach me for a religious endorsement, that whatsoever words comes out of my mouth comes from the mouth of God.  sick people.    "Chorus: Get down, come on, get down with the sickness Get down, come on, get down with the sickness Open up your hate and let it flow into me Get down come on get down with the sickness You mother get down come on get down with the sickness You fucker get down come on get down with the sickness Madness is the gift that has been given to me"    the bible is a compilation of God's words documented by those people who have experienced being with him in flesh, in faith and in doctrines. it was created by humans in Gods name, perhaps the reason why people has different interpretations. it should serve a special purpose, re-uniting people. showing that even though we have different understanding about his word, let us not forget that there is only one true God. the one who created this universe, the one who created us all. it doesn't mean that if i do not belong to your church, i won't be saved when the judgement day comes. nobody has the right to question once faith, only God. your God is also my God, so what's your problem? born again christians don't believe in saints, so what? moslems believe in Allah. so what? roman catholics believes in mama Mary, so what? mayor sanches once said he was a mama Mary devotee, but after pleading guilty to the rape and killing of the up lost banos student he did a dirty finger and shouted "putangina ninyo" on philippine television. not because you're good in persuading people  with your crap you can save me from my sins. Jesus in his time also fought false prophets, but he never uttered any inflicting remarks. it was his pure intention to speak the words of his father that lead people persuasively.    "I can see inside you the sickness is rising Don't try to deny what you feel It seems that all that was good has died And is decaying in me    filipinos are known to be religious. perhaps the effects of foreign colonization can be considered as one of the principal reasons why faith plays a very important role in this country. religions should help and inspires us in strenghtening our faith with God without the need to hate others who have different beliefs. want to know my christmas wish? watching  bro. jocel (ely's alalay) from dating daan and bro. michael from iglesia featured in mtv's celebrity deathmatch. what do you think huh?    "It seems you're having some trouble In dealing with these changes Living with these changes The world is a scary place Now that you've woken up the demon in me"    i guess these religious leaders should try eating their own dog foods. start practicing what they preach. well these are my opinions, i'm not judging anyone or anything nor i'm  playing wise... these are purely point of views.  umm... perhaps that's my final word for now.  until next week.    "Chorus: Get down, come on, get down with the sickness Get down, come on, get down with the sickness Open up your hate and let it flow into me Get down come on get down with the sickness You mother get down come on get down with the sickness You fucker get down come on get down with the sickness Madness is the gift that has been given to me
