It has a user interface that is incredibly easy to use.  I have my first program due tonight, it's really basic and simple. It just asks for you to input your age and resting heart rate, and it returns what your training heart rate should be.  Very simple.     But I was having a mental block, trying to remember how to get my data from the user.  Then I was like, DUH, smacked my forehead, and then put it in.  For my first program, I've probably got 2-3hrs of playing around trying to remember how to get the input. After I remembered, it took 60 seconds if that, for me to have it working.  I'm so proud!  Can you say WOOHOO!  So I have my program all printed out, and on a diskette to turn in tonight, along with my 20 or so exercises that were assigned.  I'm quite happy that I have my homework 100% and ready to turn in.  It's a relief to just sit down for 5 minuets, and know, that you have nothing due right THIS instant, and can just relax.   Life is always about being busy busy busy busy busy.. It's about cramming as much into your waking hours as you can, before it's time for you to die.  You don't want to have accomplished nothing.  But....sometimes that nothing is just as important, so you can de-stress for a few minutes, before getting your nose ground against the grinders wheel.  Relax! Monday's almost done!
