As I was thinking about my past tastes in music, I saw how this was true in my life.  I feared showing any form of weakness as a youth, so resisted the temptation to be drawn in by music. I saw how it controlled people's emotions when they would watch movies. I didn't want to be controlled.  Around 11 or 12 years of age, Kirk introduced me to a lot of music, most of which I listen to and enjoy now. It was also at that time that I got my hands on some Peter Cetera tapes. I think I related most to the song "Solitude/Soliaire", as I was extremely introverted towards strangers at that age.  Just recently I bought Peter Cetera's "Greatest Hits" album. Now that I am dating Kristi, I relate to a lot of his love songs. "S.O.S" is probably my favorite as far as rhythm and sound go, but its lyrics are about lost love, so I don't really relate to them. I relate much more to "Feels Like Heaven", "Happy Man", "Faithfully", and "She Doesn't Need Me Anymore". There are other love songs on there that I'll probably appreciate more later in our relationship.
