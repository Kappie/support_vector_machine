I'm in the top 20 in league play and my head to head match play has really improved. I can't complain.  I've stayed away from pary poker for the most part. I did go in for 5 minutes last night. It was quite funny actually. I went to a $25 NL table and start to play a few hands. Nothing exciting. On my third hand I get dealt 55. Nothing exciting so I pay my .50 to see if I can trip up the fives. Flop comes out and it's Q59. A good flop. It's three in including me. I'm second to act. The first guy in the early position goes all in for $30.00. Not I'm not sure to call. I analyze the hand. He's in early position, he could have tripped up a pair as well or hit two pair. It's a tough call. What would you do?  Well, I had to see it so I took a chance and called it. The last guy folded and the cards came up. He was sitting on Q9. I had him beat but there were still two cards left. If he got another 9 or Q, I was done. 26 comes out and I've doubled up. He was pissed. He said I was just lucky. That's poker baby. I pissed him off even more when he bought back in and I sat out then left the table. Take the money and run I say. Especially on party poker. I good way to end the night. Let me know what you think of the play. I'm curious to see what others would have done with the 5s.   Indiana Slim
