I hope that both Max Mosely and Bernie Ecclestone, past and current presidents of the Michael Schumacher fan club, note that Valentino is a champion and what they have been passing off as a "champion" in Michael Schumacher starts to fall apart.  I only hope that its not to late for Ferrari to recover from the inevitable decline of Michael 'mania' induced by Jean Todt. (Michaels sycophant boss)  To a spectacular season of demonstration of daring, skill, personality and the championship attitude of Mr. Rossi.
