Which is fun:) Plus they only have the 1st mission complete so once you're done with it, blah blah blah, you get the point.  Needless to say, I ran out of work on tuesday, and mostly am just flying around hoping it doesn't crash.  So, our fridge started leaking at my house. That was pretty exciting. The landlord is coming on saturday to fix it. At least this way he'll think we we're doing dishes cause of the water being out. Instead of whoever that doesn't do their dishes.  So, I've been getting home at 11 and then I get up at 6:30. It's pretty damn tiresome.  Hope you all are doing good.  PS - "American Gods" rocks PPS - it's a book
