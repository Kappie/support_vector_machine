My father is a paladin of the Loyal Fury and has faught many battles, but his kind heart still shines through no matter the action in which he takes.  My Mother is of no station within the House of Torm, but still poses the strength, will, and sometimes healing powers to aid in Torm's fight against all that is evil.  I also have a sister, Karri Wierwood, who has wishes to become a priest, though she is still a little young for such."           "One might ask as to why I have not followed in my Father's footsteps and take up the call and become a paladin of Torm.  As I have told my Father in the past, there are more ways to serve Torm than simply becoming a paladin.  For I hope to bring the power of magic to bear along with the sword of Light.  Father still hopes that I will one day return to him and take up the call, I may still yet.  With Father's approval I took up an apprenticship with of old and wise wizards at the Lady's College.  I was fortunate to be accepted by the old elven wizard Nym Moonbreak, Father is friends with Nym since he and the head of the temple ask him for magical help at times."           "As I was growing up in Silverymoon I gained many friends of different parentage.  I had friends that were dwarven and elven, as well as humans.  I even had friends that were a mix between some of them too!  My greatest Dwarven friend was also a friend of the family, Durg Stoneshield.  He was the main stonemason who helped to work on the temple of Torm.  He enjoyed being around the youth of Silverymoon, always said he enjoyed the flame of youth.  Course we liked him since he was always nice in telling stories of his battles and how the walls which he helped to create were always impenetrable.  He taught us also how to work stone, said 'stone is a migh'y friend to have on your side, cause its always there and it don' like ta be forced ta move!'  When Nym had told me that my apprenticeship was nearly complete, I told this to Durg and he had one of his friends that was good at the forge make a quarter staff of mithral, so that I would always have some stone to fall back to."           "As I have said I have had many friends growing up, but I do not time to name them all.  However, there were some who were my most loved.  Durg being one of them as is Nym and another is the Paladin Lord of our temple: Maldin Everstand.  Along with him and my Father and Mother, I learned of the ways of Torm. He told us of the great things which Torm had done as well as those actions taken by his followers in defending the innocent.  Father and he are good friends having faught in many a battle side-by-side.  I used to watch them practice their fighting skills in sparring matches as a child.  They taught me all that they could about the ways of Torm, and if one didn't know the answer to one my questions, the other would chime in with what they thought might be the right one.  I have learned much from them. In the hopes that I might one day become a mighty paladin to fight for Torm, they taught me to fight some when I was older and before I had taken up an apprenticeship with Nym.  Maldin is a great man and I love him just as much as I love my Father."           "When I had become the apprentice of the elven wizard Nym, I had no idea what I was in for.  He is a very old wizard, with a kind heart, and plenty of patience to spare.  He was more than happy to have me as an apprentice and was willing to teach me many things about the Weave.  He told of the mythals of old and said that though I might not be able to create such, due to my short life span that I could still hope.  I had told of a time when I had seen a wizard conjure up some sort of magic armor to defend himself in a duel and that I wanted to learn such an art, so that I might be able to aid those of Torm.  And from then on I became a Abjurer, studying under Nym.  I knew Nym was not of the faith of Torm, but he still understood my faith, and he told me once that 'Faith is the most powerful defense of all, for it has the power to call down the Gods to come to your aid.'  Nym also told of many other forms of defense, such as being able to the enemy before they see me.  One day nearing the end of my apprenticeship he told me that it was time to see what I had learned and gave me the task of going out into the world to test my new skills.  I said that the task shall be done and that I would return once it was done, he was glad to here such.  As a gift beyond the knowledge in which he had already given me, he also gave a cloak of his people saying that 'though I cannot give you an armor better than your faith in Torm, I can at least give you this to help hide you when the time is dire indeed.'"           "I have left the Family that I love so much and the people of whom I care the most for, may Torm protect them always, and may he grant me strength to fight the evils of this world."
