Also did some survival mode with Ayane.  I like Ayane's moves, perhaps even better than Lei Fang.  I'm going to have to experiment with her a bit more.  Anyway, that took about 90 minutes, and the tip of my thumb is now bruised.  I think I'm going to have to go with something a bit less stressful.  Ah, I have just the thing!  Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball (DOAXBV)! Last time I played, it was Hitomi.  Since I'm trying to keep track of how my collections are going, I figure I had better go back to Christie.  I had played with her earlier but had not kept track of her items.  I wound up playing longer than I had intended, a couple of hours, actually.  But at least I now have a full record of exactly where she is in her collection.  Of all the girls I have played with in DOAXBV, I like Christie the best.  As an added bonus, her best partner is Lei Fang, who is very cute.  I have only played through as Lisa, Tina, Lei Fang, Hitomi, and Christie.  That means I still have Kasumi, Ayane, and Helena to do.  I haven't completed any sets yet, so I'm just going through to get a sampling of each for now.  Finally, sleep.
