San Francisco seems to have it all: crazy stuff to do; crazy, openminded people; crazy weather; and crazy money to be made.  And crazy suits me just fine.  This comes after a near-miss with an impending depression that forced me to take a sober look at my life (well, I wasn't exactly sober at the time, but perhaps a sobering look at my life).  My brother got hitched over the weekend (beautiful ceremony, reception, and all - Virginia sure is purty) and his friends got me blitzed.  14 hours of riding cramped in the back seat of our Impala brought me back to my parent's house.  I'm not sure which is more contricting, being sealed in the back of a car with a raging hangover or being secuestered at my former home without license or wheels to set me free.
