I think the artwork and quality of the game are super, although the linen of the cards are a bit too textured for my liking.  If you hold them a certain way, the light will glare off of the card and make it difficult to read the card.  This is such an improvement over the old 3M version of the game which had almost no artwork to speak of.  I think this is one of the things that I like best about Face2Face; they take the time and extra effort (read money) into making an already good game that much better.  I'm sure that  Sleuth  would have sold well if it was just a reprint of the 1967 3M game.  The attention to detail and improvement on presentation should make this a hit.  The family took the new version out for a 'spin' this afternoon and had a pretty good time.  The game is a bit much for Julia (age 6) but she's understanding some of the ideas.  She insists playing, though, so three-cheers for her tenacity!  I also finished reading Dean Koontz's latest "  The Taken  ".  I'll give it a 3 out of 5 stars.  If it wasn't for the ending, which tied the story up nicely, I'd have rated a one.  To me, this just didn't stand up to the enjoyment, that I've come to expect, from a Dean Koontz book.  I'm usually struck by the characters in one of his yarns.  There's always at least one character that I'm drawn to, and whom I'm interested in following.    The Taken   just doesn't have the 3D characterization that I'm used to.  Granted the tale takes place for the most part over a time span of less than a day, and the action is roller-coaster paced.  So, what can I expect?  I guess I was just hoping for more.  Perhaps a longer novel would have sated my appetite.  I'm now on to read Stephen King's   Dreamcatcher  .  Looks like alien conquest stories are filling some need.  :)
