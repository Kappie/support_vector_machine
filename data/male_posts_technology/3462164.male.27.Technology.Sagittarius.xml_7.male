I still can’t believe the Randleman/Crocop match nevermind Fedor/Coleman. It looks like we will also see [finally] the Jackson/Arona match so hype by Pride for the MW GP last year.  Here is the card as it stands now:  Quinton “Rampage” Jackson (USA) vs. Ricardo Arona (Brazil) Kazushi Sakuraba (Japan) vs. Antonio “Nino” Schembri (Brazil) Hidehiko Yoshida (Brazil) vs. Mark Hunt (New Zealand)   Tournament Matches are:   Fedor Emelianenko vs. Kevin “The Monster” Randleman Antonio Rodrigo “Minotauro” Nogueira vs. “The Texas Crazy Horse” Heath Herring Paulo Cesar “Giant” Silva vs. Naoya Ogawa Semmy Schilt vs. Sergei Kharitonov
