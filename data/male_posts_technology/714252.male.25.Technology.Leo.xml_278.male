Unfortunately I am going to have to close Step Thru as a company.. I tried putting it off as long as I could but a limited company for one person is just too much to handle and I have been killing myself to try and keep it alive but I have realised that it's just a company and I was fighting to keep a name alive when it made more sense to close the company and re-open as something else..  So that is the plan.  I need to sort out a few legal and financial bits and pieces and then I can officially close up shop as Step Thru. Now I know that sounds like a bad thing but really it isn't.. Why? Because I am re-opening immediately as a new company. This new company will start of in a MUCH better position than Step Thru was ever in and will allow me to take on work that I have been unable to do yet.  I also have a REALLY good friend coming over from England to work with me which I have to say is going to make the world of difference.. I have been working essentially on my own for the last few months (Bubbles has been a life saviour but would say himself that he is hardly a savant of the computer world) and it's a hard thing to motivate yourself to work when you haven't got someone else pushing as well..  Add to that the fact that work is slowly starting to pick up again and the world really does seem a brighter place :)  Anywho, I had better put my nose back to that grind-stone.  ttyl ;)
