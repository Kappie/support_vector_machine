C.H.I.L.L incidentally the Christian FellowShip from Help Institute's theme for this year..which stands for  Changing Hearts Impacting Life..lah..  Indeed we are living in the times where prophecies from the bible are coming to life and God have been working to see it come to pass and most importantly with the saints of the earth and angels and even God himself have been obeying the commandment that God have set Himself to make diciples of all nations.  For those who are reading the blog, do not take your own sweet time to reach out to our friends. Already grab a friend who have not known Jesus and start to spend time with a friend allowing them to know you and your lifestyle and most important the God that you serve.  Last Nite, indeed there were the times of refreshing ...with Ps Samuel Lai from Sheperd Community Fuk Lam Church in Hong Kong's temple street. Where Hung Hing or other gangster which made their due in some of hong kong's most violent movies lives . Ps Samuel Lai or Uncle Sam which they , the occupants of Temple Street most affectionately call, have been the most influential person in that area where he have held countless street sermons, goes out in the street ministries where he care for the homeless with acts like washing their hair and giving out food. He , desires to give back and pay back for the sins he have committed, when he was in the police force and as a gangster. He was in Jail for 13 years and finally came out . He was touched by God and now a man of God . Recently a Hong Kong show met up with Ps Sam and gave him an interview as he shares his ministeries and the people he have met including his family .   Really touched by the revelation that God have revealed upon his life . Whatever relationship we perceive on earth with our earthly father reflects our relationship with our Heavenly Father...U want to know more...get the tapes at SIBKL.hehehe
