I wanted to leave a message, but you have to be a member of  urlLink xanga  to do that.  I'm not a fan, even though I appreciated their cover of  urlLink the Who 's  urlLink Behind Blue Eyes , but I do enjoy seeing rock'n'roll singers crouching in baby swimming pools and posting kitchy images of themselves. The picture above was taken in the  urlLink Rijksmuseum  in Amsterdam and Fred  broke the rules  to pose next to Rembrandt's  urlLink the Nightwatch . I've been there and there's big signs telling you that all photography is forbidden to protect the fragile paintings (and the copyright on the expensive reproductions the sell at the museum store). But I guess was just a chicken not getting a photo of my own.
