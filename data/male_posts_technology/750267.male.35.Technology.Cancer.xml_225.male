Is it time to leave Iraq? From my perspective, not yet. If America leaves Iraq in the state it is now, it will NEVER AGAIN have credibility in front of the world when it comes to its next regime change. (It barely found support for invading Iraq in the first place... next time, there will be NO other allies willing to support it.)  The U.S. could never threaten North Korea, nor Iran, nor Syria, with invasion and these countries would know it. The end results would be a more chaotic world, where rogue nations could openly persue nuclear and other weapons with impunity.  The best analogy is if a child disobeys his parents. When the parents go to spank him, the child ends up spanking the parents. If the parents just "put their tail between their legs and walked away" from that situation, what has the child learned? What has his brothers and sisters learned?  The lesson, I suppose, is that they should have thought it through before going down that path. If they did think it through, they should have made it clearer to everyone that this would not be a cakewalk. George Bush should NOT have stood proudly (and smugly) on that aircraft carrier declaring the war to be over.  In the end, the U.S. made a committment to the people of Iraq that they would suffer less after the fall of Saddam, not more. They haven't fulfilled that promise yet.   Incidentally, the same can be said of Afghanistan after the Taliban, where warlords rule the countryside. Are things better outside of Kabul than they were before? Debatable.
