We might actually get real readers! Ones that don't like to insult our intelligence with poor linguistic skills or the inability to capitilize their letters...and Jenelle. (I apologize Ã— 654945645145.4 if I spelled it wrong. I'm awful with names) Yes, bitches, this is as close to an angry rant as you'll probably ever get from me.   Who knows, maybe my heart's just not in it. After all, how can one write a rant of the angry persuasion if one has just ended the best day in the entire world?    Jim:  Ben, I think you're lacking a chromosome.  Ben:  What? I'm lactating? *Feels chest*  Rosalie, Jacque and Jim:  O.O!  God, how I love the world. I love my Beej and I love my Karine more than life itself. Thanks for the great day, lovelies.   "Because there are few things that could make me happier right now..."
