( I think they're interchangeable)  Anyway, because of it, I'm slightly backed up in school work.  Yesterday I went to two basketball games between my school and my best friend's and we lost to them (both the girl's game, and the guy's).  It was kinda funny.  I stayed over night at his house afterward, and we just sat around lazy, doing nothing. It was fun. :)  Missed helping out at church (laying sod and stuff) cause we slept in, but whatever.  I would have been really tired anyway, after it.    Oh, Brady suddenly got his sight back on Wednesday night! I'm really happy for him.
