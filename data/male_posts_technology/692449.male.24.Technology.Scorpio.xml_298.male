I worked friday and saturday then susan and I got drunk saturday night and watched the pink panther and the orignal italian job. Then sunday we went to see Rent and eat at a fancy italian restruant called Vervace. It was a great time I love to go out on dates. For those of you into that sort of thing  urlLink here  is a really good epic comic called errant story I've been reading it for a while and it is worth a look at.
