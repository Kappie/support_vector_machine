This was apparently what many other people decided to do as well  as I saw a multitude of people walking, jogging, running, biking, etc.  I felt great and was able to maintain a fast pace after I started slow  for the first half mile or so.  I went 4.5 miles in 40 minutes.  I  haven't done the math enough to figure out minutes per mile but that's  6.75 miles per hour.  I took my iPod for the first and last time until  I either buy a mini or an armband for the existing.  I ended up having  to carry the iPod the entire way.  It was fine at first but it  progressively got heavier and eventually felt like a bowling ball by  the end.  I tossed it down the path in the end and knocked over some  senior citizens then used a rock to pick up the spare.  The weather was  phenomenal, I felt great, but the coolest thing about the run was the  people.  I had two favorites who stuck out in my mind and I'm not sure  who should win the the physical fitness award.  It comes down to the  woman walking and talking ON A CELL PHONE or the man who may have been out for a walk with his dog but he had stopped to sit on the curb and  smoke (Debbie).  Since I only saw the woman actually doing any  exercise, I guess the award will have to go to her.  I don't know if I  can actually classify what the smoker was doing as true exercise.  Maybe walking to the curb from his car (5 feet away) felt like murder  to him, but the Marlboro most likely disqualifies him.  Other than  that, I journey back out tonight to enjoy the weather and get those  miles in for training.  It could stay this temperature all year as far  as I'm concerned but then they would call this place San Diego.    For a final thought tonight, I listened to music with no words so it  will have to come from the sticker I saw on a car when I finished that must have known something deeper. Half way through my stretches, I happened to look at this car and the sticker read: You smell like butt  Have a great day!
