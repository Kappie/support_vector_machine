Saturday morning was mostly spent by Jo and I recovering from being kept awake most of the night by our 21 month old, who just wouldn't sleep, because she seems to have some kind of virus.  Then the afternoon was spent transporting earth and sand from a friends house to ours.  Our friend had overorded for some landscaping work, and we were only too happy to take it from him because of the work we are doing in the garden.  Remember last weekend I took up an old patio, well there is now a damn great hole in the garden that needs filling! The earth went in there and still hasn't filled it - looks like I'm going to have to take my Dad up on his offer to get some from him.  He's doing work on his house which is going to leave him with a glut of topsoil - handy huh!  Sunday was spent in London - it's my boys 4th birthday today, so we took him up to see his Grandad at work.  Dad is Station Officer for Kensington fire station, and retires in July, so we thought we'd take Ciaran up to look at the fire station, and the fire engines, have some lunch and then go to the natural history museum.  Highlight of the day for us all, was to be driven from the fire station to the Natural History museum in a fire engine!  That caused a few looks, seeing me, my daughter, my son, my wife, my mother and sister decamp from the engine!  There were also 4 fireman on board, in order that the engine remained operational, whilst we were out - that was a laugh!
