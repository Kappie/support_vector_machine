It's been really great here recently, great weather, havin some fun.  I got to go to Maui a couple times for work, didn't get to spend much time hanging out though.  I'm doing a food drive and another biathlon this weekend so that should be fun.  Peeling right now from a bit of too much sun.  Hope everything is going well with everyone else.
