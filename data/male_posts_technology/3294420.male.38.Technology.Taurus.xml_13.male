Maya was just adorable.  The pictures are great, but seeing her move around and making all these cutesy sounds, especially while sucking down her bottle top it all.  She is just the cutest thing and you know, Darrin and I couldn't decide who she looked like most at this point...  Debbie: I couldnâ€™t stop looking at your "production" in Maya's room. UNBELIEVABLY BEAUTIFUL artwork!  I know Gina and Dale are working their butts of getting the house just perfect, doing a lot of painting themselves, but that room of hers is a true showpiece.    We had such a great time visiting.  I am still reminiscing a week later.  Wish we were closer :-(  Love ya - Jeanette
