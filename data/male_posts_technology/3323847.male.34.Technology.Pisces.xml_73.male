I give Nokia an "A" for effort on their new model, but it simply may be too little too late.  Now they report there won't be nearly as many games available for the device as previously announced?  This geek has to wonder if this is that proverbial nail in that proverbial coffin for this product....  Note to businesspeople, if you wish to branch out into other markets, make sure the product you release is PROPERLY engineered.  You'll want to perform market tests too, if you have the bucks.
