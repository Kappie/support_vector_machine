Whats lies beneath that calm nonchalant exterior is a man not to be messed with. Fear this man, he will drink you under the table, then calmly crawl underaswelland slit your throat. His mind tricks however far outweigh his vicious physical prowess. He has been known to spend the day at work communicating with his colleagues (of which I am one) using only strange murmuring noises, I hope the camera footage is still on the companies security system, because it witnessed the rare collapse of an entire workforces sanity over the period of eight hours. We all clocked in in the morning as calm rational humans (on paper anyway) but when we clocked out that evening, we were physically shaking from the emotional turmoil, our hair had been crudely cut with stanley knives still bearing the rabid spittle we produced at the point of mental breakdown and our clothes had gone from ourpitifully broken bodies. Sadly, the management didn't notice any difference.        It is too late for us now, we are lost and destined to a life of souless inanity (and that's just work related), Prew has inflicted far worse on us. We are retches, mere shadows of our former selves, the man is a killer. Fear him.
