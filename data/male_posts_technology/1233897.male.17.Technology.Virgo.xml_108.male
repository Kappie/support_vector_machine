What does it really mean...how do you know if you are in love...the different types and kinds of love...ever wondered these kinds of things? Love is such a complex and amazing thing! Well, it would be, for God is love, and who can comprehend God?   What about the love between to people of the opposite gender? Usually we think of adults, right? It seems to me that teenagers aren't really expected to fall in love. They are supposed to have crushes, flirt, fool around, wish for love, but never actually fall in love. Is this true? Maybe its just a mindset...we've been conditioned to think that we cannot fall in love because we are too young, inexperienced, and immature. Maybe we are just as apt to fall in real love as the ones 10 and 20 and more years older than us.  But how do we know if it is love? How do we discern whether or not it is just a crush, or that we have convinced ourselves to care for someone because we were told they cared for us? How can we know? Are we just the same as those who are older than us? Do they know what falling in love is supposed to be like? Are we all in the same boat?   What are we supposed to do if we think we're in love? It seems that the difference between a simple crush and love is that, besides other factors, if you love someone, you want to care for them, and show them that you love them, and tell them. It is deep...but with a crush, its simply based on lust in one form or another, and you want to keep it secret from that person that you like.   Its so confusing, and complex. Somebody has to tell us how it goes... We only have to wait on God, I suppose. May he tell us quickly.   - Liv, 10:06 PM
