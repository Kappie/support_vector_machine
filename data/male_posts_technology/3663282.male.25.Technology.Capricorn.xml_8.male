My next door cubicle mate is currently happily listening to  Can't Take My Eyes Off You  by Frankie Vallie.Went to the clinic this morning. My blood pressure is normal, Alhamdulillah.And I got my blood result today as well. The doctor said everything was ok, soI didn't need to go there anymore. Alhamdulillah.So that's that. My mum willbe relieved to hear that. So will my beloved. Shesaid she was worried when I told her that my blood pressure was high the first time around.  After seeing the doctor this morning, rushed back to the office since I had to attend a training. The training was for Oracle's  Recovery Manager  or RMAN for short. Nothing much to write about that. I mean, it wasn't that interesting or anything. Just your normal everyday training. So tomorrow we'll be implementing the RMAN on the  Sun E3500  server.Now, that should prove interesting,and successful, I hope. After that, we need to implement RMAN on a production server. That will be donewhile everyone's asleep.We might start at midnight. Because the ritual needs to be performed withthe blood of a living chicken. I mean, you can't get blood from a dead chicken, can you. Duh! Hehehehe... Just kidding.  Saw  Shrek2  again last night. My sister bought my niece the DVD. So after the credits, I asked my parents to keep watching, because I heard that there was an extensionto the movie. And lo and behold, there was! But I'm not gonna write it here, since it would spoil everything. So, go watch it yourself! Hehehe. I've watched Shrek2 over and over and it's still funny.Seriously! I seriously need towatch other movies, huh. Can't depend on  Shrek2  can I. Well, I might watch  Van Helsing tonight.
