She called me up at 2 A.M. lol, I think she was drunk and wanted to get laid. I didn't answer the phone. I have hit rock bottom with this process, I am ready to kick ass and take down names. XXXXX called me and really wanted me to go out. I think he was trying to hook me up.  I told him I would go but I flaked out.
