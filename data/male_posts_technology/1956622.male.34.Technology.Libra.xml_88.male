She was saying it over and over in a quiet voice.    That really put a smile on my face and made me happy to hear.  Once she was on the phone she did not talk a long time but she while she was on she told me about her boo boo that she received in the pool here was feeling better.  She said she received another one today.  This one hurt a little.  I gave her a kiss over the phone and asked her if it felt better.  She laughed and said daddy it still hurts because you are at your house and I am here at mine.  So you did not really kiss it.  From there she says pretend you are grandpa.  So the rest of the conversation was me trying to pretend I was grandpa.  She finally gave up on that.  I will have to get Gma  Gpa on the phone for her I think that was a sign.    I called Jeremey on the phone to wish him a happy birthday and asked him to eat some cake for me.  I got the impression that talking to me made him uncomfortable.  I think I just need to leave things be and let him contact me if he wants to.  I don't want to stress the boy out he does not need that.    Not that I expect him to ever see this site but I think he deserves at least a little recognition on his birthday    Happy Birthday Jeremey!
