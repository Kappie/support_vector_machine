I'm very attached to my medium point black pens, thank you very much...   2. Do you prefer plain paper or paper with lines (notebook paper)?  Of late, I've mostly been writing on the back sides of things I run off the printer at work. When I do use lined notebook paper, I much prefer wide rule, as I can get a hand cramp by just  looking  at college-ruled paper...  (I suppose all that is at least in part a function of the fact that I ranked 3rd in my high school graduation class for worst handwriting: there was once a rumor that after graduation the guy at #2 got a job in encryption for the CIA; and as for the guy at #1 -- well, the first time I ever saw a JPEG of the  urlLink Voynich Manuscript , the thought crossed my mind that it bore a significant resemblence to his usual inscrutable chicken-scratchings...)   3. What's better: books from the library, or reading online?  Real books are undoubtedly better for the eyes (unless, like me, you make the mistake of looking back and forth between the book and the TV), but, due to accumulated inertia, I've been sticking mostly to on-line reading of late...   4. Which would you rather get, e-mail or snail mail?  I suppose I prefer e-mail, only because a snail mail carries the potential pressure of responding in kind, and my average creation time for your basic old-school letter is about 6 monthes...    5. Do you have a paper weight on your desk?  A couple of things on my work desk that *could* be paperweights:  a beer stein with the logo of the community college I got my Associate's degree at a Magic 8-Ball that I got at my Uniface training a while back (which has a Uniface logo on it) a foam coaster with my current employer's logo ...hmm, seems to be lotsa  urlLink logos  here (there may be a good reason for that, but I haven't a clue what meaning there might be behind it, and so I have no more words...)
