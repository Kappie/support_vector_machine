 So K, do you think that people didn't really know that Kerry is a "Ted Kennedy Democrat?"  It should have been apparent when Kennedy came out of nowhere to right Kerry's ship when his campaign went into free-fall early on.  If it wasn't, then it must be obvious considering who was with Kerry all night on Super Tuesday.  If what you say is true, then people thought they were going to get a middle-of-the-road democrat, but instead got a left-wing liberal.  Oh!  I feel a great conspiracy theory coming on here.  Maybe, just maybe, the Republicans somehow manipulated the media into painting Dean as a left-wing extremist and John Kerry as someone who leans toward the middle.  Then, after the national conventions, the Bush camp will be able to use Kerry's liberal-ness to turn everyone against him.  Yep, that's definitely it.  Stupid people.
