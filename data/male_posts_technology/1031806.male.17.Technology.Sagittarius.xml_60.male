The turkey bowl turned out to be held at Century High School instead at of one of the church's fields (no mud - a good thing).  I have come to a realization; I suck at football. :)  It still was pretty fun though, there were only three or four people that actually played well, so again, it was fun.  Those four hours were filled with little oddities, ranging from Patrick drinking beer out of a crushed can, to the Century crowd upending the field goal posts, to Cori ripping my backpack, to Nicole later running over it with her car.  I have some quirky friends. :)  Well in reality I'm probably more screwed up then they are. ;)   Anyway, after that Goody and I decided that we wanted to go to Fry's to take advantage of a really good one-day sale.  We attempted coursing numerous people to transport us there, and finally after much misunderstanding, my mom took us.  When we got there, we met an hour-long line which my mom (cool as she is) stayed in for us while we hunted for the stuff we wanted.  As it turned out, the entire trip was a futile effort since almost all the items we wished to procure had sold out long before we got there.  Oh well, it meant that I got to spend more time with Goody, and I am thankful for at least that.    Well, I'm running on steam, and even that's about to give out so I'd better end it there for tonight (this morning - lol).  Listening to:  Deadbeat Holiday - Greenday
