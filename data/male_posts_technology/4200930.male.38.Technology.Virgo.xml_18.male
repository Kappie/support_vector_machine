I even stayed over for tea which was unusual for her to offer! - not ungrateful just puzzled - its not common for her to do this, mind you she did say she was missing some company as my brother works 16:00 through to 21:00 in a local hosptial.  Arriving home I got a rather nice LWE (long white envelope) waiting for me from the radio station Core Control where I won the previous nights competition of Bourne Identity goodies and I'm in the draw on Friday for a holiday, fingers crossed.  Tomorrows another day
