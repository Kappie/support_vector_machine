Written in Haiku, the ancient Japanese poetry form, the syllables flow in a 5-7-5 rhythm.  Good fortune smiling; Computer upgrade is yours, but are you worthy?  Move all project files (and other important things) to the Server now.  Organize your files in subdirectories by the project number.  Personal files may be kept in subfolders in your “My Documents”.  If you pass this test, the Computer Færie will transfer your folders  to your new PC. Keep project files on the Server from now on.   Yeah, what a bunch of bullshit, but I'll bet there are not many IT haikus around.
