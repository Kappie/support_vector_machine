So…I got to crawl out of a warm bed with a hot woman and come to work…I’m so tired right now I’m not even sure if it’ll be a good idea to go back to sleep. I think I Might play some Warcraft 3 and just wait for work to come around…Its 5:18am right now and I’m dreading the day to come.  I really hate being on call sometimes…it seems that anytime something goes wrong it’s always in the morning…at least the guys I’m talking to can speak dork, videogame talk with me…I have that glazed eye look that you get when only either being woke up at 3am, or after about 16 hours of playing video games…I think I might get to go home so I can get enough sleep to wake up feeling crappy. YIPPEE, and to top it off, I drank some expired chocolate milk and my fart emitted a smell that was like someone setting a freshly laid pile of rancid crap on fire, then throwing on some rubber tires and topping that off with some circus clowns…  Nice image eh? Ok, it wasn’t quite that bad, but in the efforts of keeping a good spirit when I’m tired, it was funny...it's 5:39am now...
