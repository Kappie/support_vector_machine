You know...girls bicycling wearing a normally sedate and conservative top, but because they're bent over their handlebars everyone they pass gets a full on downblouse shot.  I dig that.  Alot.  Does that make me pervy?  If so, I guess I'm pervy.  But I believe every guy out there loves the chance at a sneaky glance at something they aren't supposed to see.  It gives our girlfriends and wives endless hours of joy to have a reason to punch us in the shoulder or squirt lime in our eye.  It also gives us a little heartrate increase, and that can only be good.  Unless your near dead with heart problems i guess.  Speaking of squirting lime in the eye, I got that little bit from that corona commercial.  The couple is sitting on the beach, a hottie walks by and the guy's head follows her.  After a second or two the girl reaches in and pulls the lime outta his corona bottle and squirts him in the eye.  I love that commercial; it is SO me and my girlfriend.  Except I'd probably drool too.  Cuz I'm pervy, as we determined one paragraph up.  Uh...yeah that's all I got tonite.  Sorry.
