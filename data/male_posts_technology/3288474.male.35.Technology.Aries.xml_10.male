Having been working on the same company for 5 years, it is not a short time for me, it is almost half of my career so far, and I love the work I was doing, ie. the network protocol development is kind of fun as well as challenge for me. Looking to the future, I don't know if I can get the same fun out of the job, anyway, the money to support the life is more important. During the 5 years, even it maybe only a short time from some points of view, the company has been changed a lot, from Motorola to VanguardMS, with different style of company cultures, you can feel the different bettween working for a big company and a middle(or small) size company, during these years, you can also feel the big changes in the IT field, and the global econocial changes, people are talking about IT jobs outsourcing, the outlook is pretty dim for IT worker in America like us. Anyway, this is a change in my life, maybe it is even a chance for me, or maybe I am just too much optimistic and should keep in mind the tough life waiting for me?
