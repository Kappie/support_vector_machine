Once I get fast internet here I will do some serious flaming on their boards.  I have never had anything against G4, I saw some clips from E3 on their site before they took over techtv. It is a gaming channel and I wanted it, but knew I would never get it.  They merged and swallowed all of the techtv shows whole. Call for help is gone, and most of the time G4's shows are on, less than 1/4 are old techtv shows. I wish there were just 2 channels and I had both. Who's idea was it ANYWAY!  Oh well.  If you didn't know I moved my first load to tyler and my room is actually above the bottom 4 feet.  I will have some more time to do stuff this summer, maybe start on my webcomic. I have been thinking about it and I may never start on Farkle. It is a lot of work, and I would rather bring you guys some other content that is fun to make.  See you at a-kon!
