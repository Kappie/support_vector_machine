Work's all done - ready for a big party weekend!   It's time for a good ol' BBQ at Salon's place. Salon has played host to a number of spectacular parties. This past new years being one of the best ever!   Anyways... I put on my sexyist pair of shorts and my tightest t-shirt ever... hopin' the ladies would want to feel me up.   Get to the partay - and get the drinkin' started!   Doesn't take too long for people to start with the "Shaun's cut off" comments ("")... which is a little worrying because I'd only had 1 beer at this point - thus begins my feelings of bein' unaccepted. Note - Shaun can be paranoid and drinkin' intensifies this affect.   See I was trying a whole new let's be chatty and sociable thang - didn't go over to well - I think it mostly scared people. Aparantly I'm loud.   There are times when people tell me to be louder - and now it's "be a little quieter". It would seem that I can find no happy medium. Of course - this is my fault - no real attempt to find this happy medium has been made whatsoever.   So I leave the party - had an offer to go down to the states and hang out with a friend. Seeing as how I felt I was being rejected by the partiers - alittle too rowdy if you will. I figured it would be good to get away and see this friend for a while - we'd have some laughs - I wouldn't be so aggitative to others.   I go and gas up - head home - throw on some pants - get back on the road - and it turns out that was a bad idea. It wouldn't be fun with just me - no one wants just me - I'm not roudy enough ;) Which obviously doesn't make much sense seeing as how I (felt I) was being rejected for being too loud at the party (sorry just needed a littlebitch bitch moan moan complain complain - and I'm done!)   So now I'm back at the party - people start to miss the sexy outfit I had on (boy that sounds a little gay) - I can't win - but meh, whatever. There are some new people - so I figure I'll mingle with them - why not they're cute young girls!! I love cute young girls.   So I get a little tipsy - end up in thewashroom with two of them :P and this part will be sensored... just kidding. Nothing happened in the bathroom - well it got a little hot so I took off my shirt. I'm going to do that more often - I enjoy being topless - I also encourage others to feel the same way and follow suit.   Anyways people want to use the washroom for its purpose - we move our partay across the hall.   I should say that our partay consists of myself, Tiffy, Court and Greg. Good kids. Anyways Tiffy starts givin' Greggy a back rub... so I get down and request the pleasure of a back rub from Courtney. She gives a heck of a good back rub - fella's, she's got magic fingers!   So this is going so well, I decide to roll over (I learned that from my dog). Court and I then proceeded to make out - it was hott and it was heavy ;) I love kissin' - it's fun!   Greg and Tiff wouldn't leave the room - wanted to be there to WATCH out for their friend -of course. So I then invited Courtney to go find another place to "get fresh" - she agreed. *Grin*   So we head upstairs - oh look - a footon... choiceexcellent (this phrase borrowed from the ex Sarah)...   Now as you may be aware - I get quite sweaty - I believe that some of the medication I'm on makes me sweat - a lot! So I asked if it would be alright if I took off my clothing - everything except my boxers. I, of course was completely ok with this - Courtney is a sweet young girl - I would not take advantage of her.   Harmless, nearly naked makin' out - that's all that was going on.   What's this I hear - key's jingling outside the door - people want to come in. I am in my boxers - not that I would have minded people seeing me - all of me - but still - I wouldn't want them to think poorly of Courtney.   I go to the door and open it - there's Xuan-thy, Patrick, Justin and I believe Justin's older bro Jeff was there (quite mad). In my drunken stupor I managed to pick his room - hehe - whoops!   They also had a camera - got some good pics I hope - maybe they'll send me some so I can share with you all.   The photo taking was all quite flattering... in fact I encourage more photos of Shaun and Shaun Jr.   So I get dressed - head out to talk to them - Jeff is quite angry with me - I can understand him being upset - but I'd hoped that we could work this out- only a littlemisunderstanding. Nothing worthy of a beheading.   So -  everyone   agreed  it wouldn't be a good idea for me to try and talk to Jeff at this point. Needs some time to cool down - I'm perfectly ok with this.   However... dun dun dun... I can't understand why everyone - even my closest friends, think it would be best if I left. I sometimes get the feeling like people disown me quickly when even the smallest little thing happens. Shaun? Who's Shaun?(I invite people to offer their comments on this one - an open discussion) don't get me wrong - I'm not mad at anyone for this - I just don't understand it. Maybe it's just the beer affecting my perception of things - but I thought that people enjoyed my unusual drunken hi-jynx - gives people something to laugh about. Am I not a quirky - wacky friend? I'm not questioning my friends love for me - I just want to know if my friendshave genuine concerns about how I act when I get drunk? If it bothers people - I'll stop.   So I say ok - I apologize to Justin for upsetting his brother. I didn't intend to cause this trouble. I send a special invitation to Justin and his brother to my BBQ next month - it'll be a good time - we can bury the hatchet - literally even - I have a big back yard - a little diggin' would be fun!   So I head out to my car -  sad  that I have to go... Courtney comes with me - we stand outside of my car - chatting for a while. It was fun - I enjoy chatting. Kissing and chatting (hmmmm sounds like the making of a good hobby if you ask me! - which I know you would)   Anyways - Courtney and I end up inside my car. More chatting - and after a little while - more kissing - YAY!   Obviously distrot without me - Geoff and others come out looking for me. Excellent sneaking up on the car. One time Chris even played an sexcellent decoy (dropped his trousers), diverting our attention while Xuan-thy snuck up with the camera... many more excellent photo's takin' (kinda like paparatzi - I felt so famous even dropped the few inhibitions I had about being  "watched"  - there was many a moon and even some testi. Poor Bob had naked man body rubbed all over her windows. Some of those guys had really greasy asses too - kinda troubleling. There was some nice scratches left on the hood of my car - thanks guys - that's super! It's ok - Bob needs a good detailin' - might get some use of the buffer I have in the garage. I'll need some cut polish - I think?   Anyways - it's now 3:30 am and the party comes to an end - thus ends another adventure! Well - at least I had fun - did you?   **********************************************************************************   Afterthoughts -  Shaundiggity :   I feel so great about being young and free - and heck I even kept my cool about the whole bedroom thing - I'm proud of myself. I am getting better - not so moody - might even say that I'm not as much of a head case anymore. My apologies are actually sincere - I will make an effort to not cause the same problem twice- you have to admit it's getting better - it's getting better all the time - Just like Zellers,   it's getting better and better!
