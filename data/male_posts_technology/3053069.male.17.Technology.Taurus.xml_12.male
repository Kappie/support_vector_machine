It is a good relationship, not only is she my beautiful girlfriend, but we keep things rolling in the regular friendship. THats just the way i like it. She sent me a blog she did before she ever talk to me, wow it was cool. She like predicted the future of me and her almost. Anywho I miss her during the day it stinks, its even worse is that i get to see her not very often. ok got to go. Bye Brando and Heather.
