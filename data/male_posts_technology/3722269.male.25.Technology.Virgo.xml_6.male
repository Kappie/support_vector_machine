Anyway.. I couldnt make out what they were saying, and its a bit obvious to stroll into the middle of it all and go 'whats happening?' so I went and got my supplies and had a chuckle to good ol' Jai my indian homie that runs the 4square. I came out and walked along the front of the shops to..er..go to the..laundromat that isnt open yet? yeah thats it.. and inadvertantly walk right past the cops talking.. they're just radioing in the car as being stolen. No big deal, no big drama.. why the fuck did they need 4 units and 8 cops to recover a stolen car, and book the occupants? judging by the smell and fuckedness (yes thats a word) of the car, I'd say it had been evading the cops.. and as the uniforms make the kids from the school over the other side of town.. they'd chased them a fair way. Damn that I didnt see them pull up.. come to think of it I didnt hear them either.. ahh well. Blame winamp. That's the story. Anyway, this is where rotorua differs to auckland.. the car these guys stole (assumption) was a 92 facelift subaru sedan, non-turbo.. white. Rusty as fuck. Probably worth about $1500, and get this.. it had a set of chromies on it, probably from some nice Auckland car, worth about $5000. I think Rotorua is where all aucklands' stolen stuff comes to be sold off, and redistributed - on that note, let me know if you're after anything - I'll hook you up nig-GUH! peace out.
