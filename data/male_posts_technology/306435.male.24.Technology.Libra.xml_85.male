She did well going 1-3 in the first game with an RBI.  It  was  a softball game and ended up in a tie.  They played a second game and lost, but they had quite some fun.    Friday, after work I hung out with Ann after she had a phone interview with JVC (Jesuit Volunteer Corp) We went for Ice Cream at Maggie Moo's with Marrisa, Chris, and Jeff.  It was fun.  We also went up to this apartment Jeff had found and saw an awesome view of the city.  Saturday Ann won an award from the Computer Science Department for service and won $50.  She treated me to a meal at Beni Hana's.  That place is awesome.  It was also prom night so Ann and I had lots of fun people watching.  When we got back we met up with Chris and Marrisa again and Elizabeth was home with Hallie.  We went over to a bar in the Newport Levee.  It was an Irish bar and I forget the name,  the atmosphere seemed fake and artificial (well of course it was fake and artificial), but we had fun.  Sunday, I watched the football draft with Justin and Tom.  Bernard ddn't get drafted.  We went to BW3's and watched the PPV, also.  Today Ann found out she got accepted to JVC.  They placed her in Montana.  She will be at a women's shelter and living with a house of other volunteer's.  Justin also got offered a permanent job.  He hasn't accepted, but as much as he aggrivates me i think it would be od not to have him around.  That is about it from here...oh yeah, no baseball news whih is a bad thing...I emailed the president and hope this is just a communication problem...I am afraid it may not be.  Also, kristin I need your apartment address...i have something to send you!  All from here...
