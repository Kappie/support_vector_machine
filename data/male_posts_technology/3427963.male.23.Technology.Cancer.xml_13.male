So tired but also quite a good week cos dun have to stay in office everyday. I agree wif thomas, gals in singapore r getting pretty fine and wow, did i have a diabetic week in NUS.....but HY is still the one in my mind now......hehe i very zhuan yi one i tell u....overall its a fun week lah.   Found out during midweek that hy actually reads my blog.  (cannot write bad things bout her liow haha)  Was both happy and shocked to find out lah, that she actually bothers to read.  (maybe too bored, thats y)  Happy becos she will find out how i feel bout her and shocked cos this is suppose to be my personal diary kind of thing.....  ( and she wont even let me take a peak into her small calender diary...kns -_-" ) but i dont mind lah, i respect her privacy. She had been working really hard and i very scared that she will fall sick. Hope that she stay healthy forever. She has this badhabit of staying up late at nite and its bad for health if she dont kick the habit. ( yan, remember the newspaper cutting we saw in NUH??) Try kicking the habit and sleep earlier can?? for my sake? Can??(i doubt so hehe)   I will be performing again this coming Sunday and the next coming sunday also from 3 to 5.30 in the afternoon. And same thing lah...super last min notice one. Ah du always like that one but also good lah, cos i dont mind also since sunday nothing on one lah hehe.....If free can come lor...    Cheers,   Teddy (u're still the 1,   urlLink  Y@n   )
