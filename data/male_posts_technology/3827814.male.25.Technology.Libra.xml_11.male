I took my contacts out last night because I figured they may have been at least partially responsible. Who knows, it might just be a fluke, but my eyes seem to be much better today.  It's hard to believe how tiresome this has been. Every morning for the past several days, I've woken up having my eyes nearly glued shut and at work I'd be continuously wiping it from my eyes. All that rubbing caused the area around my eye to get dry and hurt. To combat the dryness, I started carrying around a tube of lotion, which helped a bit.  I woke up late since I played "Texas Hold'em" Poker with a few of my roommates last night. We played with some of our spare change. Things started good, but I ended up loosing everything in the end. I blame it on luck. Because I didn't get to sleep until after 1am. As a result I didn't wake up until around 9:30am. Hence, I got to work later than my usual 9:00-9:30am, at around 10:30am.  I must have just spaced out for several hours (a la Office Space), because I can't quite remember what I did. I think I spent it IMing with Steven W. I went to lunch, came back and IMed some more. I had planned on getting some work done today. Just no ambition I guess. I've been quite distractable.  I did get some stuff done. In an IM conference I set up with Cheri and Kristi, we did some school class rescheduling so that we could take more classes together. I'm a little disappointed that I won't be able to take French 101 with Kristi though. I'd really been looking forward to that. I've already taken this class, but I figure I need a refresher. Kristi wants to take French II with me the following semester and I fear unless I take 101 over again, I won't be prepared for it. I'm still a little unsure whether I want to take by myself though. I've got it set up to take Sign Language with Kristi too. However, she told me not to. She seems to think it'll be way over my head, and she may be right, but I think I'll rush in where angels fear to tread on this one.  I decided at some point that I wanted to read a romance novel and who better to ask about which ones to read than Heather, Kristi, and Cheri? So I posed a slew of questions to them, probing them to find out which I should read. I've now got two authors and 5 books that I'm considering. Here they are  Jude Devereaux "Sweet Liar"  Johanna Lindsey "Gentle Rouge" "Silver Angel" "Gentle Feuding" "Hearts AFlame"  I read reviews and excerpts from all of them and must say that the one I want to read most is "Sweet Liar". Heather told me she's already mailed it and now I'm waiting with baited breath for its arrival.  After awhile, everyone but Heather seemed to have left the IM and she wasn't responding, so I decided to call to see what they were all doing. Apparently Heather and Steven left to have lunch with Steve's mentor. Kristi was reading a Jude Devereaux book (I wish I'd asked which one) and Cheri was watching some show.  I was feeling a little tired so I went into a conference room and took a nap, as I've been in the practice of doing. I didn't sleep too well as maintenance seems to have an overly agressive cooling system going.  When I woke up I was feeling a little lonely and dejected. Then an idea hit me. I've always wanted to keep a diary and what better way to do it than make it accessible to family and friends. So I found www.blogger.com and began writing. I think this really helps me to sort out my thoughts.
