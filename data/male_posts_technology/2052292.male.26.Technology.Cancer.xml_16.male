I blamed the outage on the storm since  that's normal. Tonight he decided to try harder and managed to  disconnect everyone from the chat by flooding it enough and overloading  the server. My connection was unaffected. My server didn't even die.  Soon everyone was back in. Strike two putzo. I also remembered a  setting for flooding and lowered the time for kicking someone for  flooding.       Why do people even try? I mean find somewhere else to go. We have  simple rules. You broke them. We don't want you around anymore. geez...
