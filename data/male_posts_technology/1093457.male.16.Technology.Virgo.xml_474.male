I hope you get a smashing tan on your holiday, its nice to have a tan, it makes you feel generally better about yourself. Oh, and I will give you my address when I next see you if you don't have the full one already. That is if you even want mine!  Oh yea i can write about everybody who fancies Simon the new boy!  wa? Can you flesh that out a bit please..... Glad you guys had fun at the concert :) I was listening to my sisters Bon Jovi album and it is pretty good. I prefer Bryan Adams though.  Bless you Max you really are obsessed. Posting on ere at 3 in the morning. Outrageous. Do you not sleep? Well today I am doing sod all so if anyone wants to go to the park to sunbathe and generally just mill about down there contact me before 1. LOL.
