Seems that Tom was expecting snow when he woke up.  Not more than 15 minutes later there was a layer of white covering the ground.  It didn't stop for several hours.  In the south that means mass chaos.  Speaking of chaos...can that Ashton Kutcher film look any worse?    So Monday morning the roads were a mess.  Nothing like leaving for work 20 minutes earlier and arriving 15 minutes late.  Other than snow there is not too much news around here.  I have kept up the work out thing.  Ann and I go to the YMCA every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  I am up to 3 miles on the elliptical machine.  Like I said, not much going on.   I do suggest reading the Sports guy  urlLink SuperBlog  this week on ESPN Page 2.
