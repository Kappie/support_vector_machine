I've made a bet with little Jeff that I'll lost 10kg before he gain 10kg.  Somehow, I'm confident that I can win this bet.  And by the way, it's the biggest bet I've ever had in my life.  And lose 10kg won't be easy...  Time really flies...  Day after day, week after week.  1 hour seems like nothing nowadays.  And a week or 2 seems not so far away.  I have this theory that "as we grow up, we get used to 'time'".  Like when u sit in hot water (bearable hot water) long enough, you don't feel hot anymore - when we have passed enough time, we don't feel time passing by anymore.  Time  Spaces are... miracles... if God is almighty, would He be able to turn back time?  Funny whenever I starts writing on blog, I feel like ... sad ...  Interesting, gotta investigate how come the way things are the way they are...
