If my math is correct, that calculates out to be about $0.80 per day (excluding tax if their is any?).  Lets see, last week my lunch went down something like this:  Monday:  Country Fried Pork Tuesday:  Chicken Fried Beef Steak Wednesday:  Chicken Fried Chicken Steak Thursday:  Chicken Fried Chicken Friday:  (Out to lunch @ the local Chinamen establishment)  Although I knew from looking at the package's title of the banquet dinners what type of meat I was supposedly eating,  I'm willing to bet that on all five (5) days - it is likely that I ate the same "meat product".  Note: for $0.80 i recieve nearly 50% of the fat  sodium I need for one day.  God bless.  2)  Seinfeld is on for two hours everyday.  Which I rarely miss unless I'm oblidged to be somewhere else that I probably don't want to be (like at my parents or at softball or at friends wedding).  TBS: 6:30, 7:00 FOX: 7:30  3)  Chicago White Sox - they are just shitty enough to let my Minnesota Twins consistenly win Central Division Championships.  4)  Lack of severe body hair.  I don't have much of it above the waist which I am very grateful for.  I can boldly say that I have less chest  mustache hair then at least two of my ex-girlfriends.  I'm a man, a man that does not have intense body fur.  5)  Drunk Dancing.  No, not "Dirty Dancing", but drunk dancing.  The act where highly intoxicated men  women decide that they are most likely the best boogier in a bar/club and figure the only way to prove it is to shake that thang on the dance floor.  I am 100% for drunk dancing as it often leads to other activities that only occur when individuals are totally smashed and unlikely to know each others first/last names.  Note - I will not  did not make a move on your gal R.B. - no matter what she claims.  6)  hmmm...
