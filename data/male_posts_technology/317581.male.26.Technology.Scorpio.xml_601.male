I think sometimes there is a time and a place for drugs. and then there is also a time and a place to be drug free. For me, being drug free is key right now. I'm trying to stay at the top of my game, and I'm a bit tired now, w/o any drugs. I don't know where I'm going with this, so I'm just going to stop.      Well, I have too many things to do. Including pay my bills and sleep, so I'll try and remember what I wanted to talk to my bloggy neighbors about, and will get back to you.      Peace-   T
