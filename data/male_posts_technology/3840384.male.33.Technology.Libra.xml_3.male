Reading a book in the morning, lunch with some friends, back home to watch a movie, then reading more of the book, followed by dinner (from which I just got back), and now I am watching another movie. So in the end I really goofed off all day, with accomplices. It doesn't get any better than this, does it?  Well, ok -- sometimes it does. But this was really nice anyway. Some days you have to not do any work. And another word for that is today. :-)
