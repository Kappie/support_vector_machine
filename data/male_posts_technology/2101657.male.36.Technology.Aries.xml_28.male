And we saw 13 people who just had to be out of their minds!  We walked past the restort, and over the rail-road tracks, by the ShotTower.  We stood at the top of the north end of the sidewalk, and saw 13 people standing on the MIDDLE of the frozen Mississippi river ice fishing!     This is a ways down-stream from the lock and dam.  We've heard the river moaning/cracking before, but to see *13* people ice fishing ON it [shakes head] that just seems nuts. Especially since the temp has been getting into the 40's the last week. We had snow and rain Friday, and more rain today.  The forcast calls for temps in the 40's all week [spring is springing!! WOOHOO!!].  Well, after the walk along the river, we went to BestBuy. I want to get a copy of DVD X Copy before they are forced to take it off the shelf. It's a really easy to use program, to use with your DVD burner. You can then make a back-up copy of your DVD.  The court says it's illegal now, but why not? Why should you not be allowed to make a backup copy, so incase your original gets scratched beyond all recognition and wont read anymore, should you not be allowed to backup your DVD?  Pure stupidity on the courts side..  Then we went over to the mall, to look around in the book store   and then wonder around in the video store and the game store.  Then it was off to Bishops to do as much as we could stand to eat from their buffett  .   It was in Best Buy that my head started to throb. Bright sunlight from out side, and while I was looking at software, some guy is on a PC right behind me, with MP3's he wants to buy BLASTING behind my head.  We got home about 4:45-5pm, and the first thing I did was to crawl in bed.  Where I thankfully fell asleep. I did wake up about 8-8:30 feeling totally ready to puke, but didn't, and fell back asleep.  I got out of bed at 8am... so that put me in bed sleeping for roughly 15hrs.  Yup, thats a very productive time..  Considering I had 50 pages to read for class, and 40 excersises to do, plus a program....all for tomorrow night.  Well, I've got the first 2 sections of exercices done, still have 10 pages to read, and a program to write.  I have some after work, that I'll work on my program. I'll get the reading and problems done yet tonight.  Oh the joy of being a college student!
