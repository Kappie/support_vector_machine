Does the idea of a shadowy mushroom cloud on the horizon seem not so odd? That dark looking gentleman that passed you on the street, did you second guess his intentions? The plane that just flew by, do you wonder where EXACTLY it's going?  Don't.  Live life globally, but don't repress your freedoms.  Do what you can to understand what goes on outside the borders of this country.  The more we understand our world, the more we can keep this from becoming an end to the peace we cherish.  The whole world should enjoy what we STILL have.
