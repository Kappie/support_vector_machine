Though the novel was not that great in terms of the storyline, the characterisation was impeccable. Those characters were totally real-life. I loved it. The book was an amalgam of a kidnapping story, multiple murders and psychos with a few insanely infuriating twists thrown in. It was made into a movie, starring Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross. Now I am looking forward to meeting Alex Cross in "Kiss The Girls".  David Morrell's "Testament" began with the line,"It was the last morning the four of them would ever be together." After that it was one of the most shocking story of what it means to be hunted. For journalist Reuben Bourne the nightmare begins when he breaks a promise to cast a paramilitary white supremacy group in a favorable light-a fateful decision that will shatter his life. A basically peaceful man with a paradoxical attraction for violence, Reuben suddenly faces an enemy driven by an obsessive, unrelenting hate. Now to survive this ordeal, he must lead his family on a desperate flight into the wilderness-a world as harsh and unforgiving as the fanatics who hunt him. The story has a totally unexpected shocking ending. I really did not expect the novel to end like that.
