Chatting with a friend of mine on yahoo who lives about 3 hours away from me.  Should drive up to see her soon. I drank a whole fuckin' 6 pack last night.  I so don't want to go to work today.  Don't really have a hangover... guess I'm just lucky this time.  My bed is calling to me something fierce.  I can already feel that this 9 hour work day is gonna feel like 18 hours.  I'm definitely not looking forward to it. Eh... I'll write more later.  I'm bored now.
