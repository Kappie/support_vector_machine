It has a neat plugin model and it is really easy to install and modify through straightforward .rc files.  Among all the plugins (most of them with source code available). I found the bbzCmdEx  and SystemBarEx particularly useful. It definitively rocks!!!. If you are missing the ancient days in which most of the tools could be easily accessed via command prompt (I'm sure  urlLink I'm not alone  here), or if you are tired of the usually cluttered appeareance of your current desktop, you'd love this piece.  This is the way my desktop looks now.    urlLink    Ramiro's desktop urlLink      The box in the top left corner is the command prompt (bbzCmdEx plugin), in which you can (among other things) invoke any program that could be found in the PATH environment variable (I often use the classic developer commands: devenv.exe, isqlw.exe, iisreset and some other administrative such as ipconfig, net.exe,   urlLink taskkill ,  urlLink openfiles ,  urlLink shutdown  and  urlLink such ); you can also search in the web (?google dot net resources), create shortcuts for commonly used programs ("ie" for internet explorer, "np" for notepad, etc) and it even it has a simple calculator (=(3.20 * 2.5)).  In the bottom, a little bar displaying the amount of CPU and memory used (SystemBarEx plugin); you can also add other values (such as IpAddress, MachineName, UserName, etc.), just like sysinternal's  urlLink bginfo   tool.  It's cool, isn't it? The simpler, the better !!!
