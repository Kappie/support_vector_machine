I ended up In Zebra on Saturday and it was like Celebrity Deathmatch, but without the celebrities. I saw some 30 year old chick screaming at her boyfriend at the bar, and the poor fella was there drinking his beer and grinning. Women, eh. :P  Right, I think the time has come to reveal our mystical plan for our Christmas do. Danger's idea, and i'm helping him draw up the (laminated) rules.. it's based loosely on the book "The Diceman" by Luke Rhinehart. Basically we are going to go out, taking a few dice with us. (Benefit of being a sad role-playing geek - loads of different sided dice..) So we well have a six-sided dice for the bars we can go to.  1 - Sports 2 - Chambers 3 - Royal Yacht 4 - Trader 5 - Whorehouse 6 - er.. We must have one more.. um... Jurassic Park for comedy value  You can see where I am going with this, the places we go, the drinks we have, and even the poor, naive and unsuspecting women we unleash our libidos on - all decided on the roll of a dice. Of course we may have to scale the drinks down a bit or we'll all be fucked by 8 PM. Say a random shot an hour and normal drinks otherwise.  Also, Zoolander rules apply. No turning left, shoot-out, left hand drinking etc...etc.. Maybe even a few rounds of CHICKEN if you're good little campers.  So post your choice now, Friday or Saturday... ?
