Make abet withmyself, if I cannot come to office everyday for the rest 10 days, then I'll shave my head bold.    Actually it's 9 days if I go 高雄 with Claire this Friday.    36 Days left in Taiwan. And now I'm going after this girl. That seems not very logical. As usual, there are no means to justify my action because I can't justify my action.    If everything goes well, my blog will become Love Log soon. However, it won't last.    And everything won't go well, I presume. I've talked with her on phone for 2 hours yesterday, and already I feel tired --> this is such a waste of time and effort. I'm not saying going after girls is waste of time, but going after a girl that'll be parted soon is, a waste of time.    And at the end (if everything goes well), I'll just hurt her and hurt myself.    So why am I still doing it?  ........... ....... ...  Because I'm lonely, I guess.    Last Friday I was joking with my ex-gf that I'm going after her again. And she replied firmly that she got a bf already and I should quit wasting my time anymore.  And that was the moment I felt the lonest ever since she left me.   Love is the cure for loneliness, therefore, I'm seeking a cure.    There, I have probably justified my action...  To be honest, I'm rather sick and tired of the whole "slowly-getting-to-know-each-other" process. That's why I felt tired after just spend 2 hours on the phone with her. We could have speak longer, if I didn't quit.   Speaking of the phone call... I have to admit that the things we've talked about was relatively interesting. It could be super obviously already that I want to go after her, ergo, our conversation was mainly focus on what each other thinks of relationship, marriage, kids and future...  So all these weird questions like:  "Would you look down agirl if she goes after you?" "Would you mind if your wife's salary is higher than you?"  Somehow, it seems to me that she wants to take it slowly, step by step. Seriously, I don't mind, and I think it ought to be fun at this point, ere we become a couple.   But the problem is: Time, I DON'T HAVE.  Andshe knows this as well as I do.  This problem makes the whole going after process rather awkward and unnatural.  So......................................... I decided to speed things up a little.    Success or fail, I don't really mind.    Tonight is supposely our first informal date (going out alone). We are going to watch Spider Man 2 (what a romantic movie). And  I'll propose.   Let me rewind a little....  She asked me to go 高雄 on a 3 day trip this Friday. I don't really want to go because her sister is tagging alone. Not that I do mind about her sister, it's just that I don't like going out with odd number of people because 1 will doom to feel left out at some point, especially when you guys don't know each other THAT well.    Plus, I have a company trip to attend this Saturday. Going 高雄 is rather troublesome for me.   Plus, haven't I just decided that I'll come to office everyday for the rest 10 days???    Well... if she or her sister find another person to come alone, I might think about it again. After all, I am going after her.   ... back to the proposal part.    Here's my plan for today:    - 6:30Dinnerat Burger King  - 7:40 Spider Man 2  - 11:00 Coffe Shop in 樹林  - 11:30 Propose    Seems like a perfect plan~ I'm especially fond of the Burger King part.    ...    Anyways, I'll c... it seems like a pretty screw-up plan at this point.    I want to spend some time to describe Claire in detail, but I'll do that if I have time in the afternoon.    If I didn't do it in the afternoon, and if I didn't success tonight, the reason to do it may not exist anymore.    That's... that for now, I'll think harder later...
