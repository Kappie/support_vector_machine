I mean, I'm all for relentless persuit of criminals. But when you look into this DA's history, I bet even an innocent man would not be able to escape his grasp for long.  I hate it when the supposed good guys in a criminal case (D.A., prosecutor, police, judge) are clearly biased in favor of one outcome. Just like the judge in the Microsoft case who gave press interviews before the end of the anti-trust trial basically slamming the company and its practices.   In my mind, a district attorney should say "The evidence clearly points to this person as the perpetrator". Not "I know in my heart this scum-bag did it. I'm just waiting for some solid evidence and then I'm going to nail his ass!" Perhaps I watch too much CSI. Grissom is my hero -- let the evidence tell you what happened.
