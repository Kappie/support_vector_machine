Taking the time and the effort to put it together with her own two hands.  Taking the time and the effort to collect ther materials.  Taking the time and the effort to know me and to include those things that I like.  My favorite color, my favorite insect.  She gave me a gift, and it means so much more.  No one has ever taken the time or the effort to make somehing like that for me.  Never.  Every time I see it, it reminds me of her, and how much she means to me, and how lucky I am to know her, and how sweet and wonderful she is.  She gave me love.
