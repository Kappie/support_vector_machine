Granted Ebert has done more than anyone to bring film reviewing to the public via TV. Yes his movie answerman column is a good but Elvis speaks my tounge as a fanboy.. The man interviews Frank Miller on his  urlLink radio show !   urlLink Elvis Mitchell leaves the Times - New York Times film critics  urlLink   urlLink
