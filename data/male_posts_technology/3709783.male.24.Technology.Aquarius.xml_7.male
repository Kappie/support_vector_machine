I guess both accounts will in-turn generate new invitations to pass out to others?  I have generated a few filters and contacts, I bookmarked this migration  urlLink tool , sent a few emails, and that is it.  So far, so good.   In other, much more somber news, the   "One Piece"   Anime Boxset collection  purchased through  urlLink ebay  shipped with no first box..  I contacted the seller and they promise it will be here soon.  The shipping cost is too high not to be annoyed by all this.  At least now I have episodes 31-120.    Just in time for our semimonthly journey to Bloomington/Normal Illinois. Sasha and I make this journey to visit my old college roomates: Craig and Cro.  My good friend and his little brother also make the journey, from my home town, leaving us with six people crammed into a small apartment with their gaming machines.  This installment could see the return of  Everquest  as the major game of the LAN Party Weekend.  Last time this happened I got so burnt out on EQ that I vowed to never play it again.  I will be sure to report back on the ass-kickings I administ0r.
