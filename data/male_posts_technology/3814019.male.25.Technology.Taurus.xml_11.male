Better yet, maybe they will knock at my door and offer me some great deals. Some days i'm lucky and they send me emails and it makes life so simple... Well that's what moron sales people seem to think anyway.        I don't know about you, but I don't see something I like and think "oh, I like that, but I'll just hang on for now, maybe someone will try to sell it me over the phone or at my door". I got a call of a confident speaking guy the other day, he said I could save ten pounds a month on my phone bill, I told him in no uncertain terms to naff off for the simple fact that I hate cold calls. Why the hell would I trust the word of a complete stranger on the phone and sign up to something I have never even heard of before? Service station credit card girls are another pet hate of mine, they prey on the walking penises of this world. "hello there" said the gorgeous suited blonde as she battered her eyelids "can I talk to you for a moment?" The testosterone controlled ones amongst us inevitably succumb to these vicious sales sirens and end up filling in applications for credit cards before they can say "I only came in for a pee".        Even the service station car parks are no haven from dodgy sales people. I often got cars pulling up beside me as I read my paper, they invariably had strange vague European accents (the kind English people do when imitating strange Europeans) "hello there my friend" the dialogue would begin "I am on my way back from a trade fair, and have these fine designer samples still in my car, would you like to buy them, very cheap, from me, I would hate to carry them all the way home". Its at that point I oftenthought about the sheer volume of sales reps that must frequent these fairs, and why the hell didthey always end up withso many samples spare?        Sorry, I have to cut this one short, I just got an email about penis enlargements I have been waitingfor ages to arrive.
