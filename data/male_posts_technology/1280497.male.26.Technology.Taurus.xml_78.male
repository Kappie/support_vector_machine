If I actually learn how to play, this will give me something to cross off the list of things to do before I die. I have always wanted to take lessons, and I think it's going to be worth it. How come more older people don't take lessons to learn how to play an instrument. Is it because there isn't time? Is it because people just don't care to know how to play?  Or is it because there isn't a good way to explain the action? I'm not sure, but I am super excited to learn how to play. I'll probably be less excited when it sinks in that I have to practice for the next five years to even be decent.
