Brown believes (no matter what anyone else says) that Linus copied Linux from Minix, which is a for-study-purposes-only Unix-like OS, written by the noted professor and author of famous Computer Science books like  Computer Networks  and  Operating Systems , Andrew S Tanenbaum.  2. Brown visited AST in Amsterdam to interview him for the book. AST surprisingly, supported Linus and said there was no reason to believe Linus did not write Linux on his own.  3. Brown hired someone to compare the initial versions of Linux, and the then available versions of Minix. The  urlLink conclusion of the comparison  was that no one had copied anything. The details are  urlLink  here .  4. Ken Brown didn't care what anyone said (still doesn't) and continued with his book. He published some excerpts of his forthcoming book, titled  Samizdat  (the excerpts, not the book). The excerpts, (funnily) can be  bought   urlLink  here . A press-release giving some detail about the study/book is  urlLink here .  5. Linus responded saying that Yes,  urlLink  "I was just a front-man for the real fathers of Linux, the Tooth Fairy and Santa Claus." .  6. Tanenbaum also responded with  urlLink  this information  about his interview with Ken Brown and other clarifications.  7.  urlLink  Followup  by AST on the issue.  8.  urlLink  Reply by Ken Brown  to Tanenbaum's response.  9.  urlLink  Rebuttal  by AST to Brown's response.   The reason Ken Brown approached Tanenbaum in the first place is probably because of Tanenbaum's Jan 1992 post on comp.os.minix called  urlLink Linux is Obsolete . I highly recommend reading the whole thing (if you are a geek) even though it's quite long. There's another interesting thread on similar lines which I came across a few years ago. It's related to this thread, I think. If someone knows what I'm talking about, please let me know. I'd printed both the threads out (came to be about 20-30 pages, I think, in small font) and read the whole stack.  I'll be back with more updates on this Soap Opera as it unfolds.  Appendix The  urlLink  Slashdot post  that pointed me to the latest stuff.     This blog is dedicated to my grandmother, who passed away at 5am IST on 9-June-2004.   I'll miss you, Nani.
