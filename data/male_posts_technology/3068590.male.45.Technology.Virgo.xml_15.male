The champion will be either Kimi Raikonen, with the second alternative being Juan Pablo Montoya.  Constructors championship will go to McLaren.  I hope that Jenson Button recognizes the efforts of one Jacques Villienueve in his current success. I am certain that Dave Richards and Button will realize the former champion efforts by the end of this year. They will look back at the end of the year and wonder how they were so successful at the beginning and how did they tail off.  Time for Patrick Head and Sir Frank to seriously consider the replacement of Ralph. The man does not deserve a license, let alone a Williams. Time to get Jacque back and make some hay with the BMW boys early.
