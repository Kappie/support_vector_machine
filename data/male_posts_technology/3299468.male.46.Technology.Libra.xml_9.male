Last night I was up almost all night in extreme discomfort with what I suspect is a bladder infection. Symptoms, mild mostly, began about two weeks ago but came to a crux last night. Ouch. In the course of the visit they determined that my blood pressure is high and the doctor wants to have my blood checked for diabetes. Prostitis, thankfully, is not likely the cause of my current condition. He's prescribed Cipro, an antibiotic, for a week. May seems to think Cipro is weak and ineffective. I hope not.
