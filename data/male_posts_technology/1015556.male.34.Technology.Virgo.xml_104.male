I strongly dislike the definition of 'missions' the author is propogating here.   "Reaching out to people, or “missions,” is best defined as loving people." Uh, no, sorry.  Missions is not just reaching out to people.   Yuck.  If we keep on telling people thats what missions is, the nations will NEVER be reached.  NEVER.  What would compel someone to go with a definition like that.  I mean, why even bother??   But alas, I think there is hope with one of the comments from the story.  Tyler Watts, nice!
