One as big as her according to the description given by Karissa herself.  The conversation did not last long though as she was headed to the water with the cell phone and I saw disaster looming so I told her to give me hugs and kisses and go play in the water...without the cell phone.  Of course the desire to hear Jon's phone hit the water was almost overwhelming but I opted for Karissa's fun day to remain fun.  Then I proceeded to buy tickets for Karissa's trip.  Now I know why people fly and do not take the bus!  It would have been easier to get the tickets if I had been Osama bin laden getting on an airplane.  On top of that they wanted to nickel and dime me for every little thing.  Talk about a pain in the ass.  But I finally got it figured out.
