Many of you know that I still don't have an internet connection at home.  Why?  Because they cost too damn much.  My landlord might get fired if he shares his connection with me.  Something about me possibly downloading kiddie porn or something (which I wouldn't, obviously).  Corporations are weird about getting sued.  ::shrug::  In fact, he's not supposed to use it for personal reasons himself.  His company also won't let us add a second IP address, which would cost me $6.  So cable modem service is entirely out.  The alternative high-bandwidth solutions are DSL and Satellite.  I'm not getting DSL because that would entail getting a phone line, which I don't have.  I'm not paying $80 a month to be able to use the internet for 8 hours a week.  Satellites are equally stupid for me.  So I'm pretty much SOL.  At least until I move some place normal where I have my own cable and phone accounts where I can have control over my own services.  Until then, I am stuck with coming in to the office if I really need access to the web.  Bummer.
