With an appropriate set of primitives, it can provide the familiar feel of a markup language while enabling the broad range of capabilities required for application development. Its declarative approach removes a lot of unnecessary procedural code. It simplifies the programmer's task of creating the initial structure of an application, facilitating prototyping and flexible design. Declarative programming is effective for frequently used elements and patterns, and can be combined with scripting to allow procedural code for specific tasks." 

 "Decalrative UIs" are the future of rich web applications.
