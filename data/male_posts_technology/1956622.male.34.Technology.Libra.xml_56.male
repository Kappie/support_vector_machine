Barnum  Baily circus so when Karissa is in town we can go.  I look forward to seeing her look and smile from the circus.  Karissa and I had a nice talk today.  She answered the phone with a "tell me something daddy". So I told her about the tickets and that I would see her in the next couple of days.  I also informed her that I was bringing a Present from Grandma along with my present.  She acted excited about that fact.  We chatted a little more about small stuff and then she handed the phone to   SFW   I would not call that call pleasent but considering what can transpire from a call to a lying, cheating, adulterous, soon-to-be Ex-Wife I would say that the conversation went diplomatically.    Mostly we chatted about what she was packing and what I was asking her to pack.  Of course she asked me about the car seat on the bus and I informed her that I was not bringing it.  I am sure she will use that against me but I called them and they informed me it was not necessary and it was entirely my option.  I did not see any reason to coup Karissa up in the car seat for 1000 miles or whatever if they did not even recommend doing so.  In fact it has been so long since I have been on a bus I am not sure they even have seat belts in them.  I know they did not when I was a kid traveling on them.  Oh well so I get to be charged with making a decision that is not in the best interest of the child.  Not like anyone else we know is guilty of that.  I mean hell not packing the car seat on a bus might be worse then.....Oh I don't know....leaving a 4YO unattended with scissors!
