My boss Jeremy is on vacation, so I’m gonna be the head computer guy at the company. Means I’ll have the keys to the server rooms and the storage areas, which will be cool too. Hopefully it’s an easy week and no servers decide to blow up or raid arrays decide that its time to give up on life. Well, Jeremy’s got a pretty good setup, so I’d be surprised if anything other than that happened, because of course hardware failures are next to impossible to forecast.  Wow, someone on the max line has some weird seagulls in their yard, and the girl sitting behind me has really strong perfume, at least it’s a good scent.  I should read the classifieds over the person in front of me’s shoulder… Ooo, a Classic 1972 Ford is selling for only $1675… it may be classic but I bet it’s not worth too much.  -15 Minutes Later-  Ah, now I’m on the bus. Interesting people ride the bus… usually there are quite a few normal people, though at this moment they seem in short supply. Across from me in the seats is a couple… the man looks around 25 or older and the girl looks like she might be 14 (maybe younger?)… kinda sick if you ask me. Now onto the bus come the more “normal” people… the preppy girls (if you can call them normal). All flaunting their looks and smiling if they notice you glancing at them, even if it’s just because you want to write them into your blog post. I feel like Harriet the Spy, that’s kinda cool. I should use my bus rides to work on my descriptions for writing, as there are always new eople I haven’t seen before (in fact I think there’s only two people I’ve even recognized on the bus, I knew neither of them though).  Over in the corner sits a man reading the paper… sports section, of course. He’s most likely a construction worked or the like, his shoes show a quite a bit of wear and hard use, and he’s in need of a shave, or to let it grow. His glasses seem clean enough, as do his clothes, but his hat is a bit outdated (saying “2000 The New Millenium”). The bus driver finally makes his way onto the bus, and the few stragglers that will not get on the bus until the driver is there finally come in. There’s a lady that keeps talking to herself in Chinese it sounds… or maybe she’s speaking in tongues… either way nobody even gives her a second glance. There’s a Spanish guy across from me that has nothing really to mention. He looks like many of the Hispanics in the area, trying to be preppy but not looking the roll in the least. Preppy girls show they have some thought, they’ve slightly turned and are staring at the lady that is holding a conversation with herself… she’s even throwing in hand gestures now, and this guy across from me that looks like an Eminem wannabe mentions she’s doing that because nobody listens to her so she has to talk to herself. The bus stops… an old lady with frizzy white hair comes on, and a guy that looks like he likes football. The crazy lady goes and stands at the front of the bus (still inside, but I'm sitting in the back), and football guy gives her a wide eyed look when she walks past. Now she comes and sits by my laptop case… still talking in her unknown language. Eminem looks like he’s about to burst into laughter… I suppose I can understand that. Construction guy in the corner is leaning against the window sleeping. I would think that hat would be pretty uncomfortable… Eminem starts giggling, says it’s a joke but it’s more likely about the lady talking random nothingness.  This man with a CD player that looks like he could be a software developer, but probably isn’t, mentions my assortment of goodies. Pocket PC, Laptop… I suppose there are some goodies, all I’m missing is a cell phone.  We stop at another stop (by now we’ve passed a few, but nobody of note either entered or left the bus – those preppy girls are probably headed to the mall now that I think about it)… nobody of note gets on. We drive onwards. I notice the laptop battry is at 77%, where it was fully charged before leaving work, yes I think sometime soon this will need replaced. Babbling lady gets up and heads to the front of the bus again, and Eminem gets that dumb grin on his face…. Then she sits in the front next to a woman that would probably rather be somewhere else right now. Looking at football, I can see he’s probably a construction worker too, or a painter (he has some paint on his shorts). His shoes are beat up and he has a hat that says Hansen, but not the band (probably a construction company). He sits up straighter than an arrow, probably was once in the military or something. The old lady with the frizzy hair gets off, leaving babbling woman on her own… I wonder if this was really her stop or if she just needed to get away. I can’t really say which I’d do…  We stop at the bus stop by the old Beaverton City Library… this is usually where a couple hundred Mexicans get on and off the bus, but I guess it’s too early for them to be out. Some guy gets on that looks like a hippie and a biker mixed, with his bandana. He apparently has no idea where he is or what bus he’s on, as the driver talks to him for a while. Eventually he does sit down. I notice we’re passing Denny road, which means there is only Hart before my stop, so I’m going to go now. Hope you enjoy this :)
