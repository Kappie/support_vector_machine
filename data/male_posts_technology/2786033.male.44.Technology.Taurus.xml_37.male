The PDX progs preached their usual message, then provided a link to this:   urlLink  Avoiding Federal Fiscal Catastrophe: Honest Politics and Health Care Reform .  Here's a taste:   Since Aaron was addressing a progressive audience, he took pains to point out that these projections dont allow for any increases in programs that progressives would support  subsidized child care, more low-income housing, high-speed rail, insuring the uninsured. His message was that if progressives dont want the deficit to drown out any hope for their goals, theyd better start addressing long-term problems now.  For instance, start supporting the crazy notion of self-sufficiency. The majority of the people who will be facing the 2060 federal budget haven't been born yet. Prevent them from being slack-asses and needing subsidized child care, low-income housing, and free insurance by being  parents! Now!     The audience was stunned. Essentially, Aaron was saying that we should be advocating massive tax increases just to hold onto the programs we have now. That didnt seem very appealing to anyone.   It didn't? Wait, there's a rift in the ideology here. Who's usually  for  tax hikes so that these social programs can flourish? Where is this money going to come from? The cleanup of government waste?  (Insert Nelson catchphrase here. {see update} )    But nobody disagreed with Aarons math.   That's because no one there made it past algebra. After all, college is for art and music and Marxist professors and homosexual experimentation.      She was a lonely voice, but shes obviously right. Progressives need to launch a Manhattan Project on health care cost controls. Whether its  adopting a single payer system, rationing, nationalizing the drug companies, restricting the amount of expensive machinery   whatever it is  we cannot talk about health care without talking about how the hell we are going to prevent health care costs of current programs from growing to 14%% of GDP.     single payer system  - healthy people pay as much (probably more) as 2 pack a day smokers  rationing  - "So sorry that your cancer has returned, old chap, but that's all the therapy you are allotted. Good day."   nationalizing the drug companies  - Yeah, I'm sure pharm R will stay at the current level when they no longer have any revenue.  restricting the amount of expensive machinery  - This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Has this idiot ever been in a hospital? "Well, we weren't able to buy a new x-ray machine, but we can see if you have a broken bone the old fashioned way. Here, hold this piece of Radium and I'll hold the film. Madame Curie would be proud."   The last line of this article should be over the door at the DNC:   Aarons presentation left little room for hope. But maybe we can get somewhere with rage.     Because look what rage has done for the credibility of Al Gore and Howard Dean.     Update:  urlLink click here.
