Today , 2nd of august 2003, have an important impact and insight into God’s miracle. Today I touched down in Malaysia KL  airport at 6 am and I took the KLIA express train home and on the way home , I found out that I have dropped my wallet somewhere.  In KL Sentral , I have no money except some Aussie money but no Malaysian currency. I reported that matter with KLIA express but it seems all hope is lost . I have to get 30 cents from there to make a call to make trip back to my house.  I discovered not many friends in KL can I rely on when I needed help and not even cell leaders in church. Suprisingly enough , I found the friends especially Siok Chye , my former project partner , is more reliable than other people.  I phone him to get me and later while I was waiting, I am surprised my even the calmness and peace that I have in dealing with this matter. For the first time, I have not panic but took the time and effort to search and resolve the matter and for this I must give glory back to God.  I prayed to God during the time of waiting and I said to God, yes Lord, this is the problem I have and I prayed for calmness., peace and wisdom in handling this matter. I told God, that even such matters comes and I am not going to be swayed by this or disappointed  but truly I will be strengthened by God in this. I am going to stand firm and praise God for what happened. I knew that God have a purpose in allowing things to happen and I prayed for the wisdom to know what is the underlying reason on why God allowed this to happen.  I sang praises to God while waiting and I prayed . And really the peace of God is so real that it surpasses understanding and logic and I knew that God have secured my wallet for me. I told God , that even the start of this matter, now is the time of excitement , I expected already that God is going to do something exciting which I why I prayed for the wisdom to know what it is.  The miracle is that God ‘s answer doesn’t come immediately and no , God have it planned according to His own timing. I lost my wallet and like everybody who loses their wallet, you would know all hope in finding the things is lost. But I chose to stand strong and continue to praise God no matter what happens. And I knew God is still in control because of the peace He have poured upon me.  Siew Ching later phoned me and asked whether have I lost my wallet and I am surprised as I have told no one and it just recently happened. She told me that a woman have found my wallet in KLIA but have took  her trip back to Tawau. She told me that to phone her and arrange that matter. The woman, Madam Liew , is also a christian and it seems she saw the exist card in the wallet and prompted to phone Siew Ching. She attends SIB as well back in Tawau.  I mean God’s great and He is faithful to you and me. His mercy are new every morning and I prayed that I will continuously  be faithful to Him and to run to Him everyday.
