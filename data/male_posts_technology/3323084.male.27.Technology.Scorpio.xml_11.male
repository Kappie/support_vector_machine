So far I like it, the layout and interface are clean and clear of useless crap, and so far I haven't seen any ads.  Isn't that how itâ€™s supposed to make it free?  Maybe since it's still in beta there are no ads.  I'd like to see it with the ads to see how cluttered that might or might not make it.  Maybe I'll have some invites to give away soon.  Until next time...
