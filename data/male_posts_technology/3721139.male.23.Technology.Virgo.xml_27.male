There are like 200 different knots in this book, knots for climbing, fishing, restraint, hauling, etc.  In the past week or so, I've spent a fair amount of time studying these knots, and now I can tie about 20 or so from memory.  I have to admit that it's as much fun tying these knots as it is to consider the practical applications of them.  If you're interested, you can read another review  urlLink here .
