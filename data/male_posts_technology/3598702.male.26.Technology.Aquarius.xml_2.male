While on I got a message from a friend I know in oregon, he will be in town this weekend.  The thing is, I haven't been too social the past year... Im afraid I will get all excited and want to play with my new friend and jump up and down and...  Oh.  I crushed him.  *sniff*  Sorry friend.  Well, I hope it doesn't go that bad, I will be cooking the best steak ever tonight, since Friday night is officially "Steak Night."  I'm thinking of something I know for the wine, like BV Coastal.
