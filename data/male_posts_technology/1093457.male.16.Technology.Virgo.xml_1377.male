Friday was a good day for me as I only had one proper lesson, My revision is not going well as I find it physically impossible to revise but meh...  General studies should be fun... Scientific domain... Argh, its gonna suck so badly, we have been doing practice papers and they are impossible! Because its the scientific domain I get to miss the next general studies lesson we have cause I'm doing scientific domain at the moment...  Yes, I have no work to day, good job too because shortly I will be venturing outside to top up my tan... If the sun is still out that is!  I will be tidying my room today as it looks like a mass of papers and clothes... Shouldn't take me that long. I'm also going to the library.  Thats about it from me. I might update a bit later if someone else blogs.
