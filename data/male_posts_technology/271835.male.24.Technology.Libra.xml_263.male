If you haven't heard the album  urlLink Speakerboxx / The Love Below   you must rush out and buy it! (If you are a hifi buff it'll really test your system's timing, but I digress... these albums rock!)  Second thing was, I need to revise my list of top ten games...    urlLink 1080 Snowboarding    urlLink FFVII   Dunno how I forgot Final Fantasy, and 1080 is just the finest game...   Still can't justify putting Revs in there, but it wins the award for Funniest Game Character Name Ever    Prize for the first New Linker who can guess who I'm thinking of!!
