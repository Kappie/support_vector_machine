Had a rather "loud" discussion (does that technically constitute an argument/fight?) with a female colleague (ok, friend, tho less so at this moment) regarding my long service with Craptus. I described my intention to negotiate for more money at the conclusion of my current contract, and should I fail to procure a better financial deal, to seek pastures greener. She replied with "that'll be the day, they won't give you more money" and then went on about how she's heard this too many times before from me. On one hand she's right, I have been here too long and I do keep coming back, if only because it's not terribly difficult work to do and I quite frankly am too lazy to go on a fresh learning curve working for somebody else.  On the other hand I only came back here this time because a good mate who took over this particular unit asked me too and I like working with him. Also he offered me a way better pay rate than I had before I last left. Lastly, despite my desire to work elsewhere organising a job from overseas where I was living at the time just was too difficult an option for me. So I came back.   Yeah, basically it fits me because I'm lazy and complacent. I've no problem admitting that. Seems like other people have tho. Too bad. Fuck em'.    Anyway, got up really early this morning. I never get up early. I go to bed late; I never get up early. However I decided "bugger it, I'll go to the gym". Joined a gym 3 weeks ago, been once. I got ready, caught the 6:15am train, got to the station, brought my regular jumbo caramel latte  2 bits of raisin toast and proceeded to walk towards the gym.  Then I turned left.   Fuck it, I'll go at lunchtime.  Possibly.
