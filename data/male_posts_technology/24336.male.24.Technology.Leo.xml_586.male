I'm starting to enjoy wine for quite a few reasons:

 

 If it isn't cheap, it almost always tastes good.  There are thousands of varieties and I have yet to find a (non cheap) bottle that I didn't like!

 It complements the flavors of so many foods.  I'm not going to start drinking it with pizza and burgers but it works with most everything else.

 Maybe it's just my lack of wine drinking experience, but that stuff hits me hard!  Two glasses of wine has the same potency as six beers to me.
