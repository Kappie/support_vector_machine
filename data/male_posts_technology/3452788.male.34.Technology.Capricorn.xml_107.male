Funny, I don't recall seeing a space that says "You are hopelessly depressed - quit the game and pay $10,000 for your funeral" or "Insurance benefit exceeded - pay therapist $5,000". Nikki is so ... Nikki. She wants to play the game, she wants to be the banker but wants no help doing the math, she never wants dinner at dinnertime, but she wants to eat a banana while playing. She tells me that "it's nutritious, and I don't want dinner, and I will be happy, so let me have it". How can I argue with that? It then takes about 45 minutes to do the next 3 turns, because of bathroom breaks, discussing the new fish, playing camel with me, the spinner breaks, and so on. Oh yeah, also the ongoing and expanding stable of animal impressions she performs on a near-constant basis - dog, cat, horse, raccoon, tuna(!), elephant seal, otter, etc. I am really trying to be patient through this, because really she is just being Nikki. Last night I survuved it, some times I don't. I want to, for her sake, because for some unknown reason she really enjoys doing things with me, when SHE wants to.     Instead of being the typical dad who threatens the boyfriend, I will give him a $50 and say "Good luck kid, you are definitely going to need a therapist after dating my daughter".
