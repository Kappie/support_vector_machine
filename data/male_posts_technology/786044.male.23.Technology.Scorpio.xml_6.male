Luckily, all I have to do it update and upload a new PDF to their site.  I also got a new journal with the Magnetic Poetry cover on the cover. It's pretty nice. Sturdy and high quality. I haven't been too impressed with cafepress's clothing offerings, but the books and the journal are quite exceptional. If I were a stock broker, I'd rate them a "buy."  Fan P talking...
