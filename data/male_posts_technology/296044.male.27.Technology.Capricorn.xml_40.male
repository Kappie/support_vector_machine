I know, I know, Im not all that thrilled by Kerry either (actually, I do like Edwards a lot), but ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN GEORGE W. BUSH.                So Ill make this short and sweet:                1) Make sure youre registered. This is quite easy for us in the democratic, free society of the United States. Go to your local library, ask them for a voter registration form. Dont leave; fill the form out right then and there! Hand it back to the person behind the counter. Youre done. Youre registered. In a few days/weeks, you should be notified of where you need to go to vote. If you do not hear back in a few weeks, call your voter registration office. If you dont know the number, call the library, or call the DMV. Or if you live here in central Ohio, call CD101 and ask them for the number.                2) Make sure you know where to vote.                3) VOTE! VOTE! VOTE!
