Lunch yesterday: Uncle Ben's microwaveable rice bowl of the vegetable teriyaki variety, green tabasco, water, whole box of Cheez-it twisters of the hot wings and blue cheese variety (will not be doing that ever again)  Lunch day before yesterday: Grape-ape smoothie, bicycle ride to and from smoothie, actually bicycle ride to smoothie, hard ride back, drinking smoothie does not readily allow for breaking.  Lunch today: Pad Thai from the cheesecake factory (seemed like a good idea at the time), Pelligrino sparkling water, also some bread.     Work on roof finished, but who keeps tiping over the trash can outside?
