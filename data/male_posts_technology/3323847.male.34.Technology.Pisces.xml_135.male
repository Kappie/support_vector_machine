This just goes to show that  ALL  products will have vulnerabilities.  What's the most important to keep in mind is  WHO  is taking advantage of them.  In other words, you can have the most vlunerable program on the planet, but if nobody writes anything to take advantage of those vulnerabilities, it ultimately doesn't matter (well, it does, but that's a discussion for another time).  This new vulnerability is not going to cause me to switch from FireFox back to IE.  I moved away from IE for reasons other than the fact that there were craploads of trojans/viruses taking advantage of it.  Lack of innovation, features and little stupid bugs (i.e. everything outside the "vulnerability" category) that never got fixed and probably never will are my prime reasons for moving away from IE.  Will I always stay with FireFox?  I don't know, but right now I'm very happy with it.  From a systems administration point-of-view, I do miss the tight integration with Windows (i.e. Group policy features), but that's to be expected  any time  one strays too far from the "Church of Microsoft".  I just need to work harder to maintain that integration, that's all. :)
