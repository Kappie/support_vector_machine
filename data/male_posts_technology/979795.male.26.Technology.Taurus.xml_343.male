Will probably need to drum up some excuse to get the morning off then, afterall, I'm not being paid yet so not quite a loss anyway haha. Anyway this new job sounds quite interesting. It's labelled as a Software/Helpdesk Consultant, but it's with a co with some European roots so there's actually an opportunity to do quite a bit of travelling within Europe. Not sure how things will turn out, but I hope it'll be good. Anyway the company is going to be in Sci Pk 1, so getting to BVCC and BB East should be considerably easier for me. Woohoo... no excuse to not train liao ... well maybe unless I keep forgetting to bring parts my gi ...
