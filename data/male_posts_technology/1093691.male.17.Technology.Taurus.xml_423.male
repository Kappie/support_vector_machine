Nicki put the photos of the scicen lot drunk up round the school but within bout half an hour most of them had been taken down ! :( I dont think they like them much although Mr Moore did. Well after the french i went back to Nicki's house and we have now organised a revision session tmor in Croydon library, I cant beleuve im doing it but there ya go ! Hehe. Well nothing much more to say. I'm off
