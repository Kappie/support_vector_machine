And she now says the word 'ball', although the Russian version is still too difficult for her.  Today she started saying 'cow' out of the blue and with upcoming Father's Day yesterday I got the best gift of all - she looked at me and said 'papa'!  It's hard to describe the feeling, but I don't think anything else matches it.
