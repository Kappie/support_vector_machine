I was a catcher growing up in little league until I realized how political my town was, so I stopped after 6th grade. When I started play co-ed softball my junior year of high school I was coverted to a 1rst baseman. Pretty much for the sole reason that I can't catch a softball in the outfield. Something to do with the flight pattern messes me up. Baseball ok, softball forget it. I played 1 year of that until I hit college. Then I split time at 1rst and catcher. Now 5 years after graduation, my team (I am the coach) decides I should play short stop as I am one of the best athletes on the team. Not bad for a guy that is not in the greatest shape. So cool, I get to play the premier spot after my favorite MLB player, Nomar Garciaparra. Well we started and I sucked. I am getting better so that is good. Hard to move from one side of the field to the other.  Now I don't mind co-ed teams. They can be fun. Well we have one girl Wendy that absolutely sucks and it kills me. She is the nicest person and I like her but man she can't play. She is our catcher mainly cause she can't do anything else. She can't hit, barley can catch and can't throw.  Well last night 2 things happened that killed me. One Jeff our left center fielder who knows the game was on second, no outs. The ball is hit to the first baseman. What does Jeff do, stand there at second. I was mad. Ball hit to that side you go. Well next batter hits it to the short stop. Jeff decides to run with the ball right in front of him. WHAT THAT HELL!!!! Smart play by the short stop gets him in a run down and is tagged out. I asked, since I am the coach, did you forget what side the ball was hit on? He gets pissed at me. Excuse me for knowing the game, bone head. That shit drives me nuts. Secondly we are down by one runner on first, two outs bottom of the seventh (7 inning games). Who comes up, Wendy! Everyone on the team started packing the gear. Talk about a let down. Here we are battling back and poor Wendy strikes out. Kills me! What is worse she threw the bat. I wanted to smack her. Talk about making us look like assholes.  There was a lot more that went on during that game that pissed me off. I will probably add more later.
