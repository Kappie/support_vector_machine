I have no idea what happened but the teams' defense went to the crapper. Mistakes were made everywhere. They only positive was the fact that our offense picked up some.  I had a couple mistakes myself so I am not blaming everyone else. I had one ball go off my glove at first which is an error. Then twice I left runners on base when I was up. I hit the ball where I wanted to each time, but the defence got there before the ball had a chance to drop.  Hopefully tonight we will pull out a win and have a slim chance to make the playoffs. I hope we make it. If not oh well. I luckily found a guy at work that knows of a fall league so hopefully I can get on that.
