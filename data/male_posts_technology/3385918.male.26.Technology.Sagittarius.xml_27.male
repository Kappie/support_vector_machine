Damn, I was wondering where that had gone. I put it in my shirt pocket two weeks ago and lost track of it. Actually taught I had spent it and didn't remember. Now, I am very happy cause I was very hungry and didn't have any cash on me. Now, as if dropped by the angels in heaven, I have five dollars to buy myself food. Weeeeeeeeeeee !!! Of course, I have to wait for the bill to dry up, but it was still very lucky of me to find it before I put the dirty clothes in the washer. Talk about money laundering !!!  =;-D
