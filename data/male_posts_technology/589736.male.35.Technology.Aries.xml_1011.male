I would need more information and expertise to rank them on my own; however, I do doubt the validity of some of the reasons, only because they are not treated equally in all situations.  2. I cannot speak re: time and the recent inspections because they were not executed in a way I felt effective; their flawed methods rendered them inconsequential; thus, time was irrelevant.  3. I believe that in general, lasting self-governance cannot be forced; it can only be chosen.  I say "in general" because I don't believe in absolutes; there is always the possibility of an exception.  I would be delighted for the outcome to show that Iraq is an exception.  -- I respectfully decline Chris' offer of immunity; others are free to respond to my post.
