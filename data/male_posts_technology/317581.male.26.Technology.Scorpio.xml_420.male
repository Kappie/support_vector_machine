Then I think she kinda fell for me, whcih scared the living piss out of me. So I told her that she should date the boy that had been interested in her when I showed up. Then when he broke her heart, I was the one that took her out so she could grieve. Unfortunately for me, it was too late to have her fall for me. She married this past summer. I need to call her and see about a dinner.  Since that time sophomore year, I think I've hidden my feeling better, made sure I didn't fall for them any more. I think for better or worse, I've had to lose some compassion along the way. It's also caused me to have respect for women in general. Not to say that I should put every woman I meet on a pedistal, but  perhaps I shouldn't be thinking, "How can I get in her pants?"  Although, before I have always not thought about getting into her pants, and that hasn't gotten me anything but a plethura of female friends. Which is good, I like female friends, but I think I'd prefer female lovers:)  All this to say that if you're my friend and you're female, there's a chance I want to get into your pants:) But not because I am in love with you :(  Catch you on the flip side-
