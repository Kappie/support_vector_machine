[1.]  im missing someone  - but because i don't want to show concern and affection anymore nagprepretend nalang ako na i don't. some people don't like it being so concern and so caring to them. i understand.  and even if you don't care, still i'll always will .  [2].  i need to pay the phonebill  - it's already 12k. i know some of you have already experience this and in some cases maybe much worst.   well that's for now. need to sip the coffee and start working.  take care   whoever   you are.
