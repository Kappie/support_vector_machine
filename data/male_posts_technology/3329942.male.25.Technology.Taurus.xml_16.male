But over the years I felt that GOD is equally a good Enemy as HE is a friend.  Like every war we also have pact between us which says,   "Whatever GOD shall ask from me not for himself, I shall grant him that  whatever I shall ask HIM not for myself, He shall grant me that."    Here is what I desire now.  (I feel HE also read my blog. Though I don't expect a comment from HIM ;-))   "2 of my friends are in urgent need of happiness. Grant them". 1 requires a handsome job and another one needs guts to marry the girl of his choice.
