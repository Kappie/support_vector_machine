"...they[Canada] are acutely aware of how much the Bush administration has increased anti-Americanism around the globe. That's why so many of them are stupefied at the idea he might be re-elected â€“ they perceive him as having done great harm to his own country." Seriously folks, I don't know what to say, even Canada thinks Americans are crazy to re-elect georgie shrub.  I know, I know, Canada is just a bunch of yellow socialists!  Nevermind that they have been a great balancing, reasonable presence in the North American continent.
