But what does this actually mean?Is it some instinctive gut feel, generated by past memories, experiences and stock knowledge? Or is it simply some thick figment of imagination? I believe they are neither of the two. What I do believe is that it is triggered by a sense of fear that you emit, that affects you to think on your toes instead of being attacked unaware when you’re feet are flat on the ground.      Fear of the unknown. Fear of the unexpected. Fear of facing the unprecedented. I think that it is precisely this sense of fear that creates a kind of illusion that you know something others don’t. Please bear with me here, cuz this is still a working theory. And this is not to pose that there is no such thing as a sixth sense or to even dare to negate the brilliance of instinct (at times). I guess what I’m trying to say here is that I don’t exactly believe in the kind of bad vibes you get from a person or bad vibes you get from an event that is yet to come. Least to say, not in itself that is. That’s basically pessimism doing the talking and any fraction of potential, possibility or positivism is out of the window. I really am not an optimist. But over time, I’ve realized that it is a great waste of your time and energy as well as those of others, to freak out, analyze and scrutinize every single thing to miniscule particles when it is best to think of constructive alternatives to the presenting problem. There obviously is a cause-and-effect relationship between people who analyze too much of everything and becoming a little too anal? Don’t you notice that there is the word ‘anal’ in the word ‘analyze’?    It is extremely frustrating and demeaning when a person keeps gabbing about bad vibes, without them realizing that it is precisely them that transmit the kind of negative energy on to others. Maybe the reason why they feel that certain discomfort from people is because others sense disdain from the so-called Mr. or Ms. ‘psychic’ anyway. Isn’t it that when you hate someone, the person will sense it even without you saying it? Am I right or am I right? (haha how cocky does that sound?) I’m getting too carried away in disproving this bad vibes theory.     Why is there a need to constantly size up people anyway? Why do we have to satisfy some twisted need to fill up our heads with our own versions of how people think, feel, and simply are? Why can't we just admit that we can't fully figure people out right away or even never at all? The beauty in getting to know someone is in unraveling the little mysteries day-by-day and in them being able to gradually peel off your layers as well. What's the fun in finding everything out in a second anyway, right? So lets not overassume people and things, most especially if your assumptions only lead you to a negative place.
