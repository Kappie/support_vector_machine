Plans to take the rice cooker so he can serve rice with this     stuff. 4. Who knows what all he will have accumulated by the 3rd.  Since I    leave for Ivy's on Wednesday he will have plenty of time alone    to shop.  I think he is excited, although he would never admit to     such a strong feeling. 5. Does his rehab exercises 3 times each day.  He saw a Doctor of    Naturopathy who gave him a list of exercises plus vitamins and     icky stuff to mix and drink each AM. Mostly it is all several     of the B vitamins, which are supposed to make the brain work better.     The exercises are rehab for disequilibrium related to the     labyrinth system.  I looked on the net and they originally     came from an ear, nose and throat, (ENT) doctor who specializes    in this stuff. This is a good thing. Plus some other stuff the    naturopath recommends, such a brushing his body, except for     his abdomen and chest with a little plastic brush each time he    exercises.  I get to do his back and the soles of his feet.    He, your pa, says at least all this will make him able to     function better even while dizzy. His attitude impresses me     and makes me feel something, admiration, humility, guilt,    because I think I know how horribly I would handle what he     is dealing with and how good he would be to me. 6. Enough! See some of you guys late on July 4th.               THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART  7. Somebody leave me directions how to get there at the house so    I can find you when I get home.
