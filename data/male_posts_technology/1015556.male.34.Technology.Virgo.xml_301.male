I just got a little flyer in the mail talking about it and thought it would be some good points to give people an idea about the size of GCC:  - 1350 households - 20% growth for six of the last eight years - 30+ full or part time staff - 500+ teenagers - 500 children cared for by 300 volunteers - 25 ministries to adults - 14+ ministries available to people outside of GCC - 8 missionaries directly from our body, 15+ overall - 2004 operating budget of about $2.1M Wow.  Very cool.  I dream that we continue to grow disciples and not programs.
