The price of a CD had gotten so far away from the cost of actually producing the music, that in effect the music companies were gouging the consumer. (I am not so naive to believe that the artist sees anywhere near a few pennies of the $19 cost of a CD.)  Well today,  urlLink it was announced  at least one major record company will start charging 30% less for the cost of CDs. (They are also dropping the cost of tapes.) This addresses half of my proposed solution.  The other half was that they had to start becoming more flexible with downloadable music. People, particularly young people, want that option. Music companies need to give them a legal way to do that. It looks like progress is definitely being made on that front, with successful services such as iTunes.  I love it when I'm right. Notice I didn't say anything back then about suing consumers, although deterring the bad behavior certainly helps steer potential customers to the legal methods. It looks like they're turning this thing around.
