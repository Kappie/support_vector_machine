I'm doing data entry, while I scan another PC for spyware and porn. Weeeeeeee !!!!! Lots of porn. The dude that used that PC was a real sick person. And, of course, I'm backing everything up for myself. Yep, I love my work. I'm supposed to be doing some tech support, but I'm actually talking to my best friend on the phone. Don't tell my boss, okay?  Nothing really exciting going on, so I'll talk a little about myself. I like anime, horror movies, screenplays and filmmaking in general. Here is a small list of stuff I really really like:   Erasure  Sailor Moon Sam Raimi Evil Dead The Monkees WWE DOOM Love Hina Peter Jackson Jackie Chan Zombies Love Hina Azumanga - Daioh Donnie Yen eBay Hentai DVDs Fangoria Screenplays Starvengers Force Five Mazinger Z  ... and a whole mess of other stuff too. I like to talk. I'm also a pretty good listener. Sometimes I'm moody, but most of the time I'm friendly.   My views on the world (for those who like that type of thing) is that everything is fucked up, but things might be better tomorrow (yeah right). I am pro women rights, abortion, death penalty, religious freedom, gay marriage, legalization of drugs, ect. So, I'm probably one of the most politically incorrect people you will ever meet.   My hobbies are watching movies, working on screenplays, reading books on anime, horror, computers and filmmaking in general.   I love to talk. I like to listen too.
