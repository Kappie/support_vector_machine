It doesnt suck, it is a bunch of overpayed kids i agree, but they are bloody good at what they do.  The riots and alcohol stuff is a bit o.t.t because those thugs will get pissed and fight about anything, when theres no world cup, they'll fight over a bloody ham sandwich!  The policemen bit.  Its their job, though it sounds harsh, but it is their job.  My mum and dad enjoyed their time in the police but it wasnt the easiest job they ever had.  My dad was quite often wrestling 7 foot south african burgalars, and he didnt always come out on top!  BTW, Im not having a go... :)  Its nice every two years to have a tournament of the countries favourite game.  Apart from that, Im working loads stil, not enjoying all of it, but hey, its money. Will see you all tomorrow :)  Still, best of luck to England, and speak soon to y'all
