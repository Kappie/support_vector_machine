I decided a long time ago to not turn away from everything that is not part of the “Perfect Life” illusion. She is doing OK right now. Her vitals are stable and the bleeding is small. They gave here more blood so it looks like she’ll be fine.  My mom’s a hell of a woman! She was one of six kids, her and five boys. She was born in 1920 in Bridgewater MA (near Boston). She lived through the depression, WWII , and all the crap after it. She got a nursing degree in 1942 and joined the Army when WWII started. She serviced as an Army nurse in Great Britain for four years. She used the GI bill to get her bachelor’s degree in nursing after the war. She worked for the Veteran’s Administration (VA) Hospitals for 25 years. She met my Father in Florida in 1952. They had me in 1962 in Memphis, TN. She retired from the VA and worked for a few years at a retirement center. After I graduated in 1986 she and my Dad moved to Sun City, AZ to retire. They live there happily for many years.   I thank God everyday for giving me a great Mom (and Dad). I have always felt they would sacrifice anything for my welfare. It is really cool to grow up with unquestioning love from a mother and father all your life.
