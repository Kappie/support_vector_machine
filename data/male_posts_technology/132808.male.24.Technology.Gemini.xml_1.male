That's okay by me. - Dissing Jean-Claude Van Damme will not only get your ass kicked off this site, but if you're smaller than me, I will kick your ass.  And if you're bigger?  There are bats, and there are backs, and no broken-backed bastard can catch me. - Terrorists?  Not allowed.  If you put the 'bad' in Jalalabad, you are not welcome here. - If you think Ben Affleck is cooler than Matt Damon, keep that to yourself.  If you think Ben Affleck is cooler than Jean-Claude Van Damme, you may want to run into your kitchen and check on your cupcakes there, Sally. - If you are a sexual deviant, and would like to share your stories about all the different and ridiculous ways you get hot in the pants, please remember that the following words, while not prohibited, are most certainly frowned upon: bukkake, she-male fiesta, vomit sluts, and severe rectal bleeding. - And please, please remember: Opinions are like browneyes.  Everyone's got one, and no two are the same.  So everyone's opinions should be respected, and feared.  Hey, just like assholes!
