The peer-to-peer software developer, hosted in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank, that  declared war  on the entertainment industry and told them to "f*** off"? Well, seems they've grown a bit... In the occupied Palestinian territories, says Steve Taylor, a spokesman, Earth Station 5 is safe from the music and film industries' campaign to stop people sharing content for free. At any one time, claims Mr Taylor, almost 19m people are using Earth Station 5, most in non-English-speaking countries. If true, that would make it the most popular peer-to-peer file-sharing portal in the world. At the moment, everything is free on the platform, and it has no advertising. According to Mr Taylor, its backers are spending $2million a month with little if any revenue coming in. Eventually, their plan is to make money from online gambling, sports betting and ads. Well, maybe. But almost everything about Earth Station 5 may be fiction. Perhaps the only certain thing is that, at least for  urlLink The Economist , "it works."  portions of this post taken from  urlLink The Economist    In other news, even Iraqis like Counterstrike  (pictures from LAN cafes in Iraq)
