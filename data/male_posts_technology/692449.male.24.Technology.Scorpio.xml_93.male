You know it's really hard work trying to think enlightened thoughts all day, but seriously folks today is a good day to read some poetry or view some paintings or just read philosphy. After all nothing is more important then following your intellectual pursuits. I am off to class soon to enjoy the teachings of my professors. This semester has been a lot of fun and I am definitly looking forward to next semester when I finally get into some real math and physics classes no more of that intro shit for me. On the war front I think that  urlLink this  article sums up some of my views quite succinctly. I've still been trying to find any mention in the press about the current economic depression with out success. Apparently since there is a war going on noone is actually out of work. Ah when will we learn?
