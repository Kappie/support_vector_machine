THere eyes were bluish with fear and sweat ozzing on fore head out of fear.This sweat was frrezing on their foreheads giving their skin greenish tinge.  Some one knocked the door ..Much before the youngest of them all would get up..There were bullets screening the wooden baricade of the yard.  The wooden door on which Chelpark Ink dots once sprinled out from the chinese Ink pens where now washed with blood drops of young kid ..by nothing else but chinese made pakis supplied AK 56 rifles....   Who did it..why...whom could have this young guy of 7 yrs killed ...I kept guesing ???who was the terrorist ..Was he powerful ..if yes then what was threating him..7 yr kid!!!!  Watch out the full story soon...
