Night 1 - we (Justin, Brett (my Aussie cousin) and I) arrived in Kelowna shortly after 10:30 PM.  This night didn't go so well - we were grounded by Justin's grandpa. He didn't want us to wake up the neighborhood with the hum of the mighty Ford V8.  We ended up staying in the motorhome for the evening - got laughed at by Tracy via phone (we were supposed to meet up with her and her friends - always nice to make other laugh)... in the end we did manage to finish off the rest of grandpa's beer. (Justin did replenish the supply the next day - as to not be completely vengeful). We did have a pretty good time - shootin' the shit and what not... and this made us have more energy for the next day's festivities.  Got the day started pretty early - went into town for some breakfast - must point out the hashbrowns in Kelowna suck!  We managed to find the venue and start drinking at 2ish... they only had Coor's light - meh - it's sort of a beer... so we made do.  Boys let me tell ya - Kelowna has a lot of beautiful girls! They were everywhere... wearing next to nothing.  There was a bikini contest - I nearly placed... I mean - the girls were ummmm - tanned... well worth the price of admission.   We only managed to see a couple of wake boarding runs - which were cool - some nice jumps.  I have to learn to stop obsessing about things... I spent a lot of time text messaging - trying to find some friends - this really took away from the trip... when it came down to it - I, and I'm sure the crew did to, had more fun when I was just concentrating on having fun.  I got up to my usual drunken hi jynx... I don't remember it all... I do know that I seemed to master the art of maintaining a steady drunkenness -   let's see - I booted for some 15 year old girls (in an effort to be cool - and crazy... nothing more - ok ok - I did give them my card - they'll call me in 5 years... oh yeah I'm a thinker!)  Then there was the fence incident - I went around beach side to jump the fence to get into the beer garden - and well - only made it half way... it's ok ladies - don't worry - my mommy and daddy bits were not harmed... I do have a kick ass bruise to show off... I'll have to remove my shorts to show it to you... I knew you'd be cool with that ;)   Then during the concert - a young man was puking behind us - I let him know that wasn't a good idea (for about 10 minutes) - then I policed the area - didn't want anyone to sit in the puke...   Oh and I did get involved with the mosh pit - and sent some kids crowd surfing...  I think I got upset at the dude in the Japanese restaraunt for selling Ogopogo roles... let's face it - that's just wrong!  Then later on in the night slightly before getting trapped outside of the club I was seen screaming she's bicurious into the streets of downtown Kelowna - that I don't remember at all.  I like the fact that people have memories of the weekend that I don't... hopefully I helped people laugh - I know they helped me...  So even though the night ended early and I had a nice Shaun hissy fit... I look back on the adventure with a smile on my face...  I have to say special thanks to Justin for suggesting the trip and Brett for coming along - couldn't have had two better travel companions...  And of course - thank you to Grandpa Sundset for the use of the motorhome!
