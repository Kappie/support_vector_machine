I have a folder called 'Daily' for sites I check every day (duh...) like  urlLink the D ,  urlLink Slashdot ,  urlLink MeFi , and such. Then I have a folder called 'Occaisionally' for sites that are updated less often, or that I only check at certain times of the week (like Fridays for new movies). And then, in addition to a folder for the project I am currently working on, I have a folder called 'Memorable.' I save in here news stories and sites that were too long for me to read right when I linked them, or more often, that I found interesting. Here are some selections from that folder, if you get bored:   AlterNet The U.S. Is Looking for an Excuse To Fight   craigslist best of   Economist.com  Library  Style Guide   Guardian Unlimited  The Guardian  Too much of a good thing   How To Write Unmaintainable Code   International Snow Sculpture Championships   Questions for Conversations about Iraq   Reagan's Son   Wayne Madsen After the Fall   Why Nerds are Unpopular
