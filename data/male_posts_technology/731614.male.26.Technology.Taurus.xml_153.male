Derek Kelley threw up on her. Taught us about Helen Keller, which was cool.  3rd grade -Mrs. McClellan: She was very annoying.. Thought she could rule the world. She was wrong.  4th grade -Ms. Metz: The woman to which I owe my mathematical skills. Always had some sort of fun project up her sleeve (such as selling popcorn to kids on the playground outside our classroom window)  5th grade -Ms. Watters: Had the most perfect handwriting in the world.. she could write in a perfectly straight line on the chalk board, with no lines to follow!  6th grade -This is unfair, because in FL by the time we get to this grade, it's considered middle school and we have a different teacher for each subject.  Grades 1st-5th I spent in the "mini-school" which was one building, opened on the inside. So there were no walls dividing the classes. Organized chaos. It was great.
