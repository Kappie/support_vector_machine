In fact, many pple are either on MC or 1/2 day leave. Most likely trying to 'SIAM' the boring telematch. Why should it be called telematch when it look more like a tekan session?  let me explain the thingy u need to do.  Caterpillar Walk  Tie ur legs with your partner, and the 'middle' leg tied to the pair behind you. forming a 16 pple long caterpillar. Walk frm 1 end to the other.   Sponge and Water  Untie yourself, then 1 pair at a time, soak the sponge with water and put hold the sponge on the head and walk back to the other end. Squeeze the water to the bottle.   Polo Sweet and flour  The most stupid station where u put ur head into the pail of flour in search of the tiny polo sweet, which u will use a pocky stick to hold and go to the other end. Then u pass the sweet to another pair using pocky stick.   Balloons  Nope, we are not done yet. Once everyone finish getting their face filled wif flour, they come back and blow balloons. Then carry as many as they can to the other end in a pair, with a balloon in the middle.   Spin with a cup of water  I'll consider this the most well designed station of them all. Spin 5 round and walk back with a cup of water on your mouth. (most of u will fill giddy and spill the water on ur body)  And there you have it, the amazing tekan session. Anyone still reading???  Team building, can never be complete without cheating..... Team cheating in fact. Its where the whole team comes together and cheat as a whole. Come on, we are alredy adults, why would we still wannna be tekan by u all willingly?   so here how we cheated......  Before the match started, go to the flour, find all the polo sweet and place them in the middle so u will not need to dig too much in the flour.  Hold the sponge with 1 hand while walking. With the hands behind, nobody can actually see it.  Find extra water and pour into the bottle.   Tie the balloons with a string so that u can hold many of them together. (not really cheating, this is call clever idea)  Count extra fast when spinning.... there is a judge tat also do the counting. but their counting will be messed up with your counting.   And there you have it. The Amazing cheating.  Well.... i guess everyone cheated 1 way or another.  Telematch will be quite boring if everyone goes with the book..... right?  oh, btw: we got 2nd place.  After that, it was bowling.  It must be years since i last touch a bowling ball. And they put me as the first bowler in my team.   Everyone was looking as most lanes are not ready yet. So i concentrated, look at the pin and rolled the ball towards the pin. somehow or rather, the ball went towards the pin very straight. and with enough strength. as it get closer to the pin, something tells me it's going to be a strike.... and it was indeed.....  everyone cheered.... that was the 1st strike of the day (someone before me manage to do a spare) For a moment, i was enjoying the cheers from all around me, it was like as if i'm a super star or the hero for my team. the feeling was great.... but then that feeling doesn't last long...   for the next round, i wash the drain 2 times. hahaha.... the 1st strike was kelong lark..... what do u all expect? I haven't bowled for years and i played bowling for less than 10 times....  well in the end i got a low 83 marks  still not tat bad..... haha.
