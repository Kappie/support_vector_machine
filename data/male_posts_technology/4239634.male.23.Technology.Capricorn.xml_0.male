Hope to meet up with a few of my friends again ..Eugene being one of them. Haven't had the opportunity to meet up with him since I've got into this new job.  Its rather cold at work place as I work in the server room. Have to find many ways to keep warm. I don't usually feel cold easily as those closer to me should know... But Itz really DARN COLD there ....Guess itz kept that way to ensure that the computers are working at optimum levels and not overheated.  Felt a little sick before coming to work. Don't know is it because I'm not used to working in the night shift. Think I'm getting a bit heaty down inside. But luckily, the next 5 days would be off for me ..So it ain't all that bad ... Wonder what i'll be up to the next 5 days .. Most of my friends would be busy doing their stuff, as it is the weekdays afterall.. Kinda surprised that some of them are actually helping me to count the days to my off days for me ...Touched :0)  Dad went to see the doctor again tonight. He's been having a bad stomach the past few nights. Hope he'll be alright soon.  Yah ok...Thats all for tonight ...Lets see what tomorrow brings .!!  DiLloN
