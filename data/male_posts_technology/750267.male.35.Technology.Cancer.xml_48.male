I am sitting now watching an excellent program where they are thoroughly answering viewer questions on Iraq. They're taking 10 minutes to answer each question -- excellent show. "How many UN Security resolutions are currently being defied?" At least 80. "Mostly because the countries involved are friends of the United States." Ha! Israel, Turkey, Armenia, etc.  Bravo CBC.
