So today, I went shopping. In London. I bought lots of things.  urlLink Eddie Izzard - Sexie  (DVD), very funny!  urlLink Sugarcult - Start Static  (album), very good!  urlLink Black Eyed Peas - Shut Up  (single), just because that song's cool. I also bought a nice pair of jeans for £20 reduced from £50 in Gap - not bad at all! The main thing I went in for I didn't get because it's "out of season", grrrrrr. When I want to buy something, I want to buy it now, not when it's sunny, you silly people. Still, I also bought  urlLink Ministry of Sound Very Best of Chillout Sessions  which is very relaxing. So now, I'm off to bed.
