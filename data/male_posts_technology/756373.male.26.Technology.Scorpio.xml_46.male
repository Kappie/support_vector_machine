My question to you now, is which games are the suckest, the worst, the lousiest piles of donkey-urine you have ever played?   To get the ball rolling, I propose this list (in no particular order)   1)Gender Wars. This was crap in a box. And the box itself was crap as well. Total swill.  2)Total Annihilation Kingdoms. Craptastic. The only word that can describe it.  3)Global Operations. Yukko. Stupid 'Dedicated Server' only feature meant you had to have a dedicated server to play on LAN. Sure, there was a switch or argument or something that you could use to bypass this, but it wasnt documented. Besides that, the game proper is a real sad attempt at cloning Counterstrike.  4)Ultima Ascension. I've never been able to play this one for longer than 45 minutes without it locking up, crashing, or exhibiting some weird game breaking bug. And it still runs at maybe 13 fps, even on my Athlon 1500. Bah.  5)Red Faction. I hated this FPS. The so-called 'destroy everything' engine was a gimmick - you could not, in fact, destroy everything, only some things, making it no different really from other FPS's like Quake or HalfLife that had you breaking down certain walls to get through some areas. Besides that, the dull weapons,graphics and truly uninspiring level design made this game one insipid boring waste of time.  6)Myst. I can't believe people liked this game. I could make a game like this using merely digitized photos hotlinked to each other. Utter , mindless drivel.  7)Dungeon Siege. Yes, you heard me. I find this title probably the worst example of a hack and slash ever devised. Absolutely kak. Stupid spells, no special moves or abilities for your fighter, and ugly character models. I find it so cool(not) adventuring in a bath robe and shower cap, hitting things with a stick with a twirly light, and casting Fireball, Big Fireball, and Bigger Than Big Fireball at monsters that look like bad Henson animatronics.  8)Redneck Rampage. Anyone remember this one? It was novel for about half an hour, then it just got trite and dumb.  9)Serious Sam 2. SS1 was fun for a while because it reintroduced the mindless arcade shooter. But SS2 was just more of the same. And frankly, it was just too much bull(haha). Really inane, I played for about 3 hours and uninstalled it. Nice graphics just aint enough.  Only worthwhile playing co-op.  10)And my personal worst game ever, a little title called Gene Wars from way bak when, that was just so insanely, ridiculously hard that it was completely and utterly impossible to win without cheating. It had cute graphics for it's time and a nice idea (cross breeding creatures to use as your army), but the execution was horribly flawed and the stupid attempt at humour did not work in the RTs setting. This was a title I loved to hate.   Honourable mentions include Dark Colony (example of how NOT to make an RTS) and Black and White(also known as How To Fool Gamers Into Thinking They Are Playing A Game, When In Fact They Are Merely Picking Up Monkey Shit And Throwing Rocks At Things)   If you have any suggestions, mail em to me at  urlLink khayne@webmail.co.za , or head on over  urlLink here  and post your list.
