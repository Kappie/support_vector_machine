Douse the almonds in chocolate, and I think can bring it down to 4, maybe even 3 minutes. Which is what nearly happened today, except that, in the presence of other people, my sense of guilt and shame kicked in a bit earlier than usual, causing me to stop after I had chomped down about two dozen pieces. My stomach's upset now, I think.
