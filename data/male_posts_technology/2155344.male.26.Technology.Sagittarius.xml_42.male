I went to see a dermatologist today. I wanted to see a lady doctor to see if she would give me different medication for my acne problem. She gave the anti-biotics again. :( o well, she seems nice, i dont mind trying something to reduce acne. i wish there was a natural cure for this acne.   then, i went to swimming class (its tue  thursdays from 7- 7:45). I saw a guy, just like arvind trying to learn swimming. I learnt breast stroke today. Its tough, it needs lot of strength in arms and legs to move. Arvind  me then sat down to decide on which LCD monitor to buy. Then packed.. busy evening i should say. this will be our mini anniversary celebration. Australia trip will be big one!:-) Oh yeah, i tried brown rice today and loved the taste! It has much more flavor than regular jasmine rice. yummm...
