But Tom Cruise was amazing as a vulgar woman-seducing dating guru i think that was like his best performance ever!    Left Donnie Darko and A Clockwork Orange to watch ....gotta watch them b4 i start my job otherwise no chance liao. Speaking of which I'm still not sure exactly when im gonna start also ....think probably have to wait until they clear me medically and security-wise. Saying this cos everyone is asking me when I'm starting !   Now downloading Rear Windown and Notorious 1946 from Alfred Hitchcock ..well i hope those are his movies sekali turn out to be like porn movies then gonna be damm boring.
