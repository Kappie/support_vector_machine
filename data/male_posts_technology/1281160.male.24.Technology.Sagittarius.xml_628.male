Think u might have sent us to make us aware that there are websites of rajini by japanese which is a very old news to me.  And that link on butterfly......... Sari kadi. Yarru adhu ippidi time waste panni ivalavu aaraaichi panraangannu theriyala. But the site on UN Millenium goals is scintillating!  Hei vicky is younger to me atleast by two years manny. and so i felt too early. Hope u guys to have a good time at his marriage. Ennadhu ram is cominga? he dint come for my wedding and now he is going to go for vicky'sa? Ram this is not acceptable. ponaa othai thaan solliten.  by the way ram did u contact kicha? has he come back? how is he now? he hasnt posted even a single blog till date. seems to be so sick.  Hei Jax we can put in that empty space few lines of some interesting blogs. For eg. a gist or some punch lines of the discussion in our blogs. What do other guys say?  coz putting a review or some good articles might demand more space where as this gist or punch lines is more short and sweet. Moreover such good articles can be posted directly on blog itself if its a forwarded one or a link can be established for such things. So lets reserve that space for something interesting .  As an attempt i will post in my next blog an article which grasped me very much by its simplicity in explaining abstract things in such a clear cut manner. And jax u can use the first para of that artcile as the highligh of the article and put it in the empty space which also acts as a gist of what the article is all about! A link to the actual blog will follow at the end of this highlight ........  This is my idea jax and to implement is in ur hands.  Ok others, do tell jax, what else can be put. bye for a moment to cut copy paste the article which i read in next blog
