" 2nd lady says "I'm not pregnant!" 1st lady replys "Oops your not pregnant, uh thank you"  This is by far the dumbest commercial ever.   Have you seen those AE shows "Growing up Gotti" or "Airline" these shows are not good but you can't stop watching them. I watched Airline for like 3 hours the other day, and I couldn't stand the show just couldn't turn it off.
