It is surreal though breaking up with someone in the place where you were supposed to live together and take that next step...definitely not an easy thing.   But things like this seem to get easier with age and perspective. Or maybe I've just had time to get used to the thoughtlkasjdf.   Mjwernapalooza official freedom fest - coming soon - SUMMER of 2004 in NYC.   Developing...  I'm off to Dallas for 4 days. Probably not such a bad thing...
