At some stage you'll actually need to let go and let them balance, and sort it out themselves... they'll probably fall down, actually - its almost gauranteed, but we all do, and we need to, to an extent, to realise that we dont want to fall down. Down = ouch, ouch = bad, mental note = dont fall down. It's not easy, to set someone up for that fall tho, and it gets harder the more you care about them, but equally, it gets more important that you do. Sometimes, the easiest thing on the person that you care about in the long term, is the thing that seems hardest to do , right now. And so it is, that we learn to let go, first hand lessons are, after all, the best ones to learn - regardless of how many times we 'fall' to work it out.  As someone a lot more philosophical than me once said:  "Our greatest strength, is not that we do not fall, but that we find the strength to rise every time we do fall"  Training wheels off, bandaids at the ready. It's going to be a bumpy ride.  Peace Out.
