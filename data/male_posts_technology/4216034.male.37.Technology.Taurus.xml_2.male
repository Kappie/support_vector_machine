The recall includes the Audi TT and A4, Volkswagen Golf/GTI, Jetta, New Beetle, and Passat--all with 1.8-liter engines. The recall also extends to the Passat with W8 engine, all Volkswagens with the 2.8-liter VR6, and all cars with an Audi 3.0-liter V6. The majority of affected vehicles are 2001 and 2002 models. Only about 36,000 2003 vehicles are involved. The 2.8-liter V6 Passat is not affected by this recall. Gerd Klauss, president and chief executive officer of Volkswagen of America, said in a statement that "some ignition coils are not up to our high quality standards" and that the automaker intends to fix "every single car with these coils by replacing them whether they are broken yet or not." Ignition coils provide electricity to the spark plugs. Through dealer service reports, the automakers noticed that the coils in the suspect vehicles were failing at a higher-than-normal rate. If a coil fails, the "check-engine" light will blink and the car's performance may become rough, possibly to the point of losing some power. Neither Volkswagen nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration consider the coil failure to be a safety issue. VW says that roadside assistance is available for anyone who does not feel comfortable driving with a car that has a failed ignition coil. Letters went out to consumers at the end of January 2003 notifying them of the problem, Volkswagen spokesman Steve Keyes said. Car owners should make an appointment with their dealer. At present, VW is giving priority to those who have had an ignition-coil failure: broken coils will be replaced immediately. If the car has suffered a second failure, all the coils will be replaced. By March 2003, VW expects to be able to replace all ignition coils on a car if only one has failed. In order to minimize inconvenience, Volkswagen and Audi dealers will offer alternative transportation at no cost while repairs are made, the company says.
