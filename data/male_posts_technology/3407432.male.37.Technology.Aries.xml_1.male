Tried the "last known good", and apparently the last known good configuration was halfway through the first installation, because that's what it did. Weird.  Anyway, got the work done on time (just!), so I'm a very happy chappy.  Been to see Around the World in 80 Days (OK) and Spiderman 2 (quite good).  Having the weekend off for a change!
