But then again, the comic book never did, to my knowledge.  But yes I was absolutely stoked to see that my all-time favourite scene from the comic was actually used in the movie. The man is good with a blow-torch! :)  After reading the countless blogs of girls who were drooling over the men in   urlLink Troy  , the first thought that came to my mind when  urlLink Thomas Jane  was shown without his shirt was, "Brad and Eric - eat your hearts out!"  Now go and watch the damn movie, girls! :P
