Yet I find that the more I talk the less I am listened to. And I only end up getting frustrated.  Solution: When someone challenges the truth of my words, I need to check within myself if there is something that I can correct or learn. When I learn to do this, instead of being stubborn with what I have to say or blaming others, I find it easy to tolerate.
