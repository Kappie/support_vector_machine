The only annoying thing was towards the end I still had something to configure, and one of the guys in the class had finished. So he starts chatting away, to himself, stuff like.. "That wasn't too bad." and other random crap. Obviously you're not supposed to talk.  I felt like saying.. "Excuse me tutor. Please could you ask the student at to my left the PIPE THE FUCK DOWN before he gets a KEYBOARD ENEMA??"  Hopefully I should get my magical e-mail from the Linux gods in the next 48 hours or so.. yay!  An example of Australian humor...  In the trains that run around Sydney, there's a sign that reads "At night, travel near the guards compartment marked with a blue light." Well, today I noticed that somebody had scratched out parts of the sign, so it read "At night, rave near the guards compartment naked with a blue light." Marvelous.
