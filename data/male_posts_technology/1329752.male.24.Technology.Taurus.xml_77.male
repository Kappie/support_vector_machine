Well, nothing really special. I just miss blogging. Sometimes I need to feed this tiny little brain of mine and the only way that would let me satisfy these thoughts is to blog (well, just one method how to intellectually masturbate.)  I’ve got a new job with the same rate. Lots of people told me “pare bat d ka mag abroad?” My usual answer is “nde pa pwede eh”. I think my skills aren’t enough for a tough competition abroad. I was invited few weeks ago by my former boss to coach their new web developer. I asked him: “pare magkano starting mo?” He said: “Sir …” (after hearing his answer) I joked: “tangina mataas pa starting mo sakin ahh.. nde na kita tuturuan!”. Sabi niya: “Sir naman…” Well I was just joking about it. Naisip ko din: “onga pala.. last year payon and this is a different year.” Sometimes I used to think that time is moving too fast. I’m 23 and now I’m turning 24 and next year what? Yeah I need to look for a brighter perspective abroad or else…  No girlfriend still. Tagal tagal na din… 2 years ba? umm.. nope its 1 year and 8 months pala. That was August 2002 eh. Did I computed it right? After some harsh and traumatic experiences I think it’ll be better to wait for the right person. Well it’s not about having a no choice but an opportunity to make intelligent choices rather. Besides, I do have a prospect.   So what about her? I met her at work. She’s a colleague from another department (again). We’ve been dating a couple of times and I have already told her what my real feelings are. Well, still no violent reactions as of now. kidding aside, I like her. She’s the typical "saint" type. Not too pretty and not too smart (sophisticated types already brought paranoia to me). There’s one characteristic I do admire her most, her being close to God.  Very rare that we argue about religion though we have different spiritual beliefs. I guess that is also one of the many reasons why I like her. Well, still a long way to go. Besides, I think I’m moving too fast. I just started to work there 2 months or less and we’ve dated a couple of times and kissed her a couple of times. Hanggang dun lang. Kisses with sincerity. Besides, I wouldn’t care to take advantage even if I got the opportunity. I do respect her still.    It’s already 7 o’clock. One year na pala ko (pass the skyflakes and break my leg II). Thanks to all the visitors and referrers of my senseless blog.  Out muna ko. See you again maybe umm… after 3 months ulit?  Bye.
