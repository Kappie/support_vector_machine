Yes, I'm still here, and yes, I plan to stay for a while, but I'm just not sure what to think.   Why would Junior feel the need to do what he did? What can bring a person toa place such as that? We have good people dying needlessly every day and to have someone take their own life, it just seems so...wrong. I think we need more committment in life, more relationships, more love. For my part, I've tried to be supportive of everyone's views. I know Marcus is under a lot of stress, but since he seems to be isolating himself, I'll do my best from a distance. Melody is in a whole different ballgame. She is hurt and confused and somewhat vulnerable. Everytime I've seen her this week I've wanted to throw my arms around her and tell her that everything will be ok and that she should hang in there. She is such a nice girl and I hate to see her still so upset. At a time when she could really use Marcus' support, he's pulling away from her...hopefully he'll come to his senses. I can only hope that time will heal that wound...
