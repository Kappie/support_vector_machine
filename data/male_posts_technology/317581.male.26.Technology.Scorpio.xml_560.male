So he cooled things off and she eventually came around.  Things like that make me wonder if I should give up or go down fighting, especially if a girl is like, "I don't know". I often will disappear for a time and then come back and see what's up, but that NEVER works out. When you cut off communication it's a lot easier to get over someone. You quit thinking about them and caring as much.  Anyway, I think it's funny that he was ready to get married way before she was, and that she was able to be won over. Or maybe she just got freaked because she thought it should take longer. Or maybe because she wasn't ready to settle down yet. Or maybe because she thought he wasn't the ONE. Or maybe because she felt something better might come along.  I have no idea why she didn't want to get married, but now she does. She may be tohe only person that knows the true feelings. But it's kind of romantic.  Anyway, I need to work on writing my short story/autobiography of the early years. Peace- T
