NEC Electronics' authentication software offers a highly effective yet affordable solution to help detect such unauthorized products and prevent the damage caused by them." said Kazuo Nakamura, General Manager, Device SI Division, NEC Electronics.  Preventing damage is one thing, but stiffling competition is another. Who's to say that NEC won't use this authentication as an excuse to sue "unauthorized" after-market competitors under the DMCA for making compatible replacement batteries? After all, in order to be compatible, wouldn't these products would have to mimick the authentication codes of the original batteries? Such practices are exactly what got Static Control and Skylink sued in the printer cartridge and garage door cases mentioned above.
