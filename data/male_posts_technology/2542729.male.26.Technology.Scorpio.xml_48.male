I purposely did not respond to the "Union Address" for fear of damaging the bond between the two of us.  We are so divided by our logical reasoning...and joined by the reasoning of our emotions that I wanted to be sure of what I wanted to say before I said it.  As of today, I am still not ready to make that address and am in the process of meeting with the council to ensure that we reach a fair and firm decision.  To be continued.....  E: 0217
