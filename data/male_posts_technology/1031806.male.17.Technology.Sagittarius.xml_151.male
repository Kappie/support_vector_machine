I know that you’ll not be reading this until after you get back (possibly way after, knowing your email checking habits - lol) but I’ll write it like I am writing to you right now, not you a week from now.   ...If you understood that, I’ll be happy ‘cause I barely do reading through it again, tired as I am.   Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that I miss you and I’m praying for you. A couple days after I got that letter asking for prayer for the trip, I tacked it up on my wall to remind me to do just that. Initially, it helped a lot, I’d see it as I was going to bed, and pray for you for a while every night. Even several weeks before you left, it got so ingrained in my mind, that I was praying for the trip more than a couple times a day. (In fact, I don’t know really why I still have the letter up… maybe just sentimental reasons). Now, you’re one of the biggest things on my mind, day by day. I almost laughed when you asked me to be praying for everyone’s health to stay strong, in spite of lack of sleep, when you called last Tuesday. That was one of the major things God had pressed upon my heart since the day I found out you were going on the trip. Oh, and it’s not just me… several of my friends around the world are praying for the trip (and specifically you) too. They know nothing really about you other than you’re a friend of mine that’s going on a mission trip for around three weeks, and that I knew that you’d be appreciative if they were praying for it and for you.   On a slightly more personal note: I really do miss you. I’m gonna be so happy when I see your pretty face again, or even hear your voice. :)  (Do me a favor: don’t go somewhere far away for college right after you graduate. That’s really going to get to me, having to spend my senior year not really seeing you at all. Hmm… I guess I’ll just have to trust God about that one. Oh, by the way, speaking of God, I have to praise Him: all this week, more and more stuff has been happening to my family, but through it all, I’ve been amazingly happy. I just can’t get over this joyful spirit, and I thank the Lord for it (and I thank you for caring enough to tell me out right to “stay happy” last time we talked).    Oh well, my contacts are starting to annoy my eyes and I have to get up ½ an hour early tomorrow for work, so I’d better wrap this up and send it.   With love, in Christ,   ~Armaan
