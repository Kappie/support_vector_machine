Now how regular is "pretty regularly" is pretty much a debatable thing. But I do hope that it will really be "pretty regular"!! Confused?!! ... Great!... that WAS my intention. ;-) ha ha ha!! ... so I hope you people will visit this place "regularly" (groan... not again!!!) and have an inside view of my mind ... which can be quite chaotic at times! :-) so long folks! ... be seein' you! take care. cheers! - Sam
