'Now, you can make your voice heard around the world.'"  Ya know, I don't believe our soldiers should be over there in Iraq right now, their agendas are none of our business. Ok, a nation of oppressed people now have the freedom to speak out, but now they are using their new freedom to shoot at our soldiers.  Maybe we shouldn't be over there, but we are, so...I think that anyone who has the nerve to shoot at our soldiers should be quickly united with God, using nothing short of some heavy high tech piece of weaponry.  Anyway, good old Bush #2 is playing the part of both God and General like his papa did, moving his little pieces across the board.  His Agendas are wrong and his intentions are wrong.  The bottom line is, he's being driven by the oldest concept in the book, the good old $$$$. He's trying to promote patriotism, peace, and a new awareness to terrorism.  Well guy, you can't promote patriotism when you propose bills that want to cut overtime, jackass!!!  Oh, that'll really stimulate the economy...Not!  Let's see, if I lose overtime I'll be losing $7000 a year.  heh, Maybe I should go out and buy that new Corvette I've always wanted.  On top of it all, Bush isn't doing a darn thing about jobs going overseas, as a matter of fact, the US government plans to outsource 850,000 jobs.  Good work guys, all those war veterans who put their life on the line feel really appreciated right about now.
