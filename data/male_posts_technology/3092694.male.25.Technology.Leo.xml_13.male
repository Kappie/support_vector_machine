Teatime in particular.  Trying to stay off caffeine, coffee in particular, all the same, had tea this morning.   At Andrew Collins (host of 6 Music’s Teatime) prompting submitted an email on the talking point (aprox: “where were you not?”) which ran:      Dear Andrew, I wasn’t there at our last company meeting on Friday.  I was however enjoying a leisurely ride back to the office on my 1966 Schwinn bicycle, having just come from a delightful lunch at a local burrito establishment.  The consequences, alas, were having to endure much good natured heckling from my esteemed coworkers as I entered the conference room full of  more responsible employees who chanced to see me, quite sweaty, holding aloft a rather bulky vintage bicycle fresh from my climb up the stairs.  M.I.A. David C. Houder     Was it read on air to the whole of the British Empire and the internet audience at large?  Unknown.  Stuart called me to a ping pong match.  Left the series empty handed. I attribute the caffeine in this morning’s tea to a lapse in concentration which caused me to give away valuable points.   Will I go to lunch?  Unknown.  Tried to hold out yesterday, instead ate 12 ounces of pasta salad with green Tabasco.   Men working on the roof of the office.  Wouldn’t think it would require so much banging to repaper and tar the structure.  Bang.
