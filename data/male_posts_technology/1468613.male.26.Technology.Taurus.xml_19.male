Heathrow is not renowned for its welcoming atmosphere!  Well, since you've been gone SO MUCH has happened!   - Irena was evicted from the  urlLink BB  house last night with 33% of the vote. Ben, surprisingly, received 32% and very narrowly avoided the chop.  - Next Sunday the rest of the house will be  urlLink revealed  and all the housemates will be under one roof. I can't wait. - The Logies! They were fabulous! The Secret Life Of Us won Most Outstanding Drama, your  urlLink divine neighbour  was looking very sexy and the lovely  urlLink Rove McManus  won the Gold Logie.   Hope you're settling into your luxury pad and that your first day  urlLink on the job  goes well.
