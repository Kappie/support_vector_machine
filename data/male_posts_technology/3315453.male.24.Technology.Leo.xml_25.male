I also should be busy - I have a final paper due tomorrow in my History of Modern Ethics class - but at this point I don't think there's any possible way that I could be any less interested in Immanuel Kant.  I think my brain's already on summer break.  So now I'm stalling.  I'm finding myself lately speaking more and more like a philosophy major ("No, John, that doesn't necessarily imply that..." and "This doesn't provide a necessary and sufficient condition...").  I feel sorry for John; he couldn't win an argument if he wanted to because he doesn't have a clue what I'm saying.  Sometimes I wonder if I do.  In other news: Ronald Reagan passed away (today? yesterday?); Justin's in town but I have yet to see him; my last final's on Wednesday and I'm not even remotely prepared (only two more years of school yay); John and I are both itching for a little time to recooperate, to take back our mental and physical health.  The end of the quarter is so stressful, and the week after finals is such a letdown that all we do is like sleep for a week straight.  I'm so excited about my extended nap that I'm having difficulty focusing on the task at hand!    Zai jian!  Becca
