I'm calling my scripts "My Fairy Tales". Are they fairy tales?? I don't have the answer to this question. To me fairy tales are a bunch of lies wrapped in a beautiful story. Don't get me wrong when I say so. I do like fairy tales. My statement, merely my opinion. So is my fairy tale a lie?? No it isn't. It is a fairy tale with a difference. You have got to come to terms with the fact that my fairy tale is not a sugar coated candy. Forgive me for my attempt to sound poetic at times. Afterall, I love to write just as much as I love to talk. It has been missing over the last six years. This is just an attempt to ignite those old flames.
