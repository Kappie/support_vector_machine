Got a 'Thorn resistant' to see if that's what I need to hold the extra pressure due to Ben's trailer-bike.  Went to  urlLink the aquarium  for a few hours.  They have a new shark exhibit that we wanted to see.  Turned out to be not as good as we expected - not enough sharks!  It was more historic display of people's interaction and misconceptions of sharks; from ancient hawiian shark-god worship to Jaws.  And not forgetting shark-fin soup - what a stupid idea that is.   Did some beach time after the aquarium.  Then went to  urlLink The London Bridge, English pub .  Three pints of Smithwick's.  We had a great spot for the 4th of July fireworks, the fireworks were on a barge in the bay.  Admittedly, there's something ironic about watching the Independance Day fireworks from inside and English pub, but there you go.  I have to say the fireworks were a somewhat disappointing.  San Fran is much better.  Ben cried because the fireworks were too noisey.  But didn't want to miss any of it.  Got back to the camp-site around midnight.  Long day!
