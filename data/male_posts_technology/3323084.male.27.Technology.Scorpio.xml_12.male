Well I have.  While surfing through some blogs I found a post with a link on how to do this,  urlLink Chami.com FavIcon from Pics .  All I had to do was direct the site to an image that I wanted to become a favicon.ico and it made it for me.  Then follow the instructions on the page and youâ€™re done, it's that easy.  Although I haven't yet decided on one for this blog, I don't think it will be long until I do.   I  have a design in my head, now someone just needs to show me how to create it.  Until next time...
