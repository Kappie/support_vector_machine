I've had some insights recently that I've been wanting to share with my general public but I've been busy, so here it goes.  Insight #1: Most jerk men aren't jerks to the women they're courting. In fact, some jerks will not be jerks to the women in their lives, just to other men. However, for some it will eventually shine through to all their relationships, no matter how much they care about others.  Insight #2: Some people don't care about anyone outside of themselves. This goes for most people, I presume, but it is still a bit surprising for me.  Insight #3: Birth and Death are all relative (and death is much more lonely than birth). Today I had dinner with 2 pregnant women and 1 woman knocking on death's door. The woman that is close to death was scary to look at and see what the future held for us all. I don't know what I'm trying to say, except that it was a very interesting lunch with an interesting crowd.  Insight #4: to get rid of skid marks, a man must shave his ass. (I actually found this out by reading craigslist a long while ago, but have yet to test it)   OK, I'm going to go to sleep- Peace- Tim
