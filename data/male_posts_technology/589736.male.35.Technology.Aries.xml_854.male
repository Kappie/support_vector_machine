     
      Some random popcorn movies I consider equal to the Greats:  Die Hard, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Star Wars, Jaws, Goldfinger, The Matrix (with reservations), Terminator 2 (the first I consider only borderline popcorn, like Alien or Blade Runner), Aliens, True Lies, Dirty Harry, Ghostbusters, Animal House, Back to the Future, Beverly Hills Cop, Wargames, Trek II, Lethal Weapon.  Some random movies many consider bad or inconsequential, that I shamelessly adore:  The Cutting Edge, Dirty Dancing, Purple Rain, The Karate Kid, Caddyshack, Rocky III, Big Trouble in Little China, Smokey and the Bandit, Cannonball Run, Top Gun, St. Elmo's Fire.  Not an art film in the pack, none of them independent, and any one will please me as much as Allen, Fellini, Kurosawa, or Hitchock.
