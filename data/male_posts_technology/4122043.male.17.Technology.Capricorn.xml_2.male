It just like makes me feel so excited whenever one of my favorite shows comes on like Inuyasha or Van Dread, I just like freak out and get all "giddy", yes I just said "giddy," like a school girl. Laugh all you want but it's really interesting I like the intense story, not just for the action, but for the love story part. I guess I'm kind of a hopeless romantic. But whatever. A lot of people think I'm a loser or a geek, but there's only one opinion I care about. *Distant Stare* I'm not going to get into that right now but you all know who I'm talking about. GOD I can't get her out of my head just all day 24/7 all day every day she just keeps flashing into my mind. Sometimes I can't stand her, and other times she's like the most important person in my life and I can't get her out of my head right now is the latter. I don't really know what spurred this on, but I really hope nobody I know reads this especially one of my friends, cause I will never hear the end of it... ever. They always tease me about liking her, but they would do it even more if they read this, but I'm not writing it for them. I'm writing it for me. This is kinda like my own journal that's open to critique... by everyone.
