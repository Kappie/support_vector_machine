He said it was most amazing. He had been doing this thing where he wouldn't let himself come, but this was a special occasion. He said he blew a "Porn Star Wad". On a side note, Kev had hooked up with a chick my brother Craig liked, and to make right on the situation....Kev shared his girls with Craig. When Kevin asked if they were straight...Criag simply replied..."water under the bridge"  Kevin is out in L. A. this week for a job interview. If he gets it, that'll be 2 nuts in CA. All I can say is you californians lock up your daughters and get more insurance on your house!  Mr. Tom, my late grandma's husband, passed away yesterday. :o( Too much death!   On a side note, I found a bunch of voice recordings from the Chicago trip....soo fucken funny!
