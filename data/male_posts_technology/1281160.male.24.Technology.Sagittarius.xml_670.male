However i still have one unused silk saree....new in box....Persian blue (If I'm right).......  We have two functions here, conducted by the Indian community......we'll be going there.....we have planned to go to a temple, with our friends.....we don't have a temple, in Lexington......need to travel to a nearby place....one and a half hr travel....90 miles.....We have also planned to make some sweets, one dish per family(Kinda Potleg)......will sure be speaking with our parents  bro's.....  But inspite of all these, I feel, i'm missing something terribly.....the festive mood, the sound of crackers, flooded readymade showrooms, busy bakeries, my quest for chudis 'n sarees.....everything......  But this is far far more better than last year's Diwali......It was a friday......Ganesh went to office asusual......I hardly knew one family here....who were also far away from our place.....I was not that confident about my cooking experinces....So I did'nt try out anything new or different......I was afraid of deep frying also at that time(I had this problem for a long time....I've witnessed two deep frying accidents....one to my mom  the other one, to one of my aunts.Though now I'm very comfortable)......I was crying the whole day, so depressed.....nobody around me....Finally, i was okay in the evening, when i got dressed up, in my new silk saree  Ganesh took me to that one place whom we knew.....  This year, Bless me, we have so many friends around us.....we have plans to celebrate it together.....Hope we'll have a great time together......
