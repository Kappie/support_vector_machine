With that out of the way:  Never rearrange a woman's stuff.   I made that mistake yesterday when I was home sick. I thought I would rearrange the contents of these shelves we have in our hall closet... Big mistake. The girlfriend was none to happy that I was "snooping" through her stuff and moving it around. She said I should have let her do it... I thought I was being nice. It looks a hell of a lot better now and is more functional as a shelf rather than a "place where all my shit rests".
