I'll be working 0730 to 1900 on Friday, and the same on Monday.  But then I'll be off on Tuesday and Wednesday, then back to work on Thursday at 0730 to 1630, with normality resuming from then out.  This Saturday I'll be commiting acts of nearly unconscionable injustice against a member of the fairer sex in Magic: The Gathering, it almost makes my heart of coal warm.  Other activities are sure to occur as well, they always do, although none are currently expressly planned, my exhaustive memory banks tell me.    Let the Wookie win.
