The people of DPRK have a strong cultural bias toward self-sufficiency, so accepting foreign aid really rubs them the wrong way.  It is far more culturally acceptable to give something in exchange for this aid, such as assurances against building and selling WMD on the black market.  Too bad the DPRK government cannot get their economy to produce something the rest of the world really wants to buy.
