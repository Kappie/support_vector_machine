Hail oh good little man servant Danger, I would like to thank you for your obvious concern as to the identity of this so-called Adam Currie, I also was very dubious to hear from this strange character! What I found out was this....  'Many many many years ago (about 23 years) there once lived a 'Nipple Donkey', somewhere in the craggy peaks of the Himilayen mountains. Now this Nipple Donkey was named Chuck, Chuck the Nipple Donkey, and he was a very lonely Nipple Donkey for he knew of no other Nipple Donkey's in the immediate vacinity of the mountainside! He was very very sad :o(   Chuck the Nipple Donkey spent many a day walking around the rocky peaks on his own, humming lament tunes to himself about the days when he was a mere Nipplet (aaahhhhh bless), sometimes he would even jot down some harmonic melodies in his notebook, but not just any ordinary notebook, no it was a 'Notebook Especially Designed For Use By Nipple Donkey's'. Occasionally he would go and bathe in the calm rapids on the mountainside, and sometimes even take a dump in said rapids, if the need took him. But still he longed for a companion, a friend, a fuck! (well he was male).  The years passed, and Chuck began to get old, and began to lose hope of finding a soulmate. For many years he had tried to make relationships with alot of creatures he had met over the years, Badgers, Antilopes, Geese, Anchovies, Hedgehogs, Ants, Wasps (a notable failure resulting in a very swollen falas), he had even tried to befriend a swordfish he had met in a large lake!! But after many failures he realised that there just was no other life sustaining organism, that he could really identify with (aaahhh bless).  Now as Chuck the Nipple Donkey became old and yellow (for when Nipple Donkey's become old, they go yellow, not grey!), he despaired at not finding a soulmate, and not being able to spread his seed so that he would be remembered. So he travelled to the highest peak of the mountains, where he planned to jump from and sore like an eagle to his own paradise in the sky. However (drums rolling) as he perched himself on the edge the the rocky peak he heard a sort of squeeking sound coming from a cave not so far away, and it was a strange squeeking sound!  Chuck decided to put off the 'Big Leap Of Faith' as it later became known, and went to investigate the source of these noises. Lo and Behold, when he searched the cave he came across the most beautiful creature he had ever set eyes upon, an 'Arse Chicken'!!! But not just any Arse Chicken, no! For this was 'Muffy the Arse Chicken', and queen of all Arse Chickens (there aren't many), and she too was all so lonely!  So as it came to chance, Chuck the Nipple Donkey and Muffy the Arse Chicken accompanied each other in treking the mountainsides and they were gleeful for many years.  After many many many more years they decided that they had spent so much time together without getting totally bored of each others sight, that they made the decision to start trying for a little Nipple Chicken/ Arse Donkey (noone would ever know the difference between the two!).  They boinked and shagged, and rubbed together, and sat in each others cabbage patch, and sucked each other dry, and even drank out of the same stream! And AT LAST! Muffy declared that she was expecting Chuck's little Nipplet Arsey Thingy! YAY!!! YAY!!! YAY!!!  However (more rolling drums), before any more of this story got told, the writer decided that he was very very fucking bored of his latest creation and .......................................................................................................................................................................................'   Now to get back to your question Danger, I made many enquiries and much investigation as to whom Adam Currie actually is, and it was discovered that he may in actual fact be the offspring of the two strange beings told of in the above story!!! Although I cannot say for sure, hope this helped to resolve your question. Now as for our man Toaster complaining about how cold the SNOW!! is, I cannot comment other than to say 'You Plonker Toaster!' of course it's fucking cold, your surrounded by SNOW. We can all bitch at him when he gets back, on the subject of the 'Great Canadian Accent Scandal' as I have here-by named it.  ALL HAIL, ALL HAIL, ACTIVE COMMANDER BAITY signing off..........
