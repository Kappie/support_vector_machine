"Don't be angry," the mother says, "Your little sister doesn't realize that pulling hair hurts."  A short while later, there's more crying, and the mother goes to investigate.  This time the sister is bawling and her brother says, "She knows now."  -=+=-  After church on Sunday morning, a young boy suddenly announced to his mother, "Mom, I've decided I'm going to be a minister when I grow up."  "That's okay with us," the mother said, "But what made you decide to be a minister?"  "Well," the boy replied, "I'll have to go to church on Sunday anyway, and I figure it will be more fun to stand up and yell than to sit still and listen."   -=+=-  Funny Definitions  Antacid: Uncle Acid's wife.
