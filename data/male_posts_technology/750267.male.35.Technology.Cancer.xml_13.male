I found myself watching the ceremonies, and generally interested in the documentaries that were aired that day. Our local network (the  urlLink CBC ) did a respectable job with the view from the Canadian perspective.  And by September 12th, it was all over. We were talking about bombing Iraq once again. Back to normal!  So, forget most of what I posted on September 6th. It all worked out fairly well.  Scott
