I wonder what is happening... why are mails being taken too personally... and why these unecessary words like "discimination". And why do people think one is trying to discriminate if he uses his company's name...   I wonder if I were working in "Mangaathaa technologies" and used that name in my mail, then will they think I'm discriminating... is it a punishment I'm getting for working in a big company... ???
