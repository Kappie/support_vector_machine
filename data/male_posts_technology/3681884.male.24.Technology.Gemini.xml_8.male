But really, there's more to a job than how much money you're getting, right?  The people I work with are great.  Well, all except the thieving CFO, but I think he learned his lesson.  If the work environment were any more relaxed, people would be having sex on the conference tables... or, dare I think it, setting cold drinks on their desks without using coasters.  I get car service, free lunches, dinner, unlimited sick and personal days, great benefits...  So, isn't it really that bad that I'm underpaid?  Yeah.
