I was trying to get jebe's supergreg picture to link by telling her about the onclick=location.href thingy, but then it didn't work and she had to call her parents.  So now I feel bad cause I don't know what's wrong with it and I may have had her break it accidentally:(  Oh my goodness: it works now:) I guess she figured it out:) YAY! I love when links work:)  Sorry for cunfusing you jebe!
