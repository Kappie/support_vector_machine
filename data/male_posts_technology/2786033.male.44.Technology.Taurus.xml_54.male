When he and his wife were in their 20's they wisely planted Doug fir and mixed hardwoods on about a third of their spread.  It is now a respectable stand of timber and would have made a decent retirement fund.   It would have, except for our local  urlLink Doomsday cultists.   He has been prevented from cutting one tiny sapling for fear of harming  spotted owl habitat. Roy's house got pretty worn down, and he still wouldn't take help from anybody.  Social services moved him into one of those geriatric warehouses.  I suppose the property will be sold for taxes one of these days. Those owls are doing a lot better than Roy and a bunch of old ranchers just like him.
