Rini, I visited the link you specified. they don't seem to have a requirement in their opportunity list. As for today's Hindu, could someone send the details to me. The versions and opportunity listings differ from city to city.   Could someone also check  urlLink this company . Looks good, still better to be safe.  Rini, I don't remember the name of the school. But I think it was not the school you had mentioned. I'll try to recollect if possible.  Bala, the format of the resume is to mimic the  XML  format. It is not  XML , da. It is pure  XHTML . Putting it in  XML  sounds good. Let me see if that is possible.
