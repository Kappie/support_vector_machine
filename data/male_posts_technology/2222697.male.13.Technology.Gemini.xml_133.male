In the city, attending public school (which I have nothing against) I found most of the people that spoke out differed from me, even though most of the people were agreeing with me they just ignored the obnoxious fools who expressed their feelings in a public environment. Now that I have moved, most of the people here I know are homeschooled and agree with me but don't really care because they are the majority.  What really makes me mad is when idols say their opinions, I used to love the Beastie Boys' music, and now I wont read Cat's (from TTV) weblog. I have refrained from my opinion being expressed here because of most of the loud obnoxious liberals will scream at me because we are stealing oil... yet we are not stealing oil. We are selling it and giving it to Iraq. Not that hard people if you want to express your opinion watch FoxNews also!  The election is going to hell this November, Bush is the most hated presedent probably ever and Kerry changes his mind every other second. So obviously Kerry is going to win because of the "Vote for something" commercials on MTV.  Another thing I hated was when Reagan died, Foxnews was completely silent watching the funeral and CNN was talking about his love for chocolate.  But why should I care, I live in Tyler now.
