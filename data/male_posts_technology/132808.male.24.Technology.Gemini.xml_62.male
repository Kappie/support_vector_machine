For anyone who's seen the Journey DVD, I have to ask: is it just me, or is there an abnormally large amount of MILFs in the audience?  Never have I said, "I don't care if she's 40, I'd so bang her" so many times in a 90 minute period.  2.  I was showering at the Wellness Institute when I remembered something that happened to me about a year ago.  I was at work, dropping a deuce, when my nose started to bleed.  So there I was, crunching it like a madman, toilet paper crammed in my left nostril turning a deep shade of crimson when I thought to myself, "If someone was to bust down the door and take a picture, there is no possible way I could look any more unattractive than I do right now."  Anyone else ever have that feeling?  What happened?
