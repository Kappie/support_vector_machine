This rocking new job will enable me to get into the nitty gritty of the tough ISP Industry in Australia and dabble in things such as broadband packages, VoIP programs, telephony and more. I can't wait... My last day at  urlLink IBC  is tomorrow and I imagine if the past few days are indicative of tomorrow's atmosphere, it's going to be a quiet one. Nevertheless, drinks at the Queens to celebrate... er, I mean, say "goodbye." You can continue to keep in touch with me via my home  urlLink email  address. Look forward to hearing from you.
