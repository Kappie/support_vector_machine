As of just the last few weeks, it has FINALLY been changed to "Star Trek:Enterprise".  Like all series in the ST francise, it seems that around Season 3 the show really hits it stride and takes off.  Star Trek: The Next Generation (here after called ST:TNG) really took off with "The Best of Both Worlds, Parts 1  2.   DS9  (Deep Space Nine)...well...thats sorta my favorite right now, so it hit it's stride early on. Voyager got better as soon as Janeway let that bun down. Any one would be crabby if your hairs wound so tight it's pulling it out by the roots!      Enterprise had an OK first two seaons. Several episodes really stood out..and some really stunk too.  People complain about how the Enterprise NX-01 can look so modern compared to what it looked like in the original series with Kirk in command.  My answer on it? They have to make it look primitive and crappy because the first show it's based on was from 25odd years ago, that it has to have crappy special effects now?  Hell  no..  why should they?  So it just doesn't match up...it's not done in an age of fantastic effects.  But we have them now, so lets use 'em!  Now with Season 3 of Star Trek:Enterprise under way, we're finally getting to see alien species that are totally CGI (Computer Generated Image).  They look way awesome and it's about time they started doing this.  The crew is totally on their own in a very hostile area of space. They have some Federation Marines   on-board for combat situations. Capt. Archer and crew are trying to find the home world of the Xindi, a "species" that has it out to destroy Earth.  There are 5 different kinds of Xindi and they are all completely different from one another.    Capt. Archer is very much different this season. He's harder, more seasoned, grown a back-bone. He's so far looked like he's willing to do whatever it takes, and on occassion crossing the line to make it happen.    Well....thats it for this entry, will follow up with more soon.
