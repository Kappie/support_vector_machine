It was in there, I knew it was. I felt the drips of sweat running down my cheeks. I was going to have to move. I willed my body forward and ran towards the entrance of my craft. I heard the alien's squeal as it chased after me. Must go faster. Must go faster.  It was gaining on me, and I heard it leap at my back. The impact sent me crashing forward and it was face to face with me. My pistol skidded across the floor, well out of reach now.  It's sticky, hot breath  was choking me,  then it showed it's teeth, rows of razor sharp minature daggers. It's head cocked to the side and it said, "Adam... looks like we can't sign in. Any chance you could take a quick look?"  You SEE! I'm even dreaming of work!! I don't mind on this occasion because I was doing my Sigourney Weaver. But when i'm having a oil massage by Rachel Wiez it's going to be really off-putting. Bring on my freakin' holiday.
