I've got work, school registration and the associated schedule juggling, the kids including new baby, family visiting from half a country away...   Waitaminit. Who are you again?   Heh. Let's just say there hasn't been a whole bucket of goodies to scorn in the local news lately. Courthouse woes seemed to have been solved, as construction has begun. Goodie. More surface area for protests.   I hope to get some posts in here and there. Once school begins in the fall, I have a feeling I'll be spending some time tearing apart the jr. NYT that is the opinion dept. of the OSU Barometer. One such asshat had an article advocating abortion as a means of population control, likening the world's growing population to time-lapse photography of mold encompassing a loaf of bread. Now, I can't speak for this particular fellow, but we're not  all  as dumb as mold.
