As soon as the Lakers closed the gap to one score I knew Kobe was going to make the shot.  There's no way that shot does not go in.  And he got that opportunity thanks to Rasheed Wallace's foul on Shaq, which he miraculously converted into a three point play.  
 
 And did anybody doubt that the game belonged to the Lakers once that shot went in?  The Pistons didn't have a chance after that basket.  I'll be surprised if they don't get swept at home to lose the series 4-1.  All this after dominating the middle of the fourth period.  It's sad, really...I don't even care about the NBA.
