Once active in a system, it periodically changes users' designated homepages to xupiter.com, redirects all searches to Xupiter's site, and blocks any attempts to restore the original browser settings." I got hit by this one while approving ads for work.  Suddenly, you get a really ugly toolbar in IE, complete with scrolling text.  It's like an ad for a crappy BBS has been appended to your browser.
