She had this older, mature look to her.  She was calling someone on her cell phone.  She had this look on her like it was the last thing she had to do before she got out of here.  Then she could call it a day...  Staring off into the distance past the front desk at some goal she could see on the horizon of her mind.  As I walked down the stairs toward her direction it occured to me that she deserves to call it a day.  She has this stature about her that makes you know she's worked hard for this company, and she knows it.  I don't get this just from looking at her, I've also worked with her.  But when I worked with her, she was sitting behind a desk, and I didn't get to see the confidence she inspires while standing, waiting to leave, making a phone call.  I don't think I payed that much attention to her looks until today, when I saw how she was stunningly different than the rest of the people in the lobby, doing thier end of day chores.
