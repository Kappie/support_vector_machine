But i promise it will be up before i die. The main focus of the site will be about downloading anime and manga stuff (and emulators). Although i probably will not upload the files from there so i will have links to other sites.  i will have news and junk about anime and video games and geek stuff. currently i am trying to find games to review because im the game reviewer for the rpgmaker 95 program at www.vizzed.com. im sorry i didnt post yesterday but no one reads this exciting and interesting blog. the comments are up and hopefully work. and if you have ideas for my rpg please email me at samuraipanda5@hotmail.com ,later
