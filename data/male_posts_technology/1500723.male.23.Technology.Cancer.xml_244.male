       
       The Impossible Dream   To dream the impossible dream,  to fight the unbeatable foe,  to bear with unbearable sorrow,  to run where the brave dare not go...   To right the unrightable wrong,  to love pure and chaste from afar,  to try when your arms are too weary  to reach the unreachable star!   This is my quest —  to follow that star  no matter how hopeless,  no matter how far —  To fight for the right  without question or pause,  to be willing to march into hell  for a heavenly cause!   And I know  if I'll only be true  to this glorious quest  that my heart  will be peaceful and calm  when I'm laid to my rest.   And the world will be better for this  that one man, scorned and covered with scars,  still strove with his last ounce of courage  To reach the unreachable stars!
