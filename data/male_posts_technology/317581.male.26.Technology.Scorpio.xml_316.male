Sometimes I think that children should have to remain at home, then they wouldn't be running into me at the store.  Thank God I got my christmas shopping done. And the presents are wrapped.  Tomorrow the neices and nephews show up.... *sigh*  I'm still sick but at least I got drugs. Looking forward to the party tonight. I think my mom wanted me to be all excited about the presents for me under the tree. It was just difficult getting excited after driving down, being sick, and the shit hanging over my head right now. you know?  Sometimes it feels like all I do is complain. I'm sorry. I wish I could be more jovial:( maybe next year. T
