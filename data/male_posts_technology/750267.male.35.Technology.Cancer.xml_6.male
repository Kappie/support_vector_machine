I just discovered it's in its second season.) The basic theme has been done before --- place a hidden camera, throw in an actor acting weird, and watch people's reactions. Like Candid Camera has been doing for 50 years. But this guy, Jamie Kennedy, takes it to a whole new level.  On Candid Camera, the premise isn't that funny but people's reactions generally are, so they play the same joke on 30 people. "The coffee cup starts moving mysteriously... Oooo!"   On this new JKX show, it will take 10 minutes for me to explain the joke they played on ONE person. The episode I saw was hilarious. Not just a chuckle either, this was a good "belly of your stomach" laugh. I hope more people discover this unique show.
