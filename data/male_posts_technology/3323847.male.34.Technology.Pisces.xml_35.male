I don't recall a myriad of vulerabilities coming from the  urlLink Windows 2000 source code theft  (it was more entertaining than anything else).  Also, Linux is open to everyone who would like, and that's no more (or less, depending on who you talk to) insecure than any other operating system.  One thing for sure, if true, this will  certainly  be a VBT for Cisco.  Shareholders will not be happy.
