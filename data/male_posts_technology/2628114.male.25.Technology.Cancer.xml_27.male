Well I continued on with another tortuous (quad-wise) cross training session on Friday, 1/30/04 at my unsuspecting sister and brother-in-law's house.  I completed 21 minutes (3 5and2s) on the elliptical to start which left my quads burning, but I followed that by an intense speedwork session on the stairclimber.  I finished with the rowing machine, which I am happy to announce that despite the machine being a pain in my butt (literally), I was able to complete 10 full minutes without stopping.  As desperately as I want to run, it was nice to workout indoors with the wind chills below zero as they were.  Everything felt great and I was very excited to have a another workout of burning muscles and a soaked t-shirt.  My knee and legs feels great.  I am certain the consistent ibuprofen has helped with the healing.    Now, on to the best news of all!  Due to my semi-spontaneous trip up north, my training schedule was a little thrown off with sleep deprivation and random silliness.  Either way, after our fraternity football event at Ohio Northern University, I got the yearning to run.  My knee felt fine in spite of the cold so I decided to give it a try.  I started incredibly slowly since the ground was covered in ice mines, it was pretty cold, and I still wasn't sure my knee could handle it.  I was overjoyed to find that my knee was fine.  I was able to complete a 30 minute run with no aches or pain.  True, it was not the 60 minute run or long workout that I needed to complete for training, but it was a success in my own mind now that I am able to continue running.  This brings the word of the week full circle since I was "stoked" about being able to run.
