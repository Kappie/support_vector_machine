Besides simply adding more and more stuff to action films, I never could see how they could really get any better than the tons of stuff we've all seen since  Indiana Jones  through  Pirates of the Carribean .  But Sam Raimi does it.  The direction, the fantastic use of the camera, during the battle on the train was phenomenal.  Not just capturing the same kind of framing that is used in comic books, but also jarring us with chaotic angles that take us into a sort of Spidey's-eye view of the world.  And Kristen Dunst...ahhhhh. I do so like the red headed ladies.  McGuire and Molina were more than fine in their respective roles, although I didn't really see the chemistry between them--something you only very rarely see in films--a sub-sensory visceral connection between hero and villain.  On the spot now I can only recall it between Keaton and Nicholson in  Batman .  It is that rare.  The romance is touching and noble.  The theme of responsibility for one's choices (going a tad beyond the first film's theme of the responsibility that comes with power), is worthy of far more grandiose films.  Or you can just sit back and ride the roller coaster.  But do yourself a favor and note some of the symbolism such as the the power of great aspirations to lift you above the humdrum of life and how when we give up our dreams we come crashing to earth.  Note, too, the Christ-like crucifixion as Spidey "gives his life" for strangers and how they become his ersatz evangelists by not spreading his word but by living the example he set for them.  Good stuff, I'm telling ya!  Unless you're like my stepdad or my wife's Uncle Bill, neither of whom can tolerate a film that deals in any way with something outside of recorded human experience, see this movie.
