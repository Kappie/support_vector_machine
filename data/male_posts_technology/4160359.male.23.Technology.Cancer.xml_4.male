One of the most interesting things about this fair that really set it apart from all others for me was the addition of an "Indian Villiage" setting.  Because of the Reservation that is a stone's throw away, Native American culture is threaded through everything in the area.  They had beadwork, dreamcatchers, carvings, and all kinds of interesting trinkets.  I was fascinated.  I was thinking of getting a wolf carving for Girlfriend, but unfortunately, my monetary sources are quite low at this time.  I need to start saving up some serious cash here soon.  I ate freshly-made Taffy, which was so fresh, it was still warm, and it hadn't hardened enough to hold its shape.  It bent over in my hand.  I enjoyed it.  I also had some Ribbon-Fries.  Thats another thing I never saw before.  Ribbon-Fries are just glorified potato chips.  I wouldn't pay $6 for them if I were you.  I also saw a set of hot-tubs.  I now want one for whatever house I end up getting eventually.  Once again, Money prevents this from happening now.  Oh well.  I can dream.  All in all, I had a good time, and I spent less than $10 for the whole thing.
