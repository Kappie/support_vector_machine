They are still shrink wrapper and are huge volumes so I'm going to read them and then sell them over ebay and make my money back and then some.  When I got home I was really craving my last bowl of chili so I look in the fridge and MOTHERFUCKER -- it's missing. I check the sink and the empty bowl is there. I told you that Jeff and Marcie stayed over last night which I was okay with but as if they had to eat my chili. Jeff already owes me 5 bucks and I let him come over and eat my steaks and I buy beer and he drinks them and I let him and his girlfriend stay the night which was all good. But grrrr. Anyway, I'm just over reacting. He just owes me some steaks, that's all  So I had about 4 perogies left and I ate them and checked the messages. Oh shit! We're practicing at 5:30 today. I eat and go out the door. I'm 15 minutes late but I went as fast as I could given the circumstances. Mike's not there yet anyway. He shows up and we run through our 4 new songs and they go pretty damn great. We quit at 7:45 and I decide that I still want to go watch Greendale even though I'll be going alone since Curtis' friend is visiting him from Mexico.  I thought I was gonna be late but it was The Broadway Theatre's member appreciation night (free movie for members!) and there was still a bunch of speeches and prizes going on. It was pretty boring for me, I just want to watch my free Neil Young movie.   The movie was really good. It was uneven at times but all-together beautiful. It was shot entirely on super 8 and there is no dialogue. All of the store comes from the songs which are sometimes (badly) lip synched. Right now my favoirte song from it is "Grandpa's Interview" it's so long and gorgeous with those slow-motion guitar solos that make me love Neil  Crazy Horse.  Well tomorrow night Calexico is here so I'll be checking that out.
