I will have to wait and see how it all shakes out after this weekend, as the weather is very nice and i expect most everyone will be out there giving it plenty. Will have to wait and see.    On Friday, I dragged Mark(friend from School) out with me to go on a bit of a geocaching adventure, he is a reluctant cacher, does not enjoy it, not sure why will have to ask him... anyway...  Went and finished off some the other caches i intended to do last sunday but never managed to, did most all in the area but one. The highlight of Fridays trip was the grave of the fifth Earl of Carnarvon who apparently discovered Tutankhamen's Tomb in 1922. I almost died climbing to the top of the hill wheezing something chronic...    Today I went back to that area again and finished off a couple more caches that i wasn't able to get to last night, and started finishing off the caches in west berkshire, got three or four more to do before i complete west berkshire, will save them for another day.     Have started to use another web browser Mozilla Firefox ( urlLink download it! ) It is an open source browser. and has some rather neat features in the downloading and watching of web pages department.    Watched Starsky and Hutch last night, was all Mark's idea, am quick to add, but actually did find some parts quite funny, which might be explained by half a bottle of wine.
