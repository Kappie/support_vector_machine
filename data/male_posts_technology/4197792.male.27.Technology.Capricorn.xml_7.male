       
      Yesterday I had to take the day off since my kids daycare was closed.  Well, I can work at home, provided there are no kids to feed, change, discipline, coddle, read too, talk too, switch TV channels for and mediate arguments for.  I think I answered 2 emails yesterday for work.  Enter, Today!  I have 79 emails to answer (not counting the ones I could delete without reading) and still counting.  I have to give credit to those people who 1) work at home or 2) own their own business.  I can't imagine the stress level these people must feel.   I usually do extra work at home every night, but only after the kids are in bed, my wife's in bed and my TV shows are over (being that it is summer time this is not a big deal).
