 I agree with this a 100%. The problem with a lot of Flash designers is they think more about what looks cool rather than what is easier for the user to comprehend. I think the  real art in web design  is an easy to understand UI that looks elegant, and a lot of times Flash designers give you the opposite. They don't understand it's not about "the art", but about the user.
