All I've discovered is there was some fuck up with the timesheets and no one can explain to me what happened or whose responsibility it was. Surely it can't be that hard to pay a measly salary to one resource when the whole project is worth multi-millions? Yes I know, it's all fucking bureaucracies and the number of hands that are involved.  It still doesn't make me feel any better, especially after what an exceptionally  FUCKED  week I've been having, compounded by the fact that I'm broke. Today I caught a cold too, how nice.  I'm just waiting for someone to try and mug me so I can beat the living hell out of them and break their mother-fucking legs.  I seriously mean that.  Then again with my luck, I'll be charged with battery and using excessive force not warranted by the threat.  I really need to break something right now.
