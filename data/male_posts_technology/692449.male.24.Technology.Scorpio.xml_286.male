In other news I've been busting my ass at school so I haven't had a lot of time for other activities. I have been playing a MUSH with epw  urlLink here  and so far that's a bunch of fun. I have a 1st level lawful netural dwarf fighter named Varn. I really like my character and for once I get to play instead of dm. Anyway I'll try really hard to update more often.
