Frequencies over time are naturally  rendered as histograms. Percentages are routinely conveyed by statisticians  through pie charts. More relevant to those of us who spend the majority of our  days in meetings, time-based data is often expressed in the form of a calendar.  In fact, calendars make our lives easier by organizing activities into  timelines, allowing us to view event-based data from any number of angles.       Unfortunately for a developer, the  acquisition of new event-based data sources often translates into writing new  calendar controls to display that data. And while this is certainly a manageable  if not resource-consuming task, many individuals and organizations already have  installed on their home and work computers one of the most full-featured and  robust calendaring application ever to be written. I'm of course referring to  Outlook. Microsoft Office Outlook 2003 has simply stunning calendaring  capabilities. With Outlook, I can view weekly highlights, monthly summaries, and  daily snapshots. I can view the calendar in standard form or as an organized  list of events. I can view my personal calendar side-by-side with that of my  teammates, gaining the ability to drag-and-drop scheduled items between them. I  can even display a Microsoft Windows SharePointâ„¢ Services event list as a  calendar within Outlook.     With this feature set, it'd be a shame  to have to reinvent the wheel every time someone required the ability to display  a new data source. For example, why can't I use Outlook's calendaring  capabilities to display my group's server downtime schedule as culled from the  servers' event logs? Why can't I use it to display my Windows Scheduled Tasks?  Why can't I use it to display recent posts from my favorite RSS feeds? And why  can't I use it to display the recording schedule from my Windows XP Media  Center? In fact (drum roll please), I can.
