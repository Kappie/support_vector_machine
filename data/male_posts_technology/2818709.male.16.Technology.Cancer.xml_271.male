I really like the pink triangle. I was listening to the song, and it struck a few chords...and i said to myself, "I've never seen any good weezer backgrounds. I'll make my own." So, i made it. I think it's pretty damn good. I might make a pink triangle blog layout...I think it'd be a big hit on blogskins. I kina zombied out once i got home, doing nothing but concentrating on psd...i'm tired...tired of school...tired of a lot of things. I really wish things were like they were last year. We were all dumbasses...and we didn't care. There wern't any "judges" like there are now. Next year will be better with most of the people gone. It'll give me a chance to concentrate on my work...i'm sorry if any of the "judges" take offense to this, but, i felt like saying it. I havn't posted anything that related to my feelings, and that's what journals are for, right? Oh well.    Let me know the truth, let me know the truth...
