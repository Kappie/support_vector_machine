In Iraq have things have kicked of again with Al Sadr and his army, there have been a huge number of deaths on both sides and it looks like it will continue. I also believe they have declared war on the British down south in Basra.  Basra has been relativley quiet and more stable than Baghdad or Najaf, and certainly more secure than fallujah.  This could be a worrying trend with the resistence controlling large parts of the country be it that we dont see such reports in the media, Iraq would begin to resemble Afghanastan. Watch this space I am sure there will be  more to post on this issue.   Garlo btw football season is started back today, our year this year i hope (LIVERPOOL are  my team)
