Ann made a surprise appearence coming home Saturday night (two dayts early).  Her friends got elevation sickness and they decided to cu tthe trip short...no problem with me.  Sunday, Tom and Justin accompanied me to one of the most atrocious Reds games I have ever seen.  The best part of the game was a Wilton Guerrero infield single.  The best part of the day was when a mullett dude yelled for a security guard because a kid threw a sno-cone at him.  Later the three of us went to BW3's for Summer Slam.  I am not going to run down the card.  There are other places to find that info.  Instead I am going to tell you that we watched it with an old lady.  Justin for once...was weirded out.  It was great.  Tony from Addex was there.  That was cool.  I hadn't seen him for the longest time.  When he got fired from Addex we only heard stories, but it was rumored that he showed p the next mornign to confornt the lil terrorist Mark.    Monday I spent watching wrestling by myself (JUSTIN!!!)...you can read more about this experience on Tom's up and coming commentary on Bizzaro World.  Then Jsutin came home and we went to Dana's where we met up with the Gog' Guys and Ann....they were not together.  Nicole Roney made an appearance...she was with Claire and were celebrating 21st birthdays.    Tuesday not much happened.  In fact I don't remember Tuesday at all...    Wednesday..we went car shopping.  That is right.  Justin is going to buy a Jeep.  We played dont let the car salesman tok to you game.  We would park and walk with confidence.  Justin would write down info and when someone came up we would walk the other way...it was great.  Later that night I officially met Elizabeth, Ann's roomate.  That puts two down with two to go.  Rol and Kristin were there.  We watched Leno...  Thursday...I spent most of Thursday working on a cd or both Ann and Kristin.  I am having no trouble finding sonns for Kristin...I knoiw what she likes.  I know what she doesn't like, and I know what she needs to listen to (more Ma$e!).  She will like what ever I send her as long as her three songs are on there.  Ann on the other hand is different.  True she will probably like whatever I do...but I want her to REALLY like it.  I have found about 6 solid songs so far.  Everything I listen just doesn't seem cool enough for her...anyway...  Kristin, I hope this suffices you.  Please, edit...  Until next time...
