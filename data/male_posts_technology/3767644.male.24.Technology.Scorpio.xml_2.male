I smell the sweet country side, Whilst I wander the meadows, The grass, fresh from the morning dew, Sways bringing my memories to life  When I would run through the tall grasses, I had her beside me, following, I wished then as i wish now, She stays on, through all times.  Why should I feel a tear roll, Moist should becomes my eyes, tearful, I knew dreams fade away at dawn, Someday I shall realize the same.  The morning mist has faded down, To reveal a land kissed by its presence, I pick up a fairweather flower Fresh, pretty like the girl I knew.   (C) Copyright Ritesh Nair 2004
