New Scientist reports that it's risky and some say it shouldn't be done, but that isn't stopping a team of US surgeons preparing to carry out the world's first face transplant. More news as and when I can find it. Insert gag about face being rejected, because you're so ugly.  I think this one has the legs to run and run... just remember, you heard about it first at New Links!  Note to mmC : I think we need the science icon promoted to the sidebar... I'm gonna run out of bandwidth soon!
