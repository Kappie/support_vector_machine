If you're not familiar with the Oscar winning film, it's essentially a documentary that follows   ULTRA  -liberal (note: I cannot emphasize the word ultra enough here) Michael Moore in his quest to determine why the United States has so many gun related homicides compared to the rest of the "civilized" world.
 
 This is an interesting question to ponder.  The thesis put forth in the film is three-fold.  Firstly, there is an enormous number of guns readily available in our country.  Second, there is a pervasive fear that is constantly fed from all directions that creates an edginess amongst our citizens.  Third, there are fundamental break-downs in the social fabric of our nation, causing rifts in the family unit.  These rifts give reason and opportunity to those who wish to perpetrate gun-related crimes.  Personally, I find part two of the thesis to be the more intriguing part of the equation.  I've felt it myself: why are people so afraid of everything in this country?
 
 I'm no psychologist, and I certainly have not performed any research in this area, but I can definitely go along with Marilyn Manson's comments in the film.  The government, mass media, and big business all want you afraid.  They want you to be afraid that the terrorists are going to kill your kids.  They want you to be afraid that if you don't get rid of your acne, you won't get married.  They want you to suspect your spouse of infidelity.  They want you to buy duct tape, sheets of plastic, teeth whitening strips, and a Lexus.  Fear motivates people to spend money and convinces them to allow others to act in an immoral fashion.   Fear is the lubricant of our great nation's empirical engine. 
 
 Why do they want us to be afraid?  What does our fear do for them?  Essentially, the government, mass media, and big business are not exempt from this fear.  They are equally afraid, but for different reasons.  You have to ask yourself, "Who has the power in this nation?"  Answer: rich white guys.  What strikes fear in the heart of a rich white guy?  Losing their power; their strangle-hold on the wealth and the ability to make the decisions in this country.  President Bush and his conglomerate of fear-mongerors are afraid that the United States will cease being the ultimate-super power they think (and I emphasize think) we are.  Ted Turner, Rupert Murdoch, and the rest of the media giants are afraid that they will lose their grip on the public (and their pocketbooks).  Fear of losing power drives these men to a means to hold on -- by making sure that the general public lives in fear.
 
 The worst part of the situation is the side-effects.  We have to be afraid of something.  So the media must pick someone to terrorize us: black men, Muslims, women, etc.  The United States, the supposed melting-pot of the world, cannot come together as one because the media divides us.  Whether consciously or not, mass-media drives the public's pre-conceived notions of other people.  Sadly, those notions are ones of fear -- not the type of emotion that glues a nation together.
