It only refelcted my state of mind and was not meant to lash out at anybody.Iwould not beposting any more of those in here anymore. One, I don't want the whole wide world to be reading them and second I want to add a comic touch to my posts. My inspiration Sindin Vadukut. This guy's posts are hilarious . The link to his blogs is  urlLink http://sidin.blogspot.com/ . It is a must read.
