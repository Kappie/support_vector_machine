I think I'll start out my journal with a list:  top 5 movie villians.  1.  Leonard Smalls - Randall "Tex" Cobb - Raising Arizona 2.  Liquid Metal Man (aka T-1000) - Robert Patrick - Terminator 2 3.  Agent Smith - Hugo  Weaving - The Matrix 4.  Commodus - Joaquin Phoenix - Gladiator 5.  Mama Fratelli - Anne Ramsey - The Goonies  Admittedly this list is weak with only a trio of true badasses, but they popped into my brain at the moment. (credit #4 to Big Al)     I'm polishing off a bottle of bourbon that a good friend of mine and I started this past weekend (mmmm.... bourbon)  My weekend starts tomorrow because I'm taking Friday off.  wooohooo!    Big Al had jury duty today.....boring!  She just had to sit in a room and read the book she brought for 4 and a half hours.  I hope I never get jury duty, though I do like to read.  Keeping on the sunny side, we did get to have lunch together today...a rare occasion for us on a weekday.  RANT - Based on a conversation between my boss and a coworker yesterday:  What the hell is it with the letter q and and the letter u?  They're always together.  U can exist without Q but Q can't exist in a word without a following U (not counting proper nouns and acronyms).  Hell, Scrabble strategists will tell you to hold a U until the end of the game just so you can use it in case you get stuck with a Q.   I can solve this problem:  I think, since Q can't be used in a word without being followed by a U, that the U should just be implied and not be included.  Thus, quest would be spelled qest, quality would be spelled qality, and Larroquette would be spelled Larroqette (go Night Court, no wait...Larroquette is a proper noun, can't use that one.  How about equestrian would be spelled eqestrian).  just read the above...no more bourbon or weblogging for me tonight
