I hope that we'll remain good friends, but I'm sure that we will never again have a boyfriend/girlfiend relationship. It makes me sad that I will never have that with her again, but I am upbeat and I have decided it was for the best. Now all I have to do is get out there and start meeting new people. I've decided that I need to get more involved with school and get mor involved with the undergraduate physics student association. I also think that I should join some other type of social club. We'll I'll give it some thought and post more about it later.
