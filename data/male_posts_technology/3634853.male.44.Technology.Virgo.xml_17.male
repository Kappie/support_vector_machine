I keep pretty concise logs in other ways of everything I'm doing and it gets a bit redundant to re-hash it every day.  Besides, for anyone looking at this thing, it would get pretty dry if I continueed, I think.  So, it looks like I'm going to go see Fahrenheit 9/11 this wekend with Dave.  I'm not really into Michael Moore, because I think that although he brings up some great points, he also distorts the facts terribly and the genreal public doesn't always see through the BS.  Then I have to come to work and listen to these people talk about what a great movie it is, because it shows how mislead we've all been and what a terrible job Bush and his cronies have done.  It took this movie to point this out?  Where the hell have you been?  I can't remember the last time I didn't vote Republican across the board, but I can truly say that won't be happening this November!  If I can see it , then those that are looking for issues shouldn't need Michael Moore to point it out for them.  I got a kick out of the news today about Saddam Hussein being brought into court.  Almost everything I read said something about it being a ploy by Bush to boost his ratings.  What about the people this man has kept in fear all of these years?  Any chance that may have something to do with it?  I did see one person come forth and say that they were looking forward to their chance to testify against him, ONE!  I'm really getting tired of living my life in fear.  Every day another person is shot down or run over or beaten to death, all becasue we no longer remember how to deal with adversity.  If something doesn't go our way, hell, we'll just make someone else hurt even more.  What kind of logic is that?  Then I keep getting these letters in the mail from the support people back in NY.  If the god damned governement spent as much time trying to break down the gangs and putting criminals away, as they do pestering me about whether or not my kids all have sufficient medical insurance, this country would be back on it's feet in no time.  Each and every one of my kids receive support, have medical insurance, and are as well taken care of as possible, yet I still have to go to my benefits people at work and resubmit tons of paperwork so that they can be sure.  What a bunch of bullshit!
