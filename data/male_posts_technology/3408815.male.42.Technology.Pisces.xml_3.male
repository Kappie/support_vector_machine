It seems like a waste of the little time you have everyday, but then I know that there is a part of me that wants to say something. A voice inside me, who wants to get something get off its chest. Time is a limited priceless gift we are given, but sometimes that gift is best spent on yourself so you can enjoy the rest of you time with others.  So that’s what I’m doing. I’m doing this for me. You will see rants and raves about being a husband, father, living in Texas, working, and just living.  Hope there is some soul out there who can at least be encouraged to write their own blog after reading this space in time I have reserved for me.
