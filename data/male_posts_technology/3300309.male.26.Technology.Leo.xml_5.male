I'm watching Big Brother and the rundown on the new housemates is, well, a bunch of nutters:  There's a lesbian, a sex-changer, a guy in a thong, someone pretending to look like Samuel L Jackson in the Barclay's advert, a posh girl amongst others.  Channel 4 have gone full stops to make these guys hate each other, they have limited beds (two members have to share a double), one of them will not be having their suitcase .  It's certainly more interesting than last year.  Though I loath most reality TV, BB does have an attraction this, simply because there's a chance they'll try and take each other out with blunt objects.  See you all later.
