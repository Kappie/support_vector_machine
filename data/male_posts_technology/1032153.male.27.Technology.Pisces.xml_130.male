I don't know why, but we better say bad America because they are always bad for some reason. And ohh why not bad Mr Bush too while we are at it. Tut tut tut. Israel; you need to learn to live in peace with your neighbour.  For those who would agree with that last sentence, check  urlLink this .  According to this Herald article:-  " Palestine lost her spiritual father," said Khaled Abdu, one Gazan among an endless stream of mourners. "We lost a great hero and an irreplaceable leader ".   So who was this man? Again the Herald says:-   Yassin joined the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamic movement dedicated to the spread of Islam, while a student in Egypt. In 1987, he became the spiritual leader of Hamas, the Brotherhood's Palestinian military wing, sworn to Israel's destruction.   In 1991, Yassin was sentenced to life in prison for the kidnapping and killing of two Israeli soldiers.    In the paper version of the Herald today, we read of Yassin:- that he said it would be " acceptable to establish a Palestinian state in the West Bankand Gaza, to be used as a temporary base to destroy Israel. "  This man is seen as a spiritual leader of Islam and of the Palestinians. Well there we have our problem. He is no hero at all. What hero can be leader of an organisation that incites people to encourage their children to be sacrifices in their bloody war against other innocent civilians who happen to live in Israel? This question brings another similar one to mind:- What parent would encourage their son or daughter to kill themselves and others, and be glad when it was done? When will Israel and Palestine be at peace? I suspect never unless Israel is wiped out.
