We have all gone through or will shortly go through the process of signing an agreement and obviously we would havfe read it and quite thoroughly too.     But there was one clause which actually put me off. The one about losing the job if convicted of a crime. This I think is utterly unfair.    I am not saying that all criminals should be allowed to retain their jobs but that this clause should be applicable on a case to case basis. What if I have killed somebody in self-defence or in defence of somebody else or I killed somebody by accident? I will still lose my job because I am convicted. There should be some respite to this. I have effectively done nothing wrong morally. Infact I have been on the side of justice all the time. But I will be shown injustice by getting fired.If I have committed the crime for my personal gain then yes, I deserve to be shown the door.    The companies talk of social responsibility and they do some good social work. But this too is a social responsibility. I am not saying that all companies should give even the pickpocketers, chain snatchers, thieves a chance which they should as society shoud give them a chance for rehabilitation (which is another topic altogether). But they should realize this folly and rectify it. But unfortunately this is not happening and unfortunately I too have accepted this clause. You can say that I have no right to talk on this as I am a part of it but this was just a thought on my part and I will definitely atleast talk about this to my HR.    Once again I thank you all for your patience and feel free to comment.
