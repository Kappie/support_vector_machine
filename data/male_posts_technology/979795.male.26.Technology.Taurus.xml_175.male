The water flowed towards my bag (which was on the floor) and kinda soaked it a bit. But it was wet enough to get my jeans and some shirts inside wet as well. I was extremely irritated when I left the YMCA.  Because Burgen is known for it's seafood market found along the waterfront in the early morning, we walked across to grab breakfast there. The guys were really willing to spend money on seafood. I went to a convenience store for a hotdog and a cold drink. I'll probably try the seafood for lunch instead.  Walked around aimlessly and it was really boring. What an ordeal it was just passing 2 hrs. Luckily we found a bookstore. The first branch we visited had very little English books but the guys were still able to hang around for quite awhile. I'm not a very great fan of literary works so most of the English books displayed simply didn't appeal to me. Across the street, there was a bigger branch, which was much better. I bought a book on Viking sayings. It's a bit pricey for it's thickness I guess it's but OK lah, bring a bit of Norway back with me lor. So far, I've yet to see anything about Burgen I really like. It's so similar to Birmingham that I feel that I should could've remained back in Brum to see the same things. It's almost 1200 now and I think we'll grab lunch in awhile. All we're doing now is just sitting in the square and listening to a brass band playing nearby. They are pretty entertaining though.   1740 hrs  Having a terrible day so far. We still haven't done much except sort'a whiling time away sitting here and there and not really doing anything. I think I'm kinda holding the guys back because I haven't got as much cash to play around and visit places and stuff. I also can't eat as much as I'd like. They probably find this cultural city with all its museums and all that more fascinating then I do. It wouldn't be a bad idea for them to go ahead without me but they probably didn't feel it was a good idea to just leave me while they went enjoying themselves. I'm grateful but I still don't like the idea of preventing them from enjoying themselves. Another part of me isn't exactly that enthusiastic about visiting museums and all those stuff either, but if I had the kind of spare cash I probably wouldn't mind it. Sigh, I'm not comfortable with incurring too much extra expenses and bad debts lah. Not to forget that I still owe them a meal in Copenhagen. Daniel has already treated us one. One thing though, after we returned to the YMCA, I did catch a really good nap. Hopefully that changed my mood a little. I'll go look for the guys in the lounge now, maybe we can do something after dinner ... I hope.   2100 hrs  Went up to the peak of Floibanen. Sort of Burgen's version of Singapore's Mt Faber and/or Bt Timah Hill I suppose. There are a few tracks here and we took a quick walk here and there. Daniel was finishing a book he just bought this afternoon so he tried to get another one in the evening, but to no avail. Most bookstores were closed already.  Tomorrow is another full day of travelling. We'll be taking a coach/train back to Oslo to catch a ferry/cruise to Copenhagen, Denmark. I'm really looking forward to leaving Burgen and going on to Denmark.
