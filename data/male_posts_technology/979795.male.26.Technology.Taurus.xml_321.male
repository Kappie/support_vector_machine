Woke up this morning with less of a fever but a bit of sorethroat. Seriously hope I feel up to grading later.   urlLink Ruth  seems like she's considering stopping blogging because she's worried about what some people might find out / read from the blog. I was kinda worried about this when I first started too. But I soon realised that it's simply a way of self expression. It helps me to self-reflect the mood captured when I'm blogging. Sometimes I'd realise I've been a pompous stick-in-the-mud and a real jackass, but I also learned that so long as I behave according to how I've blogged and vice versa, that my actions do not contradict my thoughts captured during my blog and vice versa, there's really no issue. Nobody can pop on by and influence me to 'shut down' my blog. Because if they are not able to accept what's been said, they can either email me or post their own comments. After blogging doesn't mean everything (my attitude and mindset is final), somewhere along the line I may still change my perception and my stand accordingly if I'm convinced that I should. Sometimes we need to place past events under the light and re-evaluate them again for the sake of self-reflection and growth lah I suppose.
