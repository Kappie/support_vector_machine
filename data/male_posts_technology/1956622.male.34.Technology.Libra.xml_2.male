Tara called while I was at Wal-mart and asked us if we wanted to come over and swim in her indoor pool at the apartment.   I bought a new floating swim suit for Karissa and a pair of trunks for me so we could go swimming.  She is really excited.    We met Tara and got in the pool.  Karissa had a great time she loves to swim glad to see she still does that.  I had her jumping off the edge and into the water with me.  I could not get her to do that before.    Afterwards we had dinner with Tara and Karissa fell asleep on Taraâ€™s Lap.  I took her home.  It is kind of early so I put her to bed and went out with a friend to a later dinner at Red Robin.  My mother called me while I was at the movie Theater with my friend Kristen and said Karissa was quite warm.  I told Kristen that we would have to catch up later and I had to go.  On the way home I bought some medicine for Karissa.  When I got home I gave her some of the medicine it was quite a chore.  That did not used to be a problem either.  Putting up such a fight over the medicine woke her up so we were up late watching movies.
