I've got classes starting again on the 7th and I'm desperately trying to find a new job before then. I've really come to loathe my job so I've decided to find something new. I've become very much addicted to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. This is a great game that sucks away hours of my time. Anyway I have to go to work pretty soon, so  urlLink here  is a quick link to an article about nanotubes.
