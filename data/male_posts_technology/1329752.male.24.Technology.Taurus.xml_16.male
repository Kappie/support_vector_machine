"sex is a gift from God. sex is beautiful if only will be use in a nice way."  well in my opinion, tao lang ako, sex can be sometimes a part of a lustful thread... pero using sex as tripping to destroy once integrity, honor and morale.. never it will stand a chance in my mind. ano kaya naiisip nitong mga  tanginang tao  natoh? they can hire a bitch naman for them to taped their p0rn, well if they don't find it exciting and they do taped p0rn, sana lang di na nila pinublicize and di na nila pinagkakitaan... i think the justice system should streghten its law regarding violation against privacy and morality. the people should also do their part... madaling hanapin ang sex. totoo yan. pero we also shouldn't forget na we could be a victim not only by this issue, but by sex itself...
