Was reading Guilian's last 3 posts on her OD and I gotta admit. Since lastnight I was in the same mood as her. Dunno why, just feeling damn bored and lifeless, slightly pekchek over nothing in particular. Blasting some music now. Most friends know that though I dun chiong, I enjoy a bit of noisy music like remixes and all that. Nothing completely techno or heavy metal type (can't stand those at all) ... Eargh!!   Aikido @ Siglap (Thurs night)   Something I was telling Gary on Thurs night after training at Siglap. Leon was his usual joker self during training. Was quite rude and not serious at all. Usually I didn't find that to be a problem. But that evening I felt a little indignant about things. Even Richard got more serious with the class in general. Made us sit down and gave us a lecture on etiquette and attitude. These days I found myself getting impatient with Leon also. And the effect of it is that I may tend to tell him too much what he's doing wrong and he's feeling so sianz that he pays even less attention to what he's doing. I might have to watch myself and converse less with him. He likes to ask and ask but never quite listens when he is being answered. Oh what the heck lah, I'm not his teacher anyway. Shouldn't even be teaching him anyway. Weird thing is I never face that much of a problem with the other 2 beginners. So I also dunno, is it Leon, me, or wat? What I remembered most distinct about training with Leon is that we were training halfway and he just walked over to another pair next to us to help 'demo' with one of the guys. I was like just standing there facing the wall where my partner was standing a few seconds ago. Damn rude. Richard saw it and that's when he told him to get back and not just walk off like that. Leon's attitude on and off the mat is the same, slacker attitude and not really putting much serious effort in anything. Can tell even when he is laying the mats. When he lays just 1 pc of mat, he literally sits down and starts fitting in the jigsaw mat. We always lay our mats in a ready position because it only lasts like 15-20 seconds, so there has never been a need to sit down. Sitting down and getting up again waste more energy and nobody I know does that. Only Leon. You can tell he is maintaining that 'after I sit down I don't want to get up again' mindset. Same thing when he does his Aikido. After being pinned to the ground, he stays there so long before picking himself up. Bad thing is 1 new brown belt girl (prob from kids class too) is kinda taking for granted that mat laying is a guy's responsibility. I don't see her helping at all though she gets to class a bit early. As a junior I don't think I should say anything to her directly, but last Thurs was seriously tempted. Why? Because I really don't want new blood to come into the dojo, see a senior not doing anything, and just follow suit. Being in a Pri sch now, I realise a lot of thing depends on a good foundation. We are literally cultivating the next generation of people (whether in school, society or in our dojo) and if they do not learn things the right way at the very start, it will be difficult to change them later on. But at the same time I'm also worried of the effect that may arise, what if for eg, this brown belter gets sian of being told to lay mats each time, may feel like I'm picking on her, then just keep arriving late to siam the mats? Also got a negative effect. There's no 100% method I guess. Dunnoz, may just speak up coming week when I see Leon and her again. Leon for one needs the extra work. He's been an orange belt for 3 yrs and I think it only shows one thing, that he has been stagnant for the past 3 yrs coz his mind is not moving forward. I've heard of pple avoiding taking the grading tests but never of the case that Sensei keeps one at his current belt level, probably because of his wrong mentality and attitude.   Friends   Friday came. Was really looking for ward to meeting some friends from Uni that evening. Was great seeing some familiar faces again like Begh, Lynette, Darren. Dinner itself was nothing special, just KFC. A bit quiet though we did talk quite a bit of crap. Usual lah, with Darren and me around, you can't quite expect too much serious talk. After that we went for coffee at Raffles Link. Nice place, but too bad it seemed a wee bit more enclosed. I still prefer Spinelli at Heeren but these days I figured it's just way too hot to sit anywhere without aircon. After that we left about 10-ish. Got home and I SMSed everyone that it was nice to meet up after so long. Got some SMSs back. But this Begh ar, said "Since when did I get so sentimental." Kinda got me thinking. I must be mellowing with old age. Harhar...  Just brought to mind how much I haven't kept in contact with my friends. It was only recently that I sent a short email out to my Poly classmates and updated what I knew of each other. Was glad that I got some mail back from everyone as well. Think I've kinda become the unofficial database administrator already. Probably arrange some meet up after James's wedding dinner. Despite these people, I've also failed to update groups from NS, people I knew from Aikido in UK, Birmingham Uni (there's a bigger group besides those I met up on Fri), my English housemates from 1st year Uni, and some really close friends from here and there. Funny how convenient you just let these friends slip out of view as time passes. With some lucky ones, you'll still be the same no matter how infrequent you meet up with each other. But with many, you'll just loose touch quickly.   Work   At work also some very small matters going on here and there. Overall I'm glad teachers aren't completely shunning elearning out despite their already busy schedule. But I think I need to do more as well. Gotta start prioritising my work. On the whole, I get quite a chunk of quizzes from teachers to convert into elearning during the past 1 wk plus. A bit overloaded all of a sudden. But they seem to be clearing up. Had to turn back 2 quizzes from teachers until my load is relieved a bit. I won't say it's unbreathable lah, but just that it seems like everyone is fighting fire at the last minute so deadlines are all packed in a bit close that's all. A bit too much all of a sudden that's all. Daphne was feeling down yesterday also. Shan't say too much except that it's all work related. I dunnoz, I dun feel that kinda pressure she does. In fact, any pressure I feel is mostly temporary and I never let them get to me for long. Maybe coz I'm more bochup lah, but it's only coz I know that if I dwell too much on the 'here and now' I'll just get stuck and stop moving on.  Plus the fact that the kids are constantly making fun when they see the both of us together. Dunnoz, again I'm not so bothered coz they seem to direct this more at her than me. I don't normally get affected by these but Daph sure seems to be. Seriously lor, maybe I need to step in to make them learn a bit of respect. Dun wanna use army style on them lah but last Fri itself I just did (again). 1 group of students came in to use the lab PCs and Daphne asked one of them (anyone of them) to go check on whether another lab is empty so that she can bring them over there for the lesson. Immediately one by one they just went "Chop! Cannot call me!" then another went "Chop!" followed by another and another. Most friends will know lah, I cannot stand that kind of attitude one so my response to that was "AR! You chop somemore! Chop somemore lah, I make sure ALL of you go to the lab and come back here together instead of just one of you!" They still proceeded to ignore my statement and went on "Chop! Chop! Chop!" So I said, "OK I count to 10. 1 of you better go or else it's all of you. 1, 2, 3, 4 ..." And one kid (group leader apparently) decided to go. Really man, army style. Haiz ...   Home   Getting exceeding irritated with small little things at home though I try very hard not to be. For one thing, my parents get really cynical at times. Eg if they see something on the news, they say things like "Ya they so stupid" or "These people deserve it." Basically really machiam Luo4 Jing3 Xia4 Shi2 type of comments. These days rather than comment too much I just step aay and go back to my room. Think it's all I can do, by removing myself out of the equation, nothing will happen. Another thing is my sis. She is so ji4 jiao4 when it comes to some small things. For instance, just eg. I was the last to come back home for dinner. She was in the midst of finishing her last remnants of food when I placed a plate in the sink (for washing). While I was finishing my soup, she washer her own bowl and can't even help to wash a bit of the stuff in the sink. Seriously I dare say I never consciously leave thigns in the sink for her to wash. If I do, it's only because I've already washed the first batch of stuff with soap and the soap on the sponge has gotten too diluted for another batch. I figured since she'll be washing after me, she can clear the next batch. Even so, I try to maximise the soap by leaving her very little washing. She's really taking things for granted liao. Even though things are right in front of her she can siam it like it doesn't exist. Really, if you want me to be frank, I have to say that there's a very good reason why she is still single. She'll be a horrible wife and I would pay my deepest respect to the man out there who can change her someday. OK, make no mistake. I'm not perfect either, but I think I'm not as particular about these things like she does. In fact my whole household seems to be that way. My parents also get this idea I'm very particular about small things and keep asking me before they do this or that to the extent it's irritating. I can only say that it's because they themselves are very particular people so they assume their son to be the same. I'm really really irritated at the way things are.   People in General   My conversation during lunch at BK with Daphne still rings clearly in my mind. People in Singapore gets damn haolian sometimes. Arrogance is what I call it. Just walking out of the fastfood they can not even bother to close the door again and let the aircon out like that. Geez. I'm really worried about the next generation of people when the current ones show these kind of examples. What type of people are we trying to cultivate. Being in school everyday I sometimes look up to what teachers are doing. MOE's slogan "Moulding the Future" holds true. But how many of them really believe in that when they took up NIE's offer/contract? Most just do it because of the economic downturn to get a job. What's the point in that? And S'pore govt itself is still way too result/academic oriented to get down and dirty during the filtration process to filter out un-committed people. Same thing I'm feeling for the SPF. I'm aware that uniform services sees a huge group of people leaving each year, but they only have themselves to blame for taking in the uncommitted people in the first place. Geez... really, we can see how a person or people in general are from the little things they do. Do you condemn someone just because of a sudden outburst? Natural for humans to be biased based on a first impression. But open outburst like that are not accurate. The best way to judge a person I think is if you take note of their behavior during the other times. When a person gets angry, it's because something happened and clouded their usual emotions instead. (Of course, those who have frequent outbursts ALL the time, definitely have a problem there lah.) We gotta remember not to let their emotions cloud us the same way it does to them. It only takes a celebrity 1 misbehaviour in public outside to destroy his/her reputation. But I think that can be so unfair to them. They are human afterall.   Movies   Really felt so bored lastnight I'm considering catching a show alone if I have to. Never tried that before. Anyway I was flipping the papers and came across some shows on my list. Zatoichi (some samurai film on a blind swordsman), Hellboy and Starsky  Hutch (comedy), just to name a few." Will see how lah...   Aikido @ ARCC   Was   late for training yesterday. Took 197 all the way from Parkway to Jurong interchange. Really roundabout journey. Took me 2 hrs to get there. I was late of course. And I didn't get anything right. We did static exercises/techniques for a long while but the moment I tried out non-static ones, all the basics went out the window - from moving hips first to simple arm and foot movements. Was quite disappointed with my practice yesterday. Only thing I really took with me, was the fact that I will never take 197 to Jurong East from Parkway anymore. But Frankie Sensei has a very good way of breaking down the exercises and techniques. I've decided to start doing their exercises more regularly at home every few days to familarise myself with the basics and fundamentals. Even just how to hold the bokken is like so difficult for me to grasp. Everytime there's the statement "extend ki" I'd just go "...." Heh ... I'm only glad I'm wearing my white belt during training instead of blue.  Beginner's mind, beginner's mind, beginner's mind, beginner's mind, beginner's mind ....................   Weather   Weather has been soooooo daaaaaaamn HOT! I have trouble sleeping everynight. I'm perspiring like a pig at home every night. Luckily I just bought 2 cans of prickly heat powder. These days I put some before going to work. When I get home I powder myself with so much powder after my bath, that it gets ultra cold for a good 5 mins or so. But at least it helps prevent me from feeling all sitcky and yucky at home. MMmmmm .... prickly heat powder. Again, another army must have item.
