So here is my answers to the questions that Liane sent me.....  1) How would you finish this phrase "I have never been so embarassed as the time when......."?  'I got a 12" splinter in my ass!'   2) If you could have any job in the world what would it be?  'Heavy metal journalist'   3) What do you like best about each guy on toaster files?   'NOTHING...I fucking hate them all!!!'  4) If you could have anyone as your lover who would it be?  'If I could find a girl that actually made me feel comfortable and loved, it wouldn't matter who she was...I am looking!'   5) What is your absolute favorite meal of all time?  'My mum's Sunday roast, although I haven't had one for about three years!'   Ok that's it from me, post again when I have unpacked etc etc. Baity signing off......
