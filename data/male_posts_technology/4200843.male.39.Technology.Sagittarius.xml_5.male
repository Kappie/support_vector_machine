I did go to ATS and find out that my car probably needs new exhaust manifold. I think that part also has the catalytic converter on it as well. Now you know when parts for you cars have many syllables, the price goes way up for them.  Watched Identity tonight. Can't work out if I liked it or not really. I guess it was OK, but could do better. I'm sure there are people that will think it's a masterpiece, but it's not.
