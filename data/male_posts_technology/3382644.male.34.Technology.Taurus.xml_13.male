Too bad I couldn't do that for big money.  It won me some sponsorship points though.  That was cool.  It was a good played tournament.  I made my fair share of mistakes but I got some really lucky flops tonight.  Looks like my game is starting to show improvement.  I think the wilson software was a good investment.  Good night all.
