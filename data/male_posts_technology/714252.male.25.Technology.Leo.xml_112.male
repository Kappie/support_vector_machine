Yesterday was interesting, I spent most of the day working on Ideas for a database engine for the "Salsa Electronic Magazine" ( urlLink http://www.irishsalsa.ie/ ) and helping the lovely Alison with some ASP code stuff.. Then last night bubbs came over and we watched (drooool) Geri on last weeks Boston Public (I still had it on video.. FOR JONNY of course..)  Then Helena got out of her Dinner thingy (not after trying to tell me that I hadn't given her a rescue call on time when I had.. Thank God vodafone put time stamps on the answering machine messages..) and I went over to her place..  I have to say. Staying at Helenas has its good side and its bad side.. (Leave it!!!) On the good side I get up early and get to work early.. On the Bad side I have to get up early..  I AM EXHAUSTED today.  Anywho.. I managed to post a reasonably decent sized blog with no mention of the, eeek I almost said it ;)
