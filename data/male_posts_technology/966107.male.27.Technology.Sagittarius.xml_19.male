Not that this was a little known distribution. I recall reading about it sometime back in 2002 but at that time, I was more interested in getting my feet wet in this industry  fascinated by Red Hat Linux (I still am...).  What made UnitedLinux different was that it was a collaborative effort from four of the big software vendors - SUSE Linux AG, the former Caldera International Inc. (now known as The SCO Group Inc.), Turbolinux Inc. and Conectiva SA. It seemed like a sure winner having such a developer base  funding behind it.  But things changed dramatically and very fast. SCO is more interested in suing people to make money rather than developing  selling software, SUSE has been bought over by Novell Inc.  Turbolinux underwent a ownership change  then moved out of US market space.  Despite this Unitedlinux still is being sold  supported all the partners except SCO. But the Unitedlinux website has not been updated since April 2003. In the what's new section of its website, the last posting is of 22nd April 2003. Hardly a new posting...  So what happens to Unitedlinux in the future? Not that the whole world will come to grinding halt if Unitedlinux goes down under, but I fear that it would be sad ending to a very good project which had a lot of promise to deliver to end-users and developers in terms of a solid non-Microsoft operating system which was cheap and at the same time well supported  also it does not usher a good news for similar Linux initiatives.
