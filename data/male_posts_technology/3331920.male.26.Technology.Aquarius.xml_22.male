I'm going to assume that Mel and I will be sharing the modelling duties but we'll of course be playing that by ear, since there's still ASP to work on, JOY!  Went for a great walk tonight since it's so nice out. Tried Cous Cous for supper tonight too.  It's pretty damn good. Trying to get a hold of my folks on the phone, but it's busy for the last half hour, so i'm heading to bed. My mom's a bigtime chatter when you get her going on the phone.  I'm out.
