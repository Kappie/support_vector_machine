I was unable to access the internet, so I didn't get to upload it until the time the actual blog posted for me. :)  I suppose, lately, or maybe all my life, I've been trying to find myself, and help myself, which I seem to have been unable to do, even though I seem to be able to effortlessly solve other's problems, or help them. I confuse even myself sometimes. I wonder why I look at things the way I do, why I know things are going to happen, what fate has to do with my life, and what it affects, what it's going to hand me next. Its frustrating, too. I've tried and tried to do things, but, they just seem to all melt down into the same failure. I don't even know exactly what it is that I'm doing wrong, or what's causing it. I've been told that there is sonmething that I need to change that I haven't, and they (the person) won't tell me what it is. I don't know where to start. There is no beginning. I suppose it stems from my childhood. I had and have... sort of, two loving parents. My Dad has always been there for me. He's always been the responsible one, and he's always been my favorite of the two. They (my parents) divorced for the first time (of two times) when I was four, and Dad moved away to Laconia. He came to see me all the time, but when he wasn't there it felt like he never was. My Mom was always crying at this table we had in the kitchen. There was always a box of Golden Graham cereal on the table, and a phone, and a phone book, and she's just put her elbows up there, near the window, and cry every night. I was four, and this tore me apart. Every night, after having my Golden Grahams for dinner, I comforted my mother before going to bed early. I'd get into my bed, which was a crib with the sides taken off, and I'd pull out the pictures I had of my Dad under my pillow. One was just him, and one was he and I. There was smiling in all of them. I'd stare at those two pictures, endlessly looking them over, and I'd cry myself to sleep. I had nightmares all the time those days, too. The same one every time. I had this closet in my room, that I shared with my Mother, and it was always very dark in there, light could never get in, even if the door was open. All these red skeletons would come out and the "leader" would pick me up, and kiss me. Then I'd wake up. My parents got together, and I'd say that time poeriod was the best of my life. When they got back together I was five, and when I turned six my Mom was pregnant with my sister. We moved back to Concord to the house I'm in now. After Sam was born and old enough to live somewhat on her own, with care from Dad and no waking up in the night and crying, Mom was never home. She was always out, blowing all her money on god-knows-what, partying, hanging out with friends, etc. Dad and I would always sit at home, waiting for her to get back, which as rarely before I went to bed. We'd have "hang out nights" and watch movies and talk, make food, and that was truly the time we got to bond the most. Basically, after they divorced for the second time, when I was 12, Mom started doing drugs, quite a bit. It got bad over the years, and she lost her job, and all her severance pay went not to bills, but to cocaine and ecstasy. These days, I'm lucky if I see her two days a month. My sister is heartbroken. She's 9, and she needs a mother. My Mom is never on time to get us, which shows she doesn't really care that much. We're disposable, I guess. Sucks, huh? The only thing I've ever really had trouble with is my Dad expecting a lot of me and girls. I don't know why, but things with women just haven't worked out, until somewhat lately. Even then, my past experiences with being hurt, again and again, have broken me. I barely trust anything anymore. I never have as much trust and belief as I should. I have hope, always, but I never have the faith that I should. I'm always worrying. When it comes to a lot being expected of me, it not only boils down to myself being exposed to a lot at such a young age (my Mom with drugs, and the fact that she was a lesbian (this I found out when I was 13)), a lot is still expected of me sometimes. My Dad sometimes... well.. often has no patience with anything. He asks me to get good grades, when I don't, and then I finally do, and everything's better. Then that's expected of me, and it's not good enough anymore. I haven't ever really been able to truly be a kid, and just run amok like kids should. I understand safety, but how safe can you be. Is it protecting your child when you run through a list of reasons in your head that you could tell them so they can't go somewhere? That's frustrating. My dad has never taken me out driving, and I'm in driver's ed. How's that? I bet I won't get to drive his car, either, even though we have three at the house. It's things like this that frustrate me. Also, sometimes my wireless router at the house will fuck up, and he won't be able to get online (and I won't either). When this happens, he not only flips out at me, but he has no patience. He expects me to be able to snap my fingers, shake my ass, and have the router snap back to life and online again. I work as hard and as fast as I can to fix it, but christ, what does he expect? I'm still 16. I just have never felt as free as I should be. Any freedom I do have is restricted. Computer: restricted. If I go over someone's house a lot, and I want to go, it's "you just went there yesterday, or last week". Whether these instances are far apart or close together, they build up on me. I find myself being mad for no reason. Just angry, and I am in a fighting mood. And I lock all that in. I'm in a situation right now, with someone that knows who they are... :) And she is... very special to me. I've never been able to connect with someone like I have with her, before. I'm left in aweevery day, and I don't even know how I could've ended up having a chance with someone like her. It seems too good to be true, and that's why the paranoia kicks in. I've never, and I really want to emphasize the  N E V E R , liked someone, and had them like me just that much back. I've never met someone emotionally capable of meeting me on that level, or someone that even cared that much for me. It was (and may still be) me always writing the notes, saying I Love You, wanting to spend time with the person, and... That hurts. To know, for once, that someone actually wants to BE with ME, that they love me BACK, that they want ME, is a completely different feeling, and it's something I've never truly had. I just, sometimes, feel like people don't really care about me or what happens to me. With this someone of mine, though, I understand she's worried just as much as I am. I just hope she knows I'm not fucking with her head. I would never, not with her situation, or with anyone else. I just wish things would work our for me, for once. And I hope I can realize what's going on, and what I need to be truly happy. Hopefully I'll find it. Or maybe fate will bring it (or has brought it) to me. Patience is a virtue.  And to my love: You can take me on your roller coaster, and whisper me your secrets. I still won't let go. Even if you try to shake me off. :) I Love You.  Je t'adore, mon petit chou. (Did I get that right?)  ::sigh:: okay, that was a lot to write. Time to log OUT!
