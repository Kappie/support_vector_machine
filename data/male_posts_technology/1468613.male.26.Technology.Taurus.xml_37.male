Both teams had finished the season with  exactly  the same points and so both teams had to beat their opponents with a greater goal difference in order to win. In fact, the whole points and goal difference thing was so complicated that even at the end of the Rangers match, we weren't quite sure who'd won the cup.  Didn't quite go to the pub at 11 to watch the match at 3... that would have made my night a seriously short night. We ended up meeting up at about 1:30 which wasn't so bad. Mind you though, Julie and Tracy (the two that invited me along to watch the match) were drinking me under the table very easily. I couldn't keep up with the rounds and had to skip a couple.  We didn't stay much longer after the end of the match at the sports bar.. it was starting to thin out a bit so we headed up to another bar/restaraunt to have dinner. That was the last place we stopped off as the night was seriously starting to get long... well we had started at 1:30. Only stayed till about 9:30 when the eyelids were starting to get a bit heavy I was having more and more trouble understanding the Glaswegians... either my hearing was getting slower or their talking was getting faster!  I thought it best to stumble home and at least work off some drinks. Of course, after an afternoon of drinks, one gets the hankering for fatty, salty food. So I thought I'd try chips'n'cheese. Well, it didn't quite work out the way I wanted it to. I think the chips were a little cold and the cheese didn't melt. So I got home and tryied to zap it in the microwave but that didn't quite work too well either!  well best be back to work  cya! -gede
