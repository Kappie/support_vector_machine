Jamaica is a real interesting country, struggleing to address it's social problems with a ineffective Govt.  Murders are a daily occurance mainly due to the drug trade.  In talking to the locals many feel that Jamaican society traditionaly revolved around the Mother as being the Leader of the family and traditional values were in stilled in the children.  With young women gettting hooked on drugs, and embracing a lifestyle that deemphasizes family, the role of the strong mother is dissapearing, leading to the breakdown of their culture.  Very Sad to see such poverty and violence in such a beautiful and abundant land. urlLink
