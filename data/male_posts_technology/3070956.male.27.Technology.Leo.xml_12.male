I'm traveling and I'm at Starbucks so I can use the Internet to work since my hotel room wants to charge 60 cents/min for local calls - uugh. They keep playing "Big Time" by Peter Gabriel, but I don't mind since I feel like it's almost a theme song for me, hehe.  I just wish they would let one of the songs finish playing - grrr.  So annoying.  I quit my full-time job (where I was well paid) last year to make practically nothing for the past year and a half and it looks like it's finally starting to pay off.  I have a  number of very cool and talented people working for me to build my first software product.  We hope to have a fully functional version done by the end of the summer. Prospective customers are excited about the possibilities and so are we.
