They couldn't find her to ask her, so they told me to tell mom where they were if I saw her, which I did when she asked several minutes after they left. When I told her she went to the front door and started yelling my sister's name out it really loudly. Annoyed, she came back inside (they were out of earshot) and when they got home no more than ten mintues later, she pulled my sister downstairs to talk to her,  and when they got done talking, my mom left to a recital (or something) and dragged Nicky along with her to it. I have no idea what that was about... not sure how she has the right to punish SOMEONE ELSE'S CHILD... But hey, I wouldn't be one to understand my mom. (LOL)   Mi madre es loco.
