Got Project Romans starting...haven saw that schedule although i've got it...been planning my budget..for cell SImply United...work and yeah preparing for the College Camp commitee work. Even that talking back about cell with Dan, Siew CHing and Lindy have been great to see what God is gonna do in SImply United and I believe this year is gonna be fun and able to cope it more effectively and efficient. Indeed God have provided us with quality people who are passionate and transparent to Simply United. Yes many of them will be going away , but with them carried the presence of God, God 's promises and plans with them. Hope as they even go there...that God 's glory and name be magnified in them.  Indeed God have commissioned and prepared them in advance in SIBKL or in SImply United. It is so great to see lives being impacted..for God...and they are gonna impact and empower people in Aussie.  Today set some directions, mobilize some ppl and even set goals and visions statement for the cell which i think , we can do it since we are more experienced in doing this...Lot of ideas have thrown around on how to invite more people to cell..I have set the focus unto international people.  God have made this cell to be unique all the time...last year it have been a year where Simply United have interChurch cell members and i believe this year will be an international cell members in Simply united.  Plans for Simply United have been planned out and well SImply United Cell members, be excited to serve the Living God as you have been empowered since last year..and this year...carry that spirit of E03 to cell cause we are gonna have a blast just reaching out to the community and impact the people....Giving and giving ...not until it hurts...but to continue giving even though it hurts..because God is a healer and He will be there to guide us and follow us thru. There will be outings, workshops and for the cell members , to cause u guys to rise up and be sheperds of many sheeps.
