Reason I don't wanna go home is because i'll end up spending madd money in a short amount of time, I just know it. I know me  I know my family. Second reason is because people will ask me  questions...   DON'T ASK ME ABOUT JACK!! YEA, I'M HERE, AND I'M STILL ON ORDERS TO GET SENT SOMEPLACE!!! AAAAAAAAUGH!! WHO GIVES A RATS ANUS ABOUT THE YOUTH CHOIR??? IT WASN'T MY BABY FROM THE START AND I'M DARN SURE NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS DOWNFALL SINCE I'VE BEEN AWAY!!! aaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGH!!!  Yea we've also received some interesting news in relation to where we may be going (quite rumor talk) but at least this rumor is stateside. Some are saying that we may be spending our days @ Camp Shelby in Mississippi....doing what exactly is beyond me. Well i'm out now. I was expecting this big email from Nik but I guess something came up. It was kinda deflating, cause I was prepared to dig thru the emotional well again  see how she further feels about the relationship. Ah well. Speaking of which, she called me last nite...which isn't unusual...but it is @ 1:15 in the morning. I thought something was wrong but apparently she was just missing me. Awwwwwwwww poor thing... Well...more to say...as I do many times, but i'm headed back to the barracks to watch Mace Windu kick some sith butt again lol. I downloaded some Clone Wars cartoons and from what I can tell, the second season is far better than the first. Sweet! I'm...wait...I sound awful white when I say 'sweet'...aight, screw that. To speak blackly, i'm a Star Wars fan again. Got inspiration to continue my ultimate Jedi storyline again. Its gonna be a party in my brain and NOBODY'S INVITED UNTIL ITS FINISHED! HAA!!!  *Editors note* As one can clearly tell from this exegesis of this entry, the author was very excited. Please take all of his mistakes for love. If you choose not to do so then u can...(insert expletive here lol)
