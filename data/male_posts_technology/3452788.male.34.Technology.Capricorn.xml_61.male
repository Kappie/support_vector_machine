Anyway, I had therapy today, and I was not in a talkative mood.  Essentially it comes down to the idea that I can never please myself.  No matter what I do, it is never good enough, I can never win, I can never be satisfied, everyone else will realize I am a fraud and a sham, that I should be fired from my job (current job or any other), that I don't earn my pay, that I am a bad parent, a bad husband, etc.  If I am not trying my best, I have failed.  If I slack off or make excuses or don't pull off a miracle like I sometimes do, I have failed.  Imperfection is all around, but I am the most imperfect of all, because I was given so much potential and have wasted it.   There this dark place inside me that is a dying little child crying to get out.  If he does not, the darkness will destroy me and everyone I love.  Every time I try to listen to this little child inside, he is smacked down by the Critic or the Worrier.  The Child can only sneak out during dreams or subconscious states, or sometimes when I have escaped my life.  The Child is awed by the beauty of the natural world: forests, mountains, streams, animals, flowers, granite, soil, oceans, wetlands.  Every day the Child is pushed down, he dies a little bit.  He has been surviving for almost 30 years, but there is very little energy left.  The Child, in order to live, needs me to run away from everything I have and give it freedom to explore and grow and live.    But I don't know how I can do this.  My family needs me, I need to be a provider, I need to work to survive in this world.  I can't just run away from it all.  That is what little kids do, right Annebrev?  Vacation doesn't help, it is only a momentary escape before diving back into the reality of working and eating and sleeping and avoiding meaningful conversations and struggling with parenting.  This process has brought me from miserable ignorance to seeing the edge of the barrier, whatever it is that keeps me from being whole.  The gulf between is huge, awesome, horrifying, impossible.  How can I ever cross?  I am so flat inside.  I might feel happy or soothed for a few minutes, but nothing replaces the overwhelming weight of this depression.  It is a cold, grey, damp blanket that smothers every spark of creativity or desire or motivation or happiness.  It is a force stronger than gravity, always present, always pulling downward, stronger than dreams or prayers.  I don't care about anything.  I don't care about ever being happy, about work, about home, about people, about succeeding, about dreams, desires, anything.  This life is my purgatory.  The Child cannot survive this asphyxiation much longer - he must escape or die.  If the Child dies, every shred of emotion and humanity and pleasure will die with him.  Then what will be left of me?  What will be there to fill the hole I leave behind?  Bitterness, anger, tears, sadness, unfulfilled promises, stolen years, missed milestones, photos, everything that makes a life.  The only thing that can save me is to run.  Can I expect Anne and the kids to let me run, then come back when I am ready?  Will they run with me, or will they care?  I don't want to be alone, but if I have to, so be it.  It does not matter.
