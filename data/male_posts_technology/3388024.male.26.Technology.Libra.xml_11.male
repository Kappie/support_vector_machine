I can honestly say that anyone with a negative impression of teenagers today is hanging around with the wrong ones. I was personally blown away by they kids and how hard they worked.  Their were over 400 kids at this particular camp. They divide all the kids and adults into teams of 6. My team was pretty darn good. We had three girls, the oldest being 14, and 2 boys, the oldest being 17. None of the girls would have weighed 100 lbs soaking wet, so the hammering was left to the guys. The house we worked on was owned by Veria and Arthur Jackson. Originally we were assigned to paint the house and put up new gutters. But, we also decided to replace the facet and soffet on the back of the house and extend the roof tin a bit. All in all we got the work done with a few hours to spare on Friday.  Really, the work is not supposed to be the primary concern. The spiritual growth of the kids and the residents is the most important. As it turns out Arthur is the senior decan at his church, so he definitely mentored more to use than the other way around. I personally got a lot from the experience. Meeting them and seeing how other people live and how you can be happy even when you don’t have much meant a lot to me.  So all and all a good time. The 40+ hours spent driving the 15 passenger van could have been shorter, but I think it would take an act of congress or god to move Louisiana closer to New Mexico. Thankfully people don’t seem to get too mad when you cut them off in a car with a big cross on the side, go figure.  We did stop in Six Flags in Dallas, and that was a good time. My stomach wasn’t up for a lot of rollercoaster action, but it was fun just being there with all the kids.
