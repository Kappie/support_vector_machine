Usually wireframes are rendered in some kind of drawing program, like Visio or Illustrator, but can also appear as bitmaps or even HTML. In his latest installment, Dan Brown, shows how the wireframe can transcend layout and work for all team members."

 If you ever watch the "special features" of any DVD lately, you'll notice at the beginning of the movie making process the director has  animatics  made of all the scenes within the film. These are analogous to  wireframes  within the web design process. They are both just simple, basic, and rough layouts of the final product to be used as a first step in production. More importantly they are an inexpensive tool used for discussion purposes for all members of the team as well as clients. This step in both the movie making and web design process saves time and money, and allows the designer/director to adjust the big picture before moving onto the next stage where large-scale changes become much more costly.
