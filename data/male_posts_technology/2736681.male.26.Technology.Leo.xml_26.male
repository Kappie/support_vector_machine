He's pretty chuffed with it - it reminds him of deadlines, plays mp3s, and he can view his blogs on it and synchronise their status with his PC. However, it should be noted that the P in PDA does not stand for portable - it basically lives on his desk during the work-day. As a matter of fact, its there now and has been notifying him of something or other for the last half hour, as it did yesterday. So much for portable devices...
