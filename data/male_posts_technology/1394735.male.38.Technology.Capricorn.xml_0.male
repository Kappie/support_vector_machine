They are penned up in the dark electronic cage of a server called helen in Charlotte, Michigan.  Dan said he was going to try to get a new connection, but it will probably be something slower than the one we previously had.  So, here I am.  Relegated to emptying my mind and thoughts on a free blog site.  This is so humiliating.  It's like a guy who has worked as a high-tech consultant for years and then the gig ends and he has to work bussing dishes at TGIFridays.  That's all for now.  I've got tables to clear.
