It's not as far off as you might think.  Answer at the bottom.   The first time after reconstruction that Virginia voted for a Republican was 1928 (Herbert Hoover).  It also the first time that a majority of the Confederate states did not vote Democratic.  60 years after the Civil War, they were still holding a grudge against the Republican party for ending slavery.  1964 - LBJ.
