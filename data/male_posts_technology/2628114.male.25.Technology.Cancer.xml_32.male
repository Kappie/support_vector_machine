That's right my faithful readers, I have conceded that I got a horrible case of shin splints and not some muscle pull.  Of course this concession came after quite a few people telling me I had shin splints and me finally listening.  It's not all bad though.  I still have the ability to cross train which I was able to do on Wednesday night.  I did relatively hard workout which included 4 sets of 52s on the elliptical and 15 minutes on the rowing machine.  I got to remember how difficult the elliptical really could be and burn up my quads again without inflaming my shin splints any more.  Not too much else to report for now.
