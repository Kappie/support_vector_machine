I was beginning to be able to just listen to how she sounded and then I would shift when I lost her.  I could actually feel the power start to decrease as I reached redline so I knew I needed to shift.  I really don't know what the hell I was going for here but whatever.  I have my car back.  Hell Yeah.  It's finally sinking in, I have her.
