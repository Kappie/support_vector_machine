Most people here see me as someone who can get a little nuts sometimes, so the element of fear keeps many people from pushing me too hard - this can be a good thing.   I have not been terribly social the last few days, but I'm not putting myself in a depressive spiral either. Overall, I have been in a decent mood the last week, not super, not "happy", but not too shabby.  I have been on the Effexor for a week now, and I move from 37mg to 75mg tomorrow. The only significant side effects so far are nausea, and intestinal "issues", and (to put it at discreetly as possible) mild sexual side effects, i.e. occasional difficulty maintaining or finishing. (This is not a big issue for me, we both understand it and accept it, so it does not become a problem.) The same side effects happened with Celexa also, from the lowest (10 mg) to highest dose (40 mg).  Hey, you clicked here, don't blame me.  It's all about sharing too much information.
