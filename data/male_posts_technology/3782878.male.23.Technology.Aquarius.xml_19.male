Now I figure it's time to give you the run down on who I am to give you a frame of reference for future posts.  I'm a 21 year old ex-Air Force Computer Programmer turned Internet Helpdesk. I have a fiance SammyCaine, and a kid very close to hitting the 2yr old mark. I was a goth in my teenage years, and still have that angsty goodness in my soul, just doesn't come around as much. Been using a computer since I was 4, been playing role playing games since I was 18 in the Air Force.  hopefully that helps a little bit in understanding what makes me who I am. This was supposed to be yesterdays little opening blurb, but it didn't happen. Why? because the best of plans will certainly fail. I actually didn't give myself enough time while at work to publish this. So we're gonna do a dual day post :)   Someone might ask, why didn't I finish this post last night after work? because my computer dumped on me. OS had been about:blank hijacked, and so I did a lot of headscratching all week, tried to run a few simple commands that reset the OS back to stabilityville, and hopefully nuke that lil trojan out of my computer. But instead, it took out the whole system. Typical. so last night I spent reloading all my critical stuff(Windows, Windows Updates, Motherboard drivers and utilities, all other system drivers, Anti-Virus, and Office) then making sure I could still access Everquest.  Forgot to mention that I play everquest, I know. Some of you will probably shun me for that, I don't care, it's more complex than just picking up a box at the store and playing it. But I'll leave that to a seperate post. Wanna try to keep on track of this post, which is about what happened yesterday(since it's extremely tough to write about today today, I mean, how much is there to say about a day just started?  So last night, SammyCaine was sick, so she didn't get to partake in the action last night, she was watching TV snuggled in blankets. Very cute, while I was right behind her, playing my Dwarf Paladin trying to hit level 40. This was optimal since I could tend to her needs, and get my fix. About 3 hours of play later, I hit 40 with my paladin, I was very happy since I have a weapon that does something special at 40, it heals my character 7% whenever the effect triggers.  After that, and not realizing it was 3am, I decided to play my necromancer to get his level 8. did that as well. Logged off and went to bed around 4am. This is the life of an EQ junkie.  This morning, woke up to kicks from the fiance to get up, at 8am :( needless to say I'm not the most chipper person in morning hours, especially after doing a all night burn on EQ. So I growled and moaned about sleep, got up, changed the kid. brought him into our room while I tried to feign comatose on the bed, that didn't work either. Sick people have this kind of special pitch of whine that prohibits doing anything other than assisting them in their endeavor. So out of bed I go, grumbling all the way at 9:00am, to get myself and the kid some breakfast(Kix for him yech, and Cracklin Oat Bran for me!) read some webcomics, and sleepdrove to Sammycaine's father's house, to deliver the kiddo to them.   Now I have my peace, my alone time, I'm kind of a car guy, I like cars, fast cars. I drive a Dodge Stratus ES, with Autostick. So I'm bumping out the Need For Speed Underground soundtrack through my car stereo with the windows down and the autostick engaged, doing some high intensity driving to work. which unfortunately is only 10 minutes away, but this kind of thing wakes me up, gets the blood flowing.   Work has been light enough today for me to write over 90% more today than I did yesterday. Go Figure.  For the curious I'll leave you all with a list of my webcomics I read day to day.  urlLink User Friendly  - a ISP tech comic  urlLink pvp online  = a game magazine behind the scenes comic  urlLink NuklearPower  - original final fantasy with a humorous twist  urlLink Penny Arcade  Penny Arcade, a twisted vantage on Gaming  urlLink MegaTokyo  - an Anime style gaming oriented comic  urlLink /GU Comics  - A MMORPG Comic  urlLink WTF Comics  - a Everquest related Comic   everyone try not to feed the stupid people...
