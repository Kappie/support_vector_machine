It is more of a new frontier to allow us to keep in touch, on a group scale, and continue our friendships!  This will provide a central point for everyone to share memories, news, thoughts, questions, answers...anything you want to make available to the group! What's even better, is there are multiple formats you can post in, and multiple ways in which to post them! I won't take the time to explain it all here - I know that you are all smart enough to play around and figure it out, but here's a quick snapshot - you can post text, images, links, even audio; you can do these by way of this site, directly from the web, email, and even by phone!  So, I hope that at least some of you find this interesting, and that it becomes interesting and useful. If not, well, that's ok - at least I tried!  Let me know if you have any comments, suggestions, or questions!  ~Jay  urlLink mailto:jaycollman@gmail.com
