The wicked, the lovely, the master of sneaky-ness. It was fun to be vaporized, but only by Zorf, and never by myself. Could never vaporize myself. So I revaporized the Captain. Because I didn't want to vaporize myself. And I hate big butterflies with fangs because I'm too short to reach the button.   This all makes sense in some other life....   At least one person understands.
