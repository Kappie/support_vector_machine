Anyone Remember the maigc of a birthday when you where younger, when it was like a week away, and you just couldn't stop thinking about what you might get? hoping htat you would get the one big thing on your list, and then wondering who would get you the one thing you forgot to put on your list, but wanted anyway, Having a big party with aunt's uncles, cousins, that sort of thing.  those were magical times. Now it's just that your a year older,... nothing more... oh well, maybe next year will be better, oh I did find an interesting quote though "Birthdays are funny beacuse even though you are a whole year older, you are still only a day smarter."  Oh did I mention my lovly wife (x-wife soon enough) sent me a birthday card, bless her soul, she offered to make me the strawbery cake that I like so much, the one she made me every year for my birthday, how sweet. here's my take on that matter, here let me RIP your soul out, but I'll still make you a cake..... I'm sure it's all just the normal game she's been playing with me for years now. But still it sucks. And it still bothers me, it must be nice to be over someone and know that theya re not over you, that way you can take pot shots at them, and even if they don't respond, you KNOW that you got to them.  Anyway I leave for michigan in 2 days I may or may not post again before the trip, not that anyone reads this anyway.
