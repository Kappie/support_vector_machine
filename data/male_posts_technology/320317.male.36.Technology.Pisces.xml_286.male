The MX initiative is billed as an "integrated family of client, tool, and server technologies" that is built on a Java foundation. Chances are most Java developers are not aware of what this means for them. In other words, as a Java developer, what can MX do for you? The answer in short is a great deal! In fact, not only can MX technology improve the speed in which you develop your Java based web applications, but it can also help you create a truly rich user experience."

 Pretty sweet. The "rich user interface" is on it's way!
