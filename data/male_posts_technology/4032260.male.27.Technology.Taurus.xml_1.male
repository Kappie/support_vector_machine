But made himself nothing, taking on the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness and being found in appearance as a man He humbled Himself and became obedient to death even the death on a cross." (Phil 2:5-9)  "... work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure" (vs. 12-13)  Has the Holy Spirit laid something/someone on your heart? Is it really going to be that inconvenient for you? Humble yourself and serve God by doing that thing or loving that person. What is this life that we should store up treasures on Earth... "where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal"?   We can even tie this back into love with discernment. Don't just love the people who can benefit you (i.e. love your boss b/c they can give you a raise) rather be sure to love people who can't repay you in any way.   On a personal note... I'm going street witnessing tonight with a friend from church... if anyone's reading this... you can pray that we will be humble and that God will soften the hearts of those that we interact with.
