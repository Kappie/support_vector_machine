So, I was out on my usual excursion to a local city, and was making my way back to the car as dark clouds loomed overhead.  I made it back and started for home as it started raining...  Then there was a "thunk" as something impacted with the windscreen.  And another.  It was hail.  And in the middle of summer here!  Hence it was an odd experience, driving in the summer, with the car heaters on to prevent condensation and the windows wound up... most unpleasant.  More pleasant was the continuation of  Armor .  After a shaky start I realised that the non-stop writing style conveyed the madness of the story very eloquently.  And it does have chapters... just 70+ page ones.  More out of curiosity, I picked up the  Lone Wolf Roleplaying Game  today, along with a second hand copy of  GURPS Fantasy Adventures .  The LWRPG seems interesting enough, and the authors have at least made the effort to separate it from d20 a little... I can't remember how much of the info is accurate though.  Its been a while since I read the Lone Wolf books.  The other book was cheaper, but the previous owner had seen fit to scrawl notes over some parts of the original text, which I found incredibly annoying.  I also got Forever Peace and Forever Free, so today has been quite an expensive one.  In other news, my other campaign didn't run... so the previous week was not a good week for roleplaying :(
