I'm angry that she "settled" for me. I'm angry that I "settled" for her. I'm angry that when I said, "maybe we oughta get married some time," she took that as a wedding proposal and started to plan our wedding. I'm angry that I didn't do anything to stop her. I'm angry that while I was home taking care of the kids, she was out at her end of the school party last year, getting drunk and kissing some guy. I'm angry that she then proceeded to have an affair with him. I'm angry that I was oblivious to it all. I'm angry that I found out through email and when I confronted her I wasn't more direct. I'm angry that I didn't sue for divorce right then. I'm angry that I didn't kick her ass out of the house right then. I'm angry that she made a commitment to be true to me but she wasn't. I'm angry that she told me that she loved me but that she didn't the way I thought she did. I'm angry that I let myself get so attached to one person, to the relationship, to the idea of the relationship, that I blinded myself to all the problems we were having. I'm angry that while we were in counseling, after the affair, and we were ostensibly working out our problems, she decided it was okay to re-kindle the affair. I'm angry that she's having such an easy time of it dating many men. I'm angry that people don't seem to be interested in dating me. I'm angry that she's so readily jumped into the dating scene. I'm angry that this likely means she gave up on our relationship a while ago. I'm angry that I thought we could fix our relationship problems. I'm angry that my kids are going to have divorced parents. I'm angry that when she takes care of the kids, it frequently involves television. I'm angry that her fucking dog seems to have lost control of his bladder and pees on everything. I'm angry that she doesn't do an effective job cleaning up the dogs messes. I'm angry that she doesn't seem to care. I'm angry that she doesn't just hurry up and put the dog down. I'm angry that she doesn't want to fight for custody of the kids - that she'd give up custody so easily. I'm angry that she doesn't just move out of the house. I'm angry that she doesn't feel comfortable asking her parents for financial support. I'm angry that her cousin seems to think that I'm immature and may not be the best primary parent for our kids. I'm angry that her cousin was cool with me when we "happily married", but now she's turning out to be a bit two-faced. I'm angry that my ex-wife could lie so easily. I'm angry that the doctors don't know why my son has a seemingly constant skin irritation. I'm angry that the doctors have no solutions. I'm angry that the day care workers so readily point out problems with our kids. I'm angry that I seem to be the only one taking care of the house now. I'm angry that it's my sole responsibility to take care of the outside of the house -- the lawn, the weeds, the moles, the trees, the bushes, the cedar chips. I'm angry that L doesn't really do anything to take care of the house, except to pick up before the cleaning lady comes every two weeks. I'm angry that the garage is a mess. I'm angry that the previous owners left a bunch of their crap behind. I'm angry that I didn't do a more thorough inspection of the premises before purchasing the house. I'm angry that we didn't know about the gas pipeline running through the property. I'm angry that the gas company has dug up the pipeline twice in the two summers we've lived there. I'm angry that someetimes waterbugs get into the house. I'm angry that we may have termites. I'm angry that my garage door no longer works properly. I'm angry that the water softener never worked properly. I'm angry that the A/C unit the previous owners stated would cool the entire lower level does not cool the entire lower level. I'm angry that we don't have central air, that I have to install window units into vertical windows every year, and along with the a/c unit, I have to install plexiglass to block the rest of the open window. I'm angry that I don't know whether to sell the house or keep it. I'm angry that I get conflicting advice from friends and family. I'm angry that I love my kids too much to leave them. I'm angry that I can't just sell all my assets and go to a remote island for a couple years. I'm angry that I feel suicidal and/or really depressed at times. I'm angry that I'm not strong enough to go through with it. I'm angry that I have more things to say that I'm angry about but that I feel like I should end this blog entry.
