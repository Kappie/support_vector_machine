I put 45 bucks in and waited awhile to choose what to play.  I finally decided on a 25NL table.  The play was pretty good and I had one aggressive player to contend with.  I kept that person on my right and it worked for me pretty good tonight.  Ended up with a profit of 50 bucks for the night.  Not bad.  Hope my luck stays good.  I'll keep you posted.
