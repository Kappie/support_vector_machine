       
      A menacing beast watched over me this morning during the rush hour drive to work.  Standing tall between the streetlights, its dark body and broad shoulders pierced the smoldering rain clouds.  Motionless, it beckoned me forward toward the land of filth and sin.  What torment and fear this creature inflicts upon me.  Am I the only one affected by the beast?  Has everyone else become desensitized to this monster?  I feel certain that some have even grown to love the over powering presence, to the point where they cannot leave his sight.  For me however, the only consolation comes when I retreat to the saftey of the indoors, but often even there is not secure enough for me, what truely aleves anxiety is the cold darkness of the underground.
