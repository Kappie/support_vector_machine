I like the rock music of the 70's and 80's since they represent a much simpler and generally more enjoyable time of my life (nostalgia).  I can't stand most of today's music, partly based on lyrics/topics and partly based on the music itself.  I love big band music (Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, et. al) probably because I played alot of that in the jazz bands I was in in high school and college.  But for straight artistry, I love classical music (in the general definition of orchestral music).  Bach, Beethoven Tchaichovsky, Mussorgsky, Rossini, Copland, Wagner, Gershwin, even some Bernstein, and on and on.  When I get a chance and have had a stressful day or week, I lay flat on my back in front of the speakers and listen to some of this music, lose myself in the intricacies of the music and end up feeling much more relaxed and focused.  Sorry for drifting off topic there, but my point was that I had never thought about the fact that my taste in music has not changed much over the years and how that relates to heart and mind.  That would be an interesting study (what do changes in taste of art reflect on the growth of person?)  I bet some doctoral candidate has studied that at some point.
