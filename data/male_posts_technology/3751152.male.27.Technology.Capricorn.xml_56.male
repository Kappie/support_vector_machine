I don't like being in a bad mood because I'm such an easy going soul (almost too easy going if you ask some).   I'm really not going to go into why work sucked today because no one wants to read that. Instead I'll talk about why work is going to suck tomorrow. Well, I can't really do that with a clear mind because I want to think tomorrow will be a better day. I'm optimistic like that.   I already feel like I'm in the busy season. I haven't returned any of my friends' phone calls this week. I'm playing phone tag with a potential dating prospect and I'm working 12 hour mid-week days. This is not good and it doesn't bode well for the fall when things actually go live. I've said this before but I mean it this time, this is my last football season working. I'm going to try to switch over to baseball or something. The pre-season rush to do football previews is taxing. Baseball is more consistent and the travel is much better (albeit frequent). And...I'll actually have more time to attend TCZ Meets :)
