Nothing big, that's for sure. I did get  urlLink Musicmatch Jukebox  installed on my machine, so now I can make mp3's and burn mix cd's. Woo Hoo! I also picked up the new Incubus cd, but haven't had a chance to listen to much of it yet. What I have heard sounds pretty good, but I'm not sure what songs I like on it yet.   I just got done watching High Fidelity. That's a pretty good movie. I would say more, but then I'd have to dissect my thoughts too much, and I'd write a few pages instead of a few sentences.
