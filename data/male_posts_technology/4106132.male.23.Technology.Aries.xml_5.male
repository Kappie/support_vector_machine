Having got up at a reasonable time this morning I went back to bed  slept til lunch. I then had some food  went back to bed. Also lay on my bed watching a dvd most of this evening. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't that tired (though I've made myself tired by doing nothing).  I just have been so bored with nothing to do that I've found myself with nothing to do but go to bed - It's either bed or keep using the computer.  Still haven't got problems sorted out with my mates. Ah well, one of these days things will start going right again.
