And if you're anything like me it's usually on your way from the parking lot and straight through to more interesting things.  Well, there was one particular department store--I can't remember which--where the associates dressed in these long trench coats.  This was disturbing enough because I was always under the impression that they had extra vials strapped under either side of the coat. Like they were fake Rolex dealers willing to give you "the good stuff" if you didn't go for the displays.  The color of the coats was my next issue. Some associates wore all white. Given the design, they looked very nearly like lab coats which made me want to ask, "Who do you think you're fooling?" No offense to spray girls, but it doesn't take a PhD in Chemistry to squirt a slip of paper, wave it under a stranger's nose, and whisper "Obsession... Calvin Klein".  This department was comprised of two large counters on either side of the main entrance into the rest of the mall and the trench coats on the opposing side were all back. This is where I start to take a mental journey.  First of all, it was pretty hard to bypass this area unless you went way around and it's not like I had that big of an aversion to them... I found it almost entertaining in fact. But maybe that's just what they wanted us to think. It's just perfume. No big deal.  However, the more I walked between those two unavoidable counters divided by light and dark, the more it seemed to me that they represented the forces of good and evil. The balance of the world... the human condition... was being decided in that very perfume department.  One day Mrs. Jenkins decides to try Diamonds by Elizabeth Taylor causing some guy in Syracuse, NY to decide to volunteer at a local soup kitchen... the next day our curious Mrs. Jenkins wants to get a whiff of the enigma that is J-Lo by sampling Glo Perfume and that poor guy in Syracuse gets mugged after completing his civic duty.  Wouldn't it also be interesting if she got carried away with the spraying and it caused whoever came into contact with her to donate all of their money to non-profit organizations or, conversely, go on random killing sprees?
