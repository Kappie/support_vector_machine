The leaves were changing (actually they had already changed, now they were falling), the grass stopped growing for the year and browning in some spots, and from the highway, as I watched from the backseat of my Dad's old Mercury Cougar, all the houses in the town below had wisps of smoke coming from the chimneys. It reminded me of a valley full of candles that had just been blown out.  It was 1984, and I was tagging along with Ma and Pa Dukes for the day (had no choice, I was 5 years old). Apparently, someone out in Greenfield, Massachusetts was foolish enough to have a tag sale (or a yard sale, or a rummage sale, depending on what part of this lovely country you're from) on this brisk Saturday morning in October. So naturally, it's my mother's job to drag her husband and youngest son off through the wilderness to pick through someone else's crap just in case there's something of value to her.  Mom was a bit of a talker as well. She'd chew my Dad's ear off the entire day and he would just turn his head and smile then and again just to show her he was listening. Now and then he would throw out the occasional, "hmm," or "oh yeah?" but for the most part, he'd pretty much stare straight ahead and watch the road in front move toward him at a steady 55 mph clip. Someone once said my mother could talk a dog off of a meat wagon. I didn't understand what that meant (again, I was five).  From the backseat, in between battles with Shredder and the Ninja Turtles, all I could offer was the frequent, "how much longer?" "Ten more minutes," my mother would say. Mom was infamous for replying with "ten more minutes." Ever notice how every time you asked your parents how much longer, it was always "ten more minutes?" It didn't really matter where you were going. You could have been 2 hours from the destination, but it didn't matter. I think every time I was told "ten more minutes" it had already been twenty minutes from the last time I'd asked.  About 45 minutes later, we arrived at the tag sale.
