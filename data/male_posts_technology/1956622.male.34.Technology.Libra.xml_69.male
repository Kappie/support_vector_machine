Of course I got the lecture about how I was in cohoots with Kirk and Katy, Jake and Lisa and everyone else.  She states what does my child in my possession have to do with you?  I said well unless you fail to realize this our lives are still intertwined and when you tell me you have to have Karissa back because she is going to a birthday party that obviously will never happen I am a little curious.  She then says I would sure like to be able to wipe my ass without you knowing about it.  I simply said this has nothing to do with your ass nor do I even care about your ass.  She was like she has been gone for 3 weeks do you know how hard that is?   I was like hello...I have seen my daughter for 1 month THIS YEAR 3 weeks is a walk in the park.  I hope you now have at least a small taste of what I have gone through!  She then said well you will get her for Thanksgiving and Xmas so I won't get any holidays with her.    I simply said well we can trade you can have the holidays and I will take her everyday.    Of course her answer was no!  Then she tried to tell me how nice she had been chauffering me around so I could spend time with her and stuff.  I simply told her I thanked you and it won't ever happen again I will get my own car.  Sure she chaufferred me around but I had to sit around while she hugged, kissed, held hands, and groped her boyfriend in front of me so it did not come without a price.  Not to mention having to explain to my 4 YO why she should not try to french kiss her daddy!  So I would say I paid my dues!  She will probably come here and want to take Karissa and there is nothing I can legally do to stop her.  The order gives her that right.  If my attorney thinks I will be mediating anything other then stuff for the kids he and her have another thing coming if I lose before a judge then so be it but otherwise I am going all out.  What do I have to lose but more money I do not have?
