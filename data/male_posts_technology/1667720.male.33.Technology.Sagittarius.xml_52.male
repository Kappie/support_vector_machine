I went to urlLink  Supergo Bike Store  (by the way, great store) and I got a  urlLink Blackburn Trackstand Fluid Trainer .     urlLink     Blackburn Trainer urlLink      This trainer is not as smooth as Rob’s Cycle-Ops Fluid II, but with 30% discount, it is a great buy. With that, I also ordered a  urlLink Cateye CD300WD  cycle-computer from  urlLink Lickbike.com .This will allow me to track my cadence, speed, and distance even if using a trainer. Plus I like the wireless feature.
