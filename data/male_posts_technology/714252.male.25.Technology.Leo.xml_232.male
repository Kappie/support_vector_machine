First off my Birthday was absolutely amazing! I REALLY REALLY want to thank everyone who showed up.. I was completely blown away by how many of you all showed up.. We completely took over a huge section of the capitol! I really appreciated it and it meant a lot to me that so many people showed up..  I got to capitol and started drinking early.. Myself and Jonny got to catch up nicely :) Then all the others started to filter in.. It was great we started with one table and then slowly expanded :)  Had a load of drinks poured into me (including a green cocktail that I am afraid I can't remember who got it for me.. whoever you are thank you.. it's actually one of my clearer memories.. I remember trying to find my green glass over and over :)) and wandered around chatting to one and all.. [Insert a large Blank here] Then myself and Bubbles started to dance.. That was.. Interesting.. I remember about 60-70% of dancing with bubbles but one thing I clearly remember is suddenly noticing that * Everyone * has stopped drinking and is looking at us.. Not just my friends but everyone in capitol seemed to have stopped to watch..  This leads me to a strange quandry.. Every time I get really drunk around bubbles and there is hip hop we usually end up dancing and nine out of ten times we get a similar reaction.. I have yet to firmly convince myself that they aren't laughing when they look at me :) (Shup Fewl.. I won't take no shit from you..)  Anyway. After that I remember subjecting poor claire to some drunken salsa.. Sorry Claire.. Please forgive me.. The next little while is another blank.. Then we are on the move to RiRa! Wohoo! At this stage I am very... Hazy on what happens next.. I remember getting to RiRa. I remember going directly to the Table Football and myself and Gordon playing against two pricks.. When we started I was just playing as always but then they pissed me off and as a few people can tell you I am good enough at Table Football that no matter how drunk I am you piss me off and you might as well leave the table now.. We kicked seven shades of sugar out of them, then fired up by alcohol and anger I  demanded  they let me play them one on two where again I trounced them completely.  I loved every minute of it..  My next memory is of dancing with Orla somewhere in RiRa and considering how well I know RiRa it is scary that I can't picture where.. And that is pretty much it till I am leaving.. I have heard reports of myself Jon and Bubbles going at it on the dance floor again. Myself Orla and Jenny having a bob and something about disarming a nuclear weapon with my teeth.. I think that last report wat put there just to fuck with me..  Anyone has anything else they can remember\report PLEASE let me know...   Saturday I woke up surprisingly alive.. I think.. I was still a bit drunk in all honesty. Spent Most of Saturday laxing around Orlas while she was at a run through for a choir gig they were singing that night.. then up to mumy dearests for a little while in the evening before going to The Gig.  Myself and mum went to Orlas "A Summer nights Gospel with the Dublin Gospel Choir" (Yeah, I thought the name was funny too, just don't tell Orla I said that...) I have to say I had an amazing night.. The opening act where a group called Apes  Babes. They were an acapelo choir that sung songs with no band, yet still sounded like a full band was playing..The did everything from folks songs to "No Limits" and a prodigy track that just rocked.. Very fuppin cool.  GAH! I hate when you get a malteser that's rotten in the middle.. And back to my blog..  Then the Gospel Choir came on and OMG.. It was brilliant (even if they did keep getting us to stand up! Down with that sort of thing! I had a sore leg...) The singers were all amazing, really REALLY good. I had never really heard Orla singing properly before, apparently she only sings properly when she's getting paid.. Bloody Diva.. The rest of the night was just cool... Never thought a night of gospel could be so much fun.. Anyway.. After the show there was an "after show party" at one of the choirs members houses (Sue.. Funky Funky lady :)) and Apes and Babes showed up. After a few drinks and a bit to eat they all started signing and OMG.. There were about 4 people in the room and we all just huddled in the corner thinking about how we would never try to sing in public again.. Have to say overall.. An excellent night was had..  Sunday day was brilliant... It was a complete write off. I did NOTHING at all. It rocked. Then in the evening myself and Orla headed to the Ormonde Quay for a quick dance before going to the fund raiser thing in the Morrison. When we get there the place looks dead.. No Table set up with Kelly Anne sitting there looking into the middle distance.. No Salsa videos on display.. No sound at all.. We go around to the Back room and have a look for a class there.. Nothing.. The place is dead.. So we go to head down to the ormonde and phone Gordon to ask him what's going on.. Turns out the class was on with the door closed and no table set up outside.. Oh well..  Couldn't reallt dance 'cause my legs were still killing me from dancing on Friday night (Oh yeah.. When I drink and dance the dance gets a bit.. Mad.. It usually hurts for days..) but had a nice time watching and then the same in the morrison... (Sarah and T really should have won the raffle.. I think it was a fix..)  Then Monday I took off again.. (I know.. What a weekend eh?) Had another lovely day of doing next to nothing. Then we went over to my mums for the anual birthday tea! I love going to my mums on my B-day.. It's so nice.. And then just stayed in watching a video and drinking wine.. All in all the perfect weekend :)  Thanks to everyone who made it so funky\special :)  Mike (Now a whole year older..)
