Except I  have to go back again tomorrow cos the jacket i bought has a grfaet big stain on it that i didn't notice in the shop. Grrrrrr. How annoying.  Does anyone every look at those 'blogs of notes' on the blogger home page? Some of them are very interesting. 'Belle du jour' is a particularly, um, intersting one.....gives you a whoile new insite into people's lives........ Something else that I was going to say but OI've forgotten. So I'll go back to writing thank;you letters. Wahey.
