I don't know but he seems to be more active chasing others round but less hungry.    Quote of the Week   Hard work spotlights the character of people: some turn up their sleeves, some turn up their noses, and some don't turn up at all.  Sam Ewing   Speakers in the Alfa  The speakers that were originally in the Alfa I just bought are 'lacking........at best'. This intolerable situation will soon change. Instead of two 'Ark class speakers' I have purchased four speakers off the blogger (or is non-blogger more appropriate) Jono, and will probably install them at some point in the next week. Jono has already installed my Blaupunkt CD player. Cheers Jono. Soon Brahms' Clarinet quintet will be pumping in the Alfa! Yay!
