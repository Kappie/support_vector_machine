The aggregation effect, and the interaction with the content saved, is very similar to the way in which I interact with my TiVo. For example, with my TiVo, I collect television shows that I watch at my leisure. Each show that has been recorded by TiVo contains a brief description of what it is, and I can modify the settings for each show--whether I would like to have it remain on the TiVo forever, whether I would like to delete it right then, or whether I would like the TiVo to take care of that for me based on the space available on the machine.  In the same way, my  urlLink Sharpreader  program collects headlines or entire posts from various feeds that I have determined. I can then peruse those posts/headlines at my leisure, deleting when I want or just letting the program manage that aspect of things.  This similarity gives rise to other comparable experiences with both the TiVo and my chosen aggregator. First, with both systems, I constantly have the sense that I am behind in my reading/watching. The shows and posts I thought I would want to ingest are simply too numerous for me to ever get through. Thus, although I still spend a whole lot of time reading the news (less time on the television, but still  some  time), I have a more acute sense of what I'm missing.  I used to look through CNN in about ten minutes and be pretty sure that I had a grasp of what had happened on a given day. Now, I feel like I'm using a cotton swab to take a sample of the beluga whale that is the news of every day. It's similar to when you do a  urlLink search on John Stamos  and you realize that this insignificant, B-list actor's name search yields a whopping 130,000 or so results. Does anyone care anymore that there is more information out there than we'll ever be able to consume? We're used to it with search, at least.  On the subject, though, did the news suddenly increase when I started using an aggregator? No. Did my familiarity with current events/thoughts/feelings/random stuff increase because I started using an aggregator, even if I feel overwhelmed during the process? Yes.  If I'm going to either watch television or read the news, it's advantageous for me to have TiVo and an aggregator. In both cases, my time spent doing those things is economized, and there has to be some value in knowing what you're missing--if only the humbling sense of not knowing a whole heck of a lot, compared to what's out there.
