But it reaaaaaaaaallly needs lots of sweat on our part to stick to the road map, coz that road map is for organisations which are having enough resources and are following some processes atleast. But in our case, since our department is not full fledged and is in a developing stage and also not many process areas identified, i mean u can consider we dont have ODSP at all which CMM suggest. So just imagine about starting from scratch, where in i was even asked to prepare a template for making a proposal for a project and need to prove the rational behind every element in the template.   Ofcourse, we do have some standard templates like those provided by IEEE (Institution of Electrical Engineers) but then still, it needs to be customised to our company and thats where the entire work goes in. Atleast i am happy that we have some references like that of IEEE.  The next few months is probably till mid April, its going to be Process definition and the rest to follow is process implementation. and mind u, this is additional work, which we have to perform along with our regular work load. But then as all transition demands exra work, we see to it with new hopes of much regulated and consistent way of working, to deliver a quality product.   Ofcourse i would also like to talk to you people about the kind of exposure to certain project management issues too in course of time. Yes, i will also keep you updated of how a company moves in different stages when it tries to reach further. Esp. a small company like ours which has a very meagre or no presence i can say in pure s/w projects,  must have proper vision to see where we are heading towards. And i think, our seniors have thought over it and so we are getting equipped ourselves to meet any kind of project in railway signalling domain in forthcoming days.   Ok guys will share more in days to come. but then what happened to other bloggers? Looking glum for quiet sometime........ Anyway, if u people are taking a bit of rest, before u shower us with all kind of posts, then i wait for it with glee.  till then bye!
