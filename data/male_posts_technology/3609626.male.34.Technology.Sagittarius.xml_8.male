LOL  Ian's not the only one feeling bad.  I've been having gnarly headaches for over a week.  I hate that I can't figure out what's causing it though.  Could be migraines, sinusitis, a tooth ache... Or spending too much time staring at the tv or monitor playing Final Fantasy XI!  Nah, can't be the last one.  I'll just take some Tylenol and play for a while.  I should feel better soon.  I'm kinda glad that Sean's next two trips were cancelled.  That way we can play FFXI together.  ;-)  Hmmm... I'm seeing a theme in my thoughts.  Karen
