At the end, he has a throwaway line about churches getting into the game. Having spent the last two weeks doing some tourism, including a good deal of church-visiting, in both France and England, I reckon it could actually work here. In both countries, a single organisation (the Catholic and Anglican churches, respectively) is present, often in great numbers, in every town and village. Better still, they're generally evenly dispersed among parishes and, most importantly, they quite often have the tallest buildings in town, a fact sometimes enforced by local building regulations (see: Paris). This is gold. I don't believe, but I could believe in this. Perhaps I'll start my application for the catholic church's IT department :)
