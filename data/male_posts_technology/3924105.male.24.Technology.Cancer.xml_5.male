This seemingly boring task sooned turned interesting as I found myself coming across several long lost documents: receipts, school transcripts, credit information, previous employment, my entire life's paper trail all thrown into this filing cabinet that I had long since forgotten about.  At first I came across manuals and guides to old PC games that I used to play. I came across the manual for my very first motherboard, a 386 DX based board. I remember how hard I worked to earn that thing, and how much I loved it. It brought back memories of how hard I worked as a child, for the things I wanted most. Today, the story is much different...my drive is gone.  I found medical records and letters from past girlfriends. Thoughts of relationships gone bad, poured into my mind. So many years wasted on these girls, yet in some way or another I'm sad some of them didn't work out. It truly makes one wonder, why they all fail...if they all fail because of me. In the end, I was always told it was my fault, I'm the jerk, I'm the reason for it all. Maybe I was.  I came across my credit records. Tens of thousands of dollars of debt that I put myself into, as a teen. I didn't have a clue what I was getting myself into, and everytime they offered credit, I accepted. Never holding down a steady job, I never repaid my debts. I look back and am disgusted at my own irresponsibility and incompetence. But then I have to wonder, has anything changed?  Mulling over my school records, I skim to the bottom and read my high school GPA, a 1.6 cumulative. The string of D's and F's is astonishing...a glaring example of my lack of effort in my high school days. Only recently have I proven myself with A's and B's, seven long years later. I feel sometimes as though I define "pathetic" singlehandedly.  What has my life been? Looking through my file, thinking back to my youth, I realize that I've led a sad existence. I've never had any friends, never accomplished anything significant. I've never traveled the world, never held a great job, never had any academic breakthroughs. I've never had a successful relationship, never had a passion for life, and only once have felt true love. I ask myself over the years, if it gets any better than this, and I convince myself that it does. Days, months, years pass, and while little things may improve, the overall state remains the same.  My memory is shot, my health is poor, I'm overweight, my mind is going, I'm losing my hair, I'm relatively broke, I have no friends, no family to speak of. My schooling has hit a dead end, I can barely finish a book anymore. I have no forseeable future, no path, no hopeful "plan b".  I wake up every day, thinking maybe this is the day it will all change. Maybe this is the day that I finally take the correct path. Perhaps it's time to quit living in a dream world, and face the reality of my futile existence.  A mistake was born.
