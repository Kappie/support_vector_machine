Incredibly, the other player actually co-operated with someone (namely me).  This was the first time I've seen them do that, in any RPG they've been in.  Spooky.  I picked up  The Fifth Element  Special Edition and  Starship Troopers 2  today.  The latter is... interesting.  Imagine, if you will, Starship Troopers crossed with something like The Hole.  Very odd.  The weather has been uncharacteristically decent today... though there was the rumble of thunder and some rain earlier.   Heroland  is coming along well - they "final" version is presently under construction.
