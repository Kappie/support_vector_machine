I'm telling you, if I get asked ONE MORE TIME how much longer til his party (Jamie can tell time btw) I'm going to commit Harry Carrey.  This morning was spent running all over Highland/Griffith/Munster trying to find hair dye. The party is Harry Potter and everyone is supposed to come over dressed like their favorite character from the book. We have been all over looking for washable hair-dye (black of course) and glasses. We FINALLY found the hair dye after I went to one of the salons to ask where I could find temp hair dye. I had been to Walgreens, Osco's, the Party Store, Target... so when I left there, I stopped by where Paul gets his hair cut and asked them and they sent me to a place like Sally's Beauty Supply. We didn't find any glasses though. I stopped by the eye place (For Eyes) and asked if they happpppened to be throwing out any old glasses that looked like HP glasses but they said no. However they did have the HP glasses in stock! So, for just a split second I got excited but that excitment faded as soon as I saw the price tag of $70. Which the lady then told me she could take $44 dollars off. I told her, thanks but that's ok. It's only a 1 time thing.   ARGGGHHHH!!! *GOES RUNNING DOWN THE STREET SCREAMING AND SHOUTING LIKE A LUNATIC*  ....yes, he asked me again... I'm sorry I ever told him he could have a party...  Anywhooo.... back to the glasses, I bought some black poster paper to try to make some glasses out of that. Goooood luck! I'm just so glad I don't have to prepare food. We are ordering pizza and having popcorn, pudding, and fruit snacks. Plus some drinks. I had thought of Butterbeer and Melia had given me the recipe, but jamie wants Pepsi (which I think Coke actually had something to do with HP) but maybe that and Orange kool-aid and that will be 'Pumpkin Juice'. I really don't like Pepsi. I'm a Coke or Dr Pepper girl. Water actually, most of the time, but I digress...  Ok I have to go, less than 4 hours now til this *ahem* !Very well put together party.  Have a great day  Oh yeah, pray this dye comes out of their hair.
