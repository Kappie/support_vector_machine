She is going to have a sneaky word with her and see what she can arrange, but nothing promised though, but wouldn't that be cool?!! I cannot wait! Seems like everyone has got Jools fever at the moment!  I can't wait for Bon Jovi either- that will probably be the best gig that I've ever been too, although we will probably get deafened!! Yahooooooo!  In the end I didn't see the 300th episode of the Simpsons last night, I went to bed and watched the film about Anne Frank, which was qutie interesting. I might try to read it again, I  think. I read a lot of it when I was in year 4, but it was a bit advanced for me then and I didn't really understand all of it, and eventually my teacher told me to give up and read something more normal (teachers for you, eh?!). But I might get it out the library and read it after the exams of something, seeings as I will probably have a lot of spare time on my hands! Anyway. I've just come back from clearing up the kitchen, I went down there annd there was dozens of bowls, plates and glasses on the side, so I opened the dishwasher and found it was full of dirty plates (or so i thought). So, I washed and dried up all this stuff, took me over half an hour to do, only for Nancy to walk in and say "What are you doing that for? The dishwasher is clean, y ou've just got to empty it" and I thought some very rude things then! i was also quite cross cos I'd squeezed a couple of plates, a glass and quite a bit of cutlery into the dishwasher, so I had to try and decide which was clean and which wasn't! Worst thing was, I was about to run the dishwasher cos I'd filled it up with the powder and eveyrhting, so I would have been re-washing most of it! Geez I am so thick sometimes! After all that I have decided not to do any revision this morning seeings as it is nearly lunch anyway, I will just mess around playing computer games, and after lunhc I will do some serious revision! (says she who has said that eveyr day yet done none properly yet). Anyway, toooodle-oooo guys.
