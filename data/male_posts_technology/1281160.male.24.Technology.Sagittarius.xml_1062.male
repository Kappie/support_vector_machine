The next day you call and say "Hi,I'm very rich.Marry me." That's Telemarketing.   You're at a party and see a gorgeous girl. You get up and straighten your tie, you walk up to her and pour her a drink. You open the door for her, pick up her bag after she drops it, offer her a ride, and then say, "By the way, I'm very rich.Will you marry me?" That's Public Relations.   You're at a party and see a gorgeous girl. She walks up to you and says, "You are very rich.." That's Brand Recognition.   You see a gorgeous girl at a party.

You go up to her and say, "I am very rich.Marry me!" And she introduces you to her husband That's Demand and supply gap.   You see a gorgeous girl at a party. You go up to her and before you say, "I am very rich.Marry me!" she turns her face towards you ------------ she is your wife ! That's competition eating into your market share.
