I love to enjoy the rain with someone.   that is alright though, time will take care of that...... hopefully...   my friend dared me to run all the way across the street and up the street and then back...  I was like, is this man kidding??  I kicked off my flip flops and ran up and down the street while it was pouring and ran back tothe house.  I was drenched!!  It was fun though!!!  I hate some steak and then, I came back into my room.....  I don't know what to do with my time now, sometimes...  I just feel so alone!!!    how do you feel about the rain? would run with me in the rain?
