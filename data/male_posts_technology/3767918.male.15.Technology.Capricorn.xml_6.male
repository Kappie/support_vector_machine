She went shopping and blew her birthday money, then we went back to hers. Went on her new (huge) trampoline and... Other stuff ;)  What I've Been Playing:  Been leading platoons on Planetside, getting some CEP but not much :( good fun though :)  In the News:  I forgot to read the papers/websites/watch the news on Friday, so you'll just have to make something up for yourself.  Brazil has passed a law banning the carrying of firearms in public and making it illegal to own an unlicensed gun - with licensing rules similar to those in the UK. There is also to be a referendum to on whether to ban guns outright.  A car containing four Rumanians and bearing German number plates, has crashed into the security fence at the Houses of parliament. Two men have been arrested and police are trying to determine if the crash was deliberate or not.  Other Stuff:  Microsoft have upgraded their search engine to come close to the quality of commercial search engines like Google. They are also planning to release their own search engine software later this year.  The Hubble telescope has discovered around one hundred new planets orbiting distant stars. This makes the total of known planets to two hundred and thirty.
