Nothing really big, but a bunch of little stuff that she said she wanted.  She said that it was the best Bday ever, so I guess that I did good.  On Saturday we went out to Clearwater Beach and road on the  urlLink Sea Screamer .  It was supposed to be the world's largest speed boat.  I wasn't impressed with how fast it went, but when the dolphins came out to play, it was fun.  They were riding the wake of the boat, and jumping.  It was totally cool.  Then we went to Post Corner Pizza.  The absolute best pizza in the Tampa Bay area.
