The City of Rochester Hills is a Home Rule City. That means we have a City Charter created and adopted by the residents by which we live. The City Charter determines everything from how the City operates to who can serve as Mayor to how much taxes can be imposed.  The current City Charter limits the City's General Operating tax to 5 Mills. A mill is $1 for every $1,000 of taxable property value. The Charter then allows for the residents to vote on special millages such as fire and Police protection. At one point there was a fund for local roads, however it was terribly inadequate and the Council at the time allowed the voted millage to expire with the intent of going back to the voters for a special local road millage that would cover the actual expenses. Unfortunately, this millage attempt failed. While the City has been pretty successful in "Finding" the money to cover some local road repairs over the last few years, with the economic downturn and the loss of State funding, the money has dried up.  Another flaw with the Charter is that it was created for a Township that was becoming a City with about 30,000 residents. The original creators of the Charter did not envision that in 20 years, the City's population would more than double! The General Fund it maxed out and the special voted millages are quickly approaching their max due to the Headly Amendment to Proposal A.  Now people that know me know I'm a straight shooter. I don't sugar coat things and my penchant for "telling it like it is" has gotten me into trouble more often than not, but that's who I am so why stop?   The Straight Stuff  The City Council is faced with some tough decisions when it comes to local roads. Let's face it, the money has dried up and decisions on what gets cut needs to be made.  Now of course Brenda Savage and the No New Taxes Group or Mary Jo Dinha and her anti tax group will tell you the City has cash falling out of the Treasury. But I was there when they were both asked to put their money where their mouth was. We invited them both to go through the budget with us and show us exactly where they think we could make cuts and do you believe it? They REFUSED! Gee, I wonder why?  Now the struggle I have is what do we do as Council Members? Do we let the local roads crumble and turn to gravel? Do we stop plowing snow in the winter? Do we stop chloride treatments and grading of gravel roads? Or do we tap into other general fund money and close Spencer Park and Bloomer Park and the Environmental Center? Do we make cuts in Police Protection since we subsidize the Police fund with General Fund money? Should we just start doing special assessments to fix roads? Or do we go back to the voters with another plea to listen to the facts and approve a millage and ignore the unsigned flyers from the Anti Tax groups?  Welcome to my world....  It's a tough decision. One that can't be made lightly. Probably the toughest decision I've had to make since I've been on Council.  Now Rochester Hills has the second lowest tax rate in Oakland County. You would think that approving a small millage to help keep the road in front of your house in good shape should be easy to pass. Facts are that the Anti Tax groups have made statements that they will oppose any new taxes we try to pass. Why? We don't know. We asked them to put their money where their collective mouths are and they all refused. I can tell you my opinion... It political. Look who is in charge of the Anti Tax groups; disgruntled former city officials that just don't like who is in office so they do everything they can to undermine any attempt to make the City a better place to live. But that's just my opinion. No facts here...  I would really like to hear comments from any readers and see what you have to say. What do you think? Here are the options:  1. Approve a small tax millage that everyone pays, even businesses. 2. Stop all local road repair and maintenance activities. This includes snow plowing, grading and chloride treatments. 3. Find the money somewhere else and cut other City Service such as parks and recreation? 4. Create special Assessment Districts, do the required work and place a lien on homeowners who will have to cover 100% of the cost.  You tell me. What would you do if you where me? I would like to know.  If you have any questions, comments or concerns feel free to let me know. Irrelevant or nasty anonymous messages will be deleted so tell me what you think, but please have the fortitude to sign your name.
