       
      I am switching blogging services. I will no longer update this blog after this post, although this blog website will still remain on the web. The new blog site is created with a nice application called "iBlog" and hosted/posted on my own .Mac website. The URL of the website is:

http://homepage.mac.com/geoffmyers1/iblog/B577535438/index.html

Thanks a lot and enjoy the new blog! :-)

P.S. You can email me at geoffmyers1@mac.com for questions or comments.
