You see, this school year and the weeks leading up to it have proven to be the busiest I've ever had. With all the homework and other activities I have going, this is the first time I've even gotten on the web recreationally, in... 5 days... yeah that sounds about right. The only reason I'm posting is I may not have time to email Laurie back, replying to her voicemail(s) ~lol~ earlier and I wanted to get through to her that I had gotten them, if for some unforseen reason I could not call her back tomorrow. Incidently, those voicemails only became voicemails because my STUPID PHONE DECIDED TO DIE ON ME EARLIER TODAY!!! (Don't worry it's better now, but the battery still has issues.) Anyway, I have no idea how frequently I will be able to keep posting for a while, but let me assure you that I haven't forgotten about all ya`   I miss yah all you Youthfire'ers, hopefully will chat again soon!  ~Armaan_running
