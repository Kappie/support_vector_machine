Ok me let get in to the stuff before you yawn. I am left at the back seat when I see technological blogs in a sequel. There is no body to advocate on Marketing. Let me lend a hand for Marketing, which is giving me both hands and lifting me up.   To my understanding there are not more than two strategies for an upcoming business unit.  1.Manufacture more with low quality, price it less and find more customers. 2.Track down end consumers, manufacture less with higher quality, and price it high.   If Kicha puts me a query “ why not manufacture more with good quality and find more customers?” I will reply “ yes da but in this competitive world a penny expended should get 5 in reverse hence being meticulous in every thing we will end up in a mess”. Price and quality are either side of ‘see saw’ if one goes up naturally the other gets down. If Sriprasath argues “why not place equal weights on both sides and keep it stable” I would say “that is not for See saws are made da”.  So by now hope you would agree to my two points. That is fantastic. Then, I must proceed to the pro’s and con’s of being one among the two.   Now that Xavier has agreed to follow strategy one for his textile business (Coimbatore) I must also convince him that why should he be a part of strategy one. It is because we at India associate value with money and not quality (we means majority) hence xavier can anticipate more customers. Mahendran, his partner might ask me “so what”. He knows that I will convince him by highlighting the following points  1.Marketing expenses will be the lesser in your balance sheet(xavi sells a t-  shirt for INR 50 hence people will go for it). 2.There are people to try your new product released in future (he might release  a cargo for INJR175). 3.Investment in Brand building isn’t necessary.  4.Rub your huge advertisement costs; it is not necessary (one advt in “dina malar” as T-Shirts  at Rs.50 for sale ). 5.Packaging, designing R what do they mean in dictionary?  6.Ambassadors costing crores are out of our game. **( I will give u my call sheets da)  So why is Ramgopal pinching my hip on the other side. Oh sorry da I have promised you that the second strategy is the best. This idiot Xavier has told Ram what I have told him. Don’t cry Ram I will justify my stand. We will follow second strategy and soon overtake Xavi’s revenue. Now that we have spent a bit in understanding the Indian customer need   We are to manufacture T-Shirts designed in Germany. We will also give them the power of being exclusive. We are creating an excellent advt with Judev as the ambassador. Valli was surprised to see our advt telecasted during India Pak cricket match. So at last Ram has bought me a BMW for being his strategist. Now that I am supposed to address his executives about how we succeeded I am putting the following in my ppt presentation  1.We had priced our product in the skies which balanced all our expenses. 2.We have our showrooms present in all the metropolis hence we have the cream. 3.We have built loyal customers, who are lavish spenders. 4.We concentrate on every single customer, deliver delight and compel him for repeated purchase. 5.We had a “tour urope” scheme for family day in April, carrying them in the “cruise queen” 20 yards lengthier than Titanic. 6.We bagged best design awards from BW. (Oh God now Ram goes multi national).**  Being worn out after working for years, making Xavi and Ram the multi millionaires I am unable to help Rajesh for his upcoming Political party. Give me a desk and a chair I need to pen my first book “ who cannot loose”.   ** please call toll full number91-98433-36512 for more valid points
