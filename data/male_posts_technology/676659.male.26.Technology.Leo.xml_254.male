I go for bro. eddie pero wala ko ka vote kay wala ko d ka pa reg sa manila hehe c MM nalang nag vote for me.. like i said ang strategy nila nga "Vote GMA or FPJ will win" effective gd katama.. publish a survey that FPJ is leading..dollar rate is rising..blah blah..well cno man nga tawo indi kulbaan? so ang tawo ma vote nalang sang tawo nga ga second kay FPJ sa survey.. they voted for GMA not because she is the right leader but of fear that FPJ will win.. no offense ha.. basta that's reality.. ;) but i guess all we have to do now is to pray to GOD for our country.  enough said...
