Ok, so on June 24th, I got to see the Dead @ Irvine Meadows (I'm NOT calling it by its bought name cuz f that) thanks to a VERY KIND friend of mine.  Thanks to the same friend, and the fact that even though I was out of work, the wife allowed us to fly up to the Seattle house over the July 4th weekend, I also saw the Gorge show on 7/3!  Got a very cool T-Shirt and everything.  The shows were KILLER and in fact, I believe I'm supposed to be getting the CDs any time now.  Oh, and I got a job.   ...YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYY!!!!
