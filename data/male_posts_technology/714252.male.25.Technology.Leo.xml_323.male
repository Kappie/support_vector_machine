There are two reasons for this, both of which come from the same incident in my life.  When I was younger (yes even younger than I am now) I was in a Job that paid me more per year than I have ever earned since and it will be at least a year before I start earning that much again. I also had a Girlfriend that I loved. My first love as it happens. Me and her had always had an "interesting" relationship. She had cheated on me several times and every time I had accepted the reasons and believed it wouldn't happen again. In part I also felt guilty because I had been unfaithful to her too once. (The only time I have ever done such a thing ever, despite what a certain someone has said about me behind my back.. You still reading this?)  Anyway, she had this friend. He was an Ex from WAY WAY back. Over a period of months we all became friends and one day he found out his flat was being sold and he was stuck for somewhere to move to. I offered to rent him my spare room (did I mention I was well paid) and a few weeks later he moves in.  Now I know at this stage you all think you know what's coming but unfortunately you don't.  I started to suspect that something was going on but was re-assured over and over that it was all in my warped mind. Eventually the inevitable happened. I came home at an unexpected time and found my girlfriend in bed with my Flat Mate. Horrible huh? But hey, this stuff happens all the time..  Did I mention there was more?  I confront them and they actually deny that anything happened. They just fell asleep in a bed together naked watching a program. Nice try if I hadn't seen her sweep up a used condom from the floor. I was devastated.  Then over the next few days my already fucked up world got worse. I found out that she hadn't just been sleeping with him. Turns out she was sleeping with all of his friends  For money.  And sharing that money with him.  My Flatmate was pimping my girlfriend to all his friends.  See why I have a problem trusting Girlfriends.. But What does all this have to do with friends?  I was so devastated by what happened I left my job and took two months out and at the end of that I decided to try and go it alone, which meant I had to be very careful with my cash. No more spending money on party's and all my friends.  Guess what.. No Money? No Friends.  In the space of one month I lost everyone that I thought of as a friend.  So when it comes to me and relationships I won't take risks anymore. I just can't go through all that crap anymore.  Orla is the first girlfriend I have had that I have even started to trust (it is by no means over, I have a long way to go) and when it comes to friends I will go to the ends of the earth.  There is a flip side.  I demand a high standard from my friends. I have to be able to trust the people that are close to me. That is what I give to my friends and it is what I expect.  Recently a friend thought he was doing the best thing for me, and I respect that but the way he tried to help me involved lying to me directly. If you are organising a surprise party it is one thing but putting a gun to my head is another.  I will always respect and appreciate this friend, but I can't see myself having the some opinion of them that I had before.  I have always said to my Girlfriends that if they were ever unfaithful to me no matter what the situation that would be it. Never again would I be able to see them the same way. Friends it turns out are more like girlfriends than I ever would have guessed..
