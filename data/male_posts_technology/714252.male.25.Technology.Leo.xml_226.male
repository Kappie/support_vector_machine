I went back just now and read my very first post and I have to say it really is a surprise that I still update it at all.. I usually get distracted and wander off much sooner..   Here is my very first blog : urlLink Midgets Rock : "Welcome to my Blog.. As with most things I will probably post rampantly to this thing for the next month then completely forget that I have it ;)   By the way, most of my posts will be done through a haze of alcohol.. please feel free to ignore everything I say.."
