I'm sure it looks absolutely stunning because there isn't a moment when you don't :o)  Well back again after a quick trip up, around and back again to Glasgow. But the story starts on Friday night.. after walking 3 blocks in the rain and back again, we wen to a mexican restaraunt to have dinner (in Glasgow... I know.. it sounds kinda weird). We headed down-stairs and we were served by someone we thought was originally mexican but just had a think Gaswegian accent - I understood him fine but it seems some of the others had a bit of a problem so I acted as translator. Then as we were having our Coronas, we saw some very rock and roll guys come in and take up the large table behind us. They were complete with large hairdoos, dark sunglasses, leather jackets and greeted each other with one raised fist in the air. We thought they were just some local guys from a band, dressing up to look the part but maybe just trying a bit too hard. Anyhow, here we are taking the mickey out of them and the Mexican/Scottish waiter comes up and says, "Do you know who these guys behind you are?" And we say no and then he tells us they're The  urlLink Dandy Warhols  so we stopped laughing at their rock image and tried to think of what their hits were.. and to this day we're still not sure what they were popular for... But come to think of it, considering I have no idea what the Dandy Warhols look like it's quite likely the the band was just some guys dressed up and said they were the Dandy Warhols... Anyhow, just as we were leaving, I found a tenner on the stairs and shouted everyone a pint around the corner. Lest to say I didn't have a great amount of sleep the night before we headed off.  The next morning we headed off at about 8:30 to the care hire place, feeling like we were very lost when we started wandering through vacant lots hoping we'd see a sign for Hertz. Finally we found it and headed off in two cars (there were 8 of us all together) down the motorway. I have to say, the West Coast is  amazing . It seriously looks like a scene out of Lord of the Rings. Huge mountains on either side with snow-capped peaks. The quick version of this day is we did lots of driving, went via loch ness, just missed out on going to Urqhart Castle because it just shut, then headed up to Inverness to stay at a b and catch a bite to eat. We ended up staying in two different places - the place we stayed at were the nicest and friendliest people I think I've ever met. Alistair the husband would talk your ears off! We headed up to a bar that sold come of the local brews and also there was a local band playing some traditional scottish music (tin pipe, fiddles and a guitar)... stayed there a while but when it closed at about 12 we headed off to find another bar to go to but found that they effectively shut the doors at 11. So you have to find the place you want to go for the night and just stay there till it closes. So there were lots of people walking around when we had to leave the scottish music bar. First we encountered a guy having a leak in a corner and the police coming up and booking him. Then we came across a full on cat fight int he middle of a street that left one girl on the pavement. So as we couldn't get in anywhere, we just headed home but it was a respectable 2 am in the morning by that time.  Day 2, we headed back to Loch Ness but this time to got to The Loch Ness Meuseum 2000. At first I wasn't particulary taken by it as we were told it was just some multimedia extravaganzza and I was expecting a fair bit of crappy animatronics and slide shows. Particularly the fact that it had "2000" in its name really didn't take me and to add to that, customer testimonials about the place as you walked from the car-park. However, we were convinced by Vanessa who'd been to it before and said it was worth seeing. So It wasn't too bad, it didn't have any animatronics but it did have female manequins dressed as men.  After Loch Ness, headed back to Inverness to head along the road to Sterling. We thought this was going to be a fairly short drive and the weather seemed good. Neither was to be the case. Only just a few miles from Inverness, our sunny warm sunshine very quickly turned into bucketing rain and dark clouds.   Oh great, the fire alarm is going off. Went out and it seems someone burnt their hair with a hair dryer!?!?!? Oh goody, can hear the fire engine outside now... bet that's gonna cost the hotel a pretty packet. It appears the false alarm here is set off by the minuetest of things. So I think it best if I don't try cooking on the stove :o)  It's funny, at home I'm usually fine with cooking and can get organised to get all the ingredients together... but here.. well.. I've got M :o)  Oh, so anyway, on the way to sterling, actually was a bit futher than we expected. Stopped off at "The House of Bruar" which looked like where everyone else was stopping because along this road there was absolutely nothing else. Passed a by a small town which had a very nice Chapel on the side of a river. Then we headed down to Sterling and the Wallis monument. got there 5 minutes late and was shut. Then we headed up to the castle but just as we got there, they closed the gates to.   So in the end we say a lot of countryside and the outside of monuments and castles... oh except for one castle on the first day but that's because you could walk in and out of it any time of the day.  So I'm back and still feeling tired. Need some sleep so I can take on week 2. I've got some postcards and hopefully you'll be seeing them soon in your postboxes :o) -gede ps: missing all you guys heaps.
