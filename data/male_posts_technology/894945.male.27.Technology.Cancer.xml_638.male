As well as Damien we should now welcome Hannah aboard, she's been a TF groupie for ages and is one of the lads as far as possible, without actually having a penis of course. Random thoughts I have had over xmas/new year:  Marks and Spencers sell individual christmas puddings. I can't help but envisage a poor arthritic war veteran having dinner by himself, like in those 80's ad's for looking after old people at xmas because they get cold and die. I almost hung around to see who bought one and if they needed a hug. Is this strange?  New years meals are rip-off's. 25 a head for a tiny little started and tiny desert, and a luke warm main course. Turkish Kebab for 3 quid, anyone?  New years is better than Christmas. New years is what it is and you know what to expect. Christmas is like some tarted up Essex girl putting on her posh accent.  There's something strange about 4 episodes of Friends back to back, on every channel. But I still watch it.  There's enough of my inane babble for now.
