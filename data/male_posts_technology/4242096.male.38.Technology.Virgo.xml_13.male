I miss Sue...She does daycare and I work evenings so we always had the mornings to "chat" together...we'd turn on the cams.. and every morning, we would have our morning coffee together online..(Ok..I know that sounds corny, but it got to be a ritual)..I loved to watch her sit there and smile...(I love her smile, she has dimples)...she also has long curly dark hair, and has a tendency to "flip" it over her shoulder (definately sexy)...i used to beg her to do the "hair flippy thing"  more later
