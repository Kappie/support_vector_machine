Today is the day... *funny _toing_ sound* the Squawkbox commenting account for this blog expires. So...  What I expect is that the database will be locked up tomorrow and the links will be disabled in either case. Lite :) As I said when I put it up, will use it so long as its free, and then we'll see. So HaloScan's in. Will probably remove the older thing in a couple of days.  End of raving dynamic gigantic speech! Can we have a standing ovation please!!! :-D
