           
      First of all, the weather is crap.  So much for being outside washing cars and drinking beer in the sun.  So, as a second choice, I result to getting things done around the house.  Except that my original plans are larger than my actual ambition.  I'd say I couldn't care less about dusting an vacuuming and whatnot, but the truth is, it bugs me that it's not done, even though I don't feel like doing it at the moment.   And *someone* has brought a laptop home for the weekend and seems to have it glued to his knees.  I've hardly seen them separated since Friday afternoon - including bathroom time.   Not that I blame him.  I'd rather sit and relax and do something fun too.   Oh, well, there's one day left yet, so maybe there's some hope.
