And then the parents get home and they take off their coats and open the closet door and all the stuff falls out. And everyone laughs when they make up an excuse that somehow works, or some such thing.  In that situation, I'm always appreciative of the kids' effort to clean up the house as quickly as they do. I mean, if we always worked at the pace those kids do in the sitcoms, we'd all either have heart attacks or there would be world peace.  With Julie on her way to pick me up, I'm writing somewhat frantically, and that's not a bad thing.  It feels good to know you only have two minutes to write everything you're thinking about at the moment, and you know that you won't even get close to saying everything.  But at the same time, you know you're going to get a lot more done than you would if you knew you had two hours.  Maybe I need to write every day for two minutes, as fast as I possibly can. There's some allure to that, especially that you will only have written for two minutes.  But I'll have an ulcer the size of the grand canyon by then.  You will notice (or you won't, but now you will) that I'm trying out the one-space rule for after a sentence. It won't be easy, but I believe it's the right thing to do, given that it's already built in for the period to be up against the last word of the sentence. And on that anticlimactic note, I'll stop.
