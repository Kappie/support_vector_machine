Tomorrow am going home.. and will be back on monday morning... tuesday is a holiday for us for Krishna Janmashtami... My blogging frequency has come down, but just for a month or so more... then I'll be back to my original.   And one more thing. I want to know what is  Enterprise Collaboration . If u get any links to knowing this send them to me...
