I am smart enough to know I am not psychic, but then again I have had a few times in my life where I had a little feeling, a subconscious nudge, and I listened.    Then, I project this into thinking I should be psychic all the time, and feel guilty when I cannot protect someone.       Iâ€™m not obsessing or anything, but I have only thought about this 25 times today.    I know there is little reason to worry, just drive carefully tomorrow, pay attention, stay safe.
