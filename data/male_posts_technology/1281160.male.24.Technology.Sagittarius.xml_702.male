Me too am going to have a fine weekend. will tell all fun when i am back. and yesterday too i bunked my office as i dint feel like going. so to impress srini, i plunged still into the zone of cooking. Prepared some sweets and one special item, i mean Kolukattai to eat for dinner and not usual rice. He envied the way i was enjoying my leave. And dint feel like coming to office today. But then veetla irundha bore adikkumnu kelambi vandhutten.  Hei guys, i have got a suggestion pa. Why not we write some reviews? Ya the way i have reviewed the casette Panchabhutam, why not people who read books like jax, kicha, ram, sindhu, valli and almost all i think read something or the other and keep in touch with the literary world. So it would be nice if we start posting some reviews. Need not exactly be on books, can be on Museums or exhibitions or casettes or any thing worth reviewing. Thats what i can say now.  Gadsby good lipogram work!  Ok then guys will meet u all after holidays............. bye for now
