Can you feel the tension?? Ok, no tension, but I'd still like to get my hands on it today. If not, I'll live.  What the hell else is there to talk about at the moment?  Oh, I got my new "ergo" mouse at work today. The thing is fucking huge and ugly...AND NO SCROLL WHEEL. WTF is that about?!  urlLink Peep this.  It has got to be the crappiest looking mouse ever but its really damn comfy. They got me the Large size one and it fits my hand like a charm. Bah..form over function? Who the fuck thought that up?  Give me a nice pretty MS Intellimouse or a Logitech mouse over this huge piece of garbage.  So what if my hand cramps trying to reach for mouse buttons that are hidden under my palm and I can't straighten my fingers in 20 years time.. they look damn COOL!
