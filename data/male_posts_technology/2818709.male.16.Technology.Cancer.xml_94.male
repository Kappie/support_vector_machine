This cat died a million deaths, and lived a million lives and was owned by many different people he didn't really care for. This cat wasn't afraid to die. Then, one day this cat became a stray cat, which meant it was free and he met a white, female cat and the two of them spent their days together happily. Well, years past and the white cat grew weak and died of old age. The tiger stripped cat cried a million times, then he died too, except this time, he didn't come back to life.  - Spike  There once was a little girl who was very lonely. This little girl was given a puppy by her parents. The little girl fawned over the puppy, giving it many toys and treats. Weeks later, the little girl got bored with the puppy, and cast it aside. The puppy cryed, and cryed, but the little girl wouldnt ever pay attention to it...  - Me  How does the story end? Only time will tell.
