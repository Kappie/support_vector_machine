Here it goes:   Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).  Luckily, Adam is good at leaving coins all over the house.  Out of the pile on the desk I have a quarter that looks like its got blue ink on it - its from 1976.  The only thing that happened to me in that year was that I was born :)   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?  Bites?  Wasn't that a movie?   What is the most honest thing you have done?  I think the one of the hardest honest things to do is when you have a bit of information that you know could REALLY hurt someone and you still tell them.  Not because you want to hurt them, but because they're your friend and, as far as I'm concerned, thats what friends are supposed to do.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?  Back in the day it would have been something like walking on Kits beach, scrapbooking, or something of the like.  Now if I have a free hour I just want to be with Adam.   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?  The Bush Administration - starting with George Dubya himself.  HULK SMASH!!!   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?  I don't think there is any 'cause' that would make me want to do that - I'm pretty much opposed to war and that sort, but I would most likely do that for family - mine and Adam's.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?  Um, I think I'll be dead and I won't really care what is on it.  Although, it might be funny if it had something pertaining to evil stuff or world domination.     What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?  I don't have cable so I wouldn't know :)   What was your first job?  Being that my dad was in the military, my mom always worked up at the mess halls doing military functions and weddings and such.  So I basically got a job as a waitress doing all this stuff.  It was actually quite fun sometimes as it was a pretty big military base and we'd always get these young Americans or some of our own militia.  Being a young girl, well, it was nice to drool over these guys or have them talk to you ;)   Finish the sentence: “I have never…”  ...tried karate but will later tonight :)  Whee!
