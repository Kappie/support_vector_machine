The skyline was continually flashing. The fireflies certainly seemed livelier than ever. Probably in some way due to the fireworks. I think I may have figured out why we using fireworks to celebrate the 4th of July. It's because they sometimes sound like gun blasts. It gives you a small sense of what it would have been like to have fought in the Revolutionary War.
