Harrison and Brandon came to my house for 3 days. They wound me up, It is almost like they bring stress with them from Colleyville. I don't know why I have to keep dealing with that city but it seems like I always will.  The one thing I enjoyed was going to the  urlLink lan place , we payed 5 bucks for 2 hours of CS, UT, BF1942, and Quake there were some others but we pretty much played these.  There is a lot of stuff I want to do in Tyler. First is a  urlLink Go club  and second, lan parties. I don't know many people here but hopefully in highschool I could find some people.  Lastly in my post, I would like to address  urlLink this comic ...  So far, It is one of my favorite MT strips. The most favorite being  urlLink 495
