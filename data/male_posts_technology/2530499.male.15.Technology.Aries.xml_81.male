So, in compromise, I will do neither, but rather ignore it and tell you something random.  I have a stalker. Her name is Sara/h. I'm a little scared, if you'd like to know the truth. But let's not talk about that. On another note entirely, I caved and payed the three dollars to go to the Lincoln Center on Thursday. I felt a little dirty about it, but you know what Nickigeorge says: " Conform. Consume. Obey. " I also got duped into singing at the weird little Salon tomorrow. How, how do I do tevery day? Ahh, I'm such a good little drone. :DD  Speaking of drones...actually...this has nothing to do with drones whatsoever, but today was such a happy day. Oh how I adore PE. Oh how I adore volleyball. Oh how I adore being good at something for once. Mmm...nothing like flirting over sweat and stories of crater's in one's house,  non?  But, you know what I love the most? That beej will read this and have  nooooo  idea who I'm talking about, and it will likely drive him mad. Dear diary, why am I such a horrid person? Heehee. I've always wanted to say that. Now, end stupid post. I just needed to update, because I don't want to clean and this just seemed like the right thing to do. Night all.   "Because Beej is a paranoid little admin. man..."
