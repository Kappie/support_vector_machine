I guess everyone would have harboured a thought of being a scientist at least once in thier life, wearing white lab coats, working with microscopes and other scientific equipment. Take a look at  urlLink some really interesting jobs  in the world of science. Tell me which job  you like.   And still be doing, never done. -  Samuel Butler , Hudibras  (pt. I, canto I, l. 204)   I have also added a couple of stylesheets in " urlLink  Quod scripsi, scripsi  ". Check out the styles and let me know which ones you like to have in " urlLink  All in a day's work!  ". I'll be updating " urlLink  Quod scripsi, scripsi  " soon.  Rajesh and Bala are finally entrenched at Coimbatore. They are staying at a mansion here, just a few right and left turns and a couple of S-bends from my house. Rajesh has got a cell now. He'll be posting his number soon.
