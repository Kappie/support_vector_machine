And yes i think it is sad and unneccessary because its obviously an overreaction to the whole Sars thing, even if they deny it.   But I don't know, for me the problem wouldn't have come about in the first place if we didn't have irresponsible people who actually let their dogs and cats out on the streets when they didn't want them anymore or found them to hard to handle. For me thats no worse than what AVA is doing. But we don't see people voicing out strong opinions regarding irresponsible pet owners or petitioning for laws to try and stop people from abandoning their pets. I wonder why that is so.
