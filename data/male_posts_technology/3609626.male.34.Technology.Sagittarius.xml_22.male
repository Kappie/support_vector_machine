They are almost through though. They have finished most of the re-installation. They have to reset my sink, do some touch-up painting and carpet. The builder took a carpet sample Friday so I expect that to be completed soon and I can move into it and get my living room back where it ought to be.        I haven't even set up my [home theater] system yet because I can't get the bamboo stand that houses all of my equipment where it needs to be until the bedroom is finished. I sure wish [Sean] lived close. I could use [his] help in setting everything up right. I know I will muddle through but when I moved I couldn't believe the morass of wiring I had behind the equipment. When I redo it I will need to be more organized.
