Well, not quite the meaning of life but the meaning of war at least, it's a start.  OK. I'm convinced... this is the REAL reason the United States is waging a war on Iraq:   The world is a garden. Every country in it is a flower. Every flower is different, and that's what makes it a beautiful garden.   But nestled in amongst this mostly beautiful garden are some weeds. The weeds have been there for years (decades in some cases), and although the flowers didn't like the weeds, they felt there was nothing they could do. "Weeds are plants too", and they have a right to exist in nature. The flowers just had to learn how to live with the weeds.  Some tried to organize together and "contain" the weeds. They would build little fences around the weeds and try to convince them to stop acting like weeds. They would pass resolutions to try and get the weeds to comply. All in all, it wasn't working, but again, what else could they do?  Then one day, one of the little weeds struck down one of the flowers in a senseless attack. The whole garden was outraged (even some of the other weeds!), and so they all got together and killed the weed that did that. Everyone believes the garden is a much safer place for all without that nasty weed.  But that gave some an idea... wouldn't the garden be a nicer place for all flowers if there were no weeds at all (or at least, some of the other biggest baddest weeds were gone)? Without the weeds, more beautfiul flowers would grow. Some new flowers will be allowed to grow -- many of which the garden has never seen before. A couple of the biggest flowers decided that the garden would indeed be a nicer place for all, and so they began a campaign of removing all the weeds.  Iraq is the first weed. It's the easiest one to go after because: (a) there is existing precendents in place (10 UN resolutions for instance), and (b) Iraq was weakened 12 years ago, so the risk of a long, drawn-out, bloddy war is low. There is talk of other weeds being next: Syria, Iran, North Korea. I don't think they'll go after North Korea for a while, though, simply because North Korea doesn't align itself with very many terrorists. Islamic countries, sadly, are more urgent targets because of the terrorist factor.  Anyways, that's my view on why the U.S. is at war. They're going to clean up the garden.  Scott
