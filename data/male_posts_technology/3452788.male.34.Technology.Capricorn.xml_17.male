While there, I mentioned that I was trying to isolate causes, and had settled on stress, tension, possibly depression, and maybe mold in the office.  Doc's ears perked up when I mentioned depression, so I had another appt., talked about it more, and I will start seeing a "shrink" very soon.  I did not realize how difficult it would be for me to actually discuss w/ the doctor.  I felt so defeated and powerless, like I can't help myself, I may as well join the dopes on Jerry Springer.  I know logically that I should not feel that way, but I did.  Sue me.  I have started thinking about what to say or discuss, and of course I think first about what is wrong with me, and bad memories, and start into a downward spiral.  I see help coming though, so I will withstand the urge to self-pity.  I can see that this will be a VERY difficult process for me.  I hate when I can't figure things out, and I hate worse admitting that fact.  There are a ton of memories that have receded far back in the past that I would like to keep in that dark little corner of my brain, but I have a feeling it is in my best interest to clean out that corner.  What does it mean to "deal with" things in the past that are so bothersome?  I have a mental image of cleaning out a dark, musty, pile of creepy, alien objects that belong in another dimension... taking each object, cleaning away the gunk that obscures the details, and examine it with a magnifying glass under bright lights... understanding every detail, making sense of it, accepting it without the filters of time and memory and values.  Finish with one object, go on to the next, making notes on each, assembling a pattern of clues that will reveal some wisdom about how these things were created ...why I think the way I do, why my experiences and beliefs have affected the way I relate to people, why I like being bummed all the time, and why I have such a hard time accepting the way things really are.
