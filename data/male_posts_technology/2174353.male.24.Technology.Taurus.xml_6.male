I am now used to re-planning at an average of once in 15 days. I have started feeling that there is a path for all of us and if we don't follow it willingly, we are dragged towards it [More on this is to come in later posts].  I have now applied to  urlLink Chalmers University of Technology  for  urlLink MSc in Dependable Computer Systems . I shall also be applying to  urlLink MS Computer Science  program offered by  urlLink LUMS . In one way, I am severely handicapped due to a 3 years degree.   Right after the graduation some of the batch mates enrolled into SZABIST for a 1 year MCS just to overcome this handicap and some others continued their studies at FAST (leading to a BS conversion and then to an MS). I couldn't enroll into either. For one, the fee of  urlLink SZABIST  was higher than I could afford at that time [even the three years had been very tough financially]; secondly, the quality of education isn't acceptable at post graduate level in Pakistan; thirdly I was very disquieted because of the administration at FAST [Again, more on this is to come in later posts]; lastly, I didn't want to work half-heartedly [managing job and studies at the same time and not doing either with full devotion]. Still, not everyone feels these points as hindrances in a strict sense but the last point is valid for me even today.   Now when I look back, I feel I might have been better off with a 4th year of education. But decisions in the past are made based on the information available in the past and they shouldn't be re-evaluated based on the information that is available NOW. I am trying to demystify the reasons behind an irksome and dull life - I have found many and read quite a few things in the process; I might become a philosopher one day!    I know exactly what you mean. Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something. What you know you can't explain. But you feel it. You've felt it your entire life. That there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is but it's there, like a splinter in your mind driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I'm talking about?   (Morpheus: What is the Matrix?)
