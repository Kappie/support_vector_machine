This is not one of those sometimes, some of em, it's pretty much all of you:)  Not to say this is bad. In fact how could it be? I mean if it were all bad no one would hook up. The thing I've learned is that if you're a guy, you just need to find the girl who's level and type of craziness is compatible with yours. I mean, there's gonna be times, guys, when you'll be like, umm... what are you talking about, and she'll be like, you should know. And sometimes you gotta remember that no matter what she does, this might be the least crazy girl you'll ever meet.   I remember some times when different guys in my past have been like, "Tim, I dunno if I can put up with this craziness" and to be honest, I talk bad about girls sometimes, expecially when they interfere on guy time. (IE when I want to hang out with my guy friends, but they have to go spend time with their girlfriends) But I just tell em, "Look at this wonderful girl you got. Sure she's crazy sometimes, but they ALL are. You got a good one my friend" OK, so that happened like once, but I can pretend it happened more than that:) And no, don't worry ladies, it's no one that reads this blog;)  Well, check you latah, I'm getting up in 6.5 hours for running:) YAY
