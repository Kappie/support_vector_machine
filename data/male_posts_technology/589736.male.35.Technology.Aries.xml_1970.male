There is nothing wrong with mass market films (baaa).  I want to go see RotK, but Julie has no desire to, and has not even seen TT yet, so she would be lost anyway (baaa).  Sorry, all this political discussion has me responding loke a politician and not answering your question (baaa).  BTW, who is this?  Johnathan or Mir?
