I have a tendency to eat all the wrong stuff when I am stressed: ice cream, creme brulee (my all-time favourite dessert), French fries, fast food. With Drew's death, I have been feeling very finite and mortal. Today when Colm got home from work, I was sitting on the couch with three pints of Cherry Garcia, scooping and stuffing! Colm walked over, gave me a kiss, took the ice cream away and asked, "What are ye doing? Trying to kill yourself with that?" He knows that I have been trying very hard to stay away from the "bad things" because of family medical history.  With those simple words, I cracked: tears flowed, heavy sobs came. Finally, release from all the pent-up emotion of the last two weeks. Colm just held me, and let me just melt into him. I tend to be an emotional "stuffer", i.e., throwing all my feelings and emotions into the bag I carry over my shoulder. Then, when the bag is full, POW!, mess everywhere. Mortal and finite, emotionally spent, tired of being the strong one for everyone else, I collapsed.  As I write this, I realize that I am very fortunate to have good people in my life who accept and love me as I am. Colm is a blessing, I just can't say this enough. I am grateful, not only for him, but for everyone in my life. I say this now, for all the world to see (or at least the few see who see this), I LOVE COLM WITH ALL MY HEART!!!  Peace!
