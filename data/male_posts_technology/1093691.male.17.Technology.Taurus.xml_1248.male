I have looked at the courses I want and they all require a portfolio and a foundation dipolma thing some of which the unis actually allow you to do there and then go on to the course so actually Tom for me personally it is not optional and when I asked them about it they said you could apply without a portfolio but you'd have a much better chance of getting in with one seeing as one of the courses only has 45 places on it so yes, I do need a foundation course and portfolio. I can't even remember what the unis are. Only one I can remember is Nottingham Trent uni.  Cool Jackie I was planning on wearing a skirt as well!!! Lol. So hey we can be skirt buddies? lol. What skirt is it? Short skirt? Long skirt? Denim?
