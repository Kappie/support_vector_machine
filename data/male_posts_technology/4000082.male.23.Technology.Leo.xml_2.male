It is almost a habit for me and I am sure for everybody. They look at their watch and say "Oh My God! I am late for officeagain". Everybody would go in panic, some go to office, some to school, college, important meeting are based on time, events are recorded based on time, some say its good time, some say its bad, for some time is too long (college lectures), for some its too short (a date), some make great discoveries (Einstein) base on it, some scorn at the transport because its not maintaining time.   NOW, WAIT A MINUTE   Just stop and think about who invented time, when did the first second start, who divided time, who gave each unit of it weird names, when does it stop and plenty of other questions. TIME has been there from time immemorial. Nobody knows when it started.  What is TIME? Here is how I think of it.   When the cosmic egg broke, that was considered to be the start of time as some scientists say. But there was time before that also. Let me explain this way. This is an thought experiment so you have to do most of the part.  "Stop looking at your watch or shall I say the one that ticks at your right hand bottom of your screen. Think that there is no time. What will be the world if there was no time. Imagine you are doing your daily chores. Go to your office or wherever by following your instincts. Wake up from the bed, go to your office, come back from your office and take rest only by following your instincts. Does the world stop rotating if there was no time. But let me contradict my own  statements. What if everybody started following the same procedure, that is without looking at the watch you do your work. You do your work great. But does that match the instincts of your fellow human being. "   You are going to meet somebody at a hotel. How will you convey the message to your friend. Will you say to him to follow his instincts and come to the hotel. I am not saying that you or your friends instincts are wrong. All I am saying both of your instincts do not sync up. TIME is a feeling, an instinct that GOD has built in you for doing different things in one human day.Say you are cooking and you have already started it. If there is no time how will you end it, you will be doing the particular activity continously. But on the contrary you will end it. That period of you doing a specific acivity is called a Period and that can be TIME.   So some smart human being maybe to solve the problems of syncing up the instincts, giving a specific name to an activity you do at one particular period which is again driven by instincts, gave a name to all of this. Guess what...TIME? He must have divided the whole idea of time into very little pieces. OR let us say the smallest amount of period a human being can possibly do a specific work or the smallest amount he could probably imagine and put to use in his work.   The word TIME is flexible my friend.  Here is another "exagerated" illustration.   Some guy told to another guy," I will meet in you in an minute". Probably that was the smallest unit known some ages back. That guy came before a minute and had a quarrell that he was not specific. So the people decided to divide minute into seconds and so that everybody could sync up with other's instincts more accurately and that meeting will now take place based on seconds. Another guy said "Hey, Watch out for that rock is going to fall on you in a second". But before that the man was dead. Again the council decided to break seconds into smaller pieces and so on and so forth."   Like the illustration, TIME had many forms like days, years, light years and on the other extreme a milli second, a nano second, etc.   Believe it or not you can also name TIME in any way you want. Suppose you need a term called ONE KINGKONG YEAR to say a thousand billion million years. You can go ahead and name that. But do you really need it? Will you really use it? If put in use how many people will need this term. There might be a council to decide this for what terms are more generally used. They also make sure that these terms are imaginable and conceivable by the human mind.   All I am saying is TIME is a term which gives meaning to your instincts, constraints you daily activity, plans your life, syncs up other's instincts. NOW TIME has become so great that our instincts have to sync up with TIME, so that everyone follow the general rule. TIME is a very big term, there might be know start or no end as the humn mind can think of. So you simplify it such that it can be of use to a normal human being.   So if you know what is TIME, you are the ultimate person....NO THERE IS STILL MORE.   Can you answer this question?   At what point of time are you now? PAST, PRESENT OR FUTURE.  IF YOU SAY PRESENT...you have already gone through all three of them HOW? HERE'S HOW.When you were about to say "PRE", that maybe the PRESENT.When you were about to finish "PRE" and start "SE", you may have been in the present now, but "PRE" is past now and"NT" is the future.When you were about to say "NT"...you have already thought "NT" in your mind...and what goes on after saying"SE" and before saying "NT" that may be the future.and "PRESE" may be in the past and when you spell out "NT" that might be the present and you are already for the next word.  So where are you? PAST, PRESENT OR FUTURE ???  We explore more deeply in my next blog. ;-)
