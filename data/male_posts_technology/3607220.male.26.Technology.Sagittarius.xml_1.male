I have more questions than answers but for the questions that I have answers, I do have definite answers.  I do not beleive in love as it is put forward, the meaning that it usually conveys, literally meaning I guess. But I do believe in the affection that comes forth out of a deeper understanding of the other person.  For a relationship to worthy enough it has to have the love, respect and understanding as it essence. I believe a long standing relatonship has these at its base, huge and strong, cannot be shaken at all.  Why do we need a relationship? May be we want to live a life, life in its full glory, with all its grief and happiness. We want a mate to share our sorrow  joy, our thoughts, and to provide us comfort and security and a feeling of being part of something, being valuable as a person and much more.  What matters in a partner? As humans we wish to live a fulfilling life. 50-60 years down the line we would like to feel content about the way we have lived our lives, what we have become. We wish a feeling of joy reflecting on us, joy from our actions, from our lives and from our relationships. We would like to feel content, we would like to feel a life worth lived. Towards this goal, we wish to have partner who respects us and our feelings. A partner who values our  aspirations and believes in us. On who is very understanding and loves us for what we are. One on whom we can have immense faith.   Does anything else matter for us? Then why are we scared to get into any relationship? May be we are not sure of ourselves and our decisions, we are also scared of people around us, friends, relatives and people in general.  What if the relationship fails? What if the partner does not turn out to be what we had expected? What would others think? Can I live a life which is looked down upon by all others who I know?  But then we need to believe in ourselves, we will commit mistakes and we do, we have the right to. The mistakes would be painful but we need to bear them, its part of life else happiness will loose its meaning, it makes us deserve the joy, and the ecstasy. We cannot give away our life to others for the fear of pain, we cannot scared of committing mistakes. We need to take our lives in our own hands, let us make decision and let us not blame anyone else for it. Lets live life as we want, as we want it to be. At the end of the day if not for anything  at least we would be satisfied that we have done what we thought was the best and what we thought was correct. And this means we would have lived a life to the full. We need to have the passion for our lives and what we want to make out of it.
