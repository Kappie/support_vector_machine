Hell yeah baby, still a game out of 1st place but that's quite alright.  *  Wolves vs. Kings - Wolves won!  Oh yeah, besides the crappy Bulls, the Wolves are one of my favorite teams.  Kevin Garnett is for fucking real man.  He "imposed his will" (taken from David Aldridge of ESPN) on the game and I haven't seen anyone do that for quite some time.  If anyone deserves MVP in the league it's definitely him.  Now if he can get his team past the Lakers...That's going to be a tough series.  If it goes to a game 7, I go for the Wolves otherwise, it's going to be the Lakers in 6 tough tough games.  *  Season Finale of Smallville - So Clark sees this chick and she has powers and shit like Clark.  Lana left for Paris.  Lionel is behind bars.  Clark finds out that the girl is someone who dies a long time ago as she leads him to the cave where Jorel is talking to him.  He gets sucked into the wall and then wait for next year.  I would have liked it if it ended a little differently.  Like him running away and living in Metropolis.  See he's only a junior and with his senior year coming up I think it would be a good change of scenery if he just up and left for Metropolis.  Lana, the love of his life, is gone.  Pete is gone as well.  The only person left if freakin Chloe.  She can get very annoying.  She is a geek and I like geeks but sincerely, she's one of those geeks that might be a little bit too cheery for me.  I love her hair though.  Just the right length for err...never mind, sister reads this ^^  Yes, senior year of HS in Metropolis.  New characters introduced, old ones revisit.  He makes a new fast friend etc etc etc.  A whole new angle where he's trying to be good but still bad but good because he doesn't have the red kryptonite on him.  I dunno, there are more directions to go with if he was in the city compared to Smallville, Kansas.  Anyways, still enjoyed the show.  The Karen chick was a hottie.  I'd take her any day of the week.  I think I need some sweet sweet alone time with her.  *  Series Finale of Angel - Well, what can I say.  It was good, it was kinda bad, it was just in between.  Yeah.  I like Angel.  I try to watch it after watching Smallville but I really couldn't get into it.  The ending was kinda crazy with all of them (the ones who survived after they tried to kill the Black Thorn) were up against a few buddies of the people they killed.  Pretty much hell was coming after them.  Through deceiving the people who trusted him he was able to get inside the Black Thorn and become a member.  He knew each person's identity and hatched a plan to kill off each of them.  I enjoyed the last few moments of Angel.  I wish I had gotten into it earlier than I did but oh well.  It's gone, I suppose a box set rental would be cool to do.  *  Star Trek: Enterprise - I didn't get much out of Star Trek because of the other shows I was watching but it had something to do with the Xindi fighting each other to save humanity's hide.  Of the 5 races of Xindi, all were up for building a weapon that would destroy Earth and kill all Human kind.  Enterprise was sent to this mission because of a Xindi probe that killed 6 million people.  It was a test to see the destructive power of their new creation.  Although that was just a test with a prototype, the much larger version was only a few years from completion.  So enterprise set a course for the expanse to search and destroy this weapon.  To make sure that it won't happen.  In this episode, one of the hotter characters on the show, this Asian chick Sato was captured and she was to decrypt the arming sequence and get the ball rolling (so to speak).  I think she did.  I don't remember, all I know is that the other Xindi who were in the plan backed out and are now fighting the Reptilians (the race who actually hates the humans because they think the humans will end their world in the future).  That's where I left off.  I don't know if anyone can help me out and tell me what happened with the weapon, that would be great!  For a little bit of nerdy thinking now, see the problem is that I need fucking TIVO or some sort of Personal Video Recorder.  actually I would much rather have 1 big TV with several screens that can be divided up (kinda like the ones at BestBuy stores by the video games section) and hooked up to an audio selector that goes with your eye focus to select which TV you would have to hear sound.  did I explain that right?  Here, let's try again.  I want a big TV.  a TV where I can have up to 4 displays of shows.  With that, I want earphones that selects the audio through where my eye watches TV.  Now that would be a great invention!  Think about the possibilities!  Let's keep it simple with 4 divisions for example.  top left would have the Cubs on.  Top right would have Smallville on.  Bottom left would have enterprise and say you are just really bored, you can hook up an XBOX to the bottom right.  Say Smallville was on a commercial, you can switch and look at Enterprise and listen and watch there.  The cubs would still be playing and you can casually glance to see the score.  If all are on commercial, you can keep playing your game of KOTOR or HALO and not miss a beat with all your shows.  If you only want to watch on show, then turn of the screen divider and wala! you got one big screen to watch your sports event, show or play video games on!  Alright, enough rambling!
