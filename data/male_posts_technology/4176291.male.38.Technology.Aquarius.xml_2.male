I think it is a very good read about the influence of money on politics.   urlLink http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2002/foth020930.htm?source=EDNWFH   Of course, we can write all the articles we want, and nothing will change. It is up to the American people to hold it's leaders accountable to the governed, and to force the complete removal of corporate money from the political process. Up to now, it seems the American people have more important things on their minds than democracy.
