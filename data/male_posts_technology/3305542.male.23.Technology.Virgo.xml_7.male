Here is an update on some of the events in my life.  Monday I went out on the river with Phil (my coworker and new roommate), James (another coworker), and James's girlfriend Echo.  It was around 90 degrees so although the water was a little cool, it felt pretty good.  We went waterskiing, which was a lot of fun.  I hadn't been waterskiing since junior high, but it all came back to me pretty quickly.  By the time we quit, I was jumping over the wake and learning how to slalom.  The other major event this week happens tomorrow, when my good friend Kasey Louise gets married.  It's a shame all the good girls seem to be taken.  Well, that's it for now.  Later. - Jeff
