I just got a letter from my mother, which she sends every year around my b-day, which moved me in a way i cannot paraphrase, so I will reinterate it word for word....it goes as follows:  Thank you for twenty-seven years incredible, magnificent, joy filled years of being blessed with the pride and pleasure of being your Mom.  I've loved every second.  I have a life time of treasured memories from the moment I first held you on up throughout your life.  Your home coming was on september 9th, three days old.  Your first night home we slept on your bedroom floor because I didn't want you so far down the hall.  The next day we borrowed a tiny crib from Rick Marshall and you spent your nights at my side for months.  It was a thrill on the evening of january 28, 1977 when your first tooth appeared at four months.  I promptly called everyone to share the news. (it all fits that I brag about the fairytale life you have created for yourself now.)  You had a large collection of words at 1 and spoke in clear sentences at fifteen months.  Sitting at 6 months, walking at ten months, dancing at eleven months, jumping on the bed and wanting a motorcycle at twenty-two months (Ahhh, who can mess with that long range goal!)  You had fun chasing Yvonne, the dog, and playing with your first friends at the age of one, Jason, Laura, and Mary Melinda House.  At two and a half, your sense of humor captivated people and made them laugh.  You called yourself the "Baseball Kid" and loved to play and dress the part.  We played baseball in our hallway at 13 months.  You sported a diaper and a baseball cap as you smaked the ball, threw your plastic bat, and ran through the kitchen, dining room, living room, and safely back to home plate for a big score.  At three you were playing in the neighborhood park in a Bonita Springs uniform that Nanny gave you.  Your first big college football game was Michigan vs Wisconsin on November 3, 1979 at the age of three.  The "Big Boy" outing with just you and your dad impressed you more than the 54 to 0 score U of M won with.  At five, you were the big brother of two and on top of your world.  You enjoyed everything and everyone.  You learned to ride your bike at five and a half on June 12, 1982.  With each experience and moment came more joy and love than I could ever have imagined.  Your swimming accomplishments were impressive.  Your hard work and long hours earned you sixth place in Colorado at the age of ten.  My favorite part of your swimming career was begging you to jump off the diving board for the first time.  I encouraged and promised you anything you wanted if you'd jump in.  All the time i was praying you would not ask me to show you how!  After hours you took your first plunge and you've been unstoppable since.  At twelve you crossed the finish line of your first one mile Fun Run Race wearing the number 5 on it.  Your thoughtfulness, brains, creativity, sense of humor, and sense of adventure has given me the times of my life.  You are an incredible Son, and an awesome brother.  Your loving and powerful example along with your strong sense of family has made being a single Mom possible and a pleasure.  Each of us is blessed because of you Eric.  Happy Birthday Son.  I have enjoyed your childhood and I am proud of the man you have become.  Your greatness in all you do is a consistant marvel and joy for me.  I thank God for you and who you are.  Eric William Haller, God smiled the day you were born Son and I'be beamed with joy and happiness everyday since! Eric - Ever powerful and ever ruler William - Resolute protector Born Monday September 6, 1976 Labor Day @ 2:28 PM. 8 pounds 15 oz.  23 in long.  Happy Birthday my Son! I'll love you forever.... Like you for always.... forever my baby you'll be!  With all my love and admiration..... Mom xOxOxO   Now, that is a tribute....I don't even know what to say but this..... If you think I am bold, it is because she was so strong. If you feel I've loved you, she taught me to love by showing that she loved me. If you think I am a family man, it is because she taught me to be through the endless sacrifices she made for our little family. If you think I am sensitive, it is because she cared about me so much, and was so attentive, that I cannot help but be the same. If you think I am empowering, it is because she was always on my side encouraging me to press on. If you think I am touch with my femine side, it is because all I had to teach me how to be a man, was a wonderful woman.  I don't believe anyone has said such nice things to me ever.  If half of what she said is true, I have already justified my time here....I just feel so lucky to have had such a sterling example in my life, of what a beautiful person is....Mom.....I love you....and thank you for raising me to be me...you didn't cut any corners...even if it came at your expense.  No regrets, No consessions, No shit!  Wow...now that's impressive.....take a bow girl....you've made somthing great......and you made me, cry like a baby!
