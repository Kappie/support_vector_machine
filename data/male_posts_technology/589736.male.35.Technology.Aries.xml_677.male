Hope you're feeling better.  Dave  - Conrgats (late, but still.. Congrats)  Tree  - We're going to be NY the 26th -1st. You in town?  John  - Hope things are going well. I can pretty much guarantee that I can think negative thoughts better than anyone else in the circle, so count on me to my part.  Takers? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?  Props to Mir and Jimi for making appearances at our Holiday Partay of Festivities last weekend. The rest of you get a big fat finger. (Guess which one?) Ben, of course, is excused due to his unfortunate accident, and Tree, simply since there's no way our partay could compete with an evening in Manhattan.  All right, enough procrastinating. Back to work!  PS - For the record, Strong Bad sucks.
