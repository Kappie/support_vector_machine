He was always an  optimist, telling the team that we can beat these guys if we want it, talking about what he was going to  do with his life after high school, or joking about as assignment in class.  His smile found its way out on a regular basis, and it's easy to picture his grin.  I don't want to see you go Tyler, so tonight my thoughts and prayers go out to you...
