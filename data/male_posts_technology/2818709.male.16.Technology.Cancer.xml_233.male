StormsBelle: Wha? VacantSilhouette: Ok, we were walking down military ave. on the way back to chris' house from the park (we got bored, and walked to the park at like 12:00 AM). StormsBelle: ... VacantSilhouette: This guy, all of a sudden, slammed on his breaks, got out of his car, and started screaming "DO YOU HAVE A FUCKING PROBLEM!??!?!?!" at us. VacantSilhouette: we all said "no..." in unison VacantSilhouette: and this went on for about 30 seconds, then he got back in his car. VacantSilhouette: he drove a block further, and then he SLAMMED on his breaks again, and he got out, and he screamed a lot louder, and a lot more! VacantSilhouette: the same thing! StormsBelle: wtf? StormsBelle: that's crazy.. VacantSilhouette: me, chris, michael, and chuck all responded "no sir!" VacantSilhouette: i guess he finally thought that we were telling the truth or something. VacantSilhouette: here are possible outcomes if we DIDN'T manage to make him stop his anger:  VacantSilhouette: 1. He didn't have a gun - Me, charlie, chris, michael, and nick beat the shit out of him when he attacks us. StormsBelle: lol StormsBelle: I don't wanna know the other one..  VacantSilhouette: 2. He has a gun. We all run like sissies screaming away trying not to die. StormsBelle: lol StormsBelle: never mind I did.. heh..  VacantSilhouette: 3. He has a knife. We throw diana at him. StormsBelle: LOL StormsBelle: that's horrible VacantSilhouette: okie doke. i'm too lazy to retype this, so, i'm posting it in my blog. Laziness.  charlie and i came to the conclusion that there were a few possible reasons why he did that...  1. Charlie was wearing a blue shirt. 2. Chris and Michael were wearing red shirts. 3. He was drunk. 4. He was on dope. 5. He was on dope and drunk. 6. He thought we flipped him off or something. 7. He thought that we were crazy japs and that we were trying to eat his brain.  Hold me down, aveda. Hold me down, it feels so right. All i know is what i've been told.  oh yeah, and that thingimabob on the back of michael's ear? Yeah. Chuck was trying to tackle michael, and he popped it. There was blood all over michael's neck. It was funny. I said that he should just take a knife, and cut the skin off before it formed another thingimabob. He didn't listen to me...oh well. Chuck can pop it again or something.
