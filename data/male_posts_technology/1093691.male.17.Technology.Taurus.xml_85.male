My brother is watching some strange programme from the 1980s on the Sci-Fi channel about this guy who can burn things with his hand (ouch?) and my mother is reading the newspaper and drinking her tea in bed - and this happens every single night. What do I do? Well I sit in here and type away on this thing all night before going to bed.  This is quite an interesting question you ask of us Nicki, our honeymoon? Well that is kind of asuming that we get married, and having a girl friend in the first place. So in a dream world lets say... First of all, the honeymoon. Well, as much as I loved Paris and other places like Prague, I would prefer to be somewhere unique for my honeymoon. I will explain all in the morning, it's too late. For my wife? Well let me make one thing quite straight, after previous experiences in that line of feild, she has to be more inteligent and an ape. I will explain the rest tomorrow as well.  Or I could be gay?
