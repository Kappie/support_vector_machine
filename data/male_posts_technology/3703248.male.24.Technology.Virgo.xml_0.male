Finally after I met my wife and used her old x486sx with Windows 95 I first laid eyes on Internet Explorer v. 3.0.  I have used Internet Explorer from v. 3.0 to v. 6.0 and now once again I believe it is time for change.  While Internet Explorer is a fast, free, and  a reliable web browser, it has one HUGE HUGE HUGE problem….. SECURITY….  For the past several hours I have been using Mozilla’s FireFox 0.9.1 and have visited sites that would have just demolished my computer if I viewed them with IE.  Also during this entire time I have not received a single popup.  Even with a popup blocker while using I.E, I still had a tremendously hard time completely avoiding popups.
