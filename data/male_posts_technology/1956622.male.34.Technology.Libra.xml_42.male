In fact while talking to Karissa today I got hung up on because Karissa wanted to watch her TV show and not talk to daddy.  I was asking Karissa if she wanted daddy to let her go so she could watch her show and......Click.....then nothing but dial tone.    Once again great parenting   SFW  !  Thanks really appreciate it.
