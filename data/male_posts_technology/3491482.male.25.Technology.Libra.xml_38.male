Despite working in a field where offshoring has made an impact, I feel it is a much better use of global resources for those who can do better work for less to be allowed to do so.  I hear arguments regarding trade imbalances, but it seems to me that capital that is allowed to flow where more wealth gets created will ultimately provide the greatest fertilization.  We can expect that, ultimately, these developing nations that receive our capital should flourish and develop their own needs, which we may end up satisfying one day.  The other argument I hear against offshoring is the drain on human capital, as expertise to do the work ends up being developed overseas instead of here.  The US has been a net talent sink for so many decades that I wonder how anyone can now raise this alarm against other countries.  Like capital, brainpower that is concentrated in the environment where wealth-creation flourishes is appropriate.  If offshore environments allow people to band together to create wealth more efficiently, it only makes sense that this is where the human capital should go.  Any imbalance related to the relative wealth of the client and server nations will soon be equalized.  Granted, 'soon' may be measured in decades, which isn't soon enough for a displaced worker, but overall, it is best for the world economy.
