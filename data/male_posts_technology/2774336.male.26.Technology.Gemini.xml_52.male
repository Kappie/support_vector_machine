 I had whitefish with lemon and herbs for lunch (see last post) and now when I belch I taste garlic and rosemary.  I suppose that isn't too unusual considering the ammount of each in the recipe. 

 My intestines feel full, bloated, and I am having gas but not enough to expunge the feeling.  It's a bit odd to feel my  intestines  full as opposed to my stomach.  It's a much lower feeling than what I remember over-eating to feel like.  I wish it would go away so I would feel more like training tonight. 

  Update:  So I had some peppermint extract drops (alchohol free) and a little orange flavored Citrucel, then belched to include the garlic and rosemary of the fish I ate for lunch.  That is  nasty .
