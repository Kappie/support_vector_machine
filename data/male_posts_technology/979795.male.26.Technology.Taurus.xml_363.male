MOS burger + chocolate ice-cream... mmmmm. Need to think what to eat for lunch tomorrow.  Went to grab a haircut today. Another garang haircut. But I still felt it wasn't short enough. Think I told the barber to cut no. 1 along the sides and back. Should've told him no. 0 instead. Anyway while waiting there was a father and son waiting in line just before me. Maybe it's working in a school that's why I seem to be noticing kids more. But this kid was damn cute. He was scrawny and dark and his hair looked like it was cut in durian style a month ago. Just that now it has grown and the hair seems to be protuding from all angles on his head. His father was convincing him to go for a shave with the blade later but he simply refuses. His afraid of the razor blade and insist on just the shaver only.  Dad: Later go for a shave OK? You see, other kor kor so brave. Kid: Dowan. Dad: Want lah. Kid: Dowan.  While waiting his turn, the kid was so hyperactive and was contantly running around. The barber was busy cutting the hair of someone else at the moment.  Dad: Can you don't run around or not? I want to listen to the radio programme. (FM95.8 was on.) I can't remember his exact words but the kid was saying something like this; Kid: When is it my turn? Dad: Later lah when you get into the chair. Kid: (Hops onto the empty barber seat in the middle) I get into the chair already. Dad: Not this one lah. The one the uncle is cutting now (for current customer) lah. Kid: (Blur look.)  When the barber was done. He went for a quick smoke break. The kid settled into the chair to wait. Dad: (Just playing around while waiting for barber) Papa cut for you want or not? Kid: OK lor. Dad: But if Papa cut means must shave one hor (meaning using the razor at the end of the cut). Kid: Dowan. Dad: Want lah. Kid: Dowan. All the while the father was pretending to mess around with his son's head/hair. But it looks more like a head massage for the kid. Dad: (Massaging / messing with son's head.) Kid: (Turned head here and there.) Dad: What are you doing!? Later uncle cut for you can move around like that or not? Kid: Cannot. Dad: Ar, ok ar. Cannot move ar.  Barber comes back and proceeds with haircut. Kid still moves head here and there. And when he doesn't, he moves his hands to scratch his neck (thereby making his head move as well).  To help prevent his son from moving too much, Dad: Ar close your eyes ar. Kid: (Squeezes eyes shut so tight that he appears to be frowning throughout the haircut.)  At the end of the cut, Barber: (To father) Your son's head is like those Indian dancing like that, neck and head cannot stay still one. Dad: (Laughs) Kid: (Staring at his own reflection and new haircut with blur look on his face).  I look at the son and he looks even more impish. Resemble more like a monkey now with his durian/GI cut.  Bloody cute kid, man.
