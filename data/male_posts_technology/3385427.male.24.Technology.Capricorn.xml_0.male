A star found in the westernmost region of the giraffe-shaped constellation “Perseus”.  In 1670, when it was discovered that the visual magnitude of the star changed constantly over a period of 69 hours, it was said that this was due to a partial eclipse caused by another body in space. This was later confirmed in 1889.  Recently, scientists came up with a new theory. They now believe that there may be something sinister about the ever-constant flashing, for it was recently discovered that the cycle was occurring over a period of 20 minutes and with each cycle, the time was dropping by a fraction of a second. It was said that at this rate, the flashing would come to a complete stop in approximately 6 years 3 months and 27 days. In other words, today…in about 3 minutes, or so I’ve calculated. My name is Damien Thorpe. Although I work for the NASA Ames Research Centre in California, I’m currently stationed here at the University of California in Berkeley. My job, to find out what happens when the flashing stops. Not long to go now.  Little was I to know that they didn’t need me to tell them what was about to happen. The whole planet would soon find out for themselves. One minute to go. The cycle is now occurring over a meagre 0,02 seconds. The hair on the back of my neck is tingling.  Right now, I have the eyes of every influential person on the planet, trained on me, waiting for my hypothesis. Actually, it’s more than a hypothesis they want. They want the exact facts. I’m not in any position to give it to them though.  Thirty seconds to go. My ears start ringing. I think of my family. My beautiful wife Kelsey. My six year old daughter Jade and my two year old son Orin. What I wouldn’t do to be with them now. Twenty seconds left. I’ve got a bad feeling about this. Don’t exactly know why. This star is more than 300 billion miles away. That’s about 200 light years. Ten more seconds. My palms start perspiring. My vision becomes fuzzy. I can’t think straight anymore. Five seconds. “Oh God!” Four seconds. “Please help us!” Three seconds. “Kelsey!” Two seconds. “Jade!” One second. “Orin” Time’s up. The next few milliseconds seem to last forever. I remember my whole life. I remember playing in the park across from our house as a child. I remember my first day of Senior High. My freshman year at Yale University. Graduation day when I was chosen as scholar of the decade. My first day on the job. My wedding day. Oh how beautiful Kelsey was in that dress. The day Jade came into our lives.  The day we were blessed with Orin. Saying goodbye to them when I left this morning for work. Then, the minute just past runs itself over and over in my head. It passes.  Time’s up…. I’ve come to my senses. Time’s up…. I remember. Time’s up….  The sky lights up with a brilliant white light. For a moment – just a moment – it almost seems beautiful. Then, as suddenly as it came, it disappears, taking with it all other sources of light.  The earth is plunged into darkness. Looking up, it’s almost as if the sun wasn’t even there. And it needn’t have been anyway, because overhead, a huge atmospheric phenomenon is occurring. A bank of clouds, one as such I’ve never seen before, begins to cover the sky. Unknown to me at the time, the same was occurring, not just here, but all over the globe skies were being covered by this ominous black cloud. The darkness had come. It’s been just under two years since that terrifying day. Electricity is non existent. It’s like being back in the dark ages. People use home made candles as a source of light. They try to keep it to a minimum though, so as not to attract too much attention. Nowadays attention is the last thing you want to attract.  Since the darkness came, a whole new breed of animal has risen. The Screeches. Named so because of the spine-chilling shriek they emit. Like bats they use this shriek to gain a sense of direction as well as “see” their prey. Unlike bats though, this shriek can be heard by the human ear. It is a terrifying sound.  Humans have come to live in fear of these creatures, as they quickly finished all natural animal resources. It is now just our species left for them to eat.  Due to the lack of natural resources, we have also come to live in fear of ourselves. Humans will kill and eat another human if the hunger is great enough. We do not roam the dark streets for fear of other humans, but most of all, we do not roam the dark streets for fear of the Screeches.   Screeches. Large black animals with a hard leathery skin and a mouth with multiple rows of teeth.  They first came about a year ago (I do not know exactly how long ago, as we don’t bother to keep track of dates and times anymore). Since mankind’s first encounter with these creatures, we’ve only managed to kill seven. Seven! In comparison to the hundreds of thousands that they’ve killed. Unlike other animals from earlier years, these appear to be adapting very rapidly. They started out as animals roughly the same size and shape as lions. We managed to kill four of them, but when we discovered that we were fighting a losing battle, we decided to move to higher ground, where they could not get to us. Then came the winged ones. Same size, same shape, but with wings. They quickly found our hiding place in the mountains and hills. We killed one of these. Unfortunately, they were too agile and swift for us to properly defend ourselves, so we moved again. This time, we started using the oceans as a hiding place, building forts deep under the ocean waters. It wasn’t long after that we found they had adapted again. This time, they came to us in the shape of sharks. When the people first started dying, we assumed it was a species of shark that was attacking us, until we managed to kill one.   Studies of the body lead us to the conclusion that they were the same creature, but in a different form. We have since killed another one.  We considered moving back up to land level, seeing as how these creatures had adapted themselves to the water. We figured that it would buy us some time.  We sent out numerous parties to scour the land above, but the few people that managed to return safely told us that these creatures had not adapted completely. Their other counterparts stilled roamed the earth above. Driven by the will to survive, we have now built entire cities under the waves.  Cities covered by many layers of steel, to keep the creatures out. So far it’s working, but research has shown that these creatures are getting bigger and bigger and soon, these steel walls are not going to be enough to keep them out.  We have since started building rockets. Our next habitat will be in the vacuum of space. Scientists estimate that it will be at least another year before we are ready to move again. They also estimate that it will only take a few months before these creatures find their way into the cities – maybe even less.  One would think that, in times such as these, mankind would come together and unite their efforts for the sake of saving our race. The opposite is true though, as we seem to have turned against each other. There is no sense of community anymore. Humans simply live together due to a lack of space, not choice.  When I talk about humans eating one another, I talk from personal experience. About six months ago Kelsey left me. She came home one day and found me hunched over our bed, blood completely covering the bedspread. I had torn Orin limb from limb and was in the process of eating him when she walked in.  The strange thing is, I don’t regret it at all, not a single moment. It tasted so sweet and tender. So sweet that since that day, I’ve eaten a number of others. I have tried to find her and Jade since then. Not to ask for forgiveness. Not to ask them to love me again.  I want to find them, so that I can eat them too, just like Orin. Eating all those other people has never been the same as the day I ate Orin. I’ve come to believe that the meat of a family member is sweeter than the meat of a stranger. I’ll find out when I catch them. Right now, I’m on my way across town. I’m heading to a reservoir on the other side of the city.  I’ve received word that Kelsey might be there. Oh I hope so. The hunger is killing me. I stop for a pack of cigarettes at the local supermarket. Cigarettes are now handmade using strips of cloth rolled over shavings of seaweed.   I step out of the store and stop to light the cigarette. A flash in the corner of my eye catches my attention. I turn to see what it is. Nothing. The alley on the side of the supermarket seems deserted. I decide to check it out anyway. Maybe it’s a homeless drunk. If I eat him, no one should miss him. I enter the alley and immediately recognise the odour emanating from within. At first, I can’t remember where I’d smelt it before. Then it hits me. A Screech. But that’s impossible. There’s no way one of them could have got inside the city walls.   I consider turning and running but decide against it when I think of the amount of meat I can salvage from it if I can kill it. I take out my pocket-knife. Hardly big enough to kill a cat, but it’s all I have. I move further into the alley with my knife held out in front of me life a priest holding a cross.  It happens so suddenly. Out of nowhere it jumps at me, shrieking like a banshee. It tears off my arm with one swipe of its claws. I don’t feel a thing. It’s as if it’s not really happening to me. Almost as if I were watching it all from across the street.  The first thing I notice is that it’s standing on two legs. A new adaptation. Smart! Never saw it coming. At that time I realise that mankind is not going to survive this next attack. I get the feeling that this is not a lone Screech. This is just the only one that I know of. I’m pretty sure that this exact thing is happening all over the city.  I look at my hand and for the first time, I realise that not only is my arm gone, a large portion of my shoulder is gone too. Ripped completely off. Torn apart like a piece of paper. I can’t help but think about what I’m going to miss. I think about the fact that I will never see the outside of this alley again. Never light up another cigarette or smell the pungently sweet smell of the rubbish dump across the street from my apartment. I think about the fact that I’ll never get to go into outer space to our next habitat. That doesn’t bother me too much though, because I know that nobody else will either. I also notice that I don’t think about the past at all. I don’t think about playing in the park, graduating from Yale, my wedding day or the birth of my children. Things have changed since that first day of the New World. My mind has changed. It has become warped.  The only thing that I cannot help but wonder is whether or not the taste of Kelsey and Jade will be sweeter to these animals than any of the other humans around. I can’t help but feel sad that these creatures will eat them.  Not sad because I don’t want them to die. Sad because it should have been my opportunity.   None of that matters anymore though.  With the next swipe, the creature tears the flesh from my face. I live long enough to get one last thought. I can’t decide which thought should be my last, but I don’t have time to choose, so I take the first one that comes to mind.  Kelsey and Jade. So sweet. So sweet.    *It makes one wonder – “Who are the real monsters?”*
