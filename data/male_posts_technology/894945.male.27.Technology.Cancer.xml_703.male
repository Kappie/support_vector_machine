Actually I don't really care, couldn't give a shit as it's been fairly mundane so far!  Anyway as I was saying, it's nearly the weekend- so what we all going to do? I am a bit disappointed at the lack of response form you guys about going out at the weekend, I though we were all outgoing, but it appears that you have all become quite boring in your little relationship driven lives!!! (I detect a hint of want a GF in there hehe!) So come on guys, think of those who don't have a nice warm lady to snug up to over the weekend (winks) and come out to play.   So now we get to Baity's though of the day.... 'If I shout out "Lets all go and kill the States members!" I wonder what the general consensus would be?'  Baity signing off.....  'Into Glory Ride'
