Dr James Tan, consultant urologist and principal investigator of the ED study, said: "Indians seem to have twice the risk of having ED compared to Chinese. "No reason is immediately apparent in our study."  Hmm interesting ..well I think maybe its because Indians are usually way bigger in that department so its harder for us to get it up ? ;)
