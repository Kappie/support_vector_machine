Thanks for all the prayer.   Car Accident  Some of you may also know I had a car accident on the motorway last Tuesday. God protected me from harm, and I am now back at work.... somewhat poorer, and transportationally deficient.   Alfa Romeo  Dan and me went to look at an  urlLink Alfa Romeo  tonight. It is a replacement for my Mazda 626. I am really thinking of buying it. I'll keep ewes posted. Thanks for helping Dan!   Mafia  Awesome night on Sunday. Heaps of the youth from church went round to  urlLink Jono's , and we played Mafia. A good night was had by all! If you haven't played this game, get in touch, and I'll let you know when the next one is.    Lack of Posting  Anita has commented on the lack of posting on all blog fronts recently. In fact Dan has been the only one who really has been. What's going on? I've been too busy, but really want to get back into it. I just don't really have much to say though. Maybe I'll have an issue to bang on about tomorrow. Until then God bless ya'll.
