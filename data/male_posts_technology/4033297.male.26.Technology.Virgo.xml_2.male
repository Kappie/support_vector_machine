I will be participating in a 10 day "Ultimate Adventure" throughout Belize with a small group of no more than a dozen people like me - adventure/challenge seekers (I can only hope).    Since it should be a challening and grueling experience (which I love and embrace), I've been working out a bit, mostly lifting weights, and eating healthier. Although I see little improvement in my physique from working out, I am fully confident that I'll have a washboard stomach and bulging biceps by early December (I can only hope).    Anyhow, I promise to invest in a nice, durable, compact, reliable, good quality digital camera. My only fear is that it will hinder my excursion and/or refrain me from doing stupid things with the camera (such as getting wet during caving where I might be required to go under water).    So expect some refreshing pictures from the Carribean soon!  I'll describe a little more about this "Ultimate Adventure" on another day.  But for now....bye.
