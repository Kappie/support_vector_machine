There is a section of the society that favours abolishment of this ultimate punishment while another section favours refinement by changing the age old form of death sentence by hanging to that of the lethal injection or the gas chamber.    Why should death sentence be abolished? The reasons put forward by some are it is inhumane and no one including the government has the right to kill someone. But there are instances wherein the accused should be given this punishment so that he does not return back to his roots and starts his assault on the society. Should rapists, serial killers, hitmen, drug smugglers, political criminals, spurious drug producers be let off with a life sentence which is just for 14 years? Should the people who have made money or has had pleasure at the cost of others lives be let off with such a soft punishment? They have played with people's lives, with their trust, and with their faith. Such people should not be given a chance to come back as they have committed crimes without any conscience and not under the compulsions of the situation.    But the refinement of this capital punishment can be looked into. But again we have to sentence criminals to death by hanging based on his crime as he should also feel the pain which his victims have experienced. But on the overall we can shift to death by lethal injection. But the final word should be that capital punishement should not be abolished.    As usual I thank you all for the patience. Please feel free to comment. Thanks
