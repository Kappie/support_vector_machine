It is only at this hour that I keep imagining of rushing countrysides, lazy afternoons, or reading a book, or travelling for that matter. Well, I can think of anything other than office. I think everything else looks better.  But the point is, if I feel bad on a Monday morning, it means that I've had a fantastic weekend. And I am looking forward for more.
