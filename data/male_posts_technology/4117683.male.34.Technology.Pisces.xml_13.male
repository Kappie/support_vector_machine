I have been having longer streches of non-depression, and mediocore happiness.  Once again So much for that I know my mom will make me fell like shit within the first 30 minutes of her walking in to this house... I will time it for all of ya'll! They will be back on the 18th.  Well While I am alone I am gonna do my mothers job at Lowe's but I know she will say I do not conbtibute to the house. Also I may be doing other misc jobs... So I will have my own money!!! Yea.  I am gonna get the new Cure Cd, and maybe some older manson's cos of Ms. Slut keeping all the ones that I BOUGHT! What ever! I also need to paint the front porch, Mow the lawn, clean the house top to bottom! So at least this time I will not be bored!  Oh yea, I finally got my Connecticut ID today, So Now I am an Official resident to Ct now! Now I need to register to vote! Get out ther and vote. Go To  urlLink http://www.declareyourself.com/  and vote! I dont care who! You can even vote for the near retard! Our current prez with did not win the election!  Welll I cant think of anything else now.. but I am gonna get up at 3:30 to see my dad off so I may add something else... until nest time... Shalom!  BTW: Hi, Marie! :)  Lates! Joe
