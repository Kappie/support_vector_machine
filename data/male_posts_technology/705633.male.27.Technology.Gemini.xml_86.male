Walking down Bath Street in the lunch hour turned into a Miss World Beauty Pagent.  Brickies and plumbers in vans mowing down grannies because they are rubber-necking and not paying attention to driving.    A stunning brunette was walking past me, and she had a arse like two midgets on a fucking trampoline.  Before I knew it, I was on autopilot and on a direct course into a perfumerie. Luckily I snapped out of it before with only seconds to spare.  The problem is, this is Jersey.  Home of some of the most egotistical, gold-digging, drama queens this side of a Prada convention.  What every man wants is the perfect combination of a woman with a great body and a IQ over 14. So I have devised these simple tests to make sure that your potential girlfriend isn't too Jersey for you:    When she is asleep, insert a small tyre pressure gauge into her ear. If it reads over 20psi, get the fuck out.   Buy a normal, medium sized bucket from a DIY store. In freezer marker, write "Versace" down one side. Leave it near the hat stand. If she wears it, get the fuck out.   Glue a pound coin to her driveway.  Retire to a safe distance.  If she spends over 20 seconds attemping to remove it, or employes the use of any kind of crowbar, get the fuck out.   Over three flicks of her hair a minute, get the fuck out.   Check her CD collection. Anything related to Pop Idol, get the fuck out.  It's not worth the risk.
