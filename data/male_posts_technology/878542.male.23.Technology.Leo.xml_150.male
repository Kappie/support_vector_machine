I've actually worked on an original macintosh, and I must say, it's not a bad lil box. I used Macs at school while growing up, of course, and always preferred them to the Win 3.x and later 95 alternatives.  But using a MacPlus as a modern webserver? that's just.. mad. And with nice big color pictures and such? insanity.
