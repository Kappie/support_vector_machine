Not too fantastic despite some well choreographed fight scenes. But everything seems to be  going the 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' way now. It's nice, but not fantastic. I think it'll only impress non asians instead as they are still getting used to these type of martial art flicks. It's plot is simple enough. Revolves around a time when rebels were against the local govt. Basic story line is, A  B tried to trick C. B goes undercover, B and C falls in love. Turns out C is a spy, and it was a trick in the first place. A  B are captured. Story twists somemore, turns out A is a double agent. A  C used to be sweethearts. When A finds out B  C are in love, A tries to kill both. C gets mortally wounded. A  B fights a duel and both are injured. C intervenes despite injury. C threatens to kill A if B dies. A pretends to try to kill B (hoping to die in C's hands), C pretends to attack A but unable to harden herself to do so and dies as a result of her wounds. A and B devastated and show ends.  I tell you is a 'chim' show. Zhang Yimou kinda overdid it lah. Heard Hero was something like that. This should be a theatre work instead of a movie. 2 things I found comical and kinda stupid, A walking around with a knife in the back (literally!!). C gets a flying dagger in the chest, coughs lots of blood, collapses, starts snowing, and she still has the strength to climb up again. Dunno what it takes for her to die lor. Maybe a nuclear warhead will do the trick.  Anyway, I'm guessing that there will be quite a no. of pple who wants to or will watch this because of 3 reasons; Andy Lau, Takeshi Kaneshiro and Zhang Ziyi... people, please don't waste your money. If you really have to watch it, do so when it costs $6.50.
