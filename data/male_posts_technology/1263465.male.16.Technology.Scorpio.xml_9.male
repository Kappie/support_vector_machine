However, if anyone is sincere about wanting their own account, you can mail me  urlLink here , and I'll see what I can do.  Also, I got paid for the first time yesterday.  The check was for 103 dollars, which I promptly spent all but six of.  Hehe.  I bought a sweet little cruzer mini with 256mb capacity and the new tiesto cd (which kicks ass).    Peace out,  michael
