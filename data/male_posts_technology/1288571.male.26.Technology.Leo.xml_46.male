I just figured that a woman wears her engagement ring throughout her life, and if thats the case, I wanted to be absolutely sure that she'd like it. We went ring shopping the next day and she picked out something that she liked. It was fortunate that I did it this way actually because I'm almost 100% sure I wouldn't have picked what she did. Not to say its not a nice ring, I probably would have picked something else.  So long story short, we got a great deal, and we ordered the diamond separate from the band (Melissa wanted a specific band so they're going to make it). Anyways, the diamond arrived yesterday and we went to go see it last night. The instant the guy dropped it out of the baggy onto the velvet black cloth, Mel's face lit up. Instant smile! It was great. :) The bonus was that the diamond ended up being slightly better quality than what we ordered, but we get this one at no extra cost. Luck man, luck!! So anyways, now that she's given them a picture of the band she wants (and I've given them more money lol), it'll take about 2 weeks to make and put together. Woot!
