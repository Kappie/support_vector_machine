I used to be a practitioner of this philosophy....until this morning!  Racers....start your engines......  There is a ginormous line of cars to get onto the 17......I'm not feeling it.......I've been driving really aggressive lately (because I should be going to a therapist to express my anger) and this was no exception!  Racers....get the fuck out of the Ez way!  I find a woman who is putting on her eye makeup....not paying any attention...she is at the front of the line.....I cut her off!  I feel bad and good all at the same time.....I can't help but gloat by staring at her in my rear view mirror with a shit eating grin on my face!  The lady isn't even phase by my dick move....she continues to not pay attention and finish applying her war paint!  Nothing like a little competitive spirit and the taste of victory to start your day!  I had a stellar commute!
