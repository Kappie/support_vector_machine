Other than that, nowhere has any vacancies, trust me- I know! WEll today, I have this stpuid IT exam to deal with. AFter that I've got to change into my waitressing gear somwhere al ong the line, then attend a rehersal, and be at Caffe Lucido by 6.30pm----aaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgggggggggggggggggh! Well, hopefully it'll be intersting, and I own'[t drop anything in people's laps n stuff, and hopefully I'll get loads of tips! Probably not tho, I'll probably get the sack, ha ha! But yeah, I start tonight at 6.30pm until closing time! Sholud be ok though, if I get taught how to do stuff properly etc etc!
