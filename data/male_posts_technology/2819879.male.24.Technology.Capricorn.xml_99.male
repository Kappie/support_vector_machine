I really want to buy pikmin 2... why the English Version has to be delayed to 8/30?  Am I destined to get Japanese version? Am I?  ...  Sometimes, I thought, maybe I spend to much time on comics and novels and video games (refer to my tweens paragraph).  ...  Actually today was kinda special... 1998/6/17 was the first time I skipped whole morning class with her.  IHOP we went and it was a pleasant fair wednesday morning, just like today.  Sadly, why did we skip classes, I do not remember...  Probably just didn't feel right to go... perhaps...?  ...  Dummy.
