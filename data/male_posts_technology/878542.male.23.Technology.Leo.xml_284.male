There is a new classification available to make recreational piloting more accessible. It's called the Sport Pilot Certificate, and I think it's a step forward. Amongst the interesting bits is the creation of another class of aircraft, the Sport Plane. Which is a relatively slow, relatively simple aircraft.   A very interesting point is that the Sport Planes include airships, gyrocopters, and experimental aircraft(so long as the sport-plane pilot has participated in 51% of construction) as well as Primary And Standard category aircraft, if they fall within the limitations of sport planes.   yeah.   rock.
