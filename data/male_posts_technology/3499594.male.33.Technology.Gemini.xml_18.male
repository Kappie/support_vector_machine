Then our side turned around and made 3 outs with no one coming home. "Is that our team?" I heard a mom asked.    We also made it through the first part of the first Birthday then the full second one. There were 2 at the same time. The first one at 4 then the second at 4:30. We went to the first one for 20-30 minutes. This made the birthday boys mom happy and the kids got to play together for a bit. We then proceeded to the second one and the kids got to play in a  pool, played limbo and hit a penyata. The thing had to be made of iron. There were about 13 kids and each had first 2 hits a piece, then 3,4,5 hits a piece in turn. The thing didnt bust. 2 moms finally beat the hell out of it and it cracked open.   One thing that did disturb me though. The group of the second party ( hosts friends ) were  pretty  much too themselves. Kelli and I basically stood together enjoying the kids playing and one couple actually attempted a discussion. The host were fine and they also discussed but I could not help notice the other 3 couples staying to their group. Anyway, my wife said remind me to tell you the story of that one. Seems that these 2 particular couples wanted to have a baby at the same time. So in doing so, unfortunately one had miscarriaged, so the other mom-to-be had evidently 'taken pills' so she in turn miscarriaged. I couldnt believe it. Then I was told this occured 3 times. Finally both had kids. I was pretty much disgusted with that thought.   But all in all, the kids enjoyed it and that's what counts. I plan to watch my Quantum Leap tonight and we have Church tomorrow. My wife is doing her womans sunday school and  she allowed me to read it. I was very impressed. I told her it was very well done.   Oh and we plan on starting a diet Monday. She has been on and off one and has done extremely well. I on the other hand have always said, I need to. Well, I am actually going to go the mile and work with her on this turn. So for tonight and tommorrow I am stuffing the pepsi and doritas, but Monday brings showtime.
