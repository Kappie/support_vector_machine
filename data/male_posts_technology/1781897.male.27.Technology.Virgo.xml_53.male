I think this kid is great...and William...if you're out there.....hit me up man....beerz on me....lets do some singing!  I sent him an email today (to his school account at UC Berkley), but I'm sure i'm not the first...I have some high hopes that he'll write me back.....fingers crossed!      Go Will Power!
