I should be able to get all the walls up, and concrete collar around them done.  Its suppose to have a heat index of 104 degrees today. And I am happy as hell!  I can drink alot of water, get in shade for breaks, but at least I will be working on my pool.  For those that are interested,  as of now, I should have 7,500 in cost for the pool when Im done. That is for a 14 x 28 foot pool with a 6 foot deep end and 6 foot wide stairs.  and that also includes all the concrete decking im doing.  That same pool made with gunite with me being my own contracor,  would cost about 16,000 to 18,000  and if I had just hired a pool company would have been about 25,000 to 30,000. Also I leveled my yard, and did not destroy any of my shrubs or plants.  A pool company would have ruined alot of them plus tore up my grass in the front yard with there tractors.  It does pay to do it yourself.  Dad might be coming to help this weekend, I sure hope so, I need it.  I will post a pic I have of him driving the backhoe.  He was like a little kid on that thing, quit funny to watch.
