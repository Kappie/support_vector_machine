I saw a traffic accident friday, a motorbike had hit a car and the motorbike's rider was lieing down on the road near the fire-engine (in France it's the firemen who carry injured people to hospital). I think about this guy very often when I ride my motorbike now, life is so fragile...  I spend a lot of time to playing on the computer at home, and I had a lot of work to do before the end of the week at my office.  Yesterday, I had went to the motorbike trials with my best friends. I was very cautious, but my technique was not good enough and I fell again :s. It wasn't like last time, but I hit one of my fingers and I have some problems clicking my mouse today.  It will be my wife's birthday on wednesday, I had looked for an original present, but it wasn't that easy to find. I finally bought a parachute jump, with a tandem jump at 4.000 meters with 50 seconds of free fall before opening the parachute. I think we'll go on august 2.  I'll be on holliday all of August, I think we will visit Marseille and we shall go on a soccer match with the new Marseille team. I'm looking for a one week holliday in tunisia with thallassotherapie hostel.  And That's all ;)      Corrected by Mike da hat;)
