I really feel bad, sometimes I feel so selfish...she needs someone there for her full time...  Lemme explain, she is divorced w/ child ... I am married w/ children...she is ALWAYS alone...I always have someone to go home to (even tho' we don't always get along and over the years my love for my wife has turned into more of a friendship thing than a relationship)...but I would do ANYTHING in the world for Sue...She is one terrific woman...  delima is.....should I stay w/ my wife and hurt Sue or should I leave my wife and hurt her and be happy w/ Sue?...My wife makes me somewhat happy, but Sue makes me really happy?? Remember, I have kids  youngest of which is 10....she is my pride and joy...i can't disappoint her!!  It got to the point the other day that I was making myself sick and I scared myself...I actually started thinking about the easy way out...that's right, suicide...no descisions to make...only how many oxy-contins to pop and how much "Jack" to chase them with...  That's why I am on here....kinda like therapy...I have no one that I can talk to about this, so basically talk to myself
