I went to see perahara after a long while, had to wait for about 4-5 hours till the parade started and the another two hours till it ended, I would have just passed along the day, but after 20 years my cousin visited us and i didn`t want her to miss it, so i tagged her along to the perahara with her friend...who visited as well.  urlLink     hic`cups
