I installed Red Hat Linux 9 on my PC last night. Rock on! I installed the works. 3.5 gigs, most of the stuff I probably will never use but you never know what you're gonna use. It's a learning experience. I want to set up a webserver and a ftp server. I still have XP on it too. I have a 6 gig partition for windows and another 6 gig partition for Linux. I also have a 800 meg hardrive that I don't know what I'm gonna do with.  So yeah, my personal and professional life are going place baby!  This weekend I'm going to go visit the family at Duck Mountain. I hope the weather is great. It's a long weekend but I want to come back Sunday night to see A.C. Newman @ Amigos. Also the Fringe Festival started yesterday so I want to check that out next week. And next weekend is the annual Duck Mountain camping party blowout. Me and Curtis are gonna get retarded whether you come or not, but please do come. The more the merrier.  Damn, you'd think I was in a good mood.  Love you to death dear reader...   dutch out.
