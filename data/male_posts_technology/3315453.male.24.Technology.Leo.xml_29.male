I took the day off today in order to study and I have been at it all day, give or take a couple breaks.  I still don't think I am nearly ready for either of my tests, mainly because I think I slacked off too much this quarter.  But I will do my best and I have vowed to try harder next quarter (Fall Quarter).    Now I am watching Last Comic Standing to try and relax a little so that I can study some more.  This is a very funny show.  I watched last year and I really enjoyed it.  That is all for now, back to the studying.
