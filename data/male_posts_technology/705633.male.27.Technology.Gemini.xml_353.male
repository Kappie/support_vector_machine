Afterwards we were waiting outside for a friend to get picked up, Bored as I was, I cast my eyes above the new KFC and saw some bright lights… Curious, I wondered round the corner to see where it was coming from, everyone saying that I couldn’t go that way. Course I could! In fact I wondered round and found the Chicago Rock Café place, complete with blaring music and full of the new staff training in dance moves!!! (it don’t open for a another couple of days) Anyway. Considering that someone I know was in there, dancing, badly, we waited, watched and laughed. All in Jerseys Fabulous sub zero temperatures. When Linda finally came out from dance practice (sorry hon, you’ll never get on Popstars), we were ushered round the corner again and in through a door, up some stairs and into the brand new nightclub Liquid, that opens tomorrow. See, its not what you know, its who. And I am doubly blessed knowing the TF crew (creep) Preliminary report…  First of, we entered. No trainers. Even though all the adverts state that you can “Be Smart, Be casual, be yourself”.  Bloody hypocrites. The cloakroom bit was weird, they asked us to write our initials on the half of the ticked that they keep, why? I can only assume that if you loose the ticket you can still get your jacket back with a drunken scrawl that bears no resemblance to your initials. The Polish bird behind the desk wasn’t exactly a wonder bra advert material either. Upon entering the club proper, it seemed more like the breeze bar or any other “trendy” bar that likes to keep bottles of brightly coloured alcoholic liquids stacked in a pyramid lit from behind with a 600 watt bulb. Oh and everything was white… One wall was made of four convex panels with windows. Through the windows was the dance floor but it was closed for the first half an hour (cramming as many people into the first bar). Then the four panels rotated in on themselves to form four lens shaped pillars opening up the rest of the club I was… disappointed. I dunno, I was expecting something better, not just Follies in white! No kidding, Its about the same size but without the raised bits. The dance floor itself looks more like an ice skating rink. The chill out bit was at the far end of the club, right next to the floor, not very chillouty. It even had a slot machine right next to the floor! Seats are furnished in white leather? Remember how long the walls in Zebra remained mank free? The VIP lounge hadn’t been completed. All in all, not impressive apart from the fact that its white (as apposed to black for every other club – hides the dirt) and that there are more lights than Santa’s airport runway. The DJ box had the most impressive bit. A touch screen for projecting a spacey computer generated video onto the walls above the dance floor, but was sparkly used by the computer illiterate DJ  who spent the night trying to play some 8-track dance music… In conclusion. White, bright but otherwise like every other town night club.
