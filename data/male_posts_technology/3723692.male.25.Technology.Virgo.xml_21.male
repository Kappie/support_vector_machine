Although I must say it will not be as intellectual as silent spring’s or as funny as of Virtuous vibes or Zenia’s or as captivating as that of Crazed Insomniac or Atrophying Senses’s, but am sure it will be mixture of all, I am good in copy paste you know ;).  Friday has always been a dull and least productive day as far as work is concerned and if you had an hearty lunch and got over stuffed then it gets really hard to go through the rest of the hours. Today isnt any different, nine of us(newly employed, although I am here from 6 months now) had to treat 14 other members of our department. So KFC was decided as a venue. and all went well. The only issue left is, it was my CC which was charged aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa and I hate recovering money (do I sound like shylock here???) Since coming back to office I am yawning and having ocassional 5 minutes naps :) and writing this.  By the way My name is Saad and I work as a Software Engineer. Work as usual has its ups and downs and to look forward for the day I started a sporting activity but for some odd reason struggling with that which is making me more and more frustrated as days are passing by and now I don’t have anything to look forward for the whole day, yikes. Gtg now  Adious
