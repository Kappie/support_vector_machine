My sister was at an all-nighter with her youth group and got back home around 2, by this time I’d already showered and gotten my suit and everything basically ready. My sister needed a ride to my school at 3 for a fair so I took her over and stuck around for a bit to make sure some of her friends were there, then came back home.   I had eaten (my first meal of the day – lol) and gotten ready to go pick up Steven at 4pm, but Mahdi randomly showed up at our door. Now, a little background on Mahdi: We met him at the ethnic excuse-for-a church we attended almost all my life (well, actually we helped start it) until a couple years ago. He’s got some mental issues going on and my dad’s been trying to help him but Mahdi’s been getting into a lot of trouble with the police and other people lately. Like a week or so ago he randomly left his van in our driveway, with a brief note written to my dad, stuck on our door that said that his roommate had been giving him trouble. That was all. (Btw, he still has studs on his tires, several weeks after the latest date he can legally have them on.) Yeah, so anyway, he randomly showed up on our doorstep and started knocking on the door for something like six to ten minutes straight. I was the only one home and just ignored him; didn’t let him know I was there. I was sitting in the kitchen eating and a thought occurred to me… He’s persistent enough; he might come up on the deck. I though for sure that he wouldn’t but there still was a possibility, and I needed to do something in my room anyway, so I took my food (leftovers from Wu’s Open Kitchen) and went down to my room to finish eating it. Almost the second I walked into my room, I heard Mahdi walking up the steps to the second story deck, right where I was moments ago. I called my dad and asked him if he’d told Mahdi that he could come over and he told me just the opposite… that he had told him specifically  not  to come. Yeah, I waited like twenty minutes and went back upstairs again (with a gun on my belt) and saw that he had gone and taken his van, but he left a 20 thousand dollar silk Persian rug on top of our cathouse outside… Yeah whatever, odd fellow.  Anyway, because of this I was close to half an hour late picking up Steven. On the way to Becky’s we picked up a camera from Cam’s house because my dad had mine and I hadn’t seen my parents in two days so I couldn’t get it from him. (Weird schedules where everyone’s asleep when I get home and everyone’s gone when I wake – lol)  We finally arrived at Becky’s at 5:30 instead of 5:00 like we had planned, but ‘twas all good ‘cause Danie and Jon arrived just after us too. Mary and Mandy were busy doing Becky’s hair so Danie, Jon, Steven, Edwin and I picked prolly the oddest of the … several hundred or so VHSs there – “Yomega Yo Zone” lol, It was a yo-yo infomercial type thing that we guessed and later confirmed, came with a yo-yo. Then came hanging around waiting for food to cook, eating and changing. (lol) I forgot a belt so I had to borrow one from Becky’s mom. After that were couple and group pictures and driving to the random ballroom in Portland: Steven, Becky, Edwin and Mary in Becky’s mom’s car, and Danie, Jon, Mandy and I in Mandy’s mom’s.  Once we got there just after it started at 8, one of the first things I noticed was the candy buffet on several huge tables in the first room, there were massive (I’m talking like two cubic feet+) bowls of Skittles, M and other things. When we got to the dance floor we hung back for a bit for some reason and then decided to start right as the slow songs started. (lol) Slow dancing was kinda scary but fun – sorta weird to do it with someone who’s just a friend, but yeah, ‘twas fun. Then the at the first fast song, Baby Got Back, Steven and I were like “Uh, we’re not dancing to this…” which was all good ‘cause our dates picked that moments to run off with each other, so we went back to our table (LOL). The rest of the next hour or two was spent dancing again, but up in the back of the higher of the two-tiered stage. “Cotton Eye Joe” came on and all 70 or so of us up there started a massive line dance. So great… haha. But yeah, I think eventually the six of us in our group that were up there got tired of the ear-shattering loudness and the heat, even though there was an industrial fan blowing on stage (girls randomly lifting their dressed in front of it… or maybe by it… whatever) and went back to our table. More walking and picture taking for half an hour and then we finally organized everyone and got group and couple shots. The group shot was interesting, the photographer was trying to fit four of us on a really tiny bench, and eventually just had Mandy and Becky sit on Steven’s and my leg. Seemed really uncomfortable for the poor girls, they were almost falling off (lol, but the picture turned out good, so *yay*).  Around 11:30, when it officially ended, we all walked outside and waited for the moms to walk back from wherever it was that they were. They ended up needing to use the restroom so we waited some more, and while we were, some self-proclaimed pervert walked up and started asking us to all pose for a picture. (lol) He kept commenting about Becky’s hair then after her took the picture some random lady with him started asking us what our addresses were and if we wanted copies of the picture. We’re all like “Um, you said you’re a perv, go away” then once the moms got back down we went next door to the parking garage and some random college guys started hitting on the girls and walked around a corner out of sight. When our elevator opened, we realized it was glass and they were hanging around the outside. To bad for them, all the girl’s dressed were floor-length, though Edwin was going to moon them… (LOL)   Sunday: The after-party, Cam’s house, and hearing Mr. Weber preach   We made it to Sherri's ordered our food, ate, and tried many different inventive ways of asking for the check when we realized that it was past 2am, more than two hours from when we’d arrived (LOL) - They were way understaffed. Poor waitress though, she was running around like mad.  When we arrived back at Becky’s house, Steven and I went inside and grabbed our stuff and everyone else took off to take other people home.   …*sigh* That was a really fun night despite the hotness and cramped-ness of the ballroom. For the record, I think my date (Mandy) looked beautiful and am really happy she invited me.  Side not: I saw a friend Hannah that I hadn't seen in... prolly more than 7 years... she got a picture with me but I forgot to get ond with her... should somehow get in touch with her and have her email it to me or something... Speaking of pictures, I'm prolly going to wait till I have some better pics (prolly scan of other people's and scans of the professional pics) before I post any... I don't have the camera with me and I didn't like the pictures I took.  I spent the next hour or so on the road taking Steven home, going home myself to get a belt (lol) and arriving at Cam’s house past 3:30am.  The first thing I noticed when I got to Cam’s house was the silhouette of someone with an AEG automatic weapon aimed out his window at my car, and the second thing I noticed was the automatic weapon firing rounds at my car … with very very good aim (or bad aim, depending on what he was aiming for… I’m assuming he was trying to hit  near  my car, but not actually  hit  my car. My only means of defense was my ½ million candle power spotlight, so a standoff was reached; every time they’d shoot at me, I’d blind them and every time I blinded them, they’d shoot at me (LOL) This only ended when Andrew called me and I told him to send Cam out to help my carry my bags up (lol).  We didn’t really do much, just talked till 5am then fell asleep. Cam woke me up at 9:45 but I didn’t actually get up until 10:15, right as Adri called me to see if I was coming to a tiny Baptist church three blocks from Becky’s house where Mr. Weber was preaching. He had told us last week that he was going to preach there and had tried to get as many people to come with him because the church was full of old people (LOL). So, we did and we highschoolers outnumbered the regulars two to one. When Weber was done preaching he called the 60+ year old “Frank No-So-Hotra” (LOL!!) up to give an announcement. Everyone applauded in hilarious agreement though when Weber proclaimed that Frank actually was hot. Man that guy’s so funny.  Later, I went back to Becky’s house to return her mom’s belt. (lol) Before I knocked or rang the doorbell Becky opened it and our entire converstation went as follows:  Her: Don’t *muffled, but it sounded close to “ring the doorbell”*. Me: Don’t ring the doorbell? Her: Yeah my mom’s sleeping. Me: Ok, see ‘yah. Her: Bye.
