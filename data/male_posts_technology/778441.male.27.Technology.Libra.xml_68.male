(for those, like me, who have a question mark inscribed over their faces on hearing about something called as a Rowan tree... let me clarify... it is supposed to be an Eurasian tree with orange-red berrylike fruits)   So... this mail further went on to list out a few features that characterize a fellow who has had the fortune  (or is that misfortune?!)  of falling off a Rowan tree! Read on...   ROWAN TREE (Sensitivity)  - full of charm, cheerful, gifted without egoism, likes to draw attention, loves life, motion, unrest, and even complications, is both dependent and independent, good taste, artistic, passionate, emotional, good company, does not forgive.  Hmmm...   Which tree did you fall off?! ;)  cheers!
