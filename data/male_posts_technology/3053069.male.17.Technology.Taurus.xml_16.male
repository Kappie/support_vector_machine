Plus the even better side of all of this was that it got me goin to a church and now i am closer to god than i ever have been. Thank the Lord. I mean it is awesome ow he worked in this. About 4 or 5 weeks ago i walk into WOW just goin to see what thoings were like. Within 5 min of that visit i had people asking m to do this and that. So i got involved and went to church often. This led to new strong christian friends who constantl reamind me of  God and is wonders. This made me keep walkin with him and day by day i gat closer to God.   Ok sorry if i bored you, but it was important to me and thats what i have thise thing for. Anywho! Tomarrow i am gion too the movies with Heather!! Cant wait!! See ya
