A very nice song!  I been super busy last week and of course I hope to be busy as well for the upcoming week. Seriously I am lagging behind in my studies ever since I started my new job. This upcoming week should be a week to catch up whatever I have Oh man!  I got myself a few toy! A thumb drive and a USB 10/100 port for work purposes. Actually I was comtemplating on the web cam and thumb drive so end up I got a 256 MB kingston thumbie at 63 bucks which was really worth it with 5 years warranty!  Most people should be watching the Euro 2004 FINALS! Oh god Oh god please forgive me for what I did! I know I know i should not do it but damn! I really cannot stop looking at Jacelyn Tay ultra big potrait at Rocher Rd and everywhere! First it was the this slimming health centre and now by Konica Minolta. I can drool till death of thirst.   I have been working non stop for last week. After a weekend mahjong session, i think it is time to come back to work and settle my studies. Let aim for higher later when I wake up.
