I know I need to work on this a lot.  God also does not want us to lie.  Well, that's a given.  But I can't think how many times I tell a little lie or over compensate the truth or hide the truth.  I pray that I will have the strength to stop this and have the spirit watch over my life and keep me in constant reminder that I have to watch what I say.
