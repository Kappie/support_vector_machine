So if you see spelling errors, blame Blogger - if I can afford a rich editor for IE5+ and NN for my web project using my personal credit card, then they can certainly afford one for here.  Anyway, didn't I promise an autobiography (or autobibliography as I so nicely put it before I edited it)?  I noticed that I can fill in a rather extensive biography in the tool that comes with blogger, so I'll do that instead.  Sort of pseudo entry for this evening.  Feel free to peruse my favorite books, movies, etc.  I'll try to find a 55K picture of myself on the web tomorrow that can serve as an avatar.
