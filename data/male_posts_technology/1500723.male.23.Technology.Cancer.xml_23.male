They will be sharp at 8:30 in any of the cases.. even durin the days of traffic near silkboard for flyover construction.    There was an accident in Garvebhavipalya.. But the problem with the people is that they crowd around the vehicle and stare at that as if some show is goin on.. That is the shit attitude which most of our Indians have. Why don't they stare after taking it off from the middle of the road. If you look at the amount of productivity wastage which will get converted into money.. Its shockin..  There can be easily around 10k people (considering infosys, siemens, wipro in electronic city) waiting there to get traffic cleared. I guess every one of them would have wasted atleast 1 hour of their time due to the traffic.. So its 10,000 man hours.. Which will get converted to around 15 lakhs rupees..   Just by moving the vehicle off the road if you could save 15 lakhs.. why don't they do that?????
