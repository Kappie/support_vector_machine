I am able to do a lot more during the day and I am less tired at the end of the day. I have the image of that muppet character  urlLink Scooter , the original orange geek! And I can't help wondering whether I look as geeky as I feel when I am 'scooting' down the street at four miles per hour.  But I realized there are three kinds of people:  1)  The people I know whose opinion I respect  -- these people will generally be supportive of the stuff I have to do;  2)  The people I know whose opinions I do not respect  -- these people will probably also be supportive (though I do not really care as much!  )  3)  The people I do not know  -- I honestly do not care at all what these people think. If I piss them off when I am crossing the street then I am happy to do it as the sort of person to be mad at handicapped pedestrians with the right of way deserve to be frustrated in as many aspects of their life as possible.  It does make things easier, and frankly I feel dumb for not just doing it sooner. But it takes time to accept the limitations under which one suffers. I should be glad that I am looking at it now rather than years from now!
