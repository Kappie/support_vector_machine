It痴 driven me before, and it seems to Have a vague, haunting mass appeal. But lately I am beginning to find that I should be the one behind the wheel.  Whatever tomorrow brings, I値l be there With open arms and open eyes, yeah. Whatever tomorrow brings, I値l be there, I値l be there  So if I decide to waiver my chance to be one of The hive Will I choose water over wine and hold my own And drive?  It痴 driven me before and it seems to be the way That everyone else gets around. But lately I知 beginning to find that When I drive myself My light is found.  Whatever tomorrow brings, I値l be there With open arms and open eyes, yeah. Whatever tomorrow brings, I値l be there, I値l be there  (Would you kill the Queen to crush the hive?)  Would you choose Water over wine Hold the wheel And drive?  Whatever tomorrow brings, I値l be there With open arms and open eyes, yeah. Whatever tomorrow brings, I値l be there, I値l be there   That's all I can think of tonight folks... I'm way too burned out... I want to crawl into a dark hole and sleep for a week. Or maybe die, that sounds better. Hmm... scratch that... Dying in and of itself seems rather pointless, but the property of being dead... Oh God I wish I could just be gone from here.
