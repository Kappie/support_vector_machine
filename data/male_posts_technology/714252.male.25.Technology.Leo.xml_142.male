Lets start with the main thing I've been doing.. Work!  So far everything is going MUCH better than I hoped dare.. We have pretty much hit our sales target for November ALREADY (Yes, 6 days into the month! Wh0ot!)  The company is officially registered and I have my company card!  urlLink Have a peek at the card!  Also got the Bank account all setup and we are about to send out our first invoices! Woohoo! All is good!!  Anyway, I have to go back to workin again but I'l try to post more later.
