(syempre yung MRT saka LRT lumiko. kase kung dumiretso yun, babangga and mamamatay kami... =)) i mean pumunta ako sa pedro gil. i burned copies of some old files and stuffs that i do need the following day. revoj told me punta daw kami sa wow philippines, mas maganda daw sa kesa roxas blvd. so punta kami afterwards pagkakain namin ng kikiam (nakakita naba kayo ng kikiam?) diretso kami sa wow and just like baregreenson said, maganda nga talaga. umm'.. ok naman. we drank few smb in cans and taho (yeah taho and smb) tapos revoj started to contemplate about her girls. hehe. well the usual thing, 2 timing and all that usual shit finding out na he's more likely "inlab" with the latter one rather than the original and syempre he needs to dump one in which he also doesn't want to feel the guilt na he'll be dumping the original because he's inlab with the latter... sabi niya: "pare siya talaga yung gusto ko, sya gusto ko mapangasawa". sabi ko: "tangna naman maliit kapa sinasabi mo nayan eh. besides, pag kayong dalawa na and may na meet ka na namang ibang girl and naging close kayo, sigurado kabang hindi mo na sasabihin ulit yan?" well i made him think about that. yun kase hirap minsan eh. di marunong makuntento, alam mong matutukso ka sa iba, bat kapa didiskarte. "in the game of seduction there is only one rule, never fall inlove." yan ang sabi sa cruel intentions, and it's true. meron pang isa. "we don't fall in love, we choose to be with it." ( sino ba nagsabi sakin non? umm... =) ) that's one good line. and it's also true... ( how i wish she also chooses to be with me. ;) )  nakaupo kami dun sa silya na kamukha nung inuupunan ni forest gump. bigla umambon, then umulan. syempre takbo kami. umm.. since it's almost 12 MN narin, we decided to go home. punta kami ng parking and found out. flat tire. so we waited for mins, umm'.. i think almost 30 mins. tapos tumila ng konti and i'm feeling tipsy narin because of 4 smb's tapos labas kami naka hubad, mga katabi namin sasakyan naka alis na lahat while we're there changing tire. freak.   few more minutes and we're ok. i arrived home 1 something. texted someone and fall asleep...    -fin-
