There was about 120 people there, not huge but enough for a good time. Some lovely young nurses as well, I think the lads were in hugs heaven. :D  I was going to tell you about the weekend before was well in Liverpool. It was mental, we had VIP passes and arranged for a limo to pick us up from the hotel. We had a tour of Liverpool drinking bubbly in the back  and doing the "stand out of the sunroof and wave to the crowds" thing. The concert itself was awesome, John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, with Eric Clapton.  The only annoying thing was we were the only people dancing in the entire stadium (second row from the front, too... nice) but the cameras loved us making an arse of ourselves, so hopefully it'll be on the DVD.. yay!  The night progress with a trip to the lovely "Angels" lapdancing bar and then finishing up at the only place open at 3am, a gay bar that didn't serve alcohol. (Not that it really mattered by this point)  So, in conclusion... Liverpool is actually a TOP place. Loads to do, really pretty city, clean and nice chicks all over the place (if you like that sort of thing)  Oh yeah... the new pool is finally open down on the front! Sure it's a bit small but it's only a fiver a swim! How will they make any money?
