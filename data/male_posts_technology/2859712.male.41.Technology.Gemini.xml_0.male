I understand it's unrealistic to expect post-surgical vision that's comparable to your best  corrected  vision before surgery, but that what I've got! Stars are particularly noticeable -- tiny one-dimensional points of light rather than the smallish smeary globs I had with my last glasses. And reading signs across a room -- amazing! I still have some nighttime fuzz around bright lights but nothing really that distracting, and it'll probably diminish as my corneas heal. Anyway it's no worse than nighttime vision with my contacts. I'm sure my outcome was helped by my being a good LASIK candidate: pupils not overly large, presbyopia not objectionable yet (not looking forward to that!), mild myopia (between -4 and -5 in both eyes), compatible corneal anatomy (not too thin). Also my surgeon went to great lengths to get a good prescription beforehand with pupils both normal and dilated, so the laser knew exactly what to do -- garbage in garbage out, just like computer programming. And as far as the procedure itself is concerned, after years of contact-wearing I'm not too squeamish about things getting close to my eyes.  So would I recommend it? I'd do it again for sure, but not everyone is willing to take chances with their eyes. As I read somewhere, the risks exist, and if you're a borderline candidate eye surgery isn't the way to find out if you're lucky. Expectations are important: Don't expect to never wear glasses again (I got some WalMart reading glasses to see close-up while shaving), expect some discomfort during the procedure and afterward (moderately dry eyes are my biggest problem, but it should get better), be aware of the risks (the web has lots of sites where people with bad outcomes describe their ordeals, but lots of good stuff, too). I know I'm satisfied so far!
