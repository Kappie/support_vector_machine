I don't know what to say about these type of performances on the reservation with major headlining artists such as Soulfly or any other "big named" bands. Personally I don't think they should have these types of events on the reservation...should stick with LOCAL acts only. Mainly because the lil towns in which they have these events are small, not enough audiences (unless of course it is known that there will be a huge audience). Peeps have to come from distance towns just to see these acts (three hours for us). I feel major artists should stick with cities or bigger towns, just because they have the numbers to fill venues, etc. That's just my opinion. Well I had no feelings whatsoever about what had happened. My thoughts were "I'll see them in the future." And despite what others feel/think about Soulfly (out of those who witnessed what happened), I still think they are a great band and will continue to enjoy their music. Oh, and at least I got half of my money back :P  While we were there, we ran into Hear Lies Treachery and Swell Chemistry. What's cool about running into them was....well at first I recognized the natives in the group...I was like "hey, you’re *insert band name here*" for both bands...and the entire band turns around and are...heck, helluva cool, shaking hands and talkative...unlike other bands where your like "hey, you’re..." and only one of the members turns and are like "hey." So yea, that was cool. I think both performed a great set...better than the rest I think. There's a lot more to mention about this event...but I won't go into details.  I'm thinking of adding music to my blog..but I don't know of any host sites where I can convert MP3s to .wav files. There are probably simpler ways to do this...I know there are peeps who view this blog of mine...and I guess right now I'm asking for help from whoever reads this blog and knows a bit more about what I'm trying to do here. Email details to jkd_johnson@yahoo.com. I don't have much else to say...I should post this entry now, and work on putting music on this thing.
