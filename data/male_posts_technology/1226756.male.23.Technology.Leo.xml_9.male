I registered a new domain just the other day.  urlLink www.linuxboxonline.net  I'm working on a new site, and as you might imagine, it will be about Linux. All the while I'm trying to teach myself Linux, and how to set up a server. This server will host preferably: DNS, DHCP, Mail, Web, News... I need to find a place to put the server, because I just checked with our supplier, and I live 150meters to far from the junction box. No DSL available. That's a bi**h. Anyway, I hope to get this working soon. Testing out on my home network first. Using Slackware 9.0 with standard 2.4.20 kernel. I'll have to upgrade to 2.6 kernel. Just have to learn how to do that first. If anyone reads this, and knows of a good tutorial online, or a book... Be my guest and  urlLink mail me
