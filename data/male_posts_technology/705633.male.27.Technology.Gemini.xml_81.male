Working your way through a cocktail list is not good for your sense of balance. 2.  Dancing on a stage in front of three thousand people with a pair of glow sticks brings out an enormous sense of well-being. 3.  I want a jet ski for Christmas. 4.  American college lads have all the subtlety and stealth of an earthquake when it comes to picking up girls. 5.  Mexicans are generally polite, helpful and have a good sense of humour. However, customs officers are complete wankers. 6.  Hell is being stuck on a boat in a rough sea, throwing your ring up over the side and having your buddy laugh and take photos... 7.  ... or a nine hour flight with Airtours in 'scum-bag' class, the only film being shown is "The Little Vampire". 8.  Doing back flips off the ceiling rails in a bus is fun, but hurts your shoulders. 9.  Hot pants are a privilege, not a right. 10.  Don't trust dolphins.  They tell you what you want to hear, get you to caress their blowhole and you never hear from them again.
