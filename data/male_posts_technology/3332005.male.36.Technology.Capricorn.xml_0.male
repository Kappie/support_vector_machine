Managing and sustaining this growth is of the upmost importance, but how to do it and be able to manage customer expectations  etc..?  You can force greater responsibility on your field sales team, getting them more and more involved in the sales handover, producing a bit of a  project plan, managing the customer after the sale. This in my view is a problem. Salesmen that do exactly what they say on the tin (Close Business) are, in my opinion, not even slightly interested in any kind of admin work, and the last thing we need is a de-motivated successful salesman. Give them opportunities, opportunities, opportunities!  Therefore we're going to create a formal Sales Administration role, a job function which has been informally done by a number of people, but now the number of orders is reaching  a point where someone needs to own that role and take responsibility for it (While also working to do the sales related tasks not really admired by our besuited sales execs).  On a more interesting note, a trip to the Cinema last night was a great evening - Van Helsing - totally over the top horror flick, which didn't take itself too seriously - great fun and thoroughly recommended if you're into that kind of thing.
