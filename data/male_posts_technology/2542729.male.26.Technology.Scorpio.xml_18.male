That is, unless that cocksucker Bush shows up to give another of his famous "pep talks". I already can't stand the military under his leadership...wasn't too excited about it before then, but at least everything was kosher. Rabid prick has done everything I figured he would do at this point in his term...the economy is in the crapper, we're at war in Iraq, and everythings on fire. Usually I could say "oh well, blah blah blah...whatever" but its not that kinda party. I'm going to the land of the lost with a bunch of misfit drill mates that, for 98% of them, I wouldnt trust to wash my invisible car!  I'm going to miss all of you's guys, especially, my mom, my nephews, my best friend Jon, and my other homeboys Laurence  Dewitt...but I think the person I will miss the most is a woman that i've never met. A woman that for all inclusive purposes only lives in theory. A living dream that breathes and walks among the living...ill miss you miss Nikki...you're my dream come true, and I pray that God will continue to bless you always. He loves you  so do I!!! YEAY NIKKI!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Now for the 6:51 news...  In local news, vagrant son Ronald Stevenson, Jr. finalizes preparations to join with his unit tomorrow as they complete preparations for their stint in Iraq. When asked about his feelings on the matter, he could not be reached for comment because he's packing...sheesh...  In economic news, a powerful conglomerate has seized hold of evercare industries, which explains why nobody cares about each other anymore...  In domestic news, most of America is still broke...  In international news, we still have Saddam Hussein...  In entertainment news, Kelly Clarkson finished second place in the World Idol competition. Much to her delight, current American champion Ruben Studdard ate the rest of the contestants shortly after the proceedings...  That's the news for now, tune in later for Dave Attels Confessions of a Backyard Wimp!
