Of course, you can't do a background check exclusively on a car -- you have to be doing it on the driver as well. So I am being investigated by one of the country's most powerful companies AT THIS VERY MOMENT.  I find myself sitting up straighter in my chair, and I am a bit ashamed of my messy office workspace. I hope they can overlook that in deciding if they want to grant me car and home insurance...
