I had to fight for months to get my £7 lego landrover and boat from Michael Parrish's on Sheilds Road...  Bah! Kids these days don't know they're born....!    EDIT : I had one of  urlLink these  and I also just found  urlLink Torture devices   throughout history recreated from Lego! Can't find a decent "Old Lego sets" archive that has all the ones I used to have as a kid.. but I'll keep looking!
