Also, it could put me to sleep and I am pretty sure they frown upon sleeping at your desk here. Let's see what is going on ...   Oh, my friend A told me that my friend L hurt his brand new car on the highway the other day. Apparently he hit something like a jersey dam and messed up the front of his car. Now, I am not saying he is a dumbass, he truly does have some potential. L is fucking it all up though, because he is a pothead. I don't have anything against pot. I have have never really smoked it myself, and how can you really knock something (that isn't dangerous) that you haven't tried? In L's case however it makes him the most unmotivated person. He doesn't seem to have any hopes and dreams in particular, unless counting smoking the most bomb ass weed a goal. I guess to make in in life we need goals right? I measure myself against what I would like to be and try to make it happen. I wonder if L is happy... He seems happy whenever I would see him. Although I don't see him much anymore, he was also someone who lied a lot. It used to be a joke that we would roll him up after he died and smoke him since a lot of his blood should probably have THC crystals floating around in it. He doesn't really call me anymore, and I don't really call him either. I guess my group of friends just kind of floated away from him. It is kind of sad really. He hangs out with A's brother, who is a couple years younger than us. He started working at the same place as A's brother. A boat shop, and he has never been interested in boating that I have seen.    I am not sure if I should be analyzing one of my pothead friends when I have lots of other stuff I could be writing about. I am not even qualified, but I guess it doesn't matter since this is just a weblog that very little people will see (probably... I won't rule out future stardom!).  It seems, that me and my other friends have observed, that L will latch onto someone that he wants to hang out with. I would say that he idolizes them. He will hang out with them as much as possible. They will sometimes get sick of him, since he will bring the bad habits of the world to their doorstep. This seems strange to say, but I guess coming to your house in the morning for wake-n-bake is the worst I can think of right now. I guess their are much much worse things than the art of de-motivation. He never hangs out with girls that much so Mary Jane is his main thang. An amusing enigma of a person... a wookie, if you will... for your perusal.
