Take Galatians 2:20:    I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.    Where does this passage say that we must "stay connected" to God in order to have Christ live in us?  Where is the command to pray and meditate?  Where is any command in this passage?    Christians have a difficult time telling the difference between the indicative and the imperative: the statement of fact and the command.  Call it the Pharisee in all of us.  But there is no command here, it is a statement of truth.  There is no effort involved in being crucified to the world.  That happened 2000 years ago for us.  There is also no effort involved in having Christ live in me.  That happens by grace through faith.
