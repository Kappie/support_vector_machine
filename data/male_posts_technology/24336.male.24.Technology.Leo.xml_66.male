Even though current research has not come up with hard proof, all of these anti-bacterial soaps/cleansers/sheets/door knobs  are going to eventually create resistant bacteria.  It is a proven fact that all of the genetic testing on bacteria has created a few monsters, but they were controlled.  Having triclosan and the other antibacteria products being used by the ton each day everywhere is not a closed environment.
