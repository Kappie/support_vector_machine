I hate computers so much - having done a degree in computer science and now working as a software developer, I have used them so much that I really can't stand the things anymore. But at the same time, much as I dislike them, I find myself using them constantly - much as I try to deny it, I guess there is still a bit of a geek in me somewhere.       Anyway, enough of me trying to make excuses about why I made this blog. I wanted this to be somewhere that I can just pour myself out to without worrying about people seeing it - if they see it, they see it  if they don't, well, obviously, they don't.
