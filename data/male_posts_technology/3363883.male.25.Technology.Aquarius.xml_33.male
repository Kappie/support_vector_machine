Through talking with people and sharing the songs that we cough-cough made backups of, from our orginals, I have now a range of music that will hopefully be able to cope with almost any party situation.  But I'm struggling for the last one hundred songs to be able to crack the two ton.  I'm sure something will come up.  If anyone has any suggestions of any music that would be great.  Before you write however, NO I do not want decent Chinese Card Music nor stuff from Cannibal Corpse.  Anything more chilled out is definately required.  I'm managed to come across a couple of bands recently that are very VERY cool and relaxed.  If anyone has a chance to listen to Tryo - Acoustic Reggae, definately take it.  It's a french band that is all about acoustic guitars and sweet harmonics.  Pretty mad.  I've also come across Manu Chao.  A french guy who went to Cuba and fell in love with the place and stayed.  Again, no english songs, but this is all about the rhythm.  Wicked for any tropical evenings you may want to have.  I got around to playing my first game of football yesterday with my new boots.  The verdict?  Both my cheeks are sore [fortunately not swollen].  I took two tumbles and manage to fall on a different cheek each time.  If you saw me walking, it's like I'm imitating a giraffe going for a drink.  Falling on astroturf is similar to falling on concrete but with less sand.  Nothing like sand in your vicous scrapes.  But that's okay, the girls swoon when I say I picked these scars from Charlie in Vietnam.  Still, I could actually keep up with people.  Oh I'm still crap at the game but at least it's more like a game of football and less like pinball with me sliding everywhere.  My sleep is still pretty bad at the moment.  i'm trying to do a bit of exercise at night so I can just collapse into bed and not dream.  It seems to be working with me only a waking up a couple of times during the night.  Whoever thought being drug free would cause so much hassle :- ).  I hope to try and not drink this weekend.  I haven't got any plans [as a trip to Normandy recently fell through].  So I might come into work and get some extra cash instead.  I have some more extensive travel plans coming up and I think the cash will be well needed for this.  When I've booked this, I'll let you all know.
