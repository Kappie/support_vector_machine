I truly believe this is a great idea and it’s time to look at moving to this type of system. It will save wear and tear on our roads and will result in significant savings to our residents.   While the plan that was brought before Council is a relatively good one, it has several flaws that forced me to vote no.  First and foremost is that the plan does not take into consideration the needs of low income families and our seniors. District 4, which I represent, is home to a large contingent of low to moderate income families and many, many seniors.  Prior to the vote on the single hauler issue, I was contacted by numerous residents that don’t even have trash service and would end up paying for the single hauler even though they don’t use the service. Many of the seniors that I talked to only generate about one bag of trash per week. Their neighbors usually just throw that one bag of trash in with their own as a neighborly gesture, others pay their neighbors a small token and some have their children or other family members take care of it.  With the current plan, there is no way to opt out of the contract. Low-income families, seniors, families that are only here for part of the year and business owners that use their business trash are forced to pay for a service they currently do not use.  The second issue is that of accountability. What happens if I have issues with the hauler that has been chosen to service the city? As it stands, if I have an issue with my current hauler, I can tell them to go jump in a lake and can call someone else. With the single hauler plan, I have to call the city and file a complaint. The hauler has to respond to the complaint and while there is a fine that can be imposed on the hauler, the current plan has no definition of who will impose the fine and who decides that the hauler will be fined. Either way, it still doesn’t resolve my issue. I have to wait until many more residents call and complain before the hauler is removed or real action gets taken.  I have proposed a volunteer system that would allow the City to test drive this plan for one year. This gives the hauler an opportunity to show what they can do and it shows the residents how much can be saved and how the system works.  The volunteer system is very simple. The city would send out a letter to every household offering them the opportunity to sign up for the volunteer service. Once the sign up period is over, the city would go to each hauler and ask them to bid on the contract and the contract would be awarded to the lowest bidder.  The remaining features of the plan would then remain in tact. Of course the people participating in the volunteer plan probably won’t gat as large of a discount, but any savings are better than none right? This would still allow the residents that are not sure of the plan to contract with their choice of haulers and would allow the residents that want to utilize the single hauler the opportunity to save. After the first year, the plan could then be reviewed by the Council and any bugs or tweaks that needed to be made could be done to make it a plan that all residents would be happy to participate in.  Unfortunately, the issue may not be looked at since a few Council Members are sour about this proposal being defeated. I can only hope that those championing this idea will look at the alternatives that were presented and agree to continue working on with the issue.
