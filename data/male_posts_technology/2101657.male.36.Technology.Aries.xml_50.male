We left the 27th at 11:45, and after picking up a few items we needed, we headed out to Camp C.S Klaus, located just outside of Coalsburg, Ia.      We arrived at camp, for our check-in time at 1:45. The Scouts all took their back-packs out of our Troops trailer, and we then proceeded to hike the 3 quarters of a mile to our campsite.  We were staying in Owl Hoot.  Got camp setup and everything organized. That evening we had our Council Camp Fire with all 7 troops present and the Camp Staff as well.  We got about 3/4's of the way through, before the sprinkles we'd had off/on all afternoon, turned into a steady rain. We stopped the fire, and then started heading back to our camp-site.  By the time we got there the rain was coming down heavily, and we were soaked from the knees down (we had poncho's on).   On Monday the boys started working on their merit badge courses, and our 4 1st year scouts started on their "Adventure Trail", where they were working on 3 different merit badges (Swimming, Basketry, and Indian Lore).   On Sunday all the scouts who wanted to use the water, had to get pass their swim test. There are 3 levels, White, Red, and Blue (being the highest and needed to work on the Swimming Merit Badge).  My son just got his white on Sunday, and then Monday took the test and passed for the Red Swimmer.  Tuesday he took his Blue and passed. That took swimming 4 25m laps, with the last lap a backstroke of some sort, and then a 5-10 second float on his back.  He had a cheering section going by the time he finished.  It's a big accomplishment when your 11, and you take a swim test that has you swim the length of a foot ball field. Way to go!!  We had some activities that night, on a troop level, that started off with a tug-of-war.  It  was quite hilarious actually. When we walked up, 2 groups were already going, and the 1st boy in the water (they dug a pit and filled it with water, making it a very muddy mess), did a dive, just like you'd see on Most Extreme Challenge off Spike TV. If we had had a camcorder, we could of won money on those home video shows, it was that funny.  By the time it was done, the same boy had ended up in the water 3 times.  They had a few other actives, like a team getting their members over a rope 4ft off the  ground, w/o touching the rope.  I was busy with the camera trying to get some decent pics of it as it was going on.  There was some other actives involving boards and ropes and carrying team-members around.  When we were done, we then made the almost 1mile hike back to our site.  The oldest son also had his first attempt at shooting a 22cal rifle and had a blast literally.  I'll have to take him out so he can practice for next summer as he now wants to take the Rifle Merit badge (along with Archery).  Wednesday was a bit of a challenge for him, as I think the long days were starting to get to him. The 1st years had to go on a 3 mile hike (1.5miles one way). He got back and was almost wiped from that, then had to go down and work as a server at our table.  I helped the 1st years with their waiter duties, as there was nobody there to tell them all what they had to do.  Then the 1st years headed down to the parade grounds for an evening of games and activities.  Oldest son decided he did NOT want to stay down there for the "sleep under the stars" camp out, and came back to the camp-site about 9:45.   Thursday was supposed to have the 1st years start out with a "Polar Bear" swim, which he didn't want to do either.  He was getting a little homesick by this point as he had cried some on Wednesday night before bed, and Thursday morning.  Thursday he had a better time of it, as he had another chance in Field sports to shoot the rifles and the Archery range again.   We then spent 2hrs down at Aquatics (the beach) for the Water Follies, a bunch of fun events that involved water.  One of the best practical jokes of the week went on at this event, and I'm sure will go down in the annals of Klaus folk lore.  I won’t describe it here, in an attempt to protect the not-so-innocent lol  We also had family night that night, so about 5pm families started to show up, and the scouts could take them around camp to show it off and some of the activities they had done.  Since it was Family Night, I got to walk around with my Son, just the two of us.  We went over to the Water Falls, which were just perfectly lit, and looked awesome.  We went over and watched the demo from the fire truck, and had something to eat.  Then it was time to head up for the Council Fire, which was pretty neat. It got just AWESOME when they started the tap out ceremony for the Order of the Arrow.  I won't even try to describe how incredible it was, just imagine a Pow-Wow drum going, torches, and people dancing and throwing said fire torches.  It had to be the kewlest ceremony I've seen in Scouting yet. After that was done, we headed back to our camp-site to put an end to our night.  The only mishap of the week happened about 3:36am that night, when my son decided to roll a little too far to his right on his bunk, and rolled out of the tent.  The tents, are Boy Scout type tents, which are on raised wooden platforms, 2 poles holding the center up, with a beam between them.  My son’s side of the tent was about 2ft off the ground, and his bunk added another foot and a half to that. I heard him fall, and jumped out of bed, and with flash-light in hand, leaned over his bunk and looked out the side of the tent. Sure enough, there he was on the ground in his sleeping back, sitting up wondering what had just happened. He only really remembers the “whoosh” of the air going by him as he fell.  I told him to climb back up into the tent, and he looked like an inch-worm in his sleeping bag as he did it.  He fell asleep almost as fast as he had fallen out of bed.  It took me another 45 minutes to fall back asleep after that.  I did listen to the Owls hooting away though as I waited.  Friday the Scouts got to put finishing touches on any Merit Badges they hadn't finished yet. My son got his Indian Lore and Basketry badges finished up, and some of his Swimming done as well.  2 out of three ain't bad!  It was also a chance for me to perform the practical joke that I'd had planned for the week.  We had 3 boys who pulled a joke on a leader and shouldn't have gone into his tent. So....I enlisted some help, and I put their cots on the roof of the latrine. It worked out very nicely. Even have pictures of the not-so-innocent helping me do it.  All 3 Scouts took it extremely well, and we helped them pull their stuff down after it was done. By evening, we got ready for our last Council fire, were each troop had to put on a Skit and do a cheer.  Our Skit was so long we didn't do a cheer.  It was BY FAR the best skit of the evening. We did "The Wizard of Klaus", and it was hilarious.  I got to be the Wizard due to being able to do a deep voice that projected so the audience could hear.  We headed back to our camp site to finish up our packing (we pull all other stuff that we didn't want to haul-out on our hike out, back in the troop trailer), and then hit the sack. We got up at 6:10, so we could get ready, and have our Camp Site cleared out and signed off by 6:45am. We then hiked down the hill to the dinning hall for a quick cinnamon roll and milk, before going down to the parade grounds, were we threw our packs into the trailer, divvied up the Scouts between the cars, and then made our 40minute drive back to Dubuque.   We then proceeded to divvy our gear back up into our respective vehicles and headed home.  It was an incredible week, very tiring, but we had an awesome time.   The leaders who stayed all week, at the last Council fire, were even presented with a Mini-Multi tool that say "stayed all week leader, Camp C.S.Klaus" which I thought was nice.  But what was nicer?  Getting to spend the week there with my Son, having a great time, and getting to sleep again in my own bed.  We can't wait until next year! Is it 2005 yet?
