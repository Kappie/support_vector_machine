Today I had 4 smokes.  Not bad.  We'll see how this plan holds up.  I will keep track with the blog so I can see for myself that this plan is working.  Chicago Auto Show this weekend.  I just want to sit back down in my Infiniti G35 Sports Coupe and preview what I will be driving in a couple of years, hopefully.  If anything, I just want to spend time with Meghan.  I can't wait.  Well I hope everyone will have a nice weekend.  Cya.
