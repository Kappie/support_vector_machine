How many times have you been running late for some event and you pull up behind that one driver who for their own purposes, determines that you're too close to their bumper? So they pull a Gregory Hines on the brake causing you to slow down just below the speed limit and as soon as you think they're gonna catch back up with the flow of traffic, they hit it again, and again. Finally you get the scarce opportunity to pass, just to find miles of empty lane in front of them causing you to wonder, "Why the h*ck is this happening to me?"
