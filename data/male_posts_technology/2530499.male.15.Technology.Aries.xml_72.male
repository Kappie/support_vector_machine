Yesterday was my birthday, as my two  lovely  companions have informed you, and I'd like to give you a brief rundown of what happened. Also, if you could, please tell me whether or not I'm just being selfish, because even saying this just feels wrong.  So, yesterday began with me being woken up and dragged to  Women Supporting Women , a church group that my mom started, so that I could babysit. The meeting started at nine AM, and that required me being up at eight. So, we get there, and,  Horror of all Horrors , no kids showed up. So, I sat, amusing myself with several assorted childrens books until about ten-thirty when we had to drive to Loveland to bowl. (Shut up, I never said that I had a life.)  So I went, bowled fairly well, and got good and embarrassed when Mum had my name flashed across all twenty-six screens and came down and gave me a rose and some balloons. Jack Oxten, the pervy jackass on the next lane politely, and very loudly, informed me that I'd reached the age of consent. Go me. Ew. Anywho re , we went to the mall afterward, visiting the huge Sidewalk Sale that was going on, and I bought  Dancing In My Nuddy Pants  and read it in a night. See? Told you I had no life. So, after wandering aimlessly for a few hours, we haded home, where I got to see the two birthday hacks from my chums, and a few, or a lot, hearty "HAPPY BIRTHDAYs!" That was nice. Pity that it only happens once a year.   So then, I went to babysit the brats at around six, thinking that it'd be an early night and I'd be home by nine. But alas,  non , I was stuck there until one in the morning. How long does it take to go to dinner? Ah well. So, I came home, drowsy as all hell, and went to bed. And...erm...huzzah. That was my birthday. No presents to speak of, minus a Plato's Closet giftcard and the knowledge that I  would've  gotten a cellphone, but mum's not sure whether or not we're moving, and there's some kind of penalty (penal. Heehee!) for breaking the first year's contract. *Le sigh* Oh well. I'm not complaining that there wasn't much, just that it's over, and I can't look forward to being treated like a princess until my sweet sixteen in 364 more days. Bah. Not crying about that. Not, not, not! It was a nice birthday. Really. I'm just a spoiled brat and wanted something special. It's more than other kids get, right?  Pardon me, I've just disgusted myself. I'm off to skulk somewhere and tell myself to get a grip, because this is the stupidest thing I've ever gotten down about. Ever. I love you all, and hope you have a fabulous January 18th.    Because The World Needs Selfish Whiners...
