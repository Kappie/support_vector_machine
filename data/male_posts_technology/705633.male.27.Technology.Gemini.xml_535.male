If you haven't been down already and slopped around on one of the beds, watching a movie on the plasma screens and chilling out with the cooooool, oh so funky decor then get your bony butt down there. It rules! Off to London this weekend with my girl, so have a blast folks!    Here's an email from my buddy Tim for all you lovely people...    Dear all  urlLink http://www.jerseyskydive.com/  If you or any friends/colleagues fancy doing something a bit different......................see above! Tandems are £200 or £250 if you want a video of yourself  laughing/crying/white as a sheet. For that you get to be scared senseless and love it!  58 seconds of freefall followed by a nice gentle glide into the beach at the gunsite.   Well, hopefully not so much 'into' as 'on to'!!!!!!!! Drop me a line and I will sort you out with the forms. P.S. I can organise any life cover needed before the jump. Hee Hee.  urlLink Tim the lemming.
