(會不會差太多)  游泳完吃蒸餃, 吃完正在想要怎麼回家, 她就打來, 人在 ATT, 剛好凱文要載我到國父紀念館, 下車以後我就走過去找她.  She's still as stunningly beautiful as always...... oh, well...  Take her home, after shopping.  For some reason, she seems tired.  And no motivation to shop,... that's a first.......  Then I asked Jamie to pick me up and take me home, for that I have to hand him daphy's notebook.  That's probably the longest I've ever talk to Jamie...  By the way, don't buy any new BMW or Mercedes in Taiwan.  They are fake...  That's... what I've learned from him today...  Taiwan dealer always (eh... or sometimes), buy 2nd-hand cars and they fix the dashboard and repair the car to make it look like new, and then sell it like new (of course).  That's... well... that's that...  其實在台灣買的起那些新車的人也不在乎一點修車的冤枉錢吧, 這倒是另一件事ㄌ.  總之, 今天雖然好累好累, 卻是很充實的一天~  (每天都繼續這樣充實下去吧~~~)  p.s. 小龜的網路還沒修好~
