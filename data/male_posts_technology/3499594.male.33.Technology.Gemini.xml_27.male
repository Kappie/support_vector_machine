Amazing the attention span of kids now-a-days are about the size of nats.   The last parent picked the last kid up around 9:30 a.m. and stayed around for about 40 minutes. Once she split, while her child was whining about the shoes not being comfortable, we made a list for me to run errands. I had to take a couple things back from Walgreens and Walmart plus pick up some last minute items.   We managed to keep the kids awake till early evening and we all went to bed early. I took some Nyquil which kicked my butt. I was out before 9 p.m. The kids were out about 6 minutes after they hit the bed which was actually a few before 8 p.m.   It just hit 1 a.m. here and I am finished with my on-call phone call for the night. The new hospital OPUS ( a operating vendor ) was down and finally came up and operational. My on-call ends in the morning, about 8 hours from now. Man I can't wait. I been on-call since last Saturday and I am ready to give it to someone else. I also start vacation as of Sunday morning as well. Technically its Monday, but since I am off call Sunday, I am calling it then.  While I was waiting for OPUS to call me back (after I paged them ) initially, I found myself reading other people blogs again. I guess I am officially hooked on other peoples lives. Geez, I thought my wife was bad watching 'E-Entertainment'. Oh well, guess there could be worse things in life.  Guess, I been my office long enough, my boy just came in about 1:10 a.m. to tell me the movies over. Yeah, been over buddy. He wanted some water. Poor guy, my wife and I let the kids watch a movie at bedtime tonight since they both were exhausted. They crashed hard, now after 1 a.m he lets me know the movie was over. heh heh   I better get back to bed, gotta long drive in the morning.
