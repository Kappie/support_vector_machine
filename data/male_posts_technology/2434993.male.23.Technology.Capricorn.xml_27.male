We continue to find fault with that person.  The person too responds negatively to our negative thoughts.  And so there is no hope of creating a positive relationship.   Solution: When something goes wrong in any relationship, the first thing I need to do is to keep my mind calm and cool.  When I do this, I will not be caught up with the negativity of the situation or the negative trait of the person at that time, but I will be able to see something beautiful in that person. I will be able to appreciate and connect to the uniqueness of that person, thus creating space for rebuilding that relationship.
