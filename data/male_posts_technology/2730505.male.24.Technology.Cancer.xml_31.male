From the  urlLink Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary   Main Entry: love  Function: noun Etymology: Middle English, from Old English lufu; akin to Old High German luba love, Old English lEof dear, Latin lubEre, libEre to please 1 a (1) : strong affection for another arising out of kinship or personal ties   (2) : attraction based on sexual desire : affection and tenderness felt by lovers (3) : affection based on admiration, benevolence, or common interests   b : an assurance of love   2 : warm attachment, enthusiasm, or devotion   3 a : the object of attachment, devotion, or admiration   b (1) : a beloved person : DARLING -- often used as a term of endearment (2) British -- used as an informal term of address 4 a : unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another: as (1) : the fatherly concern of God for humankind (2) : brotherly concern for others b : a person's adoration of God 5 : a god or personification of love 6 : an amorous episode : LOVE AFFAIR 7 : the sexual embrace : COPULATION 8 : a score of zero (as in tennis) 9 capitalized, Christian Science : GOD - at love : holding one's opponent scoreless in tennis - in love : inspired by affection   Sounds so "academic"  It doesn't really define what the hell love is.  More...random thoughts.....  Some attributes that are related to love  Trust: People talk about how they aren't afraid that their significant other would cheat on them, because they trust them. Whether that is a consequence or cause of love, I don't know.  What bout the thought of your significant other meeting someone else?  Is that trust or fear or losing?  Is that a part of love?  Faith: I don't know how related this is to trust, but there seems to be a subtle distinction lurking around someplace. I think that trust is the knowledge that the person you love won't let you down, while faith is trust that the person you love is a good, worthy person.   Devotion: I don't think this is a difficult concept to grasp. I don't think that love (or true friendship, for that matter) can be a selfish state. When you love somebody, you are making a sacrifice. You are abandoning some part of your selfishness and forming a bond with another. If that bond is to be true, you have to give yourself to that person. You can't just live for your own needs and wants any more. The word "devotion" comes from "devote." To devote something to a cause is to allocate resources (time, energy, emotions, money etc) to that cause.  Vulnerability: People who are in love exist in a fragile state. It means exposing one's heart to another.  It truly is a difficult thing to do, that is why We don't do that for everybody, I don't think.  I think that love's vulnerability is related very closely to trust. We are safer revealing embarrassing aspects of our lives to close friends and people we love because we trust those people, and don't expect them to betray our trust -- either unintentionally or otherwise.  RICHARD BERANEK 11/27/96   Love is an intangible, an emotion - yet so much more. To be given freely in large quantity for in doing so, it is returned in even more abundance. Love is of self; for without having such personal concern, love of another is weak and fragile at its very best. Love is a special caring. A concern expressed for another extended beyond self need when necessary. Love is gentle, wishing and doing no harm. The kiss of sunshine, touch of a cloud, expecting nothing in return of that touch. Love is an evolution, ever changing, growing, a learning process for the positive. Love is freedom for each person to be an individual yet allowing integration into a single spirit more powerful than the sum of each. Love is lasting with strength to endure the difficult. A willingness, wanting to overcome, to be ever better and stronger. It is a commitment of hearts, one that can exist forever, even when not together. Love is beautiful from within and between. It is a radiance of light and warmth for all to see.  Love is to be....... given received shared    MARV HUNDLEY 09/21/96  Love is being happy for the other person when they are happy, being sad for the other person when they are sad, being, together in good times and being together in bad times...

Is feeling important, accepted, wanted, cared about, understood, cherished and everything else that is wonderful and good in the world mean that you are loved?  If you feel the same way for the other person, does that mean you love them?  When you feel loved, everything seems wonderful and beautiful and you feel invigorated.  You are more thoughtful, you're inspired, happy.  Does love cloud your perception of things?  Love is what makes you smile even when you're tired -Terri age 4  It's unfortunate that the word Love has been used so often and in so many contexts that it has become almost meaningless.  Isn't it great to hear it from the heart with the spirit, if you may, of the word is felt.  When you hear the phrase and it is loaded with all the emotions that would take too long to tell someone it feels good.  WIth that said, is saying "I Love You" a cop out?  A time saver?  When is it appropriate to tell someone that you love them?  In the morning before going to work when you tell your loved one "I LOVE YOU" is that meaningful?  What about when there's the two minute phone call, when the couple get off the phone and say "I Love You" do they really mean it?  Is it appropriate?  When you say I LOVE YOU can it mean everything and anything?  Should it?  An all encopassing expression for all nice and wonderfull in the world no matter how insignificant along with the deep emotions that mean -the- world?  Is the phrase that flexible and vesatile or should it be saved only for "special occasions" and only when you really mean it?  Loving is not always easy. Some times it is a bit of work. And most importantly, love is not a feeling, it's not a flutter of the heart, or a light-headedness or any of that. it is a deeply held state of mind.  True love is hard to acheive.  You have to get past the fears rejection, of failure, thoughts that they will run away to another or go back to someone.  I think that love starts out small and it grows to True Love.  That takes some time   Sometimes people "sacrifice" things for love.  Though romantic, this isn't always true.  Sometimes people sacrifice shit just because of guilt.  It's no sacrifice to do anything for someone who's worthy of love. A blood relation or a wedding ring doesn't instantly make them worthy, however. It's an ongoing process of change and discovery. Calls for understanding and like-mindedness. Calls for an appropriate give and take.  There is no sacrifice in love. When acting out from love there can be no loss or gain. Love is a constant. It energy so pure and alive that it obliterates everything else. Love is the highest and most basic reason for existence.  It can be beamed out of your being forever without ever draining the source.  Does Love stop?  As long as you love someone, it isn't going to stop unless they betray your love (trust, faith, devotion, vulnerability etc.).  Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.        1 Corinthians 13:5-7  I don't know where I was going with this.  I guess since it was the topic of discussion last night I couldn't stop thinking about it.  What I said last night still stands.  It hasn't changed.
