Similar to its 2MP mini camera cousin Cybershot DSC-U50   the swivel lens is great for making photos of yourself.   The lens is a Zeiss(R) Vario Tessar(R) with 3X optical zoom that can rotate 300 degrees. The camera has a 1.8-inch LCD screen. The F88 takes both the Memory Stick(R)and Memory Stick PRO(TM) memory cards.   It will be interesting to see if the red and blue versions will make it outside of Japan. The US press-release only shows the silver one.  The Black Cybershot DSC-T1   is for instance only available in Japan.   The DSC-F88 will be available in July for $450 MSRP.
