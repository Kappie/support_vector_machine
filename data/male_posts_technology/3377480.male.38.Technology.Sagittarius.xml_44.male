Heat index of around 100 when we started late in the afternoon, early evening.  we have 8 feet left to go.  we can get 4 foot done today and 4 foot done tomorrow.  even with the heat index of over 100.  Friday evening will be spent cleaning up the bottom, (it still has mud and dirt in the deep end from the rain last week)  clean up sides, finish electrical and plumbing.  will either put the liner in sat or sunday, more than likely saturday afternoon. will spend sat am finallizing the cleaning and getting ready.  still have along way to go, after the liner is in, have to get all the forms built for the deck, that includes getting another 10 yards of sand, and 10 yards of dirt to level everything with the top of the pool.  Once the deck forms are done, i call for another inspection.  they inspect bond wire/electrical at that one.  when that passes we can start pooring the concret decking.   We will have to pour approximatly 525 sq. foot of decking.  that will take some weekends!  we are doing exposed aggregate.   i found a guy that did it himself and posted the how to on the web.   urlLink  link to how to on concrete
