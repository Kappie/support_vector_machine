In MOF's world, this is because it has zero visibility outside of the OMG. This is probably why some ISO people have started  urlLink trying to do the same thing over again , despite explicitly stating in the following statement (received via Richard Soley) that they are aware of MOF, and that it doesn't do exactly what it, in fact, does. I do have some sympathy for their ontological approach for interoperability between models, though.  "The development of metamodels and UML profiles has been progressed through standardization activities such as UN/CEFACT and OASIS for UMM, ebXML, and OMG for MOF, XMI, CWM, EDOC, EAI, etc. However, every standard group has to specify their metamodel scheme by their own manners. There is no explicit specification about the modeling elements and constructs we use to build metamodels. Due to lack of standards that specify common basses for consistent development and registration of metamodels, fudge duplications and inconsistencies have to be brought. A unified framework for classifying and registering normative model elements could be required to establish harmonization of the metamodels, which are developed independently and to reuse them widely across organizations. And an ontology framework for metamodels is needed to ensure the interoperability between metamodels."
