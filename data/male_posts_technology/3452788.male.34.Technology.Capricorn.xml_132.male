Daniel picked something like an  ocean blue , thus the color of my fingers.  I don't distinguish shades of blue very well, so my reaction was ...  yep, it's blue .  Nikki is going with a  lavender of some sort , which to me is a girley-man  purple .  Anyone who looks at me instantly realizes I have no sense of style whatsoever, in clothes, decor, food, hair, whatever. The Queer Eye guys' personal hell is being locked in a room having to look at people like me for eternity. I don't even hang pictures unless I am REALLY bored, and then only natural scenes, never people. Lucky for me, Anne has a little better sense of taste than me, and I usually defer to her choices in such matters.  Also, I finished the taxes, and I will get back about $500 (after paying $2500 on April 15th). Still sucks. Anne's self-employment penalty, err, taxes are the worst part of it. I guess I need to get a little smarter about how to hide money in a SEP for Anne.
