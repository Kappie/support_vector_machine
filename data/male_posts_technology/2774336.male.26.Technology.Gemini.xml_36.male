       Gurgling 

       Cramping, malaise 

    

    Odd consistency, like cracked mud in a desert.  This movement released a great deal of discomfort. 

 

 

 Thankfully, the problems last night did end quickly. 

 While up late waiting for my gut to settle enough to allow sleep, I happened upon a website,  urlLink www.HelpForIBS.com .  Although I haven't been officially diagnosed with IBS (a GI specialist was quick to make that diagnosis without doing any tests) I was excited and relieved to read the things on that web site.  I gained a little hope that my condition may not be this life-altering forever.  I plan to try some of the suggestions on the web site about dietary changes even without a medical diagnosis of IBS.  Besides, all a medical diagnosis of IBS means is that the doctors know you don't have something else.  They don't really know what IBS is or what causes it. 

 This morning I was rudely awakened by the dog whining.  He didn't have to go outside or anything (I know because I reluctantly crawled out of bed and took him outside anyway) he just wanted to be free of his penned-in hallway.  I can't blame him.  This illness has me caged inside most of this past year too and I would love it if a generous amount of whining would get me out of here, but it wont. 

 Before crawling back into bed (which was still warm) I stopped at the fridge and had several large bites of cantaloupe.  The mellon was in great flavor and although it isn't a fruit I have any cravings for I really enjoyed it...for about 2 minutes. 

 The gurgling hit me quickly.  I almost have to wonder if it wasn't just a concentrate.  I did wake quickly and stand up, then lay back down all in the span of 5 minutes.  By the time I had been back in bed for a minute, my gut was gurgling pretty strongly and I had belching and gas.  I didn't look at the clock, but it only seemed to last for about 10 to 15 minutes. 

 I'm a bit more awake now at 10:30 and my gut has settled into its normal malaise.  A general feeling of unease, although now the waves of cramping and pain are just beginning to hit my stomach.  I'll take some Zantac and try to eat soon. 

  

  Update:  I haven't eaten yet because the plumber is here and occupying the kitchen.  My guts are cramping and making me feel rather ill.  I can't tell if its my stomach or my intestines so maybe it's both. 

  Update:  I used the bathroom at around noon and that release a huge ammount of discomfort that had built up since my last update.  I still haven't eaten much today, but I will soon.
