I have a new logo / image.  And when I say image, I mean image, not graphic.  I have a Gmail account now.  Extremely fast load times and VERY good use of DHTML, it makes me not hate JavaScript, in fact I will be incorporating some DHTML into Reviuss now because of it's inspiration along with Blogger.  I may be moving to Movable Type.  They have a pretty website, and it's written in Perl.  Although, since I am working on the new site, there would be no point, so never mind.  Firefox .9 is out.  I love the Mozilla Foundation to death and hope one day to start or be involved in an operation like that.  I'm pretty sure that is my dream and that is my goal and that is what I am going for, and why I started in software development in the first place.  I love software architecture and technology.  I am definitely back into the game, CS major for me!  I hope I get into MIT.  The things my mother told me were a bit depressiong and put me down.  I think that is my first goal in life, leading to my second goal.  I can only hope and pray to the Lord that he helps me accomplish this.  I really am worried.  I am going to revamp the forum.  I want talk of technology.  I realize this means I will be left with possibly approximately 4 users for the time being, but it opens the door for me inviting others without being worried they will find it immature and petty.  I think that is all for now.  Travis was right, a blog is theraputic.
