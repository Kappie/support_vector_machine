This has to do with variability of bottles of the same wine and vintage. A perfect example is when you buy a case of your favorite wine and you open a bottle somewhere between the first and the last and realize that "this one doesn't taste like the rest". We call this a "dead wine", in that something is in there deadening the flavor (without giving it an overt odor/flavor).   The most common reason for a dead wine is the same as for cork taint... trichloroanisole (TCA). (you can read more about cork taint in our other posts on the blog). While the chemistry is not well known, what essentially happens is that just enough TCA exists in the wine to be at or below the normal human perception limit but enough to mask the flavor of the wine.While the bottle may not smell like a wet dog, it doesn't taste like anything or it is very flat.   Often TCA is the culprit, but often other compounds like tetracholoranisole is present, as this is mainly found in the cases of cellar contamination whereby gross chlorine contamination has ruined entire vintages. Also tribromoanisole is also responsible for some of this masking, as it is chemical very close to TCA, but at low levels can deaden the wine as well.   As I mentioned, the chemistry is little known of how one compound gets in front of another (with respect to taste), but research being done now both in Australia and the United States on tasting threshold of TCA will elucidate this when completed. I can report that I have found a number of dead wines over the last few months, not corked, but just enough to kill the nose and deaden the flavor. I had one at a restaurant and requested that the waiter take it back to give me a new one. The manager did so reluctantly, but had to concede that I was correct when the new bottle was big and fruity. (To my horror, the restaurant served it by the glass in the bar as a I later saw the bottle).   This tells us that we should not accept wines when they are not right and that we should be more open to discovering and understand the nuances of wine chemistry. As you know, you have a home here for answers to all of your wine chemistry issues.   Until next time... Cheers
