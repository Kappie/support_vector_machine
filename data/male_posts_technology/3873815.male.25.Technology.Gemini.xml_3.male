Fair enough, i have no problems with this, although i wish there was more room here so she could bring my grandad as well, but money is tight as always and there's not enough room.  So, I make arrangements, plan things and all that.  Wednesday comes roud, and I receive a phone call, would I mind coming round this weekend and fix the modem, my brother will bring the parts round and I can take the ferry to see her.  This is a bloody 1,200 mile round trip, to fix a modem and stay for 2 nights.  I was going to argue the point, but was told that if they went to the local computer guy he was charging about 90 euro's for the fixing of the modem.  Fuck that, they can pay for my bloody ticket and i'd go over myself and fix it.  Things have gonna bad there since my boss closed his doors to business (12 grand still owed to him, and local busines'es not paying there bills on time for 10 years.  He's had enough and left).  He WAS the local computer guy, and charged quite cheaply for what we did.  But some people still want quality service for free, theiving bastards, and now we have a bloody con man running there IT.  Well, what could i do, my mum cancelled her trip, and we made plans for me to go over there.  Here's why it pissed me off!  Wednesday, get message, have to go upto the post office and collect the money for the ticket. Get to post office, the picture id i presented wasn't enough.  It was my provisional licence, the same shagging licence they processed for me a week before.  An hour waiting for the bus (again) meant thet once I got home, it would be way to late to return and colect it.  Whilst I was waiting for the phone call (that arrived at 4pm when I rang them),   I stepped into a local travel agent to ask about tickets and so forth, most helpful, or so I thought.  Thursday, Finally get the money order (Long que, glass walls, no air conditioning, Very hot day), I trooped down to the travel agents and asked to book the ticket.  "What package would you like?"  Package?  What were they on about!  I made further enquieries and found out they dont make National Express/Euro Lines bookings anymore.  They do the National Express/Eurolines package bus tours!  I specifically asked the airhead bloody agent about the ticket types they did and she told me, right to my face, that they booked them.  Not 20 hours have passed since this exchange, and now they dont according to the three of they that I asked!  Fucking wonderful.  I had to make a 6 mile trip into manchester to book the ticket with national express themselves.  I go home rather pissed off as I know that after 2 pm, getting a bus into manchester is an impossibility.  Well, not without killing someone it isn't.  Friday, last day to book for the weekend.  I get a lift off my dad (Look, just cos I can learn how to drive doesn't mean im confident to drive into Manchester.  Think New York city with only 1 lane in either direction), and in we go.  Twelv narrow misses and 1 padestrian almost mounted to the bonnet (wanker walked right out into heavy traffic that was moving) and we get to National Express.  I march into the que, get told I pushed in front of someone (she should have been talking on her cell phone and payed attention to the fact she was 6 feet from the nearest person) and managed to get to the counter in under 2 minutes (they like to get you out of there sight, wonderful system).  I get asked wher i'm going, what the specific destination is, what type of travel blah blah blah.  All goes into the computer, which is linked to Eurolines and Bus Eiran (Irish Busses).  The destination i selected does not exist.  We did a search for M, and down they scroll.  Not there, id have to get off in Limerick and board in Limerick, even though the place i want is 2 hours travel back up north (Limerick being in the far south), Fuck that!  I didn't argue the point, I just got it booked for Limerick and that was that.  The drivers wont give a shit, as long as I disembard and board somewhere.  Finally, after a week of stress, it's done and I got home, 20 car accident averted and 2 pedestrains still alive (the return trip was frought with pillocks as well).  Got a new case for my pc, got a processor on order, and some new ram (This pc is 4 years old, and was built from cheap parts.  The Motherboard was replaced after christmas, so this is just a natural progresion.) thats due soon.  All is well, and it will be nice to see my Mum and Grandad again.  I do miss em, and it's a pian that I have to do all sorts of stupid things just to go see them.  Whats next, sacrific a chicken to some pagan god before you can book at National Express?  I remember not too lang back it took a quick trip into a trvel agents to sort all this out at once, but thats now a myth, ever since Mr Turban decided to wage war on the west.  I'm suprised that haven hit China or Korea, places that needs that type of shake up..... makes me wonder sometimes, it realy does.  I travel on Monday, and am back Thursday.  If all goes well.  CoH Update:  Hagan, my magic healer/electrical caster is now almost lvl 20 (yay).  Took some doing seems how my BroadBand has been going offline for long periods.  Were getting a free upgrade, as they now have enough money to update the system, that and they got 1 million customers now.  So when maintenance starts, the lines go down.  Thi sis going to go on for the next 4 weeks were told, although work has progressed well.  Super Shooter, a mate of mine in the game is also coming along nicely, he hit lvl 19 yesterday, and may hit lvl 20 about the same time as me, hopefully tomorrow.  Were working hard at this as were trying to get to Hero status (lvl 20+) as we can then get capes (soon).  Also means we can get 2 uniforms, something they add as a progression status, which can be fun in it's own way.  You can also add more to your back story if you wish, as well as a journal function (look, it's a roleplay game, these things are important).  The only problem is the super group i'm in.  I like the group, but I apear to be the only person on during daylight (na dsome night time) hours, even at weekends.  This is annoying as i wanted to add some other players to the group, and I cant do it (the boos has been offline all week).  Gonna try tonight and see if I can catch him on, try and get the admin settings sorted out.   L8r Guys.
