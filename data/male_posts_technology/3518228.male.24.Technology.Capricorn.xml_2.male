I'm starting to wonder if maybe it might be fun/entertaining for me to keep one.  It's tempting to do so, just because I can. However there are some privacy issues with weblogs that I'm not sure I like.  You can't exactly control who reads your weblog.  It's tempting and comfy to start just expressing whatever opinions you might have as if this were a little personal journal.  But it's not personal.  It's very public. Well, I'll just do my best to control myself, and we shall see how this goes.  I saw  Pirates of the Caribbean  yesterday.  It was a pretty good movie.  I expected it to be silly, being that it is a Disney film. The sword fighting in it wasn't as good as I'd been led to think. But it was probably worth the 7.50, at least insofar as any movie is.
