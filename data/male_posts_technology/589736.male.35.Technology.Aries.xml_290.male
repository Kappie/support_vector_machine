I loved Dostoyevski and Tolstoy in high school; and in classical music, I'm always gravitating towards the overly lush sentiment of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov, and later the modern fellas Prokofiev and Shostakovich.  I love the snow, the cold, the brooding, the deep thought, the vodka, the fear, the paranoia, the lust for life, the memories of an empire gone by -- even the Communist menace was far more interesting and, dare I say, romantic than the rather dull juggernaut of capitalism with its good-old-boy GIs and giant golden arches looming over some foreign treeline.  I even miss seeing the uniforms and goose-stepping military parades of my youth.  And there is some small part of me that remains disappointed to this day that Soviet paratroopers never landed in the courtyard of my high school.  They are great chess players; they have delicious names; and they always longed for a warm-water seaport.  I dunno.  Just something about them, I guess.  I even like Chekhov, even though sometimes it's very much akin to chewing rocks.  Tasty rocks.  Yeah.  Um.  I'm gone.
