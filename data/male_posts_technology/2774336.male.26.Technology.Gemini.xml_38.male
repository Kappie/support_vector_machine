 An odd day today.  I woke at 11:00 am to the dog whining again.  I let him out and went back to bed.  I was up so late last night that it was easy for me to fall asleep again.  I finally rose from bed at 1:30 in the afternoon. 

 I took a trip down to the vitamin store and picked up some fennel tea, chamomile tea, and peppermint oil as suggested in the book " urlLink Eating for IBS ".  Then I crossed the street to  urlLink BarnesNoble  and actually picked up the book (their last copy).  I think I'll read it a little this evening and then take a trip to the grocery store. 

 I've just now eaten my first "meal" of the day, if you can call it that.  I did have half a banana for breakfast at around two in the afternoon, but my first sit down was just now at 5:00 pm.  A bologna sandwich again because its easy.  For dinner tonight, maybe at around 9 pm, I hope to have a recipe from my new book.
