In Dayswork blog, black is the best and all others are not that appealing. Coz they are all of the same background with only the color changes. But jaxsays blog has different layouts too which are appealing too. Can move plum, sea guava too to dayswork if u and give off all those similar purple, mint, peach color styles.  And those are all DOs commands i believe. PRN is for printing onto Parallel printer port and COM are for writing on to Communication ports i believe. So it might be like keywords of OS and so will not allow us to create folders of that name. Dont know exactly but! hope to see the correct answer soon.
