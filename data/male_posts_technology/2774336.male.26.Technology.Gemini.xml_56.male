 Seems like I may reach my goal of waking earlier by making extreme progress in the opposite direction.  I was up until around 4 or 4:30 am last night, and slept in until 1:00 pm today.  I have to make a pact with my stomach not to eat after 7:00 pm or I will never be able to wake up early enough for my new job. 

 I did happen to wake up at around 8:00 am today because my stomach was is great pain.  It was the type of pain that I describe as coming "in waves" when I haven't eaten for a while, except there didn't seem to be any waves here.  I drank a large ammount of water in my semi-awake state hoping to calm the attack, but that created new problems.  The sharp pain went away, but there was a dull discomfort and perhaps a little nausea that was threatening to keep me awake.  When I'm half awake like that, my symptoms often seem worse than they realy are, so here is a  grain of salt to go with my report. 

 When I finaly rose from bed at 1:00 pm I ate some sweedish fish candy that were next to my bed, simply because they were there and I had an awful taste in my mouth.  My throat seems better today, but I'm not looking forward to more belching.  This is going to be one of those days that I don't want to eat anything. 

  Update:  I had half a piece of Orange Cranberry Bread.  My abdomen is mildly cramping in waves. 

  Update:  The original intestinal cramping mentioned above has been replaced by the "waves of pain" in my stomach. 

  Update:  Everything is settled, but still unsettled.  This is one of the more aggrivating parts of keeping track of my symptoms; when I cant describe what is going on.  My stomach muscles are clenched, but it may just be from habbit.  As I write this I'm concentrating on relaxing my body and feeling what is really going on.  I have gurgling in my lower intestines, and earlier there was some issue with my stomach but it was general - just an ill feeling.  I haven't eaten much today. I don't really want to.
