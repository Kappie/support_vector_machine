Bad bad eq, been staying up till 4am most nights just to play. setting up a more restrictive 2-3am clause on my eq'ing. hopefully this will tame the problems with sleep and getting up in time to perform the functions required to make sufficient income. I was restricted earlier today from viewing non-work related sites since we had clients coming into the office. So I read a lot of my Platinum Edition Que HTML Bible, I say bible because this book is so huge you'd swear it was the old testament. Anyway, I learned a lot of Sweet stuff about CSS, XML, and DTD's, which is what I plan on using for the bulk of my site, also found a handy Javascript file to work around IE browser's inherent flaws.  Which brings me to my next conclusion. I hate IE, it's always behind the standards of other browsers. CSS2 is supported by most Netscape knockoffs, but not fully by IE, who claims to be fairly compliant with W3C standards. The thing that was ticking me off is something called Fixed. it's a property in CSS that let's you create content that hovers at the same place on the screen even when scrolling, and is handy for putting useful links on a page, that way people will not have to scroll to the tip top of the page to make use of your links or other content.  I plan on writing a Flash menu for the left hand part of my site, which will be fixed, thanks to that javascript file. this menu will allow easy access to a lot of content without having to put a million links on any one page. condense the links, create more white space for content. that's what it's all about.  Anyway, that's the thoughts for the day. Also going to work on making CDF files for my blogs so people who use internet exploiter can check updates on the blog site regularly. pretty handy I think.  Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix
