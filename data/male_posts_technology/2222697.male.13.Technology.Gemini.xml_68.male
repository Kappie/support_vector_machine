The test doesnt effect my grade or college entrance or anything, it is only a tool used by the state to tell if the teachers are doing what they are supposed to...  hell, I'm only in 7th grade...   I'll keep you updated, the skool wants me to relax and sleep. but i have a headache and my dad is probably gonna be mad or something.  Nice way to prepare...  --- In other n3ws I updated my site to look a WHOLE lot friendlier, and I made logos for my blog, my store, my forum, and my hub they are inverted anime pics with text on them...pretty cool stuff.   urlLink LOOKY @ teh HUB
