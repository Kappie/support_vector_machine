The music is divine, the company relaxing, the temperature comfortable; pity about the Greek! Can I recommend Brahm's German Requiem to you all? Well since you can't reply right away, I will. It's a beautiful work.  Speaking of beautiful works.... Beethoven's fifth piano concerto is amazing. Why do I mention it? Well every morning I stick this CD in the player as I drive out the driveway. I'm beginning to judge how bad the traffic was by where I get up to. This morning was wonderful.  I only just got up to the second movement. The day before was terrible, I completely finished the concerto, and went onto the other pieces included on the CD.  Eccentric?   Just a thought my mother had today, (or was it my sister) anyway, it was a good thought. My mum (or sister) said that the church of today seems to emphasize Grace, at the expense of obedience. Grace is popular, but the obedience and holy living that comes with faith (given because of grace) is almost a no no. When you confront someone about a sinful behaviours, you are being ungracious, and 'legalistic', as if confronting sin has become 'legalistic'. Of course confronting sin can be done in an ungracious manner, but it can also be done in a strong, but gracious manner. Grace does not mean God has saved you and you can go on living in sin, and imitating the world. James 4:4 says that whoever is a friend of the world is an enemy of God. James doesn't really beat around the bush! Anyway, that struck me. It's very challenging.
