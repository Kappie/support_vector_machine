Read on for our continued  discussion on Correlational Opponent Theory.              Damn you and your damn  theory!       *teehee*...this is a topic that  my brain has been chewing on for about 10 years....glad to see it is causing  someone ELSE to "lose some sleep"       Ever since you told me you  believe that each person simply "reacts" to his/her surroundings, I've been  watching people, and thinking hard for some evidence it's not true. And so far,  I haven't found it - But - I still haven't found any evidence to disprove my  preferable theory that we are unique, blah blah....       AHH Yes, and that is the beauty  of this "Little" theory - I have not been able to debunk it so far..however nor  have I really been able to PROVE it "beyond a shadow"...thats what the whole  Co-OpTheory Worksheet is for - trying to formalize the idea and get any wrinkles  in the logic ironed out with some factual (albeit mathematical)  data.       Unique in appearance -  there is no question there. Unique in mind, well - yes - I believe that (tho I'm  still considering the development of the mind [in relation to experiences] as  people grow from being a little toddler) - unique in behaviour - well, I would  say yes also, if I didn't see so many people behaving in extremely predictable  ways every day. I could argue that one's determination to think for themselves  creates individuality and uniqueness....But the rebuttal to that would be that  throughout the course of that person's life, they have been exposed to  situations, or attitudes that have given them the attitude towards  thinking.       Well, this is a much more  complex thought process than initially it seems....MY Argument is that human  behaviour is a systematic respose to the current input stimuli that the Human  receives COMBINED with ALL of the responses to ALL PREVIOUS inputs to the  system....In this way, the "Learned", "Programmed" or "Aquired" behavioural  mechanisms that humans develop are essentially the "Least amount of change  required" to make their output (actions/Behaviours) EQUALLY OPPOSE the combined  inputs (and learned adjustments to those inputs from the past)..our basic  motivation then becomes Laziness.."What is the least amount of work  (output/action I have to take) I have to do in order to balance this  equation:       Current Inputs + Behaviour =  Sum of all Inputs and outputs provided to the system over  time       _IF_ perchance, my past actions  created an internal "Engram" that means NEXT time the same scenario comes around  I don't see it as being "out of the ordinary" or interesting (i.e If the value  of my brainwaves PLUS the input scenario is CLOSE to what I remember) then the  input can be considered fully learned...How then, can we "LEARN" behaviour's in  such a way that we exhibit "Unique" personal behaviours? Easy...when we  encounter the input stimuli, something ELSE (other than the INPUT and our  OUTPUT) "unbalances" the system...for instance, if a parent ADD's input the a  baby's "Processor" during and after the presentation of an input then the INPUT  will NOT equal the memory encoded in the baby's brain and therefore the scenario  becomes "Interesting" to the baby and the baby's mind encodes the difference  between the input and the expected value back into the system so that next time  the memory is closer to the inputs...       Which leads to your next  comment really well:       Raising a child will  provide some decent evidence one way or another towards this topic - how they  learn, what they learn for themselves and why - for example - I have a cousin  who is a couple of years old - he can open and close sliding glass doors, and  understands that getting his fingers jammed would be bad - yet he has never  jammed his fingers..... (I don't know if this is something his parents tried to  teach him...)       YES..Spot on!...{maybe Kat and  I should get onto the baby-making-bandwagon and "Build" ourselves our very own  Human-AI experiment *LOL*}...i am actually looking forwad to Fatherhood partly  for this (not exact) reason..i think I understand the complexity of the layering  of learned experience enough to be a "Useful" father...also though, because the  system is LOGARITHMICALLY complex (i.e. a previous learned response cannot be  undone, it must be "learned out" and the "Whole of Brain" experiece is fully  encoded - Every input and response EVER EXPERIENCED is incoded in the brain  engram all at the same time)..i am aware that it is a pretty oenerous task and  MY Mistakes compound once they are learned by my child......       The Sliding door  conundrum.....not so hard to explain....TWO bits to it:       Going back to ..."Least amount  of change required" to make their output (actions/Behaviours) EQUALLY OPPOSE the  combined inputs"... If the inputs to this "feedback loop" include metrics such  as current amount of pain, current amount of force being exerted as WELL as  visual cues such as the location of the child's hand in relation to other  objects, velocity of the door etc... then this whole "least amount of  resistance" theory covers this learned behaviour by trying to balance the  _potential_ for pain (or bad experience) with the current siutation...However,  The child must have been made aware of their own mortality for this all to work.  At some point the input to the system (Pain, blood, shouting at by mum and dad)  increased above the "remembered" value and caused a learning experience....this  learning experience then gets "reused" in different scenarios..HOW?...well you  see this whole process exhibits a sort of INERTIA....like this: Child puts hand  near something (other than a door) MUM or DAD yells at them to stop (protecting  them from hurting themselves) and the Input stuation now does not match what the  child expects (an INTERESTING situation occurs) so the child learns to expect  shouting when their hand nears something...next time mum and dad DON't yell  (situation is not dangerous)..this in turn Becomes an INTERESTING situation  because the child was expecting to be shouted at when their hand goes near  something but weren't (and, as such their inputs don't match their  memory)....they Un-Learn the hand/shout scenario a little bit...this naturally  encodes the "Middle ground" between the two scenarios and, unknowingly, has  encoded the same situation with varying inputs as a Safe/Not Safe engram....As  soon as the child goes to touch something and doesn't get shouted at, they LEARN  the situation to be safe (because there was no shouting and the inputs _still_  do not exactly match the memory). In this way, although MUM  DAD did not  "Teach" the "Doors can hurt your hand" Meme to the child, they have learned the  process for evaulating safe stuations because they were told about an unsafe one  (I think that all makes sense)....THIS DOES NOT WORK IF THE CHILD HAS NOT FELT  PAIN! - if the child has not felt pain then there is no difference between the  inputs of:        * the child's hand touching a  HOT item that could hurt them (or sharp-hurty door)       * the child's hand touching a  soft cushion that could not       If there is no difference in  these two inputs from the child's point of view then there could be no  learning...thus we can prove that in order for this theory to work, a feedback  allowing data about the Host/Human/Child/Robot needs to be included as an input  to the system...which is ok because this is exactly what humans have - 5 RAW  sensory inputs (Smell, touch, taste, sight sound) plus multiple internal inputs  (heart rate, temperature, pain, emotive response, hunger  etc).       Secondly (an briefly coz this  is oficcially a long-winded email now), various regions of the brain are used  for differnet tasks and trained specifically for those tasks accordingly..the  various different areas of the brain are then "Joined" together (at the Mendula  Oblongata) and the total output is sent down the spinal cord to complete the  feedback loop (action is taken, the response from the action is the next input  value..e.g turn your head, the visual [and audio] input changes, potentially  producing an output). Over time, (and continuously over our life), sections of  the brain become increasingly and slowly diconnected from each other.... At a  time near conception, our brains are almost "fully connectionist" that is; each  neuron is (almost) connected to every other neuron in the brain, therefore the  brain is completely aware of the other bits of the brain....as time goes by  (rapidly when young, slowly as we get older) connections between nerons are  "dropped" this results in sections of the brain becoming diconnected from other  sections at least partially. The effect of this is that sections of the brain  that are "Trained" to respond to certain inputs no longer have the "Complete"  view of the world that they used to and are required to provide an output based  upon on the "partial picture" of the world that it has....when many sections  make "Guesses" like this, it results in novel reponses that still are applicable  to the scenario they are in response to but based upon incomplete or inaccurate  data and, therefore NOT QUITE RIGHT" which we see as being "Creative" or "Novel"  thought....this is kinda like the "Tower Of Babel" story of how "God" introduced  the Languagfe Barrier (Different languages did not exist in th ebible before  this time) overnight in order to stop humans building a tower all the way to  heaven...the brain, after some initial training in the "one big same  language"...suddenly starts speaking different dialects in different areas and  cant fully understand the dialect of other areas...this results in a kinda  neural "chinese whispers" which we see as Creativity or uniqueness - hrmm maybe  this is a good name for creative thought (Neural Chinese  whispers)...       (Also links between neurons  that have no direct link to the outside world are created over time in the brain  ...that is, one part of the brain may take its input from the output of another  part of the brain...so these decision making links are heirarchical not  flat!)       Soooo, from 3 simple theorys  (Co-Op theory + Neural Learning + Disconnectionist evolution) we get  intelligence and creative thought....       The next question is, how does  this apply to evolution?        Could, over time, our  physiology change so that certain areas of the brain are pre-connected (or  pre-disconnected) from each other to produce a more efficent brain? - is this  what happened between Homo Sapiens (neanderthal man) and Homo Sapien-Sapiens  (Human man)??       Could, over time, the "Driver  Signal" used to start this "wave theory thing I have going" (in this case the  28Hz driver signal on the Excel worksheet) be customized to pre-contain data on  it rather than being a blank driver signal...could, perhaps, we be copied with  the waveform (or part of) that our parent/mother has and, therefore, could we be  born with A Priori knowledge of the world?...the answer would seem at first look  to be YES - after all, we are exactly the same biological species as our  ancestors but we are "Smarter" or seem to be because we "Know more about  more"..we "remember" what our ancestors learned to some degree...now, sure, some  of this is because we have ancestors alive to change our inputs and therfore  condition our responses as well as other artifacts such as the technology  available today as opposed to before which change our inputs compared to those  of our ancestors and, thus change our behaviours BUT, how can WE (our  generation) learn everything our previous generations knew and then use that  knowledge to "Create" ne knowledge and then continue the cycle?...surely this is  only possible if, every generation, we Pre-Prime the driver waveform of the  brain with some knowledge (that is, it is not a simple Sine wave but a complex  wavelett similar to that left over after a waveform has already "Learned"  something)???              Ahhh..well I would say you have  just touched the tip of a 10-years-worth-of-thought iceburg...maybe I should  finish this email here and continue my rant at another  time....       ;)       Hey, By the way, what time u  knocking of today?...chances of a lift?       Lastly, I am enjoying  discussing this with someone (for once) so much I have created an online blog  for it..you will get an invite email soon, we can continue this thread on there  (and, thus refer our notes or any links we get) from home.       The Blog will be  at:         http://bitkraft.blogspot.com/         My IT Blog is at           http://tiggrbitz.blogspot.com         Kat and I have a personal one  at         http://tiggrlyfe.blogspot.com       tho it is blank at the  mo       Cheers.
