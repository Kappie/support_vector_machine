The screen flickered oppresively, sending Andy Halkyardsbrain in directions it simply didnt want to go at that god awful time of the morning. He tried to focus on the email but it was no good, something just didnt add up, it all seemed too convienient and besides, Andy had never even heard of the National bank of Nigeria. While he pondered, a girl entered the room from the kitchen behind him, he felt her presence before he heard her steps and spun in his chair to face her. She wore of face of determination above a body Andy found much to his tastes, it was the bait and he knew it. Whilehefocused on one the other could strike and finish him off. They were a team, her body and her face, he had learned to deal with one but never both.      "I need you to go to the shop" she said it oh so innocently, like it was a thing to be thought over and considered. He knew he had no option, his back was to the wall and the only way out was to climb over it, he tried that once, chiropractors aren't cheap in this city, Andy grimaced at the memory.      "Sure thing babe" he replied, trying to look calm and in control "what do you need?"    "I need some ham"  then a moments pause "you do know what it looks like don't you?" They were simply a collection of words, but those simple words hit him harder than any object could, he spat out a retort like it was the vilest taste in the roof of his mouth       "i  do  know what ham looks like, Seonaid!" it was a weak response, but it was the best he could muster, the front line fodder had arrived, he had to just hang in there for the reinforcements. Without another word she simply vanished, out of his vision, out oftheroom and upon hearing the now familiar slam of the door, out of the house. His army stared disbelievingly at an empty battlefield.      It was going to be one of those days.
