The photographer is able to capture the most magnificant scenes in Hong Kong. Personally, I think the  urlLink Ding Kau Bridge  photo and the  urlLink Super Curves  photos are the best. I would like to take such great photos too! However, there is a price to pay... the price of the  urlLink Canon EOS 10D Digital SLR camera  is approximately HKD $10,000. Of course, the price tag is even higher when accessories like flash light and stand are purchased. Anyway, if you are deeply in love with photography, then you are willing to pay this price. Hmmm... not for me now =P  Here are also  urlLink some sample images  from the  urlLink Canon EOS10D official site . Notice the details that the digital camera can capture.
