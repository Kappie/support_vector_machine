It's a pretty tough one, and I didn't get as far on it as I did when I played on Saturday. I am definately a more cautious player than Ed, who also played on Saturday.  I started again on Morrowind as well. I've just been playing various games lately, hopping around. When I was playing Knights of the Old Republic (KotOR), I pretty much just stuck with it until I was finished.  This time around, I decided to go with a meat-and-potatoes approach, playing a Scout (light warrior). I couldn't quite bring myself to go the full Barbarian/Warrior route.  Oh, and DaftApeth called and let me know that he had finished Beyond Good and Evil. He had just borrowed it Saturday evening. I guess sometimes it's better to be unemployed.
