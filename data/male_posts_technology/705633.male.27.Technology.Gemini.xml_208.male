Much to my surprise last night our Mr Grist turns out to be an accomplished dancer on stage.  I had a really good night last night; it always makes an evening more fun when the Toaster crowd get together.  I have to dress up for hallowe'en tonight and I don't have a clue what to do about it.  My Boss is throwing a party at his after work for us all with strict instructions that you will not be admitted without fancy dress.  For those of you who don't know, I started working at the Sports Bar about four weeks ago and I'm having an excellent time.  When you start they give you a Magic Shirt to wear which enables you, free entry into any Club plus makes you instantly attractive to women!  (Great, Kate has just come in to help me with my spelling and grammar).  That is no mere statement either.  I have pulled every night since Friday.  I even woke up on Monday on a sofa next to a pretty young lady and to my horror looked around to see pictures of one of the Toaster files team all over the living room.  Panicking at first I wondered what horrible mistake I had made, then I remembered the girl I was with, was on holiday and this was not her house.  Well I better get onto making my costume for the night.  Danger out.....
