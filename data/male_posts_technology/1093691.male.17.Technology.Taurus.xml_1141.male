Yes I know on peoples addresses they say Surrey like mine does but that is because its on the border. Plus there is a road the same name as mine in Croydon itself so by putting Surrey they know which one.  Croydon is a London Bourough, its South London. Just very very South. It is covered by the Met police, not the Surrey police.
