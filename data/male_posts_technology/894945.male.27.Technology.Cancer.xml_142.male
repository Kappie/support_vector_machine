Afraid of revenge attacks by lardy Hector's waitresses and the people that look after the Libby Square fountain, we lay dormant in our underground missile silo somewhere in a field in St Clement's. I don't want to speak too soon, but it looks like our few weeks of summer might just be starting. Myself, Grist, Dougal and Dougal's lady met for a top-level executive lunch at a secret location (Pizza Express... damn!) to drink Peroni and survey the beauty of Jersey's finest female talent.    Jersey Girls, a poem by Toaster.   Your skirts are short, just like your temper. You crashed daddie's Merc, but it was just a fender-bender.  You can smell a fifty note from a four mile radius, But in that denim catsuit you're looking truly dangerous.  You don't know the capital of Brazil, But if you tickle the right spot - my god can you squeal.  Drawn to a camera like a moth to a flame, Since we had sex on the steam clock i've just not been the same...
