Trying to answer this question I found this nifty  urlLink tool  on the  urlLink Washington State Liquor Control Board site .  It's sort of like a public library catalog except for booze.  You can look up all the gins or vodkas or look for a specific brand.  The best part is it shows what liquor stores have it which is great for more obscure brands and it also tells you how many bottle each store has on hand!  Only thing missing the ability to place a hold on a bottle!  I'm not so crazy about the state monopoly on liquor sales but this sit is one benefit.  You couldn't get something like this with private liquor stores!  Now if they hadn't closed the Ballard Liquor store I might be picking up some Volk Kvint Vodka from Moldova tonight!
