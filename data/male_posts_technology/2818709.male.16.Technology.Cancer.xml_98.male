That could mean that my mother is going to make sexual advances on the dentist today." I never have understood the human race's tendancy to find crutches for their grevious faults. Take some damn responsibility. Dont blame it on pluto. It never did anything to you. Poor planet. It's fucking cold. It's the same thing with religions. "----!!! Please help us! Our feet smell like a glass of 9 month old milk!" (---- can be replaced with jesus, buddah, fhwqbagads, mohammad, satan, god, darwin, pac-man, or any other deity under the clouds otherwise known as heaven.)  I mean, seriously, wtf would you have to be on to believe that some constellation can determine if you should ask someone out that day? "I shouldnt ask her today because my celestial alignment is opposing hers." No, your breath stinks. Take some damn tic-tacs. Dont anyone DARE say "You're just a closed-minded asshole." Look, I'm entitled to my opinion. So are you. Feel free to rant at me about this post.  In conclusion, the human race needs to shut the fuck up and take some responsibilty. Dont blame other people/things/celestial formations on your own faults.  [For all of you that were wondering, yes, there is a reason for this rant. I was reviewing some conversations i've had with a few people in the past.]
