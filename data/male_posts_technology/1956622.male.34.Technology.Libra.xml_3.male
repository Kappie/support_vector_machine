Karissa got a new care bear backpack in the shape of a care bear she showed everyone in the mall I think.  We spent time in the book store looking at books.    After a few hours of that we went back to Grandma’s and Grandpa’s.  Karissa wanted a ride in the riding mower.  I got the mower out and Karissa and I mowed the lawn and rode on the mower.    Grandpa went to Pizza with us.  Karissa really wanted pizza for dinner no coaching from me even!  We went to alfy’s pizza and they have video games the kids can play.  She got to play the video games (nintendo’s) and although she could not really play the games well she had fun and that is all that matters.
