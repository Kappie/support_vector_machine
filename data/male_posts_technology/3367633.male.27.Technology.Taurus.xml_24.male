It just eriks me, and exp when I am at work and cant just blow off the steam by doing some thing else.   it just seems weird that I seem to go though a few stages when I get mad its like a chemical imbalance happens or some thing, I guess that's why I don't like to get mad.   first stage,  Upset.  second stage,  angst  third stage,  depression  fourth  stage, with drawl  fifth stage, ambivalence   these are the only few I can recognize that happen with in the first few hours, but who knows what else may be there as well.
