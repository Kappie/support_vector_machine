Karissa sounded happy she was drinking a sprite and enjoying it from the sounds of it.  There was no fighting with her on the phone today to get her to talk to me.  In fact when she answered the phone she was excited to talk to me.  Karissa and I talked about her favorite colors.  She likes pink and purple, red and yellow.  I asked her to make me a picture.  The prettiest picture she can think of.  She said she would do that.  I am sure I will never see it after all Lisa will never mail anything for Karissa.  I expected a much different conversation from   SFW   seeing as she and I will be meeting again on July 24! Then it dawned on me that she did not have that information just yet.   I figure I will give a day or two then try to get Karissa's bus ticket for her to come here as agreed but I am sure that will change now.  Of course that can only make me look better and   SFW   look worse.    I was thinking this would make a great reality show!  Maybe I should patent the idea and go to work on it.  I could be rich.
