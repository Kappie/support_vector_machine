I'm supposed to be busy now, but as an old junker installs Windows 2000, I think I have enough time to post something. My boss is keeping me really busy with different projects. I feel like my head's about to blow! But that's the way life is, if you don't work, you don't progress in life or get paid, whichever you prefer!  I'm pretty angry at the moment, a couple of thing going on that I don't like. First off, last week I had three days off, which I thought were going to be marked as vacation with pay. But yerterday when I received my check, I was only paid the two days I worked. This certainly sucks because I was counting on that money to pay for my new car. Second, my co-workers just love to place the blame on other people. I mean, if something wrong happened and it was my fault, I would just say so. But around the workplace it's way different. If you do something wrong, just pass it on to someone else. It happened to be a couple of times this week, not counting the past couple of weeks. I'll just stay calm, as long as it doesn't affect me or my job.  I am in serious need of a night out, but seeing that my budget it tighter than I expected it to be, that won't happen in a while. At least where I'm staying during the weekdays, there are no good places to hang out at night. And it's weird, seeing that there are a couple of universities in town, and there are a lot of students around. If there's one thing I miss about being in the U.S., it's the lifestyle. In a sense, it's much more quiet and calm here in Puerto Rico, but sometimes I find that too boring. I don't know, sometimes I'm too quiet, other times I would just like to go out and party all night long. I'm conflicted in some ways :)  Well, it's 5:00, so that means quitting time! I don't like Thursday nights, normally I'm busting my butt cleaning my room and packing everything to take home with me. But on Friday afternoons, it's well worth it! Take care everyone, thanks for reading my boring stuff, and hopefully I'll post again soon!
