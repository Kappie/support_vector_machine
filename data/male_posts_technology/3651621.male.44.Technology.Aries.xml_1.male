Minus a small minority who vote outside the Dem/Rep lines (and minus the huge number who don't vote at all), the United States is repeatedly showing an even split between Democrats and Republicans. Which means a couple of things:  1) Regardless of who wins, HALF OF THE VOTERS AT ANY GIVEN TIME ARE  urlLink UNHAPPY  WITH ELECTION RESULTS and feel their viewpoints are not being represented.  2) When a candidate states that "the people of this country want X", that's not true. Do not believe that candidate.  urlLink HALF OF THE VOTERS  WANT X AND HALF OF THEM WANT Y.  Imagine taking the oath of office for the Presidency of the United States knowing that basically ONE HALF of those who cast votes voted against you. I would think that a President under those circumstances would want to find a way to, if not win over, at least give some credence to the viewpoints of that half of the citizenry.  Take my viewpoints, for example. Like many other American citizens, I feel that the war in Iraq is making the U.S. less secure by increasing hatred for our country in the Islamic world. Like many other American citizens, I feel that tax cuts help the wealthy buy more expensive  urlLink SUVs  while more of the poor end up on the streets. Like many other American citizens, I feel that the so-called "Patriot Act" is a gross violation of the freedoms that our predecessors fought and died for and is taking us in the direction of the Nazi  urlLink Gestapo  or the KGB.  Rather than acknowledging these opinions, the President just leans over the podium and, in the manner of one speaking to rather slow children, gives the equivalent of  urlLink "You're just wrong. Duh."  Well, I sure feel marginalized as a citizen. I'm sure lots of other folks do as well. About half of us, in fact.
