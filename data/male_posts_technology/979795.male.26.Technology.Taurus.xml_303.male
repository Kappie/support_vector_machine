BB East's class was a comfortable size despite combining with Gombak students. I liked it but I think Tommy was right. The aircon isn't a good idea. Too comfy for me. I think I might just continue at Siglap and drop by BVCC/BB East on just 1 more extra day when I can. This way I supplement my training and I still get to train with the young kids/teens at Siglap. Eh ... but it still feels weird to not be paying mat fee at the dojos I'm popping by. But at least given current $ situation, it's not a bad thing either. :P  Got my Medical FFI back in camp this afternoon. Woohoo, 1 more milestone towards my ORD!
