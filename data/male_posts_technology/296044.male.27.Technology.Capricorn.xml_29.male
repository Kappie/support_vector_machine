They've been calling me lately to talk about thier issues up in Toledo.  I haven't even gone up there for the holidays yet, and already I'm sick of them.  My one cousin, Andrea, is all about this guy she broke up with.  She hasn't even been with him all that long... I think.  I can't remember exactly when they met.  But I didn't even think they were that serious.  She kinda stays in the dark when she's dating someone, and doesn't really talk about it.  But now... oh boy.  It's all coming out now.  I don't knwo what to tell her tho... and then sometimes I have to feign death to get her to shut up.  Then there's my other cousin Jenny.  She's doing just fine relationship-wise, however she wants to talk to me about it all constantly.  Emails, calls, pictures... good lord.  I don't know what it is with these two, but they're driving me to drink.  Ok, enough of that.  I'll be up there to see them soon enough.  I'll live... I think.  My friend Kyle got a job!  Was starting to worry about that boy.  So if you see him, send him congrats.  My mom got her Mini.  Sent me pictures the other day.  I'm so jealous.  Although, I'm not sure how I feel about the double stripes on the front hood.  Is it just me, or does it look... not so Minish that way?  Er something...  MINE would have had the Union Jack painted on top.  I finished Memoirs of a Geisha in seven days flat.  I think that's a record since my high school days.  Great book.  I highly recommend it.  New teahouse just opened in the Short North.  Tell all your friends.  Pretty nifty.  Deserts, tons of teas, serving sets...  Um... Thanksgiving is tomorrow, so thanks for giving me something.  Later.
