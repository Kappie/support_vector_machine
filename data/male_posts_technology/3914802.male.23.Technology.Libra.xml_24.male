Her name is MM and she works downstairs. She somehow knew it was me even though the last time she saw me I had long brown har instead of short blond hair. Most people seem to have trouble recognizing me at first. I asked her about this and she didn't really know how she knew it was me. I think I have a distinctive walk maybe. I have a nice lil swagger on the boundry of a pimp stride... haha, no not really.                      Anyways it was kind of nice to get a ride into work. It is actually kind of chilly out today and the wind was blowing. I was carrying in my suit that I had made for Otakon, so I could get the pants made to where they actually fit. The suit was blowing around and I was tired of carrying it. So warm car was a much better option.                       She lives in the same quadrant of the city as the building we work in. I wondered why she was in the north section of town and asked her about it. She said it was because she was dropping off a friend of hers to work. I would drive to work myself... but it would cost to park unless I park farther south in the residential part, but then I would be walking for 10-15 minutes anyways. The excercise is pretty good for you anyways! I will probably start biking once it gets a bit cooler out. MM had off today but she was still going in to pick up some slack. I don't think I want any job where that happens to me. No going in on weekends or anything like that. Although I am a nice guy and could see myself getting pressured into some shit like that.                     Grrr... on a different note I have been watching Love Hina on my WinAmp player. The internet TV is the most awesomest thing ever! As long as the server is not full then you can watch some episodes of streaming anime. They also have a selection of porn which I readily started watching the internet TV for. But  urlLink Love Hina  captured my heart, mostly because it is funny and they beat up the main character a lot.  My roommate said it reminded him of the same animation as  urlLink Mahoromatic  , which is also pretty cool. but.. if you have the chance, please take a look at some of these classic anime series. Maybe someday I will meet a girl who will enjoy the silly things I enjoy someday. Then she will be my best friend...  One thing that sucked about the ride to work I guess was that I got here 15 minutes early, and I don't get to leave 15 minutes early :-(
