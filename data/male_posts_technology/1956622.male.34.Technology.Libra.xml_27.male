I think she was helping out with dinner but none the less she was excited to have chores.  Something I am sure will not carry on as she gets older.  :)   So today we talked about how she liked to do chores and how she got a new bed, Lisa must have figured out how to get the child support!  She told me a little about her bed.  She asked me if I wanted to come see it? I replied I would love to come see it someday.  She said I made daddy sad now then decided she did not want to talk anymore.    I coached her into talking by asking her what she wanted to talk about.    She wanted to talk about candy.  She was telling me how she had a watermelon ice cream cone sucker.  She also told me she had candy for dinner.  I certianly hope that was not the case.    She then told me that mommy wanted to talk to me.  Lisa got on the line and asked me when I wanted to get online, in coordination with her, to purchase Karissa's ticket.  She then said let me know when you are ready as I have some other priorities and am waiting for the other child support check.   She then gave Karissa back the phone and Karissa and I said our good buys and I told Karissa next time she comes to daddy's house we would go to the galleria and check out the candy store there.  She was so excited yelled at mommy about how daddy was going to take her to the candy store.  She also thanked me, with her cute "thank you daddy" voice,  for offering to take her and was excited to go.   I hung up with Karissa on a positive note and a longer talk then I have had in about a week.  I found a quote from the bible that I find befitting under my circumstances:   Malachi 4:6 "He will restore the hearts of the fathers to {their}  children and the hearts of the children to their fathers, so that I will not come and smite the land with a curse."
