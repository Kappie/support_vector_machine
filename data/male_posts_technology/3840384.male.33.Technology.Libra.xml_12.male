But as a friend pointed out to me, it is cheaper than therapy and less work than adding content to a web site. So we will see how it goes.  Not too much happening today. I just saw the new Michael Moore film (Fahrenheit 9/11) and left kind of unimpressed. I mean, GWB is an ass, but this was pure propoganda and with a lot of verifiable falsehoods in it. I am sure that it will make the people who hate the prez hate him more and will make those on the fence perhaps get off the bleeding thing. But no one who is a fan is likely to be swayed, you know?  Heading out to a barbecue soon. My cats hate fireworks more than pit bulls, so we will see how it goes in the new apartment. 'Til next time....
