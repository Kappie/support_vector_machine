I always found it strange that people would post their thoughts and feelings on the web and think there would be this huge following of readers who would be interested.  Then it happened...   I started faithfully reading other people's blogs!!!    So I thought  "What the hell? Let me see if anyone would be interested to read my endless ramblings?"  Which brings us to this moment in time. Hopefully I can post something at least 4 -5 times a week from my job (no 'Net currently at the apartment. Besides, I'll post during my breaks, honest!)  So I really hope you enjoy this blog, and please give me your feedback, either by E-Mail or by Instant Messenger (look it up in my profile). Thanks for reading, hope everyone's having a great day!
