You better try it out, provided you're into grid computing. What's good about this patch is that it is based on the work of  urlLink Eduardo Pinhiero's checkpoint patch , which actually works if you are still using kernel 2.4.2, but made possible to work for Linux kernel 2.4.22 by  urlLink Nur Hussein's port of epckpt .  I can't comment much tho, because I don't use my PC for grid computing. Just not yet. :P
