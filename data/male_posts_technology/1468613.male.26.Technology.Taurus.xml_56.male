I saw some orange-men marching through the streets of Glasgow on the weekend... something I wasn't expecting. I have never seen so many men beating drums so enthusiasticly (orright! so I don't know how to spell :oP )  Not really a great deal other news at the moment... I was planning on going to Edinburgh to see the castle and some ye-olde buildings but I slept in :o) Just been doing a bit of running - not away from anything just running - and playing a bit of football. I even got myself a fluro-orange ball so get ready people for a few kick-to-kicks when I get back.  This week not a great deal is lined up - just getting through the week and then I'm off on Friday!  see you all real soon! -gede  PS: apologies for last round of postcards... I sent them but forgot to put postage stamps on them...
