It has several aspects, that seem to develop independently of each other, your rendering accuracy, which is largely a manual skill and depends on how much you practice and how recently, plus some learned behaviors that seem to stick, your design creativity, which has to do with your visual sensibilities, color balance and so on, which doesn't seem to change much, perhaps a steady beat upwards with work, and your visual distance, which is your ability to look at things with 'new eyes' and see them for what they are, rather than what you *recognize* them to be. The last seems to be my only real skill or area of speciality, which is unfortunate because the other two would come in really handy right about now.
