Managed to get my 200th Cache in Oxford, went to quite a few nice parks and saw some of the touristy bits in and around Oxford.  The weather was less than desirable, was caught in about 3 torrential showers, the last was the worst, lasting for about 30 minutes and no where for me to go, was just praying that my PDA would not get wet, thankfully it didn't  Went to Iffley Road Track which is the track that Roger Bannister set the first sub 4 minute mile. Had the chariots of fire theme tune buzzing through my head for a while after...  Went into the Oxford Botanical Gardens which definately worth more than 2 minute fly by that i allowed for it. Is built on a Jewish Cemetry that ceased in 1290 (what ever that's supposed to mean)  One of the virtual caches was at a location where 3 men where burnt alive for there beliefs, didn't say what beliefs though.  Passed a lot of very old buildings not having a tour guide with me i really couldn't tell you what they were though. Will have to back and explore some more, i was on a bit of a mission.  My hands at the moment are a bit of a mess, they are full of spliters and thorns, will have to sit down to day and rectify that. No real surprise they are this condition after having to put them in numerous nooks and crannies.
