I must applaud the telecom industry at creating such a solid infrastructure, but do have to admit that customer service is often lacking terribly.  When I lived in California, Pacific Bell was the big evil phone company (here in Wisconsin, it's generally SBC).  Their customer service had degraded to the point that the state government had to practically babysit them.  They had to maintain a certain level of customer satisfaction or the state would levy fines and other punishments.  My personal experience, as both a residential and business customer, didn't necessarily reflect these problems, however I didn't really get involved with them until long after their "trying times".  I did hear plenty of anecdotal horror stories that'd make me cringe.  In any event, I think these new regulations are a good thing.  We simply need to start holding companies responsible for the level of their customer service.  I personally and professionaly find it astonishing that so many companies out there (not just the telephone companies, mind you) don't focus more on providing good customer service. I do believe things are starting to improve, but also believe that we still have some ways to go...  (I have the same rant about how poorly comapnies treat their QA and IT, but will leave that for another day.)
