Jared seems happy with the results, which obviously is a good indiciation of where this is going. Meanwhile, Significant Other and I saw FINDING NEMO, which is quite good and touching. I was surprised by its "adult" issues (death, single parenting, handicaps, etc.). I admit I got a lil choked up and S.O. found herself crying every 5 minutes. The animation is blow away. I still like MONSTERS INC. better.  Off to LA tomorrow for 10 days.   F
