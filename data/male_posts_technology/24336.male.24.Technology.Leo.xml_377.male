I only used it probably 30 times since I bought it, mostly working out.  Back in the day, I would bring a CD player wherever I would do homework, but now I just bring my  urlLink laptop .  Well, sometime last semester, something in my CD player broke.  The lid would never stay shut.  If the lid is open, the player automatically turns off.  Yesterday, I probably killed two hours just looking at new CD players.  I finally decided on  urlLink this one  since it is a Sony, thin, and can play MP3s.  Yes, it's in girly blue, but I like girly blue!  (You should see some of the shirts I have...)  Before ordering it, I thought I might as well try to fix my old player.  How could it hurt?  I was going to buy a new one anyway!  I ripped it open, moved the lever a bit and it worked!   Well, by "worked" I mean the lid would stay shut.  I got all excited and decided to go work out, just to try it out.  After changing, getting a Nalgene bottle ready and downing some Creatine (you think I am joking?), I tossed some batteries into the old player.  Nothing.  Press play.  Nothing.  Sigh.  I ripped it open *again*.  I couldn't see anything wrong, though I did have to disconnect a cable to reset the lever.  I reseated said cable.  Nothing.  Just then, I noticed a little piece of plastic sitting in my lap.  How it stayed there for the fifteen minutes between when I first opened the player to when I noticed it is beyond me.  I figured where it went (another lever that pushed down a little button when the lid is closed) and wham.  I was off to the  urlLink CCRB  listening to  urlLink Trail of Dead .
