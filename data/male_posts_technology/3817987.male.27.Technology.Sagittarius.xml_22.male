I'm a Cuckoo  features a really exciting remix of the title track, "Stop, Look, and Listen" which sounds like a lost Monkees track, and "(I Believe In) Travellin' Light" a lovely little Stevie Jackson ballad.   Books  in features a double A-side of "Wrapped Up in Books" and the new "Your Cover's Blown", which is an ornate spy saga that sounds like a collaboration between Chic and Squeeze.  The lone b-side on  Books  is a adorable tune called "Your Secrets" which contains what may be the best single line in B history, "I just had somebody tell me I was introspective to a fault".
