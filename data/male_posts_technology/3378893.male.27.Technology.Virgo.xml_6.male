I'm definitely learning a lot about genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, neural networks, and other loosely related topics.  I've also met this incredibly cute girl.  She's in the REU program, too.  I feel like I'm going crazy because I just can't get her out of my mind.  Unfortunately, there are only two women in the program, along with like 14 guys, so the girls get a lot of attention.  I just wish I knew what to do to attract this one.  I invited her to come down to Lewiston this last weekend to hang out with me, but she declined.  I'm not sure if that means that she already made plans with someone else or what?  I'm not very experienced with this dating game, so I don't know what to do.  And the emotions I'm feeling are just so overwhelming.  How does anyone deal with this?  I just can't seem to function since I am so preoccupied with such a mixture of confusing thoughts and feelings.  No matter what happens, I guess life will go on.  So I guess I'll just have to keep going.
