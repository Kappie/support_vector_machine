I am really out of shape, especially playing with guys who just came off of a high school season.  I did make a good diving catch that got a good rise out of all the dad's who were watching our practice instead of the little league parade going by.  I got to catch too.  I am amazed at how comfortable it was.  I thought for sure I would feel some muscle, but I caught four guys in a row about 20 pitches each and I was fine.  I am pretty sure that General (that is my coach) is going to start me there.  Mainly because I kept asking him if I could.  We don't have a team name or colors yet.  We did get numbers and we decided on gray pants.  Now I have to find a place to find pants.  Cool fact about our team is that we are made up entirely of guys who found the web page and enquired.  Anyway, we have practice on Wednesday and I can't wait!  First game is Sunday.  you can check out the schedule and other info  urlLink Here HTTP://NKABL.ORG
