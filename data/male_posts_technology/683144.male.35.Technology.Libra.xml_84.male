Perhaps their response rate is higher from some folks on these days, but from past experience I come prepared to mass delete the inbox with very, very little attention on the weekends. False positives likelihood for us traditionally have been higher on the weekend, but it has been a necessary road bump.  No more.  I'm hoping that by using Gmail to be able to use to ferret out the good from the bad it will be easier with their fast search.
