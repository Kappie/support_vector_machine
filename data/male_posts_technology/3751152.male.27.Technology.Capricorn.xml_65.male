Now I'm ready for your questions and my close up.   Current Music:   urlLink Big Daddy Kane    Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ). : Great I picked up a quarter made from 1965. Hmmm...nothing happened to me in 1965 because I was 10 years away from being conceived. However my mom said she got a job in New York City with the phone company in 1965 and my dad was smoking hashish while working on his thesis at Penn. Works for me.   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why? : My job. Working at a newspaper is instant reality. If I'm feeling too good I read the AP wire and hear about an explosion in Jerusalem, a beheading in Afghanistan and the war breaking out in central Africa. That's my often changing reality.   What is the most honest thing you have done? : I told one of the editors that I was embarassed about a story that ran on our front page. And she proceeded to include it in the weekly newsletter. Of course the girl who wrote the story cried and I looked like an ass. I apologized but that was a lie because I meant every word I said in the criticism.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why? : Maybe take a run on the beach with Metro and Boozer (my dogs).   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why? : A stack of Toby Keith CDs.    For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why? : My family, my ex-fiancee and my professional reputation.    What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why? : Eternal. Because death is forever.   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why? : Any of those male  sex pill ads. Why? Because I can't imagine smiling that wide if your stuff is hard during an entire work shift. I mean I'd be a little embarassed if I'm strolling around the office standing at attention.   What was your first job? : My first work for pay was on the watermelon farms in rural Florida before several years before I moved here. My first job selling video games at Software Etc.   Finish the sentence: “I have never…” : I've never shagged Britney Spears. I've never bungee jumped. I've never swam but I always jump in head first.
