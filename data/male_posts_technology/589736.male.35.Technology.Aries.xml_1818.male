"Oh, it's not my fault for being a slut...my cat has infected me with promiscuous disease."  If rats are infected, it causes slight behavioural changes, thought to increase the chance of transmission.  Well, it causes no behavioural changes in infected cats.  In humans also, there has been no conclusive evidence to show that behaviour is directly affected by the parasite.  They "evaluate" people's personalities, and then test if they have the disease.  Well, that ends up being a correlational study.  How do you know that people who like cats don't have certain behavioural characteristics already?  Or that people who are more likely to clean litter boxes don't have a certain personality?  Or maybe people who don't clean their houses are more likely to get it since they would be the most likely candidates for rat infestation.  There is no ethical way to show if there is any truth behind the claims that it supposedly has mind-altering effects on humans.  The only way to test for the personality change would be to test their personality before and after infection.  Comparative studies are the only ones that would be scientifically worth anything.  For now, the claims are total bollocks...   Off the subject, did anyone else think that the 'Matrices' were absolute shite?  Yuck!
