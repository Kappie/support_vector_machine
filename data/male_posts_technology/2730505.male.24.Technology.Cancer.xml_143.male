Blind facination huh? would blind facination be enough to call every night while you were struggling on cheating on your boyfriend to make you feel better? would it be enough to drive four hours every chance that I got to see you? would it be enough to have you meet my family and have them accept and like you? would it be enough to have you hang out with the best of friends that I have in MI? would it be enough to keep me around even though the whole time you've been lamenting your ex? would it be enough for me to drive there to pick you up, drive back to Chicago for a car show to hang out with my best female friend and then drive you back? would it be enough for me to stay the night especially when you couldn't sleep and drive back early monday morning? would it be enough that I would want to share my everyday with you? would it be enough that I kept you company when you were alone? would it be enough that I actually told you to tell him but you were satisfied on lying to his face about it. would it be enough that I forgave you for blatantly lying to MY face? would it be enough that I forgave you for setting up those traps? would it be enough that I wanted to share things that I liked with you? there are so many other things that I could list but in the end it doesn't really matter.  you never cared and I cared too much.  My "blind facination......and all shallow things" yeah FUCK YOU.  Fuck you for teeling me how I felt.  All that talk that you had for me it was all fluff.  You were just all talk.  You were, you are and you will be.  All the things that you said really didn't mean anything to you.  It was all lip service.  I thought you were better than that.  I guess not.  You're still a fucking kid.  As old as you might like to portray yourself, you are still a fucking child.  You better grow up because California will eat you alive if you don't.  Well, wait, you will probably just get another poor sap like me and use him up and then toss him like a bad habit.  Whatever bitch, I would wish you a good life again but whatever.
