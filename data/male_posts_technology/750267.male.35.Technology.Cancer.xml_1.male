I liked the original idea of Survivor - stick 16 people on a remote island, and through a combination of social interactions and producer-created contests, only one person will eventually be left to win.  Now that several of these shows exist, and in an effort to rescue TV ratings, producers are introducing unexpected twists into these games. Like on Survivor Africa and Survivor Marquesas, when the producers had the teams randomly switch, breaking up strong alliances and upsetting the balance of power in the game.  I can see why they wish to do this - after all, people will tune in when there is a lot of suspense and drama. If one person or team is clearly has a huge advantage, there is often very little suspense or drama.  But despite these ratings related goals, surprise changes in any type of contest are unfair. Imagine if the NFL introduced a new rule during half-time at the Super Bowl that drastically affected the game? Or if the finish line to a marathon were suddenly relocated during the race? Survivor, Big Brother, and all the copy-cat programs are, after all, a contest for real money.   These producers must clearly spell the rules out to the players before the game begins. They can keep the TV audience in suspense, if they must, for TV ratings. But the players should not be surprised by some mysterious twist the producers dreamt up the night before to improve ratings.  If somebody has used a brilliant stategy to build an unbreakable alliance, or in any way gained an upper hand in the contest, the producers have no right to arbitrarily change the way the game works in response.  Just my two cents. Mark Burnett, if your reading, please take note. Scott
