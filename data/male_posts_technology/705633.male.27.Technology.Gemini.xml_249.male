When you have an "I hate my job/ college course/ school" day try this: 1. On your way home from work, stop at your local pharmacy, and go to the thermometer section.  2. You will need to purchase a rectal thermometer made by "Johnson and Johnson." Be very sure you get this brand. 3. When you get home, lock your doors, draw the drapes, and disconnect the phone, so you will not be disturbed during your therapy. 4. Change into something far more comfortable, such as a sweat suit and then lay down on your bed.   5. Open the package and remove the thermometer. Carefully place it on the bedside table so that it will not become chipped or broken.   6. Take out the material that comes with the thermometer and read it. You will notice that in small print there is a statement:    "Every rectal thermometer made by Johnson and Johnson is personally tested"      Now close your eyes and repeat out loud five times:  "I am SO glad I do not work for quality control at the Johnson and Johnson Company"
