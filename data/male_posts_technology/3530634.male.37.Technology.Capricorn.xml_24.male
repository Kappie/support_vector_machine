THE LADY  When I arrived in New York harbor I saw this lady smile at me She knew I came from far away But now invited me to stay  She said” This land is beautiful and free, Come, stay with us, you’re safe with me” Her smile was warm, her arm raised high It carried a torch, a light high in the sky So that all people could see it And understood why  That was many years ago, and she still stands there, tall A wonderful sight and comfort to all She still welcomes people that come to her shore The poor and the rich and she still asks for more The wonderful lady in the land of the free The lady that stands for our Liberty  Copyright: Gerard Verschueren, July 4th 2004
