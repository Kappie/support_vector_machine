I'mtrying, Jackie is trying so come on Tom, Jo and Max, blog!!!!!!!!!!  I didn't get any cards either not that I am bothered because I personally think v-day is a load of cobblers! Its just another excuse to feel special and for people to make money. So for people who don't get anything its worse. :( Anywho, I can't wait for tomorrow! I will probably hide behind someone during the film, I'm sure i'll get scared I always do when I see horror movie type of things! What did ya'll think of the new seats in assembly? Snazzy!!!!!!
