So thats why I made my own forum, to get away from gaia. After all the arguing yesterday, I was inspired! So I wrote an intro to a story called (pause) "Spy Ware Killer" It is about a program talking in first person about his adventures in killing spyware...All I did was write the introduction, so it is no wonderful work of art. Maybe I should (see comments on last post) start writing fanfiction to improve my writing skillz.  ---  I got the title to work, heh, I keep using "> >>) Actually "Elad's hub" is only a place for me to put all my little sites. The MINI SITES tab are pages that are made by anime g33k aka "me" And are affiliated only with the blog. heh, i need to link to those ^^;;.  ---  Please check out my site at the  urlLink hub  even if you are just visiting.  ^_^
