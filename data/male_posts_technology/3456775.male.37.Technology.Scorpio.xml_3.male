I'm not that vain, yet.  I'm so vain, I probably think this blog is about me...Oh, wait! It is. Silly me.   So I will be diary-ifying all of my thoughts on cigars and coffee. And occasionally other topics as I'm compelled.  Most of my upcoming blogs will be on my more active entry into the world of cigars and their accompanying culture. I have smoked cigars quite irregularly from the mid-90's up to about 6 months ago. By irregularly I mean like averaging 5-8 a year and sometimes going 3+ months between cigars.  A brother-in-law is a carpenter and we started discussing building ourselves personal humidors. We were tired of one-offing under humidified cigars for way too much money. My research into humidor construction and characteristics exposed me to the intriguing cigar culture in general. I'm just getting to know it so most of my blogs will undoubtedly have a newbie flavor. Oh well, we all start somewhere.  I've also been drinking coffee since the mid 90's and have formed all sorts of opinions about it and its consumer and producer cultures, as well.  But enough of my yappin'! Let's boogie!
