Futilely thinking that a day and a half of rest would correct any of that ache I felt, I went back to running tonight.  My intent was to complete a 30 in the glorious cold.  I made it a whopping 3 minutes before I had to stop or hurt myself worse.  All totaled, my run/walk tonight lasted 7 minutes and left me clamoring for cross training alternatives that I could do while my knee heals again!  The beauty of being in college and having well-to-do siblings is you have many alternatives.  I am now forced to alter my schedule (just daily schedule, not training schedule) so that I can work out either at the rec center or my sister's house.  It's not too big of a deal, just a hassle.  I really stinkin' want to run! outside!
