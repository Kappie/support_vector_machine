My next project just popped up in my head. I am gonna make a little theater/arcade section of my blog. It will have games like shinobu (see previous post) and little flash movies and such.  In math we are doing this little project on an animal that we have to make out of geometric shapes...I am doing an elephant and i need to go to the store.    the truth.
