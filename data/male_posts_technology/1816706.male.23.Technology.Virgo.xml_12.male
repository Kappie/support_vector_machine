It was a decent beach, not too many people on it, but it was overcast, and too many waves for snorkeling.  Headed to the very top of the island and went to his cave that is underwater that is called the “Blue Room”.  There is a little opening at the top of the cave where you enter, then you climb down some rocks and there is an underwater natural spring water pool for you to swim in.  Sometimes the way the sun enters the room and reflects off the pool and the roof of the cave it gives the entire a cave a blue tint to it.  It was ok while we were there, but the water level was a little low so it wasn’t as great, still pretty cool though.  After that we checked out Ke’e beach which is at the top of the island and also the start of the Na Pali coast trail.  Stayed out there and soaked up some rays for a while.  On the way back down we checked out this other place that’s kinda hard to find called the “Queens Bath”.  It’s on the North shore still but weathering from the water has created a nice little pool in the middle of some lava rocks, and it replenishes itself with sea water when the waves come in.  There is decent snorkeling there when the waves aren’t too crazy, which while we were there, they were.  Headed back to the town of Lihue to have some more Saimin for a late lunch.  Hey!  I told you it was good!
