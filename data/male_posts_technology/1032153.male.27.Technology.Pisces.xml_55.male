I don't start work until 2:00pm tomorrow, so I have a free morning, which will be good to utilise.   Prayer Box  I remember once, somebody talking about a box they had with a slot at the top. They would write down prayer concerns or worries they had, and insert them in the box, and pray about them, committing them to God. I have constructed my own little prayer box out of a 'punished' memphis meltdowns box (not the three pack... we're talking about the big packs here...). Well the person who mentioned this said that after a few months of inserting prayer needs into the box, they would crack it open, and read what they had prayed about. Apparently it was such a blessing to see how God had answered so many prayer concerns.    Jono's Blog   urlLink Jono  goes hard on the topic of men. Go Jono! Sock it to 'em. Truth is truth, and while it should be said with Grace... it should be said; period.    1000  On the 12th of August, you guys are going to make this blog tick over the 1000 visits mark. Wish that were comments already!
