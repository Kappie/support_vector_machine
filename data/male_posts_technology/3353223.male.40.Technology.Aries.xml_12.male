I wonder how I will get on with this blog. I did try starting one before when I first moved to Christchurch from Wellington but I did not have the tools to make that easy - no high speed internet from home and no easy content manager of my own, just some simple scripts under Cygwin and VIM.  Perhaps things will be different this time around?
