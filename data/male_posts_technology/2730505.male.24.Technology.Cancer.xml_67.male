There was shit talking galore when we were playing Halo over the weekend.  We played Team Slayer on one of the larger maps (the one with the snow) and that was fun.  First to 50 TEAM kills wins the whole thing.  It's great when you and your team mate have figured out how to play together.  Someone take point to draw out some of the initial fire and the other person backs the point man up.  It's such a beautiful system.  The first guy has to have some sort of sheild to take a direct sniper rifle shot and the second guy has to be observant enough to pick up on where the shot is coming from.  Yeah there is some form of screen watching here but it doesn't play as huge as role as in Golden Eye.  Once you and your team mate have found some sort of rhythm and keep the players on the other team separated, it's going to be a quick game.  We also played EA Basketball 2004 this weekend.  I suck at that.  I mean I can play it but once the other team gets hot it seems that there is nothing in the world that I can do to cool them off.  I mean Baron Davis scored 60 point me.  He scored 60 on like 15 of 18 from the line.  Now that is absurd.  I guess I better practice on the basketball if I have any aspirations of being as good in basketball as Halo.  Today, I will be getting some of my shit ready so I can start to ship that shit out to the new apartment.  I think I will be leaving a lot of the baby stuff at my parents house.  I will be going through some of my old clothes and shit that I don't think I need and put them in a bag for the Salvation Army.  I gotta get my damn bills into some sort of filing system that will be easy to move out of.  I also gotta make sure to study the closet to make sure I can still take that thing down and hopefully move it out before I move out.  While I am at that might as well take a look at my fouton and see how it goes together.  Yeah I guess there is a lot of shit to do after work today to keep me busy.  I just hope that there is something not boring to do at work you know?
