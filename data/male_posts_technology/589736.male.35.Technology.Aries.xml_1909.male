Same with why they chose not to destroy Zion -- because inevitably the cycle would repeat, and they'd have to do it again.  The Oracle allowed Smith to absorb her so that she could help Neo when he confronted Smith in the final battle; she was left behind when Smith was destroyed.  Speaking for yelahneb:  Ben's theory is that Neo has been altered with cyborg-like implants that allow him to connect with the machines.  I'm not satisfied with this interpretation, but I haven't come up with anything more satisfying myself.  In general, it seemed to me that the goal was not victory/defeat (1 or 0), but the breaking of a cycle: something that was neither 1 nor 0.
