We went to  urlLink CMTS  to help out with whatever they needed - detailing cars, mowing lawns, etc.  It was really fun, the kids worked hard, and they loved hearing from the director, Andy. Here are my notes from conversations with Andy, it was cool to bump up along someone who lives such a life of faith and sees God provide so readily. ===  the kids fell in love with him  crazy stories about God providing and walking in faith property obtained for $175K  downflow paint module - $50K new, got it for $400  God speaks audibly, the clearer the voice the harder the task  We circumvent God doing miracles We don't let God work that way in America  Story - Peru driving in mud road Nancy asks is something wrong with the car He gets out to look One wheel has totally fallen off It's 300 feet behind them Totally destroyed In the middle of nowhere, nobody is going to come around They pray A land rover shows up The guy asks if they need help You could take me up to the river, so I can go across on a ferry and get a repalacement wheel The guy takes him, waits for him, brings him back, helps him put the new wheel on his truck Then he hands him his business card, goes back the way he came from His name was "Angel Mendez" and he supposedly worked at a local bank. Andy never did check at the bank...  ===  Here is the followup thank you letter for the people that prayed for us.  ===  Dear friends,  Thank you so much for praying for the middle school missions trip. I believe we accomplished our primary goal - to blow away the image of a stereotypical missionary. We went to Christian Missions Technical Services in Bernville, PA to serve Andy and Nancy Merrick for a weekend.  The Merricks were missionary mechanics with Wycliffe Bible Translators and on the field, got a vision for bringing that kind of technical service back to the States to serve missionaries on the field.  They have been in operations now for 21 years and their primary tasks include servicing vehicles and machinery for missionaries both state side and overseas.  They also allow missionaries to use their property on furlough and travels, and obtain and send specialized equipment to the mission field. Our time there included cleaning and detailing some of their fleet of vehicles, basic lawn maintenance and odd jobs on their property.  We also spent time listening to some of Andy's amazing stories of how God speaks, how God provides and how God enables. Our students fell in love with the Merricks and they were captivated by how far reaching the CMTS impact is, and how they were able to be a part of that for a short weekend, accomplishing our original goal. So, thank you for faithfully praying for this trip.  Your partnership in the sending and enabling of these students was vital.
