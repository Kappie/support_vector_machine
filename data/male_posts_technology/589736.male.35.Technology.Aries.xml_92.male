On the other, he appeared to be working for Dooku to assassinate Amidala.  But Dooku was building the droid army that the clones fought.  Was he just playing for both sides?  2)  Who was/is Sipha Dious?  My spelling is made up, and this question is not my own, but if you take out the "pha", what do you have left?  Sidious.  Coincidence?  3)  Why was Palpatine/Sidious creating two armies that were destined to fight each other?  Did anyone think about the fact that the Seperatists may actually be the beginning seeds of the Rebellion?  If so, how ironic is it that the future rebellion was responsible for the death of so many Jedi?  All in all it was an ok movie, but I find myself agreeing with Johnnathan on a movie for a change.  Alot of what we saw happened because it had to happen.  It was more like riding a roller coaster (i.e. being on a track) than it was going exploring in a big old gas guzzling SUV.
