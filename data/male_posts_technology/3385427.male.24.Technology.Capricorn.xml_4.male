Onb the last laps Button pushed the race to it's limits when he came within 0.4 seconds of Trulli. Rubins Barrichello finished in a comfortable third behind Button. Only nine racers remained in the last five laps with Ralph Schumacher having to pull out. It was Trulli's first F1 win and a well deserved one at that.
