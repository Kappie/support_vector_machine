Had to shift the timing instead of at night because at night i had to go to church and do some calling of people. So basically i met Andrew and believe it or not, i've met him for 17 times at McDonalds!!!! Oh my..i'm glad there is McDonalds..at least they are providing us a place to do bible study..hehehe. Anyway, for the calilng part, we had to do calling to those people who attended the seminars by Peter Jack and Jon Paulien. They came to singapore earlier this year to give free seminars about lifestyle(Peter Jack) and the book of Revelation (Jon Paulien). So a group of us decided to go down to church and call those people together. It sure was fun when it started. I was given 20 people to call and the first 3 i called expressed interest in what we were promoting (the free loan of the Search DVDs by Geoff Youlden, another good speaker). So i felt i was in this telemarketing job and it was really fun calling and talking to people and promoting about my "product". I guess this is the only kind of sales i'll be interested in as other kinds like insurance and MLMs don't give me much of a motivation to be part of it. They somehow do it only for the money or whatever, but for this it's doing something for the benefit of people. That's why when we called them, some people asked why we were doing this, and so i replied that it was a community service and our goal is to improve the lives of singaporeans through health and lifetyle and also exploring life's issues. Out of the 20 people, 4 of them were interested for the DVDs and so i'll have to go down personally to deliver it to them. And as for the rest, i think the majority didn't answer the call. Guess i'll have to call them up again next week where we will be doing this calling session again. Fun fun fun.  And my friend from Accenture called me earlier on and told me there's a job opening there. He was telling me they are always seeking fresh graduates and the job sounding exciting. 5 day work week and working with different projects throughout the year. Hmm..i told him i couldn't take it yet as i'm doing some project work now so that will put my job search 2 months back. Well, i hope to complete my current project for Youngberg Wellness Center and then i'll have more fun searching for a nice job. Their website wasn't even listed in the search engine!! Oh my, i'm going to make it listed and bring in some business for them..hehehe..think of the potential for $$$$$  Oh well, tomorrow is shuqin's graduation. Another fun time! hahaa..this time she'll get the chance to do funny poses and maybe i'll post it up here later.  Tomorrow night i'll be having badminton again with some skillful people. Hmm...since i have tennis pics here, i think i should have other pics of the other sports that i do. Well that's all for now.
