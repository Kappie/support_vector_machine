She says that she is listening to her  inner voice and I don't understand what she heard. Anyway, good for her and good for India. If she became the PM, I'm sure that most of the educated middle class will come out and vote in the next election. Finally, Manmohan Singh became the first Sikh PM of India. Hope Sonia is not doing what Jayalalitha did in TN a couple of years back. We don't want a dummy PM with Sonia calling the shots.  The next thing I didn't understand is why Pak Prez Musharaff invited Sonia Maino to visit Pak, before inviting the PM. I think he understands Indian politics better.  Chennai had a very good summer this year, with occassional rains and clouds. The monsoon started in Kerala a bit earlier and I was lucky enough to enjoy some rain there.  My uncle is getting married on 27th and I've now reached the front of the queue. The pressure is now really mounting on me.
