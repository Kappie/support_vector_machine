Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).    Ok..its a Swiss 20 rappen piece from 1980.  Ah in 1980, my father bought our first home computer, and my life definitely took a slant in the geeky direction ;)    What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?   I guess I think of the concept of a real life, one outside with others and with a real significant other.no computers or geeky engineering stuff that I spend my day doing.   What is the most honest thing you have done?   Call to the police to admit that I had made a prank phone call that had gone to far. I had to go to court because of it for "false reporting to authorities," but got let off.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?   Hmm..usually its try and organize my place or at least make a bit of progress with it.  If I am not at home though, I guess its just to catch up on a bit of reading    If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?   Hmm..the speed bump I have to go over with my bike on my way to work and back.   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?   Probably for a group of people that I cared about. I guess movies like Titanic try to make it look noble to sacrifice your life that way.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?   Thanks.  Hey, it was one interesting experience ;)   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?   Any of those pay per minute chat line ads that get repeated over and over during late night tv.   What was your first job?   Ok..outside of various yardwork type jobs, it would have been fabricating ceramic superconductors in a laboratory.   Finish the sentence: “I have never…”  done an illegal drug   Ok..through that list of questions.  So what else is new besides having laid bare several aspects of my life, I finally worked up the courage to phone a woman up for a lunch date.  Although she told me she usually did not go to lunch, she agreed to make an exception in my case..so I was relieved there...still gotta set the date though.  Everyone seems to be going on vacation at work except me.  Looks like I may get stuck trying to figure out what to do with an intern whose boss will be gone for a month. Oh well, I am sure there is slave labor to be found
