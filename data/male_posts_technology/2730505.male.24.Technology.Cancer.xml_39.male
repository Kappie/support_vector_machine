Then Saturday we get to go to St. Joe's for dinner and a movie with the Pokorskis.  Haven't seen them for quite a while either.  Ahh, North Beach.  Home to the $3 pitchers and darts.  Good times.  Gotta do laundry tonight to have clean clothes for the weekend and then go out for a little while to whoop ass in darts.  Ain't no one around that can step up yet.  Maybe that will change tonight.  I got a few things to do tomorrow so that should keep me busy.  I have this one request to move a person upstairs, set their phone up and their terminal and then move the other guy to where this guy moved from as well as bringing his phone over with his monitor.  Then after a month, they're going to move back to their old spots.  What the fuck is that shit?  Can't they just stay there since they're going to be there for just a month?  Whatever.  Well better go home and start the laundry.  No time after this.
