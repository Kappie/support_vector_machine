One difference I see is what happened in the 1994 and 2002 mid-tem elections.  Historically, the party out of power gains seats in Congress in the mid-terms.  In 1994, that paragon of virtue (tic) Newt Gingrich managed to energize the Republicans on a national level to take back the House for the first time in 40 or so years.  He then of course proceeded to blow his momentum and hand Clinton the White House in 1996 through a number of missteps.  Fast forward to 2002, and Gephardt (sp?) was banking on retaking control of the House and firming control of the Senate.  Instead, the House remainined in Republican control and the Senate went back to the Republicans.  What does that mean for the upcoming election?  Probably not a damn thing, but it is a difference.  I do have to laugh at the Democrats first harping on the fact the Iraq was going to be a military disaster, which it was not.  Then they latched on to the economy being terrible, but now it is recovering very nicely.  So now they are back to Iraq and the post "war" efforts and saying we need to get things under control.  But, I am not hearing many solutions, just pointing out the problems, which I fully agree are there.  Angie - Thanks, that makes me much less afraid of Dean.  I did not know he is a doctor.  I have not heard any of Dean's details on the medical front and will not pay attention to them unless and until he becomes the actual nominee.  But, one concern I have of government mandates on things like insurance and medicine, is that it smacks of socialism.  Canada has socialized medicine.  Everyone is covered and the quality of care is good from what I have witnessed.  The problem is with availability of some forms of treatment.  My mother, who handles the insurance for her doctor's office and has many chronic ailments (lupus, arthritis), told me the waiting list for heart catheterization is about 18 months in Canada.  The problem is, when someone needs that procedure, they need it pretty much imediately.  Most people don't survive 18 months, so they travel to the US and pony up the cash to have it done here.  I guess my point is, for right or wrong, profit is what drives most things in this country.  The insurance companies and doctors have to be able to profit from their work or they will do something else, creating a shortage.  I will be curious to see how he addressed this in Vermont.  If the government steps in much further, I am afraid that our medical system will be hurt severly.  Case in point of the profit driven results is Viagra.  I'm sure that there were many other diseases/conditions that Pfizer could have researched besides male impotence.  But, look at the original target "audience" - Middle Aged White Males.  They knew that they would be able to make a proverbial killing from the general affluence of that market.  In the meantime, research into chronic illnesses go underfunded or totally unresearched.  Mir - I would hope that we will utilize Iraqis as much as possible.  However, given the magnitude of the problems that need to be addressed, I doubt that they have the numbers and/or specialties necessary to do it all.  If we are talking road and bridge work, I would assume that the Iraqis have the ability to do those.  But, if we are talking about updating the electrical system nationwide, they probably don't.  Heck, given what happened here over the summer, you could say that neither the US or Canada do either.
