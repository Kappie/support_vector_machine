Well done!! Everyone knew you can do it!!!!!!!   This is a super important milestone for you.  Celebrate as much and as hard as you can~~~   Too bad I couldn't be there celebrating with you... but you know I'm so happy for you as well.  -------------------------------------------------------------  2ndly...   Will the damn slow turtle Typhoon ever come?   This morning I've meet the most incredible Sunny-Rain.  It was broad day-light and the sun is shining as hard as every other morning.  The sky was blue with a few clouds here and there, yet, if you feel closely, "THERE ARE RAINDROPS!!"  Thanks to the typhoon, that was an incredible weather...  -------------------------------------------------------------  3rdly, today is the first day this week i'm only 15 min. late to office...  That's not as noteworthy as the last 2... but...
