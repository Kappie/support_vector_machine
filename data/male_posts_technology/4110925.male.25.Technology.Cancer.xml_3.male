Here, a blog where I should dump everything that came across my mind.  I was thinking what topic should I put in to get people to notice my blog, but I am not very updated with the latest world news nor celebrity gossip. But title does suggest something sexual do attract my attention (I think it have the same effect to 99.99% of the world population as well), but I don't have many "goodies" of  exotic materials to share with you nor do I write sexual stories.  Hey, what the heck. I am not making any money out of this, might as well write something which I am interested and comfortable with. I think I would be happy even if I have only one reader (Yes! You are lucky No.1). I forsee it will be filled with my thoughts and a lot of unanswered questions. Every posting should be KISS-compliant. Anyone interesed?
