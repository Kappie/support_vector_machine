Check out the downloads section, as they have some links to some useful resources. If you enjoy world building, take a look at their templates and see if any of your material is a fit for submission or start writing something that you can contribute to the project.  A quick snippet from their FAQ...   What is the Fargoth World Building Project?   The Fargoth World Building Project is a collaborative effort of interested people, working to design a generic fantasy role playing setting, which any game system could take advantage of. We have opted for Generic over a specific format for several reasons. First, it was felt that the project would appeal to more contributors if we did not force them to channel their creative energies into a specific game system. This also allows the project to be accessed by a much wider variety of people! To date we know of several game systems being operated in the existing elements already created. The other major reason we opted to stay generic is that we felt it unlikely that all of the members could ever agree on a single game system! Like any other large diverse group, each of us has his or her likes and dislikes when it comes to game systems and to avoid infighting we stayed away from the whole subject!    sh0
