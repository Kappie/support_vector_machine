For the last few months we've either slept at her house or mine...I woke up this morning with "The Big Lebowski" still playing and me cuddling her pillow. I'm not saying I'm a sap, but I did miss her alot....We've spent one other day away from each other in the last 3 months...you kinda get used to her being there.  Anyhow, on to something else..  My car is in the shop, I drive a Hyundai Tiburon, v6, 6 speed...pretty sweet...I drove a Nissan Hardbody and a Frontier before that...till one's transmission went out and the other had an untimely run-in with a Backo (Hillbilly equipment.) They gave me a 05' Nissan Altima as a loaner...I have no insurance on it...I know someone is going to hit me...  I also missed my payment last month, so I'm hoping to get a loan from my job to cover it...it's no big deal except someone doesn't think I should get it seeing I already have one. I'm almost done paying it off and it's not like I only make $50 a week...so I'm stressed out of my mind right now.  Other than that...work is just stressful...I have the feeling there's upper managment in my department trying to give me any trouble they can find and I'm in a constant worry I'll be fired. I work my ass off and please everyone...which is a big friggin' deal since I take care of the CEO, COO, CFO, and President of the Board...not to mention the owner...this is a Fortune 500 company as well...  Anyhow...I'm done for now...I need coffee and I have some issues to close...later for now...sorry, it's early and I'm tired...I'm not trying to be funny just yet.
