Jesus teaches about the Good Shepherd in chapter 10 as a response to a question from the Jews: "Are we blind too?".  His episode with the woman caught in adultery (8:1-11) comes sandwiched in between arguments with the Jews, and furthers the debate.  Why is all this arguing necessary?  Why doesn't John just teach us about Jesus for who He is?    Here's an answer I'd like to propose.  John does this in part because he understands the continuity of the New Covenant with Old Testament religion.  If Jesus were bringing a completely new administration of religion to earth, why not just ignore the old ones?  Jesus didn't spend a lot of time pointing out the religious hypocrisies and sins of the ancient prosititution cults, for instance.  Jesus attacks the Jews because they are the administrators of the Covenant as it stands in His day, and they are wicked shepherds and hired hands.  He is rescuing the Covenant of God from those who hate God and returning it to those who love Him.    And in the process, Jesus shows us how He is greater than the externals of Old Testament religion.  He is greater than Moses, because He wrote the Law.  He is greater than the Temple, because He can raise it up and destroy it.  He is greater than the priests because He has the authority to pass judgment in the Temple.  He is greater that these things in the same way that an object is greater than its shadow.  He is not replacing the old, but bringing it into the Light.
