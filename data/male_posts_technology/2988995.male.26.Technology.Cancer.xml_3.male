I guess you have not understand the gravity of the  situation or I am sure u  would have acted ,so I'm explaining in detail.  sure have and i'm u know a real good "actor" when it  comes to "work"   I stay in this place which has no access to buses  and autorickshaws dont go  beyond a point. Even with a 1.5 time tariff they do  not agree to ply tht  side.  thought u were from chennai. a madrasi da machch. ever  heard of tambaram????? or for that matter a.m.jain????  "where autos dare"  I invariably get delayed in the office and  after 11 in the night there  is no one to ask for directions too. I got lost on  friday and it was close to  11.00 in the night and I was surrounded by a mob of  mad dogs.  aaaww, cmon venk!!! thought u had already "gone to the  dogs"  It was really  frightening and I have no idea how i escaped.  nice one again!! better luck next time. i meant that  for the dogs, that is!!   I have to stay in tht house cos my mom requested  some relatives and they  agreed to allow me to stay there.  ok, let me be more considerate and wish u better luck  for this one!!!
