Also, I bought a Gamecube, and there's nothing like playing a brand new video game in it. Where is this leading to? I consider myself to be a geek, as I love anything that has to do with computers or video games. So it's no wonder I'm happy about the release of a new  browser .  That's right, the brand new  urlLink Mozilla Firefox 0.9  has been released. For those who haven't heard of it, it's an alternate browser to Microsoft's Internet Explorer, with lot a nice features built in. It includes a pop-up blocker, for all those people who enter those sites for "educational purposes" and get a screen full of pop-ups. My favorite addition to this browser is the tabbed browsing feature. Instead of opening 10 different browser windows, you can have only one window open, with multiple tabs on top to flip to another site. It works perfectly, even with different plugins, like Adobe Reader.  Seriously, for those of you who haven't tried this browser, give it a go. You have nothing to lose, besides moving from one browser to another. Or at least let your friends know about it. And in case you've been looking for an E-Mail client to go with the new browser, check out  urlLink Mozilla Thunderbird . By the way, did I mention both of these products are  completely free ? Isn't that the greatest!  Well, take care, happy downloading and have a great day test-driving the new browser!
