 It's just that lately life has been a lot less inspirin'.  --  Simply Cee-Lo Green 
 
 I learn as I go.  I wish wisdom could be bottled and sold.  Can you imagine the price that would fetch?  I've found myself smack in the middle of a very important life lesson of late.  People are not always motivated by the obvious.  I'm not sure why my QA manager decided to search extensively for a reason that would prevent us from releasing our product to beta testers today.  I don't understand why my friend's girlfriend decided to stir things up between me and my fiance today.  Are people stupid, or are they working on some yet undiscovered set of logic?  I can understand idealism motivating someone.  I can understand being motivated by money and power.  Sometimes reality is what drives someone.  But I have to admit that I am totally at a loss when people make decisions that obviously hurt everybody and help nobody.  I suppose there are depressed people out there who just want to drag you down to their level.  They see you succeeding.  They see that you are happy and they want to be equal with you.  Instead of rising up, they can only drag you down.  But that can't possibly be the only answer.  Sometimes you just can't tell what drives a person.  That's scary.  Especially when that person has a lot of power.  Our QA team managed to hold the project hostage for over 72 hours.  It looks like we are good to go in the morning, but any more delay could have meant people's heads.  But the worst part is when the person just won't tell you why they do the things they do.  Then you're left to wonder, to guess, to speculate...and this only makes you paranoid.  Does this person have something against me?  Did I do something to piss this person off?  Is this person jealous?  Is he just setting me up to fail?  Is he using me to attack someone else?  That's the worst.  Am I a pawn in someone else's game?  I must be making some sort of basic fundamental assumption that is miguiding me in my analysis.  What am I assuming?  I assume that the person is mentally stable, and logical, and competent at what he or she does.  Maybe that's too much.  Because this implies that the reasoning behind any decision is rational, which is probably not the case.  I should let the torch shine on my own inner workings, though.  How stable am I right now?  I think I'm okay.  I'm a little stressed by this mess of a release at work.  :: [ASIDE]  Can you believe that this is the "good project" of the two products I'm managing? ::   If I'm stable, then what else can it be?  Is it that I just don't understand what's going on?  Is it over my head?  "If I'm reading this right, and I like to think that I am..."  It's more than possible.  I can't claim to be able to play the political game at the highest levels.  Let's be honest.  I am an unarmed, (not quite so) innocent bystander in those types of battles.  But these instances are not being played at a high level.  One situation involves a kooky girl who is desperate to get married and has a well documented history of pissing people off that's longer than my...well, let's just say it's long.  The other situation involves a minor player in his organization.  He also has a well known reputation for pissing people off in the same way.  So if it's not me...if other people have the same problems, then it must be them.  What makes them tick?  What makes them insist on ticking me off?  Will they ever let me in on their secret, or am I destined to never know.  That might kill me.  Now I wish I could drink a bottle of wisdom elixor and just understand.  I'm going to go check 7-11.
