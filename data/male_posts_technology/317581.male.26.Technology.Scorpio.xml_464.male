I wish I weren't just starting out. I wish I could trust myself to not have an irrational jealousy. I wish I could say, goodluck, I want to hear all the details. I want you to be happy no matter what. I wish I could say, Oh he sounds like quite a catch and not hate him with every fiber of my being. I wish I could stay close intimate friends. I know that my love lasts forever. At least I know it's lasted since 13, and I am prepared to carry love in my heart for another 100 + years of my life.  I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss my friends deeply. We are spread out by jealousy and a few oceans. I was asked what I would do if I can do anything I was tonight, no penalties, no reprisals, and the cost is unimportant. What would I do? My answer was the I would call ALL my friends (past  present) and schedule a party at a local restaurant. We would have dinner and chat. I would make sure they knew they could bring their friends and I would make new friends and be able to catch up with all my old friends.  Trully, that is what I dream that heaven would be like. Hanging with all the people I've been friends with and just talking and telling stories. Course my life goal is to have people say that I was a good man and a good friend, a good father and an excellent husband. But maybe I'll never know about that. All I can do is be the best man I know how to be, and that means hurting sometimes.  Well, I should go to bed and/or practice the piano. Oh, and I got new glasses. Peace-
