But actually im still very disoriented by all the things i have to do, day in, day out. There are so many things that needs my attention that in the bafflement i find myself attending to none. With only work and home to take care (remember no social life, no girlfriend, no family) im not able to meet the expectations. I cant even begin to imagine what is goin to happen when i would be asked to take decisions at office and at home. My mom words always surfaces during these lean times: "You are the most irresponsible person i have ever known". Quite reassuring. It cant get worse than that. Can it?  So as i try to comprehend why SqlInt32 cannot be passed from a COM component to a web service, my roommate calls and reminds me that we are out of bottled-water and the maid is not washing our clothes properly. And i write my observation on SqlInt32 and send it to the client: "So it is by design that SqlInt32 cannot be serialized that makes them a bad candidate for web service input parameters. So the way out is to order a water-bubble every week and get a new maid."  That day my GL asked why did i change a link in the Design document to point to sidin.blogspot.com and why why in the world did i sign the mails Smitha. Boy, im loosing my grip or what? I had to convince my GL that some colleague is playing a practical joke. I took a lot of effort to sell him that. My aptitude acumen is at its all time nadir. 8 X 3 = : im bowled. And im supposed to crack CAT this November. Yeah there will be a crack alright.. one through my head. Visiting time - 10 to 4: Gunaseelam Mental hospital. All in all i think im doing a great job balancing the whole thing.   P.S: There is atleast one lie in each sentence above.
