And apparently Barbara Ehrenreich of the New York Times agrees with me.     urlLink t r u t h o u t - Barbara Ehrenreich It's Over, Ralph   She brings up some good points. Such as how Ralph is not with the Green party this year, so he can't claim that he is running his campaign to further their agenda, as he did in 2000. Not only that but he has courted the Reform party, who ran Pat Buchanan (who many call a bigot, or worse) in 2000. Then you try the New Alliance party. And you have relied on Conservative supporters who only want you in the race to get their guy "georgie shrub" elected.    Well I digress.    Ok a few more....     urlLink t r u t h o u t - Regime Change in Iran Now in Bush's Sights   Take this story however you want. It looks like we may be setting our sites on Iran now. I'm not sure what to make of this. One side is that the 9/11 Commission is expected to say in its report that there ARE links between IraN and al-Qaeda. Well you can then ask why did we attack IraQ when it looks like IraN was a country that seemed to have actually helped the 9/11 hijackers. Oh well, the other side, is that well, if IraN did do this, then we need to go after them.    Ok lastly.     urlLink t r u t h o u t - Newsweek Calls Allawi "Iraq's New S.O.B."   This article reports some scary things about the "new Iraq" and the leader that we have installed there. There are some reports that the Prime Minister may have personally executed some prisoners or had prisoners executed without trial. It seems that his government and the people of Iraq actually seem to be leaning towards a dictatorship, over freedom. Hmmmm....
