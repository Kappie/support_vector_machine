It all depends how much versatile u could show urself off (even if u aren't that much)... Knowledge and the perceived importance of English is not just a question of knowing "one more" language but a mandatory one.   With due respects to the mother-tongue, there's always a comparison with countries like Japan where English knowledge is scarce but still they are growing and are more respected economies than India. But one thing we must remember is that we did not have the same past nor a similar present. We have been dependent on the West for most of our past, and continue to do so. Some industries (like the Hardware ones) are well established there and they are the most respected manufacturers in the world. But India lacks the infrastructure to be as big in many of areas owing a lot to lower levels of education, poverty etc etc... the never ending list...  So, atleast as far as the current scenario goes (which is likely to extend atleast for a few decades) we cannot afford to take our own stand simply because we are still a dependent nation to a very significant extent...
