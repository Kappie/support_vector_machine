(a) my eyedrops are down to 3 a day from 8 (b) I can get a new prescription for glasses  Additionally, the balance changes for  Heroland  worked, for the most part.  I still need to work on how much powers cost to use, and how much power a player has available to use them.  Managed to get some time on  UFO: Aftermath , and saw the crazy "Collapsible Railgun" in action.  Basically, its a mobile fire support weapon of hideous range and power... BUT... the trooper assigned to it is reduced to a crawl.  Not the best of situations if you're on the receiving end of an alien acid missile.  Also managed to kill  Incubation  by installing the mission pack.  Fixed it by deleting the whole lot and reinstalling.  Sadly, after the first few missions, it becomes veeerrrrrrry boring.  In the long term, things are looking grim.  For me, anyway.  Not a good sign.
