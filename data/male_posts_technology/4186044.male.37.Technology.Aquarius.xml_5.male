Mind you, I have no intention of changing my party affiliation, nor do I have a problem with the Libertarian party candidates or platform.  It's merely because I believe that the greatest danger facing the country today is George W. Bush.  W is the most inept moron to steer the helm of this country. Ever.  Today we have a president who ignores terrorism to fight a "revenge" war, a president who can't even properly speak the English language, and a president who has no desire to seek the consensus of the United Nations.  I think Dave Letterman was right on the money when he said "George W. Bush - the president Dan Quayle we never had."   I urge everyone to go out and vote. Don't let the RNC or the Supreme Court decide this election. Please.  No more years!
