We both got early next morning, went for a car wash and then we were off to redwood park. I wasn't aware of this big hike, so i ate very little for breakfast :( so I was very tired when i hiked in redwood state park. It was very beautiful but the climb was tough for me. here is the map(approx. 4.3 miles):    . Came home took a quick shower, ate something and ran to the movie. Movie was awesome. I loved everybit of it. There was lot of missing info, since i read the book, i filled in the gaps for ag. Then, we had a very lazy sunday morning, went to REI and got something for our kayak and went for a walk. Saw a bit of "EuroTrip" movie. It was funny, arvind was laughing his heart out...its funny to see arvind laugh like that. O yeah, lakers lost. Cant wait for game 2. Catch you all soon!:)
