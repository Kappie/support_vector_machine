It's a  solstice .   urlLink Solstice revellers watched sunrise  from the Stonehenge in England, which is considered to be of particular significance as many believe that the site was built as an observatory thousands of years ago.  By the way... I really am experiencing the longest day as I wait expectantly for my copy of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix to be shipped to me!!
