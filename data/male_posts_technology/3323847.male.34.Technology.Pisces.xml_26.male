As mentioned in the article, some folks would give up their passwords for a simple bar of chocolate.  If you fall into this category, please do yourself and the rest of us a favour and donate your computer to  urlLink GoodWill .  In this day and age when people are  supposedly  so concerned about their privacy, it's amazing to me how easily it is to get people to devulge their personal information.  I see it daily in my job, and the contradiction never ceases to amaze me.  (On a side note,  this  is Step 1 of most computer hacking out there, and it's called  urlLink Social Engineering ).
