No complaints abt the job. Good sal, growing company, excellent work culture, and no dress code (i like the last the most among everything). But is this what I want ?   Shud gear up for AIMCAT 503 this Sunday. Still having a couple of chapters to finish in Math. Also shud tune my DI fundas.  Spent the last one hr at Office working on my blog. Some cosmetic work. Am trying to get the shoutbox and side bar proper.   So tomorrow Ind vs SL and my office recreation club is again telecasting the match for us. Telecasting matches in our office has a bad influence on the performance of Indian team. Everytime they show matches, India lose badly. Shud do something abt this. Planning to leave early tomorrow from office.  I have seen some blogs wonderfully written. Mine would not be upto that standard (am being humble here). I wud defenitely try to emulate those standards.  This post is so incoherent. Well, am half asleep and before I bang my head on the Keyboard,"GOOD Nite"
