I always thought that the things that Bush and Cheney said while campaigning in 2000 differs significantly from their stands on issues now.  They ran on a more moderate ticket, and then barely won the election (or not, however you look at it).  And then instead of embracing the other side, since it was such a dead heat, they just went head first into a super conservative stance on everything.  Seems like a slap in the face to decency.  I mean his "address" to the nation was how he was going to work to reach "across the aisle" to democrats.  How far from the truth that was.  Also I want to address the public discussions about possible terrorist threats to the election and so called plans to reschedule the election.  I am really concerned here.  Also the general discussion on how Tom Ridge seems to be calling these news conferences at very coincidental times to give "no new information".  But alas I need to go to bed I think.  I will try to address those points in the morning.
