And, no, I was NOT in prison for this period … The reasons for my revival as a blogger are numerous:  Recently I became a great fan of blog reading. I started using SharpReader (if you don’t have a RSS aggregator, try it) and get subscribed to more than 20 blogs (primarily software development oriented). So the idea blogging got in my mind again.   Moreover my friend Hristo Deshev (also a developer) started recently his  urlLink blog . And it was powered with Blogger, too. And trust me, when you have someone doing the same things as you, this is a great motivation. You can discuss details about the common activity and deepen your understanding of the matter. So after a talk with him on the ICQ, I signed-in in Blogger and (1) updated my template to a great looking one (2) enabled syndication of my blog to make happy all RSS/Atom users (3) set various other settings to make my blog more usable. Later I even modified the template to add additional links in the right section (argh, I am not accustomed to writing HTML code) and enabled commenting as a reaction to Hristo’s request (NB: only registered users allowed to post comments).   And this is not all. I also have registered recently the domain  urlLink  ivanmitev.com   so even though I don’t have web hosting, I have enabled forwarding to my blog. He-he, masking is enabled too, so it looks like that you are browsing pages in my domain, but in fact you are in  urlLink  immitev.blogspot.com   .   As Deshev points out, maintaining a blog in English, keeps your English writing skills at an acceptable level, so this is another reason to blog, though it may be a bit annoying for Bulgarian readers.
