I'd been working (sad, I know) and walked around about half one. There was about six lads in the Follies uniform (crap Ralph Lauren shirt, with spilt drink and diced carrot motif next to the little dude on the horse) who were rolling from one side of the club to the other. It was like something outta 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. I slid up to the bar, trying to look drunk and like I wasn't alone waiting for somebody. Then I was spotted by a fifty-something Anne Robinson lookalike. She made her slippery way across the dancefloor towards me, licking her lips (I shit you not). I made a quick exit by ducking behind a depressed looking hen party and got the hell out of there...
