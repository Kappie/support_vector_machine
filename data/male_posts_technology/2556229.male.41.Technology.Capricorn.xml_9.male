Alan Keyes is apparently being wooed by the Illinois GOP desperadoes to run against him. They are also considering homophobe and former bush administration Drug under-Czar Andrea Barthwell. Both are far right radicals and stand little chance. Barthwell has the very fresh stink of a work place discrimination lawsuit on her and Keyes, well how do you say... is a little over the edge or over the edge of Michael Moore's Portable mosh pit.  Go over to Josh Marshall's  urlLink TPM  to read about it
