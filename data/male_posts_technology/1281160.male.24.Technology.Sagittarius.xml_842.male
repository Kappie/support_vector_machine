I'm also assigned to a new project.. just like I was doing one a few months back.. but, this one seems to be a good project... and directly pertaining to my domain - EAI.. unlike the previous one, which was a web application project...   This is a much bigger project involving integration with Peoplesoft, BizTalk and some legacy systems.. I'll be concentrating more on the BizTalk side... am looking forward to this...
