Very good... the songs are pretty different.. a lot of college flavor in the song... with a tinge of western-urban touch...  the songs are named like "Ale Ale", "Boom Boom","break the rules","Secret of success", "dating", "girl friend" ... so that gives an idea of wat we cud expect...   especially the song "dating" is tooooo goood.... the song "boom boom" is sung by Adnan Sami...
