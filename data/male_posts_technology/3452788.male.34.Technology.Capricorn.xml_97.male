       
      I wake up this morning and feel defeated, lost, shamed, sad, guilty.  Guilty for hurting those around me and being such a failure as a person, a father, a husband.  I know this is the work of the inner demon, but I cannot stop it.  It would better for everyone if I ran away, I usually say, but it turns out I don’t even have the will to do that.  Unable to face work or family, I have banished myself to the hideaway over the garage, feeling like I’ve locked myself in a medieval tower for self-punishment.  I hope the kids do not find me here.  I can tell how stunned and shocked and hurt Anne is.  I guess I got her attention last night, eh?  Nice job, fucked-up loser. The greater the love and trust, the worse the shock is when one person suddenly snaps and acts in a way that is outside the other’s realm of possibilities.  I guess this is me trying to push her away, trying to get her to hate me as much as I hate myself.  If I keep working at it, She probably will not hate me, but just simply need to be apart from me for her own sanity and self-preservation.    It took longer, but I feel myself trying to do the same thing to her I have done to others.  The night I ran away from Becky in Reno, her silhouette staring at me from the window as I drove off to go rock-climbing at Donner at midnight.  The day I blew up at Angie for hiding my car keys in fun, and for the deal with Alyssa’s ATM card.  Other relationships with less intense feelings and correspondingly less elaborate sabotage.  My lack of connection with anyone in Mom’s family, despite their attempts to reach me after she died.  My lack of will to maintain any connection to Mom’s friends, or high school friends, or college friends, or former co-workers.  My habit of “wearing out my welcome” at each employer, where initially people seem to like me, then I become angry and bitter and distance myself from everyone.  This is what I do.  I get close to people, then I hurt them.  I push everyone away so they dislike me or ignore me.  I have tried and failed to maintain and uphold the value of Anne’s love and devotion to me.  I can’t place a high enough value on our marriage anymore, it’s not her fault at all.  I’m not worthy of her, I can’t stand the closeness, I just want to be alone for a while.
