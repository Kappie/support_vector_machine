Like a Charybdal undertow your sweeping siren song - a carefully crafted cobweb ensares my essence like poems too deep to even be written they sit at the bottom of the ocean or the deepest wishing well  I wish you well Well, I just wish I was with you now...  So I could feel your pulse in the shape of a heartbeat beating out the shape of a drumline-chorus ever-rhythmically-steady and ready to create the form for which I'm looking  From the form from which I'm looking I can almost see the end of the Earth -  it's as long as a life itself (cause it gets closer -  or farther -  depending on where you are in the world)  Where in the world are you?  You left me a note that said to meet you here So I will wait 'cause I thought it would take an eternity to find you but it only took 19 years so I've got an eternity to spare and i'll spend it waiting for you
