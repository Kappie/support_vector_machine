I am the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, says the Lord, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty." (Rev 1:7-8)  We need to talk about God TobI  You talked to us about God once. You know where it is. We speak later today. If you want to know when? Follow God's word. For through me your days will be many, and years will be added to your life.  Amean.
