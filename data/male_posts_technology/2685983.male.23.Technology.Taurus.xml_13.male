No way will I go to two shows if I'm going to Coachella. I think they're overestimating the draw of this event. People will not be flying into Saskatoon and Regina and Winnipeg from all over the world to see The Pixies. Stupid ticketmaster. Limit 4 tickets per person??? why?  I still haven't bought my Coachella ticket but I think I'm going to book my days off from work tomorrow.  Merge records will be re-releasing the first three Dinosaur Jr albums later this year as well as a new LP by J Mascis. Sweet! Finally a label that will do the man justice.  A new Wilco album has been annouced. Can't tell you when the release date is right now. I'm also looking forward to the new Descendents, Frank Black, and Modest Mouse albums.  I bought some records at this huge flea market at Prarieland Park. Can't remember everything I bought right now but there were some good finds. I'm entering all my records on the computer so soon enough you will be able to see what I have.
