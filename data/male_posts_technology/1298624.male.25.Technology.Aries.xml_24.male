I should check Amazon cause that is where I bought the first one and it was cheaper than Best Buy. Oh speaking of BB... I have to use my new ZoneRewardsCard. I have to give that to you cause I will probably lose it.  Gosh... I'm getting that sad lonely feeling... I miss you, Edgar!! I wonder how it would be when we don't work at the same place anymore. But I think that would be different because when that time comes we will probably be living under the same roof. :) winkwink~!! I love you, boo!!
