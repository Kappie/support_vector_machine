He was in HIS bed I was in MY bed. Two beds one room, NO lights. Ok Kiddies?) and I says to him. I says, "I want to have sex"  I don't know why I said it, I think I was just thinking it and decided what the hell lets share.. There's a pause while what I said sinks into our respective heads and suddenly we both double over laughing. It was hillarious. This one tiny comment and the two of us run through all the various possible responses in our head and just start to laugh. I was laughing so hard I was in tears..  This seems to be a regular theme recently. We go to bed at like 2AM watch TV for an hour or two and then start to talk about the weirdest stuff.  My Weekend? It was great actually. Really great. I spent Friday night in cleaning with Bubbles till about 1AM when I got a call from a friend who was having drinks at home and invited me over (you know me and drink.. I was there in no time flat :))  It was good to finaly get some time to chat 'cause it was someone I've known for a while but hadn't really had a chance to get to know them properly till this weekend. Very enlightening..  Then on Saturday I just relaxed and lazed for the day day. I entered a kind of comatose state of oblivion. I wasn't asleep but I wasn't awake. Surprisingly restfull.. Then I went to a comedy club thing in the IFC that was quite good. The MC was basically reading material I had already seen in E-mail jokes which was dissapointing and the second warm up guy just didn't have the stage presence but the other two warm up guys and the main guy were brilliant. Great value too, I recommend the night to all.  Rest of the night was quiet (it finished at 1AM) and I went straight home to bed and sleep which was really nice.. Haven't done that in a while and it felt really good.  Then Sunday was a brilliant day as well. Had a lovely morning, woke up really nicely and got up about twelve, had a really nice breakfast. Sausages, rashers, scrambled eggs (with real vegetable in them!!) and some toast and juice. T'was great, chilled and listened to music and stuff for a while, then went over to my mums and managed (after a quick trip to the hardware store) to fix her washing machine for a total cost of 6 Euros (there's value) and then spent the rest of the afternoon evening giving her all the gossip (I tell my mum WAY too much about me..)  Then home to watch tv and relax. Overall it sounds quiet but it was great.. Best weekend I've had in a while :)
