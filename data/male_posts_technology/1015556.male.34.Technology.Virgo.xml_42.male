In an email poll of the campus chaplains at evangelical Christian colleges, fifteen of seventeen respondents said they had seen a significant rise in student interest in service projects and missions trips in recent years.  Short-term mission trips are particularly popular among today’s teenagers and young adults: the number of people taking them has increased exponentially, from about 25,000 in 1979 to 120,000 in 1989.  By 1995, the number of short-term missionaries had swelled to 200,000.  urlLink The New Faithful   Colleen Carrol
