I am 23 years old and work for a higher-education institution doing computer technician type stuff. I am currently working on a Bachelors degree in Software Engineering. I live in the wonderfully backward state of Mississippi. I live with a cat in a small 2 bedroom apartment. My interests are computers, technology, science, alcohol, the ocean, and anything else that happens to float my boat at the time. This blog is about my thoughts (Warning they can be random and strange) and feelings about my daily life. When I have time I will put in entries that some people might find interesting or amusing. I personally would find comfort if someone found them oddly similar to their own thoughts. Anyway I have to return to work now. Enjoy reading.
