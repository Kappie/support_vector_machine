The new software, dubbed MSN 8.5, comes five months after the launch of MSN 8, which Microsoft considered the most significant update of its Internet service since its inception."

 

 It use to be I would never think of using AOL, MSN, or even CompuServe for an "internet service". However, since I have been using MSN hotmail as my main e-mail address I began storing my address book, favorites, stock listings, files, and calendar online so I could access it from any computer. I love this capability of accessing my data regardless of what I have installed on my current machine as well as the ISP I was using. So when MSN 8 came out I gave it a try with the upmost scrutiny and unfortunately I became hooked. Although its not perfect, no matter what machine I have in front of me I can access my data from whatever computer I am currently browsing the internet. I can still access my data through MSN.com without having MSN 8 installed minus the rich user interface MSN provides. MSN 8.5 fixes a lot of the little things I hated about about MSN 8.0 even though the changes are only subtle. Now if If an get them to tone done some of the colors I would be really happy.
