Most of it was through rainforest type atmosphere, and about half way through you have to cross these two swinging bridges, kinda like in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.  It was pretty interesting, a little bit scary.  At the end of the hike you get to a nice little man made damn where there is fresh water falling off making a little waterfall that you can drink out of it is so fresh.  Off to the side there is a nice little cliff you can jump off of into the water which was cool, and all around you there is fresh guava that you can eat from the trees!  Quite a nice day.
