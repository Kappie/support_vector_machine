I can't figure out how to delete archives because I thought it'd be good to almost start again, ie: with the new template start new archives. However can't find this option so gonna have to have all the old posts as well which isn't too bad but remember (this goes to everyone) they are old posts from the past when things were different and before we grew up over the summer. Some people may get that more than others.  Um. Ok so that is the main change. LOL.  Sorry I couldn't make it to bowling, had to work all day and then do revison (forced to by parents, gah). I hope you had a good time.  General Studies today, should be a giggle NOT. 2 and half hours. Yipee. 3 hours geology tomorrow. Pants.  Hope you all have good day!
