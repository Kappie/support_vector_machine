I have saved up over $500 plus another $600+ for my iMac that I am selling to Zach! We got back from grandma and papa's in Des Moines. Brenton, Paula, and Yogi were there. It was a fun time. I didn't get much else for Christmas except for a few little things and a lot of money and "puzzle-pieces" that count toward my PB G4. Laura got a brand-new hamster for XMAS that she named, "Snickers." (Another name which I liked better was, "Scooter.") On Saturday, I bought Burnout 2: Point of Impact for GameCube. I just got it today and it is AWESOME!!! I already beat the 30 crash zones, getting mostly bronze and silver, and quite a few gold metals. Zach is flying back to New York tonight, but I'll hopefully get to play with him before he goes. Amit's B-Day party was yesterday (the 28th). He isn't having a party this week, but hopefully soon. For New Year's Eve, I might also have a friend over for a sleepover (hopefully). I have two songs stuck in my head right now, "Stacy's Mom" and "Hey Ya!" This is a pretty long post, so I'll stop right here. Have a Happy New Year 2004!!!! :-P :-D 8-) ~*smilies*~
