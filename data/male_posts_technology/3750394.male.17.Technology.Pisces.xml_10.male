I really need cash, getting low on the cash flow, but what can ya do?!.  I have to work tomorrow, private client job up in Bearspaw (a little way outta the city), but I should be getting paid (at least $125), so that should last me for a little while longer, gotta save for my laptop too.  Went to Shawn's tonite for a BBQ (Gotta love those!).  Hung out with Shawn and his gf Megan (extremly nice person).  Watched a shit load of Family Guy, a great show to those who don't know about it.  Going home now, still have to finish getting ready for work tonite, still have to install Windows XP Pro SP-1a on 2 computers tonite *BARF*, so im still gonna be up for a while.  Have a good nite all.  Eric
