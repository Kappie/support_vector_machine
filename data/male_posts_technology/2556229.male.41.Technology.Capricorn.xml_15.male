My response solicited mostly positive emails from the vets but one thinks I need a lesson about life from Neil Boortz. So he sent me this, non-cited, article that is supposed to tell me what is wrong with Liberals. Fine and dandy, but here is my response. Do you think it will screw his head into the ground? You can read the whole email if you want, but I wouldn't bother its that lame Commencement speech article Neil Boortz enthusiast like to send around, because it "proves" liberals are bad. It's easy to f$%k with these guys because they are not too bright.  Sent: Sunday, August 01, 2004 4:36 PM Subject: Re: Commencement speech you should have heard.....  Why don't you cite any of these sources? What do you fear? The truth? I'd be interested in what else these folks say. I like to look at things in a larger context. You forget, I used to live in Atlanta. Then, as I do now, I considered Neil Boortz a blowhard. Have an original thought, Man. You don't need someone to tell you how to feel and think. Boortz and his ilk are demagogues. They feed on your insecurities. They know you are not happy with your lot in life or are ashamed of something about you and are looking for someone to blame or to deflect the shame upon. They feed that. Its very negative. What do you think he would be saying to you if he knew about all your ugly, dirty little secrets and desires? We all have them. How do you think he would treat you if you called his show and admitted a dirty little truth about yourself? He would scorn you because it is what he hates about himself. That kind of anger and negativity is what rule people like him and Rush Limbaugh. Doesn't it make sense to you? Remember how Rush used to go on and on about drug addicts? All the time he was the worst kind and he hid it from the world while railing against it. Though dost protest too much...or something to that effect. On the other hand, I could be completely wrong, but I'm secure enough with myself to realize that.  btw. response to my original email has been along the lines of;  "Roger That Ray. Thanks so much for you good words. Kerry will kick GW's butt in November. We're all doing our part.  xxx xxxxx, US Army, 64-67 Vietnam."  "The real Veterans among us know the deal."  So keep trolling the right wing nutjob sites. I'm sure you'll find plenty of people with whom to agree. Hate wrapped in objectivism is still hate. Don't be a hater, be a lover. It was what Jesus wanted us to do. The future is bigger than our petty ideologies.  Peace be with you and rest in the comfort that Dumbya will most likely carry Georgia and most of the south so you can blame his redefeat on us miserable Yankee liberals.
