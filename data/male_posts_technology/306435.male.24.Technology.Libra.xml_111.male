In the sixth Dunn struck out with the basese loaded then Kearns hit into a double play.  I can say I have seen Ichiro play now.  After the game we went to Justin's and I stopped by and saw Marissa.  She started her job at  urlLink Federated Department stores  on Monday.  I think we are goin to go see Spiderman this week.  Krisitn and Hallie are coming in this weekend and we will be going to King's Island.  I amd still waiting to hear from Kristin Hill to see if she is coming.  Things at work have been really busy.  The data center for the company moved to Kanas City last weekend and there has been nothing but trouble since.  Every other hour a server either crashes or loses connectivity.  The worst part is the poeple in charge of the stuff breaking get upset because we are telling them it is down.  They call us and say that it is not even thought 50 people will call and say it cannot be accessed.  We have are manager call them and suddenly there IS a problem with the server.  Politics.
