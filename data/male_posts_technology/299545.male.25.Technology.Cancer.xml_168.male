This is just five of many Simpsons for CC Lemon ads that have appeared on TV here in Japan over the years. 	 Probably the saddest aspect of these ads is not the blatent commercialism of them completely undermining a large feature of the show, but that the show is primarily recognised by these ads in Japan.
