When I arrived in Plane of Knowledge I went to the infamous Delly Tree(the Iksar's favorite camping spot) and waited, it turns out the Cleric was off gathering supplies. While I found my good friend Konath, the Vah Shir Warrior who I trust the most to stand by my side in battle. Once we met up we went over to the bank to see if there was any nice people giving any powerful strength and health boosting spells. There was not, so I focused my own divine powers to Guard and fill my friends with Daring.    When we all finally got together we made our way to Gunthak, I attempted to find an easy way to the vile shore, but I could not find any other way than to swim. Making a perfect 360 rotational dive into the water, I began swimming for the shores from the lighthouse. Konath was very close behind, though Akcron, bless her soul could not swim very well, and thus almost drown in the sea. Konath eventually reminded my of a folly I had made attempting to go west to the shore, it was south that I needed to go! so turning myself around we eventually made it to the corrupted wastes of Gunthak Beach.  Gunthak beach for everyone's information is a beach filled with terrible undead things, zombies, and skeletons, all the lost souls of those who have wrecked their boats against the rocky shores. I immediately called upon the power of Rodcet Nife to assist me in removing the undead presence from the beach. and he answered my call. It seemed with almost every fourth attack I made on the vile creatures they would scream in agony as the evil power that held them to this world was being torn from them. They all died relatively quickly.  I am also thankful that I brought my Hammer of Silent Screams with me, as it's aura closes my wounds, this ability was further enhanced when my closest brother at arms arrived, Kretais showed up on his Drogmar. I congratulated him on the purchase of his steed, and he proceeded to enhance us and make us invisible with his spells.  We then made the run to Dulak, a place of pirates and vagabonds. When we arrived Kretais marched forward in search of a place to safely assualt the enemy. While this happened a dark elf assualted us as we were not invisible at that time(we had lost it to the giant mushrooms of Gunthak) we swiftly dispatched the dark elf, and I took the dark elf parts, pulled my spit out, and roasted Konath a couple of blackened Tier'Dal steaks to munch on during battle. I love making food out of my enemies, it produces a kind of satisfaction that cannot be had any other way.  Minutes later, someone had lost their invisibility and was running right for us with many enemies on their backsides. So we quickly ran away to avoid being run over by this assualt. When we returned to Gunthak I assisted the young lady with Daring, and placed a Guard upon her skin. She thanked me profusely and got invisibility back and ran back into the fray.   We too ran back into Dulak, then we returned to invisibility, and made our way to the stormwind, a pirate ship docked at Dulak. we proceeded to kill Ogre and Dark Elf vagabonds until it seemed as if the Pirates had placed a sleeping curse upon me, for my strength faltered, and I could barely keep my eyes open. I informed my allies of my plight and they sent messages to their friends that they would require a druid to assist us out of Dulak. Eventually as we continued to fight, our Fine druid made her way to the ship. the druid, whose name I have forgotten the spelling of, then called upon the power of nature to sweep us back to the plane of knowledge.  When we returned to Plane of Knowledge, our fair Akcron who had been collecting the valuables off the corpses of our fallen enemies, sold them to the vendors inside the Plane of Knowledge, and returned to us with 75 platinum! a very fine day of battle it was. I put the platinum in the bank, headed to the bazaar, set up my shop to sell some velium I had acquired recently, and fell asleep. It was a good day, and a productive day.   If we may ever meet, may it be as brothers, and not as enemies, Ziggur Rathebringer
