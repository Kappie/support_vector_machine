Indeed, 7th Aug; my birthday, i was neither happy or sad.. But i teared, because of the Korea serial i watched..  If you are wondering if i am easily influenced by movies i watched, probably.. but Summer Scent influenced me deeply.. Why do i like this one particularly? Like the two earlier episode of endless love, this do not have a very sweet ending. But, the ending is good enough, at least they can recognise one another... At least, after so many ups and downs, they are sure of their feelings.. At least, after so many things that happened, didn't change their feelings towards another.. At least, they have one another to long and loved all these years.. At this point of time, my tear fell again..  You broke up because love is no longer present.. Yet, some broke up because they love one another deeply.. So deep that breaking up is for one another's good. Despite wide distance apart, their love didn't change, didn't fade.. When it returns, it just becomes stronger..  I managed to download the entire OST because the VCD didn't come with it, unlike Winter Sonata.. also found some MTVs for the theme songs.. It makes one wonder.. if i had bought this serial the moment i saw it last year, would i feel the same now? Frankly, i had forgotten that Summer Scent is the 3rd episode.. I love it.. because the entire serial just protrayed my ideal kind of love.. just looking at the girl from far makes your heart felt glad. Yes, i could remember clearly, all these feelings.. how it felt to be in love.. to someone..  I had loved her with my life.. had become so obessesed with her.. and despite that i was eagered to break up with her, i still have very strong feelings for her. Contradicting? You will know why if you come across my path. Scent only reminds me something.. that i should never fall for somebody who is already attached...  Summer.. A little happy, a little sad.. Feeling glad and feeling loss. A little sweet and a little bitter. Thank you for bringing love into my life.  Lovers shouldn't apologise..  DJ
