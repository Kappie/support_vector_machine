All you want to do is just pick some treasure and finda name for yourself. Before you jump into the sea, everything looks easy. But when you are into the sea, you dont know which one is glass piece and which one is the gold. You pick some what you think is gold and you come back clutching the to the shore. And each and every piece of it is a glass. Laughs and mocks is all that you get. The same mouths that encouraged you now make fun of you. It wouldn't be the blood caused by the piercing glass pieces that'd make you cry... it wouldn't be the salt water that'll make you cry.. it'll be the mental anguish...the pain of whole world mocking at you that'll make you cry.. You are now given a name "Glass Collector"...You become famous because of your name..But after sometime the pain reduces...though it never goes away cos those scars would hurt forever...you'll overhear the same people telling someone that its ok to comeback with only glass pieces.. the only thing that matters would be that you tried..at that time you will make wry smile cos you know the truth...
