Never even rest enuff then have to start work again liow....WTF!!! Had realli been a busy week last week and recalling that today is WED liow. Two days more to the weekend again and wah....no wonder people age so fast cos time realli wait for no one. Hence, feel that we muz always try to use our time wisely....-_-"(spend all my time working lah) and treasure every minutes and seconds. Be happy that u can open ur eyes and wake up every morning. in fact we should be gratful that we were given this chance to live every morning, every day. So we shall not wait for time also.....in fact we muz get ahead of time if not, travel with time and not lag behind.....To the one i love, time is not something we can afford to waste, muz treasure every seconds of our life cos we never know wat will happen tomolo and whether someone will still be by ur side at the end of the day. so hope that u can treasure the time i spent on u and not let it go to waste cos the time i spend thinking of u is priceless and can never be retrieved. Let not the heart of someone who love u go to waste, as he will never always be there for u. He will, only when u know how to treasure his time and effort. u have onli one life so live it wisely. To all the ppl out there, Look ard u and u might jus find that special someone who r willing to spend their precious time thinking of u and treasure them cos they r hard to come by and they might jus disappear the next day. Dont bother to spend time on someone who wont even spare a second on u!!! Time is priceless and can never be saved or accumulated. Spend it wisely and meaningfully. :)  cheers, Teddy
