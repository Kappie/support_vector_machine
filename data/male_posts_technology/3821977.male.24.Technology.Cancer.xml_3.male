New Celly - better than alex's  I just want to say that i've been extremely busy for the last couple of days so in all defense i can justify why I wasnt able to h00k it up with mad blogg'in action. My birthday is on th 22nd' and I'm really wanting a new computer since Doom 3 comes out on August 4th. My Hl2 should be here around that time and the xp1700 just cant push the Fps anymore like it could 2.5 years ago. Plus alex is riding high on a 2.6ghz so I'm definitely doing something wrong.. I recall upgrading my computer every 6 months but now . 2.5 years that's a world record that i hope to never encounter again. Shame Shame on me for not supporting the computer hardware industry. The Celly Situation is this. I was going to get 2 new cingular samsung x427 flip picture phones but Cingular screwed me over and never fully processed my order. I decided to forgo the reprocessing of the order and just wait and buy a nice Cam Phone. Can anyone say Samsung E715 - the most pimped out cell phone ever. Take a look at the screen and the high frame rate of the camera(1.5megapixel) and you will never look at your crummy cell phone again unless your Alex whom owns a pimpy little v400 *screw you alex, your days are limited*.   Btw : Good Email Client is Mozilla Thunderbird - F'in Sweet  more later rob
