The End    My life, my comfort, my shell of hope, Creaked and groaned with every passing day But now it’s all finally come crashing down God help me,  I never thought it would end this way.  Alone in the darkness The dawn brings not hope, But despair and distress Challenge me to cope.  I’m left in the ruins  Of all I can see Fathomless grief  Consuming me.  No one to run to,  Nowhere to hide, Nothing to live for,  No path by which to bide.  The fire which once Gave light to my heart Burns down to nothing; Shadow, Light depart.  As I wander this wasteland Over and over, Again and again, Memories of every kind Flood past me,  Thoughts of what could have been  …Of what could have been.
