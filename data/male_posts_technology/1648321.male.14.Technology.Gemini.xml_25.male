Tonight I am going to the Minnesota Wild game at the Xcel Energy Center with Zach and then we are having a sleepover. Yesterday, Robert came over and stayed at our house the whole day (from 9:30 AM to 8:00 PM). I'm excited for Christmas. Well, I hope all of you are having a nice Holiday Break! Thanks a lot! ;-)
