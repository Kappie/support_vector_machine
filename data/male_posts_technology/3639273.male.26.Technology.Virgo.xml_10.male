Introversion and many times depression when you reflect upon your lord and savior we do not need to loose our creativity but can hone that creativty and use it as a tool for kingdom purpose. As you might have guessed from my journal entries I do enjoy writing. As much as however I enjoy writing I do enjoy reading. Recently I stumbled upon something that I know I have been doing but had no words to explain it. Using the nagative things of this world as a positive catapult can be a task indeed but when you look through the eyes that Christ has given you we realize that through him. yes "we can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens us but we can also know that "Good things come to though who are in Christ jesus who are in his will and in his plan." If we believe truly in him not just in his word but in him. We truly will see miracles. We sometimes want God to act quickly in our lives when we ourselves are creeking around like sloths. I have just recently come to understand that spiritually I have been growing but in other things I have neglected. Can one have one and the other. I do believe we can. My desire has been to seek a better understanding God his purpose and his kindom mindedness. To truly understand the concept of worship and therby be a better example of Christ in my own life. Many times I fall short. I look from the worlds persepective and see a man struggling and holding onto a dream ..air if you will. However looking at it in a Kingdom perspective I see someone patiently understanding true purpose and waiting for his commands for his commanding officer. If our lives on this world that Christ has given us was for no purpose then why would we be here? His purpose is clear when the Lord says what his purpose is for us to be here. If one was to Look at Paul today or any of the other deciples would they be looked favorably by todays standards. No they woudl not. Many of them left their flourishing business and families to follow Christ. Someone today would say they were bums who left to follow the circus or left to follow some crazy man. Leaving their business and families behind. This indeed would not be a great picture. However this Negative thing that would seem would be the only choice and today our choice when it comes to serving God. Many times it is not our family..however sometimes it is our old lives, our habits, our bondages that we have fought over and over and simply for one reason. We do not want to leave. This man Jesus Christ would later bring healing. Would later bring understanding and even controversy. Many say that Christianity has caused many wars and battles. Bloodshed. However if you really research you will know that out of the thousands of people who were massacred that day in Jonestown. There was not one Holy Bible found. A manbent on his own vision. Hios reflection was God but later became twisted by his own ideals. Many people have done this. I believe many people who have left Christ have also done this as well. As well as those who have been called but are not answering. Our own ideal of God is not even HALF as powerful as the truth found in the scriptures. Never will there ever be a mans perception of God more miraculous more powerful and more true then that which is inscribed in the scriptures of the Holy Bible.  Here is what Paul Pleads Ephisians 4:17 So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. 18. They are darkened in their understanding and seperated from the life of God becasue of the ignorace that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts. 19. Having Lost all sensitivity so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more. 20. You however, did not come to know Christ that way. 21. Surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with the TRUTH that is in Jesus (Here is the key) 22. You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by it's decietful desires. 23. to be made new in the attitude of your minds; 24. to be made new in the attitude of your own minds; 24 and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteuosness and holiness.  Look and see that even as an intellectual or one who decides not to change their thinking and their past and their culture what Paul again warns.  Colossians 2:8 See to it that no one take you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human traditionand in basic principles of this world rather than on Christ. 9. for in Christ all the fullness of the Diety lives in bodily form, 10 and you have been given fullness in Christ who is the head over every power and authority.  So with the Negative of the world comes basic understanding of their principles. Though being attacked, accused or any other type of attack or even their perception is skued by this. The world is based on tradition. Which is why is does not change. It sole reason to exist it not to change in is foundation. Since traditon sets to the playing field for princliples, and behavior ANTI is the only thing that can get through. So blatant disregard is the only allowable force now instead of change we have decay.  So simply by knowing Gods purpose and plan is our lives can we begin to realize that we have a higher purpose that does not appeal to the standards of the world. Likewise our lives will not appeal as well always. However if we are in the will of the Father like Paul and many other deciples we will have favor with God and Man.  Know this that when you have Nagativity coming against you for your choices or your life that many times it comes from the opposition of what God is doing in the lives of the people of this world. We as people have been given the opportunity to bring that plan into full circle. Literally Soldiers in a war. Every war has an opposition. Sometimes they can be our own families or friends.   Stand tall and use the Negativity of others as your Catapult into a more succesful life that later will bring shame to those who did not know or understand. And know that if there is a powerful force against you. The will of the Father is being done.  I end today with this  PROV 14:12 There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.
