Yep! He raised it from a baby, and when they found it, it was a fully grown adult. How did they find out about it? Well the owner went to the hospital because the tiger bit him but he said it was a dog bite and the doctor didn't believe him. 1+1=2 and the cops found the tiger. A HUGE tiger living in one room of this guy's apartment for all its life. What kind of fucking idiot is this guy? Want to hear whats worse? He had a full grown alligator in there too! What baffles me is how his neighbors never knew.  Long story short, the animals were taken and hopefully they're going to some zoo now so they have some space to roam.
