I know there's an excercise called the "Jumping Jack" and I'm thinking for some reason that if you do a jumping jack off the diving board, it's called a "jumping jackoff".  I used to do them when I was 10 years old or so.   But that just as well may have been something I made up as a kid.  At any rate, jumping jackoffs hurt a lot more than I remember (in the private area) and I don't recommend them for guys over the age of 10.
