My last two laptops both died horrible, painful deaths, and resisted all attempts at resurrection; my wife's laptop seems to detest the concept of getting a functional CD driver; hell, the company's support group denies that the model even exists, let alone that they ever had a CD-ROM drive, and oh by the way, here's the driver so it works.  And one of my old scrap desktops managed to kill a network card somewhere between running Windows and installing Linux.  I don't know exactly when, but when I last turned off the computer as a Windows box, it functioned; when resurrected as a Linux box, the little lights blinked and the computer swore up and down the card existed, but no connection was there for me to play with.  When transplanted back to a different Windows machine, same thing; recognized by the system, pretty blinking lights, but no connection.  Darn it if I knew why.  I'm just waiting for my current laptop to give up the ghost; I can't afford to replace this one, or even really repair it.  *sighs*  That's a sad thought.  No upgrades for the cute l'il desktop, either.  At least I have a couple of new models I can work on; I'm excited about them, and I'll get to do fun things with them.  If I ever get around to working on them, of course.  We all know how pathetically slow I am at that.  I'm kinda frightened about painting the infantry; I don't know how on earth I might get them to come out well.  But we'll see.
