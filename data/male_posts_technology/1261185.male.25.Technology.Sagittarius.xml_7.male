We have all fallen in love with this cat and especially me grown attached to the little 'hellcat'.  But yesterday the landlord came by and told us we could not have the cat, even though he said we could beforehand, and that we would still have to pay the   $400 pet deposit  , of which $175 is non-refundable) even though just a month maybe two ago he said that we could get a cat if we had a letter written by Stephen, my stepson, to him requesting that he could keep a cat.    All conditions were met and still the   WORTHLESS-ASS-FUCKED-STEROID-HOUND-OF-A-SKYCAP-COCK-SUCKER   still won't let us have the fucking cat. So now I have to figure out of I can keep the cat and afford to pay the $400 deposit or maybe get the KITTEN neutered   AND   declawed in order to bring down the price of the deposit.
