Final attendance figures won't be released until late Friday, but the show appeared to be on track to beat or meet last year's crowd of 126,000.."   I'd rather got to CES (Consumer Electronics Show). It basically emulates what is happening with computing technology today. Computers are extending into everyday products in the home. Transistors and operating systems are not just in a PC on your desk anymore. Thus a "Consumer Electronics Show" is becoming more interesting than a just a "general computer" conference.
