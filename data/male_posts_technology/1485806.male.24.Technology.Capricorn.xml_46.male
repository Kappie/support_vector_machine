Had lunch before going to work..(yes working on SUndays as well) with Pure Joy people...can't see any Simply United ppl to have lunch with except well Siew Ching ,,but she 's not free for lunch so took a raincheck... Had a good time with Pure Joy ppl and yes more angpows coming my way soon as me and Pure jOy gang go visit my cell leader's house..yes it Jeevan And Winnie.hehehe  For Simply United ppl, hmm,...awesome work on the GRafitti Board..must say i am indeed impressed and proud of it...what with a comical additional KenPunya..logo there courteosy of Ken Hiew's advertisement. and of COurse Sheep United's seven sheep bowing before the star with their butt right into our face.  Yeah if u guys have come back from your hometown, well i guess we could have a meal together and we (wai nyan and me..if possibly Jamie) can take u to a serene, quiet..tropical place where you have a small pond with waterfall and quiet breeze.., where you can really CHILL or just chill with us and bonds.  For Wan Phing and Erin, well 2 bad..you gotta go soon..but we will make time to send u off.  For my new hobby, going to forums and just pointing out my view...very evident with a wide range of Chickens nicck in Issues , Issues, in Wai Nyan 's Life Legalities. Wai Nyan Life's Legalities    Chicken is in in almost every conversation in jeff Ooi 's ScreenShot's blog. urlLink Screenshots   Connect, Relate and Resonate the Faith of Jesus Christ Joshua Tan
