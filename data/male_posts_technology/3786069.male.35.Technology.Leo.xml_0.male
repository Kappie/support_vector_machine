So because of them I'll have everything I need to make the transition/life much easier.  Lining up things to do for my final day here in San Diego, the states. It sounds weird to say I'll be living outside of the states as I've never lived outside of California before. Traveled to many countries but never lived. I still think I should be able to handle the challenge no matter how many people say I'm crazy.  Still waiting for the gallery section of my site to be completed so I can start uploading all of our pics.
