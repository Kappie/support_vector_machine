Heck half the times I’ll initiate them even if deep inside I know I’m fighting a loosing battle. At least that way I can lull unsuspecting people into arguments with me.  Most of my friends no longer argue with me. The fact that I relish an argument almost seems to confound them. Since most of them see it as some sort of disagreeable activity to be partaken of reluctantly and ended as soon as possible they find it difficult if not downright impossible to understand how I can actually enjoy it.  Come on people get with the act. Thrust, parry, limber up those linguistic muscles and pump some factual dumbbells. Give your poor brain a workout apart from the 9 to 9 grind we subject it to every day.  …or at least argue with me about it. :-)
