"I banged 5 (opposite sex)" Coming from a guy = Da man!!111one!!1!!! Coming from a gal = Omgwtfbbq slutzville!!!!11oneae!!!!!  What I say is, as long as there's protection, have fun. It's not like you're getting any younger. *winkwink*  http://loserz.scribblekid.org/index.php?id=29  Yeah. That's me. The guy. Cept, i put some water in my hair, then blast some spray gel stuff. I wish my hair was kina like his... ;_;  http://loserz.scribblekid.org/index.php?id=50  I concur. Silly people. What's wrong with either one of them? Pshh. I dont care. Their choice. If she wants to be a lesbian, and he wants to be gay, what's the problem? It's not like it personally affects  you .  Homework calls.
