We've finally broken the trend of having 40+ people over, and are just going to have 10 to 20.  If all goes, as is our custom, we'll be up till way past 2:00am.  Oh brother, I just remembered I'm going to a turkey bowl (mud football for those uninformed few) tomorrow morning.  *groan*  That wouldn’t be much of a problem, if it weren't for the sleep (or lack there of) that I have been getting over the last week.  From Friday to Monday, I got around 14 hours of sleep TOTAL. Well, whatever... I'll take each day as it comes.  Just a random note:  I love Grand Prize - been listening to them non-stop for 20-some-odd hours (fell asleep to them) and... and ... oh, nevermind.  (This was actually written at 10:36am, November 28th, but due to errors on my part, I have had to repost it now.)
