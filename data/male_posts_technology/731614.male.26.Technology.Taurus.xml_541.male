Well,the one lonely woman in there, looked a bit scared since I was talking to empty closets and couches.  She had the look that I am so used to getting, you know the one that screams  "HOLY SH*T THIS GIRL IS CRAZY, I better not make any sudden movements".   She said her name was Matthews, but she generally goes by Latrice.  So I said "Suuuuurrrrrre you do, and I bet now you are going to tell me you don't steal Christmas gifts, right LATRICE MATTHEWS".  I even threw in the best roll of crazy eyes I could do but it turned out a bit more Zoolander than I would have liked.  She was confused since, you know, it is June, and pointed to a pile of gifts on the floor.  Turns out that Mattews/Latrice was stealing gifts from EVERYONE in my apartment complex.  I snatched up my gift and looked at her with "warning eyes", the kind that put the fear of god in her.  I think this is definitely the last time she will try to steal my presents.   So moral of the story, I got my gift... I will wait for Christmas to open it though.  If i can, self control has never been my strong suit.  Now excuse me... I have to write a letter to put on all 100 apartments about the evil that is happening in the front office.
