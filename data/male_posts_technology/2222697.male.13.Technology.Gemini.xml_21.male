Lets start with Steven, he plays football (he's not a jock at all its more like an anger thing) he watches comedy central. You can say that he has a funny sense of humor but its all his funny is based on tv shows *no examples needed*. Ok moving on.....Harrison, he dives [in a pool] he is the only one among us who has the dvd collection of the first 2 seasons of family guy. He is in my gym class and he is the craziest of all of....these people....erm yeah. He is a fellow anime geek and is a fan off the greatest anime ever....Naruto. ummm ok next, Elliot he has problems....he doesnt have an off button is is the rich kid who plays magic the gathering and has issuses with spelling words backwards [hey y'know racecar spelled backwards is RAC-E-CAR] elliot isnt very imortant. more friend profiles coming soon.....The End. Umm the site will be up in a week (or so), samuraipanda5
