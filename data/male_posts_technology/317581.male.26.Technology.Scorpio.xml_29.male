And dark... they were walking and they were tired, afraid, thirsty, depressed. Did I say that it was dark? Oh, and they were thirsty too, and tired of eating Lembas. but it never ran out so they had to keep eating it. That sucks. They could have started eating the grass. Grass is could for you. Just like sourcraut. Is that how you spell it? Well... ITS GOOD FOR YOU! Don't ever let your mom feed it to you for breakfast.   It's gold today shiver me timbers throw out the red garnett and wash your hands of everything you ever believed in  -thoris
