He told me that he had gotten up earlier and as soon as he got out of his tent he was recruited into this group he was fighting with currently. So I pulled my armor on, and picked up the hammer of silent screams, and joined up with the merry band. Nobella was our cleric, on a white horse she could heal all of our wounds with one powerful spell. We also had an Ogre Warrior, whose name I don't recall, and a Dark Elf Shadowknight.    It turns out we had room for another, so I sent word to Akcron to rise up and get herself to Dulak. She got her invisibility, and came running into the battle. Our shadowknight was very busy baiting many monsters, pulling more into our ambush right as we were killing off the last one he had baited. Eventually Nobella had to leave, and Akcron became main healer, she did a good job as always. We fought until Akcron grew weary, and she gated, and I once again went back to my tent in Dulak.  When I came back later, I managed to find a group fighting along the entrance, told them I would be on my way, and unfortunately on my way to meet up with them, drew the armory guards who slayed me. when I rematerialized in South Ro, I immediately got a message back from the cleric of the group asking if I wanted a resurrection I agreed and allowed them to take my body to a safe place to resurrect me. After the resurrection I assisted them in slaying many entrance guards and what not, the money wasn't great, and the enemies were lacking in numbers, and my hammer craved more action, so I recommended that we go to my spot near the warehouses. We went, and we had a fun time, Once again we had a dark elf shadowknight, who was baiting, and with a little convincing, I got him to bait more once we almost had one finished, and we chain lured them to their deaths for a great long time. It seems as though the assualt on Dulak will never end.   Eventually I got satisfied of fighting there, and decided to go home, my bags full of reclaimed pirate bounty, I got Spirit of Wolf from the Shaman of our group, and made a run for Gunthak. The run was dangerous, and became even more so when I hit the tide. I slowed down so much that the enemies I had chasing me caught up, and my body arrived in davey jone's locker. I rematerialized again in south ro and made way to Gunthak. After a short time, I found my body under the waves, reclaimed my gear, and swam to shore. Once I got to shore, I sold my bounty, and headed to PoK, by the tree, heaved a heavy sigh, and made camp in safety.
