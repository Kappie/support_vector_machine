The hacker had become a super-user. He was like a cuckoo bird. The cuckoo is a nesting parasite that lays her eggs in other birds' nests: some other bird will raise her young. The survival of cuckoo chicks depends on the ignorance of other species. Our mysterious visitor had laid an egg-program into our computer, letting the system hatch it and feed it privileges.  This is written by Clifford Stoll, who traced the Hacker Markus Hess, who logged in to most of the Top Security sites of America.
