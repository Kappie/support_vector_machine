If people ever need to talk weather it be to moan or be angry, cry or just rant and rave I will listen. If they then want an opinion or suggestion on what to do about it I will try. If they want any help, I will try. I seem to have a knack of cheering people up as well which is always useful. And if the thing they rant about or want to get off their chest and tell me is a big secret, if they ask me to keep it a secret I will. i always have done, and I always will. So people, if you need someone to listen I AM HERE!!!! People forget that!!!!  Now that is said, my day? PSE was amusing with that homosexual video but when Miss Reid tol dus about that Major from the army coming in to talk to us I was like "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEAAAAAAAAAAA". Wooooo! Then 2 hours of English back on back, hmm, it was ok I guess. We had to do a mini-presentation on a poem which I found funy in my gorup. I mean Sean and Pat were in it! But I admit it, I do make judgements on labels etc.. no matter how much I tell people not to judge grungers just because of the musi cthey listen to and stuff because I judged Sean on the fact of who he hung aorund and he is a pretty nice guy. I was wrong, I admit it. Then we had lunch which was fantabulous wth our whole blockading the tech block in. LOL. Sooo funny! After lunch what did I have? Sciene! With Mr Gallagher, we made progress today. Now he knows my name...usually its simply 'Michelles friend' or 'Jackies friiend'. Heehee. Then German which is never that amusing anyway. So. Yup. There we go.
