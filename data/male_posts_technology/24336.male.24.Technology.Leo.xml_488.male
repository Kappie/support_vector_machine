I don't remember how it happened, but I ended up on stage and was told to MC the entire affair.  I didn't know who was supposed to be in the show so I just talked to the crowd and made a game out of it.  Rob Shereda was in the audience and I was under the impression that he was supposed to be the MC but decided to let me run it.  After introducing the first act, I hopped down from the stage into the crowd.  Everyone seemed to be dressed as if it was the 70's, but in that updated-yet-still-retro style.  Leah was there and just as I was about to talk to her, I woke up.
