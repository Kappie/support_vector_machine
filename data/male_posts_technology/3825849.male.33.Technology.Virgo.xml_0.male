I didn't blog the day that this was published, but the link still works:  urlLink Revenge   I've read many obervations about how our genetic makeup has affected our psychology (mostly sexist articles about men being hunters and women being gatherers used as justification for a hunter to sit on the couch and demand a beer from the gatherer) but this one struck me as particularly intriguing. The idea that we all have a sense of justice and that our actions can often be sourced to an imagined slight on which we act in a manner consistant with our sense of justice. To which the other person reacts, thinking that he/she didn't deserve such a punishment. On and on till someone calls a stop.  Raised, as I was, in a passive/agressive world where I was forced to constantly read the subtext of everything I grew to be overly sensitive to slights. More than a few arguments in my life have started because I mis-read an attack on me and then responded as befitted my sense of justice only to be seen as the one who started the fight in the first place.
