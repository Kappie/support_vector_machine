If you want to read about this go to any news site, I use  urlLink Reuters  no reason just like them.  My favorite quote on this subject comes from an article on  urlLink Cnews .  "Hundreds of videos (of UFO's) exist, but none had the backing of the armed forces of any country...The armed forces don't perpetuate frauds."  This wonderful quote came from Jaime Maussan a Mexican UFO investigator.  I realize that many people who believe in and follow UFO sightings are open-minded, but since when have militaries ever told the fucking truth about anything.  Earth to UFO nuts mitlitaries lie that's how they survive, if they told the truth they would die both figuratively and literally.  So as I see it when a government says there are no UFO's the true believers call them liars, but when they endorse UFO's governments are equated the Virgin Mary (I have no empirical proof of her virginity).  UFO junkies are waffling more than John Kerry (this is a joke not an endorsement of Bush).  Have a wonderful day UFO filled day (I use parenthesis way to much).
