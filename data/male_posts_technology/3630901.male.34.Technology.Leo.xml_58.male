The only thing I can think of is the possibility of getting fired from my job.  Would that be so bad?  Sometimes when something drastic happens, it acts as a catalyst for creating a rippling effect, causing other changes.  What would happen if I lost my job?  The obvious answer is that I would get a new one, of course.  But what would I do?  More of the same?  Would I be able to immerse myself in a job doing the same thing but at a different company?  If so, what would have changed?  Another path I could go down would be:  sell the house and move someplace cheaper.  Re-train for something I really want to do.  The problem is I don't really know what I really want to do.  Counsel teens?  Graphic design?  Interior design?  Poetry?  Make music?  Cook?  Maybe get back into IT, but from a consultant perspective.  Doing odd jobs for small to medium sized companies.  Kind of like what that psychic was saying - that I'd work independently sometime in the next year.    If my cost of living was lower, then I could afford to make less money and maybe enjoy my life more.  What activities do I enjoy?  yoga, walking / hiking, camping (theoretically), biking, kayaking / canoeing, swimming (theoretically). What interests do I have?  environment, politics (limited), belief systems, volunteer work, vegetarianism, animal rights, suicide / teen hotline. I'd like to try painting.  I was thinking about buying S the book "What Color is My Parachute", but maybe that's a book I should be looking at to determine what I really want to be doing with my life.  What transferable skills do I have that I could apply somewhere else and still eke out a living?  How low can I get my monthly expenses and still enjoy my lifestyle?
