Though I think we'll need a little siesta in the arvo after flying at 6am in the morning... well, it was a cheap flight.  I am currently listening to the  urlLink John Butle Trio 's latest album "Sunrise Over Sea" and it's fantastic! I'm starting to like this blues/grass roots music quite a bit now....
