After the plug, she demonstrates her "ring entrance". Gail Kim interrupts her, to the dismay of the crowd. Gail states that Stacy can show us how to be a Diva, but she is going to show us how to be the next Women's Champ. That leads us into our first match...   Match 1 - Lita vs. Gail Kim  - Lita wins with her new finisher since coming back; the snap DDT. A decent match with Lita selling the beating Gail gave to her leg and knee. Also, a very nice looking leg submission by Gail during this one.  Cut to Eric Bishoff's office, Johnny Nitro and The Coach are there at Mr. Bishoff's request. Bishoff makes a match for Badd Blood this Sunday of  Eugene versus The Coach . Nitro makes a joke at Bishoff's expense and gets booked in a match versus Eugene tonight that, if he loses, " YOU'RE FIRED! ".   Match 2 - Batista vs. Shelton Benjamin  - Batista wins with his finisher; the sit down powerbomb. A match to build for the  Randy Orton vs. Shelton Benjamin  match this Sunday for the   Intercontinental Title . Orton cost Benjamin the match when he distracted both the ref and Benjamin long enough for Batista to hit a STIFF clothesline and the powerbomb for the win. Afterwards, Batista, Ric Flair, and Orton beat down Benjamin.  Cut to Edge and Chris Benoit backstage and they start to argue a bit about their  World Tag Team Titles  loss last week to La Résistance. The Coach interrupts them to inform Benoit that he has a match tonight versus BOTH members of La Résistance in a handicap match. Jump to Bishoff's office where Trish Stratus and Tyson Tomko get their wish:  Chris Jericho vs. Tyson Tomko  at Badd Blood AND Jericho must wrestling tonight on Raw. Trish then makes the case that she beat Lita a few weeks ago and now Lita beat Gail Kim, so she should be the #1 contender for Victoria's  Women's Title . Before Bishoff can respond, Kane comes barging into the office and orders Trish and Tomko gone so he can talk to Bishoff alone.   Match 3 - Chris Jericho vs. A-Train  - Jericho wins with his submission move; the Walls of Jericho. Jericho had his ribs taped up to sell the beatings he's been getting from Tomko the past two weeks.  Triple H enters the Pepsi Arena and strides to the ring. He points to a skybox where he will sit and enjoy first hand watching Randy Orton take apart Shawn Michaels in the main event. He states he has never lost a Hell in a Cell match and while he knows he'll never go to heaven, he'll see Shawn Michaels this weekend in Hell.   Match 4 - Chris Benoit vs. La Résistance  - The match started as a two on one, but after a run in by Edge to save Benoit from a two man beating, Bishoff makes it a handicap tag match and gives La Résistance another partner; Kane!   Match 4.5 - Chris Benoit  Edge vs. La Résistance  Kane  - Kane wins with his finisher, the chokeslam, on Chris Benoit. This match was meant to show that both Benoit has a chance to get Kane in the Crippler Crossface and Kane can pin Benoit. Standard "Raw Before The Pay Per View" match.   Match 5 - Eugene vs. Johnny Nitro  - Eugene wins with a double ax handle off the top rope. Match had Eugene out wrestle Nitro many times. Coach and Eugene have a stare down / wave down which ends with Coach falling off of King and JR's announce booth.  Cut to Lita talking to Matt Hardy on her cell phone backstage. She mentions getting a  Women's Title  match at Badd Blood (excuse me?). As she gets off the phone, she turns into Kane. He says that he convinced Bishoff to add her to the match at Badd Blood. "I thought it was over,” she says. "I lied," Kane replies. O...k.  The King and JR run the card for Badd Blood:   - World Tag Team Championship  - La Résistance(c) vs. Chris Benoit  Edge   - World Heavyweight Championship - Chris Benoit(c) vs. Kane   - Intercontinental Championship  - Randy Orton(c) vs. Shelton Benjamin   - Women’s Championship  Fatal Four Way (First Pin or Submission Wins Title) - Victoria(c) vs. Gail Kim vs. Lita vs. Trish Stratus  - Chris Jericho vs. Tyson Tomko  - Eugene vs. Jonathan Coachman   - Hell In A Cell  - Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels   Match 6 - Randy Orton vs. Shawn Michaels  - Shawn Michaels wins via DQ when Batista comes down to the ring to attack Michaels as he is about to hit Orton with his finisher; Sweet Chin Music. Michaels turns the tide on them and lays them both out with a steel chair. He then works his way through the crowd to the skybox. We fade to black with Triple H and Shawn Michaels brawling in the skybox.  Review - An overall good show considering, as I said, that it's the show the Monday before a Pay Per View. Some strong matches that built towards the feuds going into this Sunday. I'm still not sure what to think of the Lita / Kane / Matt Hardy triangle. It keeps making me thing that Kane has no shot to win this Sunday since he has a "backup" story. Bump of the night was without a doubt the STIFF clothesline from Batista to Benjamin. Check back later in the week for my Badd Blood picks.
