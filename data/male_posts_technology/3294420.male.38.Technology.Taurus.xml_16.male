I noticed that Maureen signs her messages Ct Mom, so I decided to sign mine CO Mom.  (Just so you can tell the difference).  I think you can tell the difference anyway.  I spoke to Jeanette on Sunday and she told me about visiting Maya and that her pictures don't do her justice, that she is so much cuter in person.  How that can be I don't know.  She is already the cutest baby I have ever seen.  Gina, I love your postings to keep us up-to-date in Maya's progress.  Hope she continues to eat well and has no further set-backs in her eating habits.  I know you can't wait to have her home.   Love you, all three of you, CO Mom
