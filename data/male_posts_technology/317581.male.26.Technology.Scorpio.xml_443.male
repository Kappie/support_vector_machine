Then know that you are unique, at least in what I've come to understand women. And if we are friends then it is probably true that you do not date mostly jerks as I don't like to associate myself with such women, nor do I have friends that are jerks, so they tend not to attract said women.   I'm leaving for idaho in 7.5 hours. I'll catch you guys later. Peace-
