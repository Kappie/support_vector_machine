You know when you want to do these things (get stuff off your mind) and find a way to do it, then when you actually GET to doing it...you find yourself wondering "What did I want to say?" in the first place. You have the words, you have the medium, you have the audience (somewhat), then what's wrong? Absolutely nothing. It's like trying to answer a question you don't know the answer to and would not know any way possible to find out what the answer would be! How does that work?! Too many questions.  On the other hand, I'm at work right now. It's  urlLink there . I'm looking at my phone right now and wondering...why is it so huge? I mean, can't Nextel find a way to make these behemoths smaller? Not smaller as in Nokia "I can barely hold it with my two fingers" smaller, but at least a comfortable..  Uh oh...call coming.
