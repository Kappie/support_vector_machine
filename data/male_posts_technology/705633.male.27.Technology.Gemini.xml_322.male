That is if you excuse the Lack of one Kidney, Broken Liver and my Lungs are probably not too healthy either. Promise to tell the Truth...  Etc. Etc.  Well I threw together a costume for last night with the help of my Brother "Dougal" and his lovely girlfriend Kate.  I grabbed an old white shirt (Why is it the undead always wear white?) and dark trousers and shredded them for a typical Zombie effect, threw some Leather armour over the top and let Kate paint my face up.  The effect turn out to be pretty good and I have photos, which I will post when they are developed.
