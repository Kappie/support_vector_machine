    
      Well then. I haven't posted in a while now, and apparently my loyal fanbase is demanding that issue be rectifyed with all due haste. I'll skip the trials and tribulations of my personal life for the moment (and frankly, if you don't know me, why do you care anyway?) and instead jump to the meme at hand -- namely, where I surf on a regular basis.    Morning tends to start with a bit of cereal and  dose of the real news from...   urlLink CNN  - well okay, this is more like news-lite, but it at least tells me the world hasn't blown up overnight.   urlLink The Seattle Post-Intelligencer  - one of the two daily papers here, and IMHO the more even-handed.  And of course, as Melia mentioned,  urlLink Fark ... your one-stop shop for Discussion/Weird News before it gets posted there.    So then it's off to work.  My exciting work-related links feature some of the following...   urlLink University of Washington  - They give me a student ID, I get discounts places.  It's a great relationship.   urlLink Dept of Genome Sciences  - My department.  Find my awful ID badge picture in the Students section.   urlLink FlyBase  - The one-stop shop for all  Drosophila melanogaster  related biological information. Everything from the complete genome sequence to proteomic interaction information. Look up your favorite gene, like  cheap date  or  Npc1b  (the gene I work on!)  urlLink  National Center For Biotechnology Information  (NCBI) - the National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine clearinghouse for all biomedical science information. Contains sequence for practically every organism that has any DNA sequenced, protein sequences, scientific journal references, etc.  urlLink  Entrez-Pubmed  @ NCBI - The Google of biomedical scientific journal article references. Handy for when you want to look up if anyone has studied the effects of excessive internet usage on brain tumor formation.    Well, work's boring. So I've got plenty of fun bookmarks around to keep me occupied and looking like I'm busy annotating some DNA sequences or something.  I'll spare you the tcz ones and move along.   urlLink BBspot  - A daily satire site that also features links of the day to all sorts of entertainment, flash games and the like.   urlLink NationStates  - A website spun-off of Max Barry's book Jennifer Government. Create your own nation and rule it with an iron fist as legislation passes your desk. Come join us in the TCZ region.   urlLink Digital Archive Project  - An online project to use eMule for good instead of evil. These wonderful people have gathered listings of all sorts of quality television programming that has gone off the air and is not available for sale in proper (VHS or DVD) formats, and provides the information and wherewithal to download episodes in AVI format for your personal viewing pleasure. Their most popular item is the entirity of MST3k, but other things include most of the series from Adult Swim on Cartoon Network, and some classic shows like Pete  Pete.   urlLink Sluggy Freelance  - Worship the comic.  If I was able to get Fire hooked, I can get you hooked as well.   urlLink KEXP 90.3  - A local independent music station that's almost entirely listener-supported. The breadth and depth of this station are almost beyond words, and their website is a work of art. They have shows ranging from indie rock to jazz to reggae to African beats to electronica to rockabilly. They offer live streaming of all their broadcasts in numerous formats (including 1.4 mbps uncompressed!), a two-week streaming archive of all shows and permanent archives of the numerous artists who appear and do in-studio performances. They also have the honor of being the first group to ever wean money out of me at a pledge drive multiple years running, so that should tell you something about their quality.    Nerd links (because who doesn't have a few hiding in their bookmark folder?)   urlLink National Earthquake Information Clearninghouse  (USGS) - Near-realtime listing of all moderate-to-major earthquakes on the planet, with all sorts of geological and historical information to boot.   urlLink Operational Siginifcant Event Imagery  (NOAA) - Cool imagery from NOAA weather satellites of things like hurricanes, forest fires, floods and other funkiness. Lots of good candidate desktop background images.   urlLink Astronomy Picture Of the Day  (NASA) - A new and often damn cool astronomy-related picture every day. They often have beautiful images from Hubble and the numerous other telescopes now peering deeper and deeper into the far reaches of the universe. Also lots of potential desktop backgrounds.   urlLink Jet Propulsion Laboratory  (NASA) - The home of the Mars Rovers and Cassini mission to Saturn, among other interstellar adventures. Another site for all sorts of cool space-related photographs.   urlLink The IHOZ Interstate Page  - The most comprehensive listing of US Interstate information around. I can't believe I just admitted to bookmarking this site, either. But wait...   urlLink Kurumi's 3di page  (that's three-digit interstate, if you were wondering.) - That's right, information on all 3di's in the USA. Ever wonder how many Interstate 295s there really are? (seven.) Plus all sorts of historical information about highways that never got built for various reasons.    Right. That'll do you all for the time being, along with some others that have already been mentioned below. Now go off and learn all about the weird history of Interstate 90. Next post, three weeks.
