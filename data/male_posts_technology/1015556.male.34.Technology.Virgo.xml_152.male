I liked: -  Insist teens give you at least one day's notice of any request. - If you can't stay up until your teen's curfew, sleep in his bed. - Don't dismiss puppy love.  Some other good advice on acne, sleep habits and straight talk from (gasp!) actual teeenagers. I thought most of the article was pretty right on.  But on the other hand, it made me realize that the students I come into direct contact with, wow, some of these things don't apply.  Because I think: #1 - they are mature #2 - they understand life's priorities correctly #3 - they have a realization that they have it pretty good in comparision to the world around them.
