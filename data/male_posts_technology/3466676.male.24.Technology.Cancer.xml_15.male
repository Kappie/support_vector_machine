If you are caught driving your car faster than the posted speed limit, prepare to pay between $196 and $450 for it.  In a construction zone those fines are doubled.  According to the last police officer I talked to, you will not get a ticket for going 10 km/h over the limit, but he would not answer if 11 km/h was the ticket-worthy speed threshold.    Speeding itself does not cause accidents.  Reckless driving and stupid drivers do cause accidents.  Do they set up "stupid driver traps"?  Of course not.  If you spend more than ten minutes on the road in a day, you will see at least one incident of a stupid driver causing a near-accident or worse.  It's the same with the drivers that think the right turn lane is actually for passing cars through intersections, that is a far more dangerous maneuver than having a heavy foot on a six-lane highway.  The safety of automobiles, handling ability, and braking power has increased exponentially in the last 20 years, yet the speed limits have not gone up at all.  On many stretches of road, there are concrete barriers in the center of the road, and on each side and the limit is merely 80 km/h.  Where is the danger?  It is impossible to run off the road or into incoming traffic.  There are no intersections to cross.  The only reason to have an artificially low speed limit is to make money.  When you see new highways made, you can see that they build locations for the police to hide and set up speed traps.  Those locations are safe for the police to jump in front of "speeding" cars and have them stop.  If a driver is on a straight stretch of highway and has the time to safely stop the vehicle because some maniac jumps out in the middle of the highway, then they are not actually speeding.    Yes, I am bitter.  I am $196 worth of bitter.
