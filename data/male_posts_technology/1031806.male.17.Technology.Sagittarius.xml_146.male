I have been weighing out everything, and what is good for me.  I also have been talking to my Mom about it all.  And here is my opinion, because I'm done with all this crap.  ---------------------------------------------------- I know if Brady really wanted to he could turn around. Brady Can't be helped, I wanted to help him, because he is a great guy.  the reason he can't be helped is because he won't help himself. why you ask? because He loves attention, that's why he continues to be in areas or subjects having to do with the rivas family or anything that gives attention to him.  And I'm sure that's not the only problem. ---------------------------------------------------- I'm not saying I'm perfect we all have problems,insecurities, and issues, I guess just one of mine is low tolerance.    My only friends that have helped me grow mentally are you armaan and andrew motimer.  ---------------------------------------------------- And the Rivas family in my opinion, not having to do with Brady or beth...just my own experience, are the type of people I hope to never be like.    They have everything wrong about me, even how they think they know me, If they really knew me they would hate me like they hate Brady, I'm sure. I'm also "VERY" tired of being bossed around by people who think they are better in every way, when they really aren't, because no man is above another we are all equally guilty.  and when you don't do as they say some tend to get physical or argue aloud. And I don't want to be around that anymore. I really have nothing good to say about the Rivas family,  and just one of the reasons I can't be a friend to the Rivas family is because in there minds they are perfect, and there is no helping the perfect. so I'm done. ---------------------------------------------------- And going to Drew could help you, but most likely won't, and you know what? I hope I'm completely wrong about every single thing I have said so far and that I will say.     ----------------------------------------------------   I'm cutting myself off from this whole mess. I have a new screen name. I will no longer be answering the phone for these numbers/people and not because I hate the people I just hate the way, and well the retardedness at times.      [at this point he lists all phone numbers associated with the Lee and Rivas families]     Family's: Rivas Lee         And I have blocked certain e-mail addresses. I wonder if this is what you might call a mental break down of some kind. O and tell the rivas family not to bother coming to my house, because like I have said I'm done. ---------------------------------------------------- Here is some advise to the rivas family in the matter of Brady and ect:    This is love: To love people as we find them, and if they have weaknesses, to accept them with a heart filled with love.   "Love never fails." 1 Cor. 13:8   A friend is someone that will except you the way he or she found you, And if she or he has weaknesses, to accept him or her with a heart filled with love and to help them no matter the matter because that is just one of the many things friend are for.   1 Corinthians 13:1-13  I may speak in the tongues of men, even angels; but if I lack love, I have become merely blaring brass or a cymbal clanging.  I may have the gift of prophecy, I may fathom all mysteries, know all things, have all faith-enough to move mountains; but if I lack love, I am nothing.  I may give away everything that I own, I may even hand over my body to be burned; but if I lack love, I gain nothing.  Love is patient and kind, not jealous, not boastful, not proud, rude or selfish, not easily angered, and it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not gloat over other peoples sins  But takes its delight in the truth. Love always bears up, always trusts, always hopes, always endures.  Love never ends; but prophecies will pass, tongues will cease, knowledge will pass. For our knowledge is partial, and our prophecy partial; but when the perfect comes, he partial will pass.  When I was a child, I spoke like a child, thought like a child, argued like a child; now that I have become a man, I have finished with childish ways.   For now we see obscurely in a mirror, but then it will be face to face. Now I know partly; then I will know fully, just as God has fully known me.  But for now, three things last- Trust, Hope, Love; And the greatest of these is Love.   -----------------------------------------------------    Our "group"  (circle of friendship)  is a place of warmth and caring  (but for me its been cold because of serious competition in the area of play or "games", and caring which is fake if acted out)  Where people come together  (now there is a rift in-between the Lee family and the Rivas family which complicates and complicates over and over.)  for listening and sharing. ( which can be hard at times because of the rift but other wise is easy for me and you) A place of kindness and trust. ( it used to be, and if there still is its decaying) of tears and laughter too; ( tears of joy? I don't think so at the moment, laughter seems a bit scares but I could be wrong.)  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Armaan, I know I suck as a friend too. I'm very sorry about everything. if you could you might want to put this on your blog. but you might wanna edit out the phone #. I'm sure I'll talk to you soon, but I will see you later dude.   Sincerely,  Cameran Renata Heckenlaible      p.s. I'm done  .....Hiding in my hole, like andrew.
