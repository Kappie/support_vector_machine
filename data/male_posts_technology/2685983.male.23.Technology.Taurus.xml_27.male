They are very indie influenced and have a keyboard. I'm excited and nervous. I haven't told Jeff that I'm doing this. I feel bad about betraying him since what we are doing is sounding so great but until we have a drummer it's just going nowhere. I'm not saying that I'm quiting the Bob/Jeff band. I still will put just as much time into that. In fact, this will be good, I will be dedicating all my free time to music instead of just wasting it.  I can't wait until Thursday. Jenn's coming.
