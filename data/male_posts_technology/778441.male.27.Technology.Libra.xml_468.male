Time and time again, all the top officials in the Bush administration had claimed that there was 'overwhelming' proof that there were extensive ties between Saddam Hussein and Osama's terror organization, Al Qaeda.    But the Sept. 11 commission (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States) concluded that it found  urlLink no 'collaborative relationship' between Iraq and Al Qaeda .    Now, rumblings are starting to increase, about the  urlLink alleged links between Iran and Al Qaeda . Evidence of these purported links has been uncovered by the same Sept. 11 commission. The evidence suggests that      eight and ten of the 14 "muscle" hijackers—that is, those involved in gaining control of the four 9/11 aircraft and subduing the crew and passengers—passed through Iran in the period from October 2000 to February 2001.   At the same time,the commission has not found any evidence to suggest that Iran knew about the Al Qaeda plans to carry out the 9/11 attacks.    George W. Bush has meanwhile asserted that  urlLink US is actively investigating  ties between the Iranian government and Al Qaeda.     Mr. Bush noted in a brief Oval Office meeting with reporters that the Central Intelligence Agency had found "no direct connection between Iran and the attacks of Sept.11," but he said "We will continue to look and see if the Iranians were involved."       Iran, on the other hand, claims that  urlLink it has dismantled the Al Qaeda network  inthe country - a claim that has not really been validated with any evidence from the Iranians.    While Iran may have passively assisted the AlQaeda operatives in their endeavours, it remains to be seen if the US can prove its claimsof the seemingly tenuouslinks between Iran andOsama's terror network. After all, the shrill voices that bayed vociferously, claiming Iraq's links with Al Qaeda have now had to eat a humble pie! It remainsto be seen if there is any substance in the US claims or is it just another case ofBush crying ' wolf! '    And all the while, with Pakistaniforceshunting Al Qaeda operatives all across the country,the US continues to turn a blind eye to theobvious links between Pakistan and Al Qaeda!
