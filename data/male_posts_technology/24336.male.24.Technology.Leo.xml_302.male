When most people (especially men) are accused of being racist, they vehemently exclaim "But some of my friends are black!".  This may very well be true, but well assured that these 'black' friends act more 'stereotypically white' than the average.  I could almost say that I fall into this category.  Two friends of mine are just these sort of friends.  They have normal midwestern accents, wear t-shirts and average clothes you can find at the mall, etc etc.  Lastly, they have extreme public courtesy.  The public editor of the Chicago Tribune comments on the  urlLink lack of public courtesy  that some blacks have.  By the way, the editor is also black.  Does agreeing make me racist?  No, I equally discriminate against anyone that pisses me off.
