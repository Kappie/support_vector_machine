Nothing yet. And that is the precise reason why I am blogging!! I got so many thing done! Bills. Bank accounts. Emails to friends. Blogs. Notes to myself. And if I were at home, I would still be in my bed! Later in the day I would have gone to the gym, watched a few movies and met friends and felt bored at how I passed my weekend in the same old way! But this is good. The day begun early and I am chilling!! Listening to music. Simple pure relaxation!     - Kandarp
