My plan was to run to UC and do Yassos on the outdoor track only to find out that it has been reduced to a heap of mud.  What I ended up doing was running to the fraternity house, watching basketball and visiting for 5 minutes, and running back to my house.  I ran west on Taft which elicited many odd looks as I ran through the 'hood in shorts and ran back on MLK which elicited a few less odd looks.  Possibly my favorite part of the run was scaring some large black man half to death as I whipped right by him.  I was hardly making a sound running, he didn't see me coming, and I was past him by the time he was able to cry out in shock of seeing me run by.  I heard him behind me saying, "Boy!  I didn't even see that guy!" to his friend.  The run felt awesome.  I wore the knockaround shoes from Brad with the Betty Crocker insoles.  They are lighter and roll better than my other shoes, but they are smaller which caused some tender areas on my feet after that long of a run.  Other than that, my shin splint pain has all but subsided to a dull ache every now and then and my calves are still a little sore.
