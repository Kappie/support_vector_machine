The new version folds UltraDev, the company's Web application builder (which no longer exists as a standalone product), and adds more database code support and server code libraries. That makes Dreamweaver the only program developers will need to create high-performance, database-driven sites."

Macromedia is certainly making a big splash everywhere you look these days. I myself started using  Dreamweaver MX , and I am still not sure how I feel about it. My first impressions are mostly negative, mainly because I was use to my "tried  true" environment, so it's possibly just getting use to the new IDE. I am finding things I like though, we will have to wait and see.
