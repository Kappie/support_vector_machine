Elyse then confessed to the camera that she didn't understand why , but then admitted that she didn't know much about prostitute fashion trends. Funny smartass chick.  Met my sis for dinner at Orchard after going for my pre-employment checkup, yeah I am getting my contract renewed. It was nice; haven't seen her in like 2 months.  Updated her about what I been doing socially , which didn't take too long for obvious reasons. But I realised recently that I don't behave the same way around my sis as I do with other people.  I don't really joke that much around her like I do with friends that I am very comfortable with.  Which is kinda weird cos we are and have always been  pretty close.  Hmm one more question for the shrink.    Oh and also met a gal whose knowledge of music totally dwarves my own! This gal was into everything from Led Zeppelin to Mars Volta and she was recommending me so many bands that I never even heard of. And she even has vinyls and stuff! How cool is that ?
