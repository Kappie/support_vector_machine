Mark Cuban likes forwards, can you tell? Anyway,  urlLink the article  got me thinking about whether Fortson can get back to the 16 and 16 he had in 2000 (granted, he only played 6 games), or even the 11 and 11 he had in 2001 (playing in 77 games). That sure would make him a good pick-up. I'm not sure if it qualifies him as a sleeper...  If he can get back to a double-double average, the Sonics have pulled off one of the better trades I've seen in a while.   Fantasy Impact   The article mentions that he'll be competing for the PF spot with  urlLink Vladimir Radmonovic ,  urlLink Reggie Evans , and  urlLink Nick Collison . They also say the Radman will spend some time at SF, and that Collison may play the 5 against smaller centers. Both of those statements make sense. Collison hasn't played in the NBA yet, so his minutes will likely be limited as he gains more experience. Evans has been given minutes, but hasn't been able to produce like Fortson has in the past (at least not yet). Yahoo has Evans listed before Radmanovic on the Depth Chart, but I find that hard to believe.  Don't bother with Booth (who was traded for Fortson) unless your league is approaching 18 teams deep.
