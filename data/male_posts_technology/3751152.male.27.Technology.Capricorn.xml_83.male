I haven't had HBO in yonks so I never was able to watch it. And I'm not really one to rent DVDs of television shows - well, until out of boredom one day I rented 24 and well, most of you know how that turned out. So when Sex and the City premiered on TBS I decided to see what all the hype was about.  I liked it, laughed with it, but on the whole I found myself troubled by how I couldn't relate to much of it at all. I couldn't find a single thread to attach myself to that would suck me into it. No pun intended. I was regarding it as a light, fluffy fun little show but I wouldn't be devastated if I missed catching it when it aired.  So now it's the 4th of July weekend and my daughter's birthday is over, it's too feckin' hot and humid outside to go do anything and frankly, I live in one of the dullest places on earth anyway so I decide to spend the day seeing the real Sex and the City, The episodes with the swearing and the nudity and all the good stuff they just can't show on network television.  I definitely like the dirty version much better :)  Not that the show is like watching porn or anything. It just seemed a little deeper (again, no pun intended) and less fluffy with all the juicy bits back in. But in my haste to get out of the hectic crowds in the only Blockbuster in town, I grabbed the wrong season. I blame shitty labelling actually. Anyway, I ended up renting the sixth and final season. Or what I thought was the whole season anyway. Luckily SatC seems to be one of those shows where it's ok to jump in anywhere. So I watched episodes 1-12 and I found that there were many threads I could grab onto and enjoy the show - but my favourite thread was seeing Misha again. I had forgotten that Baryshnikov was a part of the final season; I had read about it a while ago and I remember thinking, 'Oh my god Baryshnikov!'  I love that man. I saw him in White Knights when I was a little older than my daughter and ohhh, he just killed me in that. The accent, the body, the glow-in-the-dark-eyes, the beautiful dancing.... *girly sigh* I know White Knights was no Oscar-worthy movie but it will always be on my Top 10 list of favourite films just for the interaction between Misha and the legend Gregory Hines (R.I.P.).  I won't gush anymore about Misha, who despite Corey's determined declarations that he is not aging well, looked just as beautiful to me now as he did back then when he showed up in episode 12. Man oh man. So when I finished that disc I was all fired up to rent the final episodes and see more of him. Yes I know how the show ends and stuff but I wanted to look at him some more :)  Unfortunately the fecking final episodes haven't been released on DVD yet. I'm so crushed. And I can't for the life of me find out anywhere online when they will be released which is even more disappointing.  This post is in danger of reaching Fire lengths if I carry on about it, but I've decided maybe I should actually start watching the show from the beginning and kill time before they release Misha for me. So if you'll excuse me, I saw a cute pair of Manolo's and they are calling my name.
