Even though I still think a good majority of the people in the world are idiots, every now and then I meet or learn of people who are quite intelligent and have a lot to offer.  I'm not saying anything about my own intelligence, but I like to think that it at least means something that I take the time to think about things, have independent thoughts, and have at least some degree of concern about the world that surrounds me.  Most of the time, no matter what I'm doing, whether it be driving, working, or people watching, it never ceases to amaze me how so many idiots make it as far as they do.  I see some pretty stupid stuff (like most of what's on network television.)   The other day I borrowed the relatively new  urlLink Bad Religion  CD from a co-worker.  He made mention that it contains a rather large amount of anti-Bush lyrics.  In the past I've noticed that their lyrics are pretty intelligent, so I figured I'd delve a bit into the history of the band.  I've never been a huge Bad Religion fan, and although I like their music, I admittedly don't know much about the band members or their history.   I did a  urlLink google search  about their singer, Greg Graffin, and it turns out that he's quite an interesting guy.  He has a Masters Degree is Paleoanthropology (or something), a PhD in Evolutionary Biology, and has taught classes at Cornell.  His PhD project about Evolution and Religion can be found  urlLink here .   I was amazed to learn of this.  I know that musicians (real musicians) and lyricists (not those who write "Oops, I did it again"), are usually pretty intelligent.  But this amazed me.  To start a band at age 15 " urlLink in response to the mediocrity and brainlessness of late-Cold War suburbia " and then go on to a 20+ year career in the industry, along with obtaining multiple advanced degrees, is quite astounding.  It certainly changes my opinion of what I had thought was just a group of guys enjoying a long career in the world of punk music.
