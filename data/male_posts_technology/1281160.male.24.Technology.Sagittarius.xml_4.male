Was not doing nothing much in particular at office yesterday. As a result, came in late today morning...   Ranjini had asked mailed me something about my previous entry. This is for her.   WMD - weapons of mass destruction, eg nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.   dithers- hesitates.   differs - thinks otherwise.
