Themed on Dolly Parton.   urlLink Dolly Wood   So, Friend that lives in Tennessee take the white trash quiz and scores under 30%.  Now, first, he drinks wine from a box. That by itself should make you 30% white trash.   But he also has family season pass to DOLLY WOOD!  He says it for his kids, but I know better.  He is into the grand ol opera stuff. I bet he even goes to the grand ol opera 3 times a year!  If that is not 100% white trash I dont know what is! heck he should have lifetime membership in the redeneck white trash society of tennesse!  Dolly Wood Jeez!
