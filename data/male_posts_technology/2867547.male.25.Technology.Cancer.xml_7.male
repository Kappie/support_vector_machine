The initial plan was to party together with my friends from FMI so I chose the retry party at Caramba as the most appropriate place for a company of various music tastes. But things went wrong and each of the 5 or 6 people I invited at some stage rejected to come. In fact they didin't miss a thing iin Caramba. We were there before 22:00 but the real thing started about 23:30 so we just drank couple of over-priced Amstel beers and contemplated the beautiful personnel.   We left Caramba at midnight, and after a long cigarette hunt we headed to Deep-Down club which was so full that 30 people were waiting outside (the reason behind that is probably the free entrance, cheap alcohol and stimulating techno music). We gave it up and tried Live House, but finally my cousin lead us to "3 Ushi" club. The entrance fee was 3 leva, but the beer was about 2 or 3 times cheaper then in Caramba. The club was full of nice-looking young people (predominately chicks :) ), dancing at the music.   After having a beer and contemplating the dancing chicks, we were ready for some action at the dance-floor. The music was chill and the atmosphere was more then excellent. We didn't leave the club until it was 3:45 in the morning.. and there were still some people dancing. Well, a night to remember (I add "3 Ushi" to my ultimate Favourites).
