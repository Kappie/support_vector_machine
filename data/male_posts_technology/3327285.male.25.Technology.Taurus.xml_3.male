Recently two constituents of mine had been removed from their positions in my department for illegal behavior that cost the company some dough.  One of these people happened to be my immediate boss.  Now this wasn't some run-of-the-mill asshole by any means.  I have worked with him for several years (6 to be exact).  The same goes for my co-worker who was also let go.  She was a firecracker in her own right, but she was one of the guys nonetheless.  Getting to the point, with my boss' removal, this opened up his position.  Now, not to take anything away from my ex-boss' performance, but he didn't exactly make HIMSELF look good, it was a combination of efforts between myself and my ex co-worker.  I had worked under him in another department 2 years prior, and it has been brought to my attention NOW that it was my efforts then that made him look good enough to get the job that he has recently been removed from.  I practically did his job, and all at the same time I made him look good.  Of course, little voices coming at me have led me to believe NOW that after all I did for him, he spent a good part of his tenure trying to debunk my efforts and, in essence, have me fired for incompetency.  What the hell is this?  After all I did for him, all the whining I endured, all the time we spent hanging out and grabbing drinks had all been for naught.  Well, this left me feeling pretty shitty, but also it instilled in me the power to regroup and try for his vacated position, a feat that should have been rather simple...If it weren't for one person, the ass-kisser.  I had the job pegged.  It was mine.  My supervisor, the one doing the hiring, even told me the job was written for me.  But, there was foul work afoot.  See, I work in an off-site building from my company's main campus.  We are a small, autonomous operation that employees 8 people.  We have our own system of leadership that runs very well, and we are a pretty tight group of people.  But, the particular operations I am involved with here is relatively new to this group.  And one of the people that started in this building, an ass-kisser by nature and reputation, has been hard-up for a leadership role since the my group showed up.  He was always promised, but never saw results.  He was ready to leave, and tried unsuccessfully several times prior to secure a leadership position outside of our building.  When the firings went down, you would have thought he was a starving dog salivating over a freshly-cut side of beef.  He was about to sink his teeth into it, until I stepped up and noted my desire to lead my group.  Then he stepped back, feeling the hurt of knowing that someone was more qualified than him to get the position.  A short victory for me that would never be celebrated.  When he announced to the super of his reluctance to apply for the job because of me, the super should have accepted it as the best thing to do and left it at that....but no.  He told him to apply anyway, as he wanted a variety of good candidates to choose from.  I saw this, originally, as a proving ground to stake my claim in once the position was handed to me.  What I should have seen was an obvious ploy to hand over MY job to the resident ass-kisser that the super has had a boner for since the day they started the operations.    No, he's not gay...he just sees himself in this kid.  I say kid because I am 3 years his elder.  I also have 3 years seniority over him.  So I should have rightfully received this job by default...but this is not the case.  In the end, ass-kiss gets the job and I get the bullshit cookie-cutter explanation of "He's had the leadership role in his eye a lot longer than you, and while you have the technical know-how and this position was practically made for you, I have to follow my instinct and go with what I feel is the better candidate."  Are you fucking kidding me?  Did he just say that?  This job was made for me...I am the most-qualified for the job...but because I didn't have the desire to be a leader (unbeknownst to said super, I have been trying to leave the building for some time in a leadership capacity, but nothing ever materialized from my leads), I lost out?  Are you on drugs?  How the hell can you begin to tell me something like this?  I should have seen it coming, but I was filled with so much pride from the number of people who wished me luck and assured me I would get the job that I was blindsided by this obvious case of favoritism.  I'd take it to HR, but in all honesty, it would cause me more grief from my super thinking I hate him, and my new boss thinking I am trying to screw him over and cost him his newly-acquired job.  So, what do I do?  Simple...start looking for something new.  Either inside the company, or out, I am poised with my schooling and my skills to find something better...and to get out of this obviously lop-sided rule that is going to run the building into a brick wall.  I used to have pride in my job...now I'm embarrassed I even work there.  Pity, because I make a good living and have a lot of time in it.  I just can't STAND to see undeserving people get a high-paying gig with responsibility they will obviously squander, or hand down to me for them to take credit for.  Ah, office life.
