As I suspected, Blogger programmers are favoring the most recent Windows-based browser coding.  While Mac IE has no problem with any other site I visit, I acknowledge it always lags a version behind what appears on Windows; as for Safari, it is a robust and capable browser, more recent than the latest Windows IE, yet it cannot display Blogger either.  No big deal; I just have to click a few more places than everyone else.  It only reveals the deficiencies of the immature and inexperienced Blogger engineers.
