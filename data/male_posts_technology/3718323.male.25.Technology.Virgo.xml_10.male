Every once in a while something happens, I see something or hear about something, and I get a feeling, though it's a bit strange. I think I'm seeking more fulfillment in my life, not in an unhappy with my life sort of way, but on a more personal level. I get these feelings that say I should be doing something different with my time, something that would bring me greater satisfaction.  I do a lot of reading, spend a lot of time outside, stuff like that, and that all makes me feel good. Escaping into a good book or learning about something new is a nice release, as is getting out of the hustle and bustle and finding myself alone on a trail in the mountains. I've even been searching for a different job, but the problem is that I want to keep doing what I'm doing (software), but maybe work with a non-profit or a company that has a  purpose . My problem is that I'm caught a bit in the middle; my training is in high tech and computers, which really isn't a "make a difference in the world" sort of field. But I've worked hard and I'm afraid to give up the progress that I've made, to take a lesser paying and lesser demanding job in return for greater personal fulfillment.   I don't dislike my job, I just feel like most people that work in environments like this become deadened in a way. Things become so routine that any creative forces in their lives slowly fade away. The little things that bring people pleasure, real and meaningful pleasure, disappear. It happens to everybody.   These feelings that I'm talking about are feelings that I get when I hear about genuine good in the world, or about people who genuinely need to be helped or who make a difference. I want to know that I've helped someone who truly  appreciates  it, something that I can't say I've really done before.   There is this guy, I'm assuming he's homeless, and I pass him on the way to work every morning. There are plenty of homeless people here, and I've never felt bad for any of them until this one guy. In general, I don't like the way that a lot transients beg and expect to be helped, and then seem irritated when you ignore them. But this guy, who I've seen in the same place every morning for at least a year, has an entirely different demeaner. He stands holding a sign, but his body language says that he doesn't expect anything. He has this neutral stare, he doesn't make eye contact, but he doesn't look away. He's older, and his hair is long enough to be in a ponytail under the hat he wears, and he's kind of a beard goatee. But the thing that caught my attention about him is that he is always standing. I've never seen him sit. And over time I've noticed his hair seem to get a bit more grey, and now he uses a cane for support, and he's more hunched over than he used to be. Every few weeks or so his clothes change. But other than that, he's always there, and always the same. I don't know what this means, but I've actually thought about asking him if he needs anything, old clothes, or food or something. I truly wonder what has brought him the this point.   When I see someone like him, that's when I feel like what I do isn't important enough. And that's why I'm searching, hoping I can find something that will bring me more fulfillment.
