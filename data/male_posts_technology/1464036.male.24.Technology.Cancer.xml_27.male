    
        The past week has been very productive, at least in the area of me losing weight. I've lost six pounds in 1 week. That's pretty good from what I hear. I worked out everyday (Monday - Friday) and ate nothing but healthy stuff (i.e., steamed vegtables, grilled chicken breast, atkins shakes, etc.).  Today, however, I got extremely hungry. Christie and I drove through Long John Silvers. I dropped $20+ on an order and brought it home. Christie got her burger and I threwmy food (the family order offish and chicken)out. I got two pieces of shrimp and Christie stated, "You know if you eat all of this, the past week has been for nothing." I first got mad at her for making the statement because I was craving unhealthy food, but soon realized that she was right. Hence, the throwing away of the food.  Yes, yes, I know there are starving kids in Ethiopia. I pray for them as often as I can, but I won't even be able to do that if I die from a heart attack. Week 2 starts tomorrow. I'll keep you posted.  Thank you to everyone who is supporting me in this life change (losing weight and eating right).  ILY
