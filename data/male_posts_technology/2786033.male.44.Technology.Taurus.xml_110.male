Ooops, no swearing. (A long search for the all-too-fitting Bender .wav file, and I came up with nothing. So here's the script.)   Bender:   Well, this is just great. What's the point of living if I can't say           "ass"? [Gasps] Hey, I didn't blow up! Ass! Ass! Ass! Ass! Ass! All           right! I'm back in the saddle.   If anyone wants to use this for a blog title, g'head.   If you can name the movie and actor who I quote in the title of this post, I salute you!
