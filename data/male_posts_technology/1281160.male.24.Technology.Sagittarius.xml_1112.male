Rock, Rap, or Pop, are smaller schools of music and the very fact that somebody listens to this music means he has an ear for it. Classical music is like a university. You need to graduate to it."  "Throughout history different forms of music have gained popularity but these have not taken the place of classical music. Thirty years ago if we got an audience of fifty it was considered great. Today, we can expect even 10,000 people. It is wonderful that in today's fast-paced life people do find the time for a classical concert. What is more heartening however, is that the audience is made up of young listeners, the so-called Rap generation. Does it really indicate classical music is losing out?"  - Pandit Jasraj
