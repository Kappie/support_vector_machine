 There just hasn't been a safe thing to eat these last few days.  Seems like no matter what, I get sick.  Today was better though, but I didn't eat enough.  I have a list of the things I ate today, and it looks long but the ammounts are very small.  I didn't, however, suffer any extreme ill affects today.  I had a few rough moments, but not too bad.  The worst was probably around 10:00 when my stomach was very empty except for water.  That odd hollow feeling was very unsettling. 

 Tomorrow I start my first day at my new job.  This is going to be a challenge.
