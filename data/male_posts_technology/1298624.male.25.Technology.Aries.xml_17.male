I can never have a jon in painting. I'm sure it will all come out. Welps... I am gonna play some SIMS now. My dad went to pick up mom and then they are going to their fave store... Home Depot. Meryl and I will go back outside when they come home. Anyways... talk to you later. Love you!! Mwah! mwah!!
