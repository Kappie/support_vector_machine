So, here is my feed back about the layout sir!  1. title: too big and it is, as it touches the blogspot ad and looks awkward. so can be reduced a bit. All together the layout has got a funky look i believe. 2 Recent posts title is too bold and even the day and date is not appealing. All the fonts look coarse to me. no smooth finish it has got. cant we polish the fonts a bit? Cant we stick to one particular type of font, rather than experimenting with many number of fonts? 3. the box in which our blog content lies: Grey background is good, but the letters touching the margin looks as if we are trying to stuff more in less space which can be avoided by giving enough padding. 4. Switch styles is not working and so pls. do look into it. Infact i dont use it much, but then since i wasnt that impressed by the layout, i thought lemme switch to different style, but to my dismay it dint work. 5. Since the archive section is a weekly one, its taking a long space and cant we switch to monthly archive from now on. Anyway we have search blog option which will help us to retrieve required info based on date or content and so i dont feel it necessary to maintain the archives to be done weekly. Monthly will do. 6. no links under blog rolling. what happened to that? i cant switch between the blogs just i do before. i want that back now immediately. how can u remove it without asking us? atleast me! 7. And the box of declaration can be had in the side bar as its now. it looks good! 8. y contact alone is not in pink as other links like home, about etc in the menu bar below the title?  Hmmmmmmmmm........ as such only this much i have to say about the layout, fix these if u feel they ought to be else, .........  And sorry guys for not being active for the past few days. Got some work at our office and these days i am spending my time in reading a fantastic novel........ Yes its by a famous russian author! can u people guess it?Yes, its Anna Karenina. Really if i say i have read a book worth a read all of my life time, then this is going to be one of them. Yes, i am in Part two and its so huge and its so alluring that its the only entertainment for me at office these days. yes, i dont own that book, but read it online! Its so so interesting that i have almost given up the art of mailing or blogging, except if needed.   My thoughts about the book, yes ofcourse i am planning to post a review of each part from next week. Its a big novel which runs into 9 parts and so many pages. Let me see if i can or not! Since i am not a pace rider on books like jax, i cant finish off in a week's time and i read it online in between my work to relax myself. but then, coz i love to read this book, i dont want to finish off soon too........  Ok meet u all with reviews and my new year resolutions in forth coming blogs.  bye for now!
