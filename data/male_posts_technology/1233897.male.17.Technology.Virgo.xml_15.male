Since I'm trying a lot lot lot harder to live my life in a way that glorifies God, I figured my blog ought to show that.  I'm not perfect, I'm a sinner, and I appologize deeply to those I've hurt... and continued hurting through things I've posted in the past.  I'm sincerely appologizing to anyone I've ever hurt... and hoping that you can all manage to forgive me. Right now, I want to put the past in the past... and start again. New Beginnings.... those are wonderful things. It's true for school, and it's true for life.  Right now, I really feel that the song Ocean Floor, by Audio Adrenaline, really applies.  The mistakes i've made  that cause pain  i couldve done without  oh my selfish thoughts  oh my pride  the things i...  you have forgotten about   they're all behind you  they'll never find you  they're on the ocean floor  your sins are forgotten  they're on the bottom  of the ocean floor   My misdeeds  oh my greive  the things that harm me now  they're not a pretty site to see  but they wipe away  by a mighty, mighty wave...mighty, mighty wave   they're behind you  they'll never find you  they're on the ocean floor  your sins are forgotten  they're on the bottom  they're on the ocean floor  your sins are erased  and they are no more  they're out on the ocean floor   take them away...  to return no more...  take them away...  to the ocean floor...to the ocean floor...   they're all behind you  they'll never find you  they're on the ocean floor...  your sins are forgotten  they're on the bottom  all on the ocean floor  your sins are erased  they are no more  they're out on the ocean floor  your sins are forgotten  they're on the bottom  they're on the ocean floor  your sins are erased and  they are no more  they're on the ocean floor...    And for that, I am very happy. The wounds I have caused will heal... God will provide for those people.  In that sense, this blog is hopefully going to become a lot less about me, and more about God and what he's doing... though I may throw in a little bit about things going on recently... just a few personal updates... but nothing near what it was before.  So, with that, I'm going to end this post.
