Strawberries and chocolate whip cream sounds about as good as things could possibly get. I just had a strawberry thing from  urlLink veniero's . I actually really like all types of berries.  Blueberries.  Those are good.  Raspberries and Blackberries are delicious.  And holy fucking Boyzenberries are amazing.  I'm feeling so much better today than I have all week at work.  I finally disposed of the annoying techno music.  I am sitting and dreaming and listening to  urlLink dublab , its Morpho right now.  Diet vanilla coke is in the house.  Three day weekend is almost in effect.  I just need to find a way to continue to eat good berries all weekend.  Yes, I need to suck on succulent strawberries for the next several days and listen to some brilliant hip hop shit and I will be living sweet life as poised, aware, and vibrant as I was at age 6. I think thats actually why I like berries so much. They remind me of age 6. I would sneak away from my grandparents house to trek through the woods, skip rocks, pick up raccoon skulls and tortoise shells, get my legs cut up by thorns and eat berries before Id finally arrive at my destination, my dad's little townhouse he shared with several other people.  A woman named betty.  I think it was actually her house. They called her betty and the green door.  She had a green door.  And a shitload of marbles in her attic.  I'd spend the night there on the floor in the living room and laugh riotously way past my bedtime about marmots and dwarves and rice paper houses that never got built.
