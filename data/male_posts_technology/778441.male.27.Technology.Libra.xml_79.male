But yesterday evening, I finally gathered enough courage and made a call and asked her when she would be free today evening, and decided to meet her at 8:00 PM today!  I'm feeling jittery all day and as the time approaches, I'm beginning to feel some butterflies fluttering about in my tummy! God! ... I thought I could keep my emotions in check! ... How wrong I was!!!  All those who know Sonali (that's her name!) have told me that she's good!  I know that if I don't take the plunge now, I'll regret it and it'll hurt. I just hope that I am doing the right thing and not rushing into this. But who knows... by the end of this evening, spent with her, I may have left a part of me with her.  So... wish me luck ppl!!! ... I promise to tell you all how it goes today evening!! :-)  cheers!
