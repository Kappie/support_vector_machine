I went behind the building waiting for the cops to leave and . hm ah their were about to leave intel one of the teachers sade "wait he might be in the ally behind the school and I thought that they were after me so I started ..... Ah hm and you know that running from cops is really bad to do its really and really really bad if you run and you did not do anything so I ran home .... And mm I called in sick because I thought that no one saw me at school....... And they sade "ok we will hope to see you tomorrow" and I sade "ok" .........Ah hm well latter that day I got a phone call from the school and they asked me some things like HOW LATE DID YOU LEAVE SCHOOL yeaster day I sade the same time I all ways leave (as soon as I can get the hell out of their) and they asked hm .......Hum who I hang out with. And then .....Ah they asked if I was coming in tomorrow I sade "yes" and they sade "ok well so you tomorrow" ..................... Hum ah ooo well the next day I went to school and I went inside and some cop cars came in to the drive way and I was ...... mmm just like "stay cool shaun" and then they came in and one of the teachers yelled "their he is" and the cops handcuffed me and they read .........
