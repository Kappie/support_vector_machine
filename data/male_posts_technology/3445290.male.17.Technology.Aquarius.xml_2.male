It is just such a relief to know that I did grow into a normal sized man which I believe is around 6 feet tall.The reason I was worried about not being a normal size because I noticed that all the other Asian men that I see in my community are quite a lot shorter than the European and black men in my area and especially since my father is 5'11" and my mom is 5'3", and I am half Asian and half Caucasian at 6'0".      The best part about finally hitting my growth spurt is the reaction I get from old friends or even old school bullies who used to always pick on me because of my size and made me so size conscious and nervous since I'm bigger than a few of them now. But I don't think I've finished growing because my shoulders are still kind of narrow, and I am yet to have facial hair but everything is where it should be and appears to be operating healthy so I'm not too worried anymore, just glad to have it off my shoulders.  **even tho I'm getting bigger and really starting to feel like a man I'm still a computer geek/fanatic at heart and I'm sure always will be!**
