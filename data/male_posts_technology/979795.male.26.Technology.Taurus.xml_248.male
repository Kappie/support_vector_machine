But I really have no time to make it too complex, what with exams and ll just less than 2 wks away. Quite disappointing.  Typed up a crap report (no point wasting too much effort for 10%, plus the lecturer really isn't too interested in a lengthy one anyway. He stated the requirement as anything below 2000 words.) Submitted my project half a day earlier and I went back home. On the way, bought fish and chips at a takeaway for lunch. Finished and took a bit of a nap. Woke up and basically replied some emails.  Seems like most everyone I know is either going to be busy or unavailable the next 2 wks. Unless I've got something interesting to post, I'm probably taking a blog break as well. Might throw in some occasional stuff on Aikido.  Almost forgot, I went for Aikido on Wed night. Only 3 students. Me and 2 new beginners. Well, one of them actually did a beginners course at a friend of Pauline Sensei's about a year ago. He was a really polite chap. Well mannered and cordial. I noticed that hee understands the formality aspect of the art and our normal practice as well because of the way he behaves in a dojo. The other guy had no experience but we did some ikkyo waza throughout the session.  I think I made the right decision to go down because it would have been weird if there was only Pauline Sensei and the 2 of them. I'm sure she can still teach as effectively but it would be nice to take some ukemi from her. Hope I wasn't being too stiff that night. The first thing she did when I arrived was ask if the families of my housemates and I were alright. Told her noone had any bad news from home so far and things seemed pretty much well under control in Singapore. Last I heard 2 days ago was that there have been no new cases in Singapore.  I almost forgot to mention the short conversation we had after class. I remembered she mention that Chiba Sensei was visiting her the last 2 weeks so I asked if she had enjoyed his company. Turns out Chiba Sensei didn't come to UK. It seemed that he injured his foot/leg before he went to France for a seminar. He was in so much pain that they had to send him back halfway through the seminar. She said it must've been really bad as she has never known him to have to cancel a trip or seminar before. On the scheduled trip to UK, the teachers in UK were suppose to attend a seminar organised specially for them.  Apparently Chiba Sensei is a Buddhist monk as well. His study of Aikido is not just about taijutsu but weapons work (Batto-ho), ZaZen and Buddhism. Pauline Sensei says he encourages these 4 disciplines for anyone who is serious about doing Aikido in the long run. I put forward a question to her about Buddhism as a religion and having the need to take up this religion even though I don't really want to or believe in it. She says, Chiba Sensei doesn't really expect you to be a convert from your religion but instead to accept the discipline invloved in all 4 elements. She quoted an example saying that when you sit in the lotus position (I think adopted by buddhist and yoga in which you sit cross legged but with your foot lifted up on top instead of under your knees) for 45 mins, you are in such pain or discomfort and that you are so alone that there really isn't anyone else but yourself to tide you through this. The idea is that you have no choice but to look within yourself for strength. Strangely this idea comes to mind when I'm doing my running and swimming. In swimming, I can tide through the feeling of being tired and just keep going for ages and long distances. But when it comes to running, I have a problem staying focused and pulling together to push myself past the no. of rounds or distance that I had decided to run. Sensei says no one would really just sit there and do this for no particular reason. I also never thought of stopping in the middle of what I'm doing to just hold still and look or listen at the world around me. I guess if I look at 2 of my Christian housemates, they always have a daily quiet time of prayer with God. I'm not sure what is the point I'm driving at, but I just see a lot of co-relating situations and similarities in a positive and negative sense in my self and people around me. Sensei made 2 points to me, as an Aikido-ka under Chiba Sensei, she encourages anyone to take up the studies that Chiba Sensei encourages. But on the other hand, at a more personal level, she admits that despite being pretty competent in taijutsu and weapons work, she doesn't go into ZaZen or Buddhism. But that's because she has looked at herself and feels very much comfortable with what she sees in herself currently.  It was an interesting chat lastnight. Food for thought.
