I'm now really excited about it all, but I have to wait till the end of February when she gets all her summer stock in b4 I buy anything. But anyway, I tried on some really pretty dresses and stuff, and it was quite a battle! There was this purple thing that was high at the front, and had criss cross straps, and I got totaly tied up in it, and the shop owner had to rescue me from it, it was quite embarrasing!! But anyway, that's me for you! It was this really nice little shop with posh clothes, no-one in there apart from the shop owner, and she picks out stuff that will suit  you, it's really cool! I thik that I'm going to go for a 2 piece, with a full (er) skirt and a boned-top (strapless) cos I tried this purple one on and it looked really good (even if i say so myself!), but it was too big, so it was being held in at the back! I'm going to go back when she has her new stock, and get one in a smaller size, and they do alterations and stuff there. BUT I am sooooooooo excited about it all, it was just such fun (apart from when I got stuck!!). Anyway, I'll stop rabbiting and go and do something useful!! Talk to ya later guys!
