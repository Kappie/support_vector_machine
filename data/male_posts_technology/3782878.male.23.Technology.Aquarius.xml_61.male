Once again we decided to assualt the Lower Guk in attempts to destroy the Ghoul Arch Magi that we missed the night prior. So once again many of the familiar group assembled. Kretais was there, Ellektra was there, Katheena was there, Akcron was there, I was there, and two new additions to our team assembled Crucial, and Arymist a wizard who assisted me in obtaining a piece of the epic weapon SoulFire! we assembled near the Delly Tree in Plane of Knowledge, our Ally Kretais would not be able to stay with us for this battle, so he enchanted us with his mystical combat boosts and camped for the night. The rest of us, 3 paladins, a wizard, a enchanter and a cleric made way to the Innothule swamp as we had done the night prior.  Luckily a majority of us were accustomed to the location, and we sped quickly down into Lower Guk. Arriving in lower guk we fought our way, with me leading the way into the lowest level. Knowing of the traps in the floors helped us today, though the wizard did find himself a trapdoor, so I took it down with him just in case he was going to be attacked by that vile gnome that I know hangs around inside that trap. Luckily, no evil gnomes hiding in the basement, and we began our way upstairs.   I led the team over to the Ghoul Arch Magi which turns out a couple of people were already laying siege to, but they said they were doing it for sport, and we were doing it for a piece of a fabulous epic item for an Enchanter. The other group were interesting fellows, they said they were just trying to spend time with the undead frogloks, and they mentioned that these frogloks were a bunch of rascists attacking them for hanging around. I mentioned to them that perhaps if these frogloks were not undead, that they would receive a different response, and we all had a good chuckle.  We spent a lot of time inside the Magi room, and we got a little bored, so they sent me out looking for more action. I managed to bait quite a few enemies outside the Magi room, using a secret passage to bring the undead into our ambush. We killed many of them before the Magi showed up, and upon assualting him, he did not have the robe upon him that we were looking for.  Apparently we killed the wrong Magi, so we waited for the next Magi to arrive, while doing this, I charged forth, and found the Lord room, the same place I died the day prior. I asked the group if we wanted to challenge the Lord room. they agreed, and thus I baited the wizards and knights of the lord's antechamber into our Magi room, where we spent a great deal of time killing these undead off. We all had a good time, and were complimenting each other on our tactics, as another Magi appeared.   We took some time in killing him off, but once again, no Robe. Wrong Magi again, and eventually our group decided it was time to leave for the evening, another night in, and another night without this robe. Arymist gathered us around, and opened a portal back to the plane of knowledge. we teleported out, and camped for the evening.  The Next day, we didn't go back to Guk, instead we went to Karnor's Castle. More on that in the next entry.  If we shall meet may it be as brothers, and not as enemies, Ziggur Rathebringer
