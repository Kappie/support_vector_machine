I spell things wrong on purpose, and if you have a problem, thats absolutely redickulous so shut the fuck up or post a comment. biotch. ' moment of life: kracky "does anyone want this last chicken nugget ?" smashly "YYYESSS!!!!" - i understand that this quote is quite unfunny, a "miss" if you will, however if you could have just heard it for yourself it was funny.  down to business. bottle de 1800 repaso for tonight - we'll take shots, roll a blunt, go out to shmeckies, take more shots, come back here, take more shots, go out again, take more shots, then take more shots, then smoke a blunt, thhen go home home and finish the bottle of tequila and smoke the last blunt. gnight...  if y'all are intersted the blunt schedule for tonight is as follows: you can catch the 10:30, the 12, the 12 35, the 12 58, the 1 26 and the 1 56,  I'm pretty sure it keeps running past that, but, you know where luke will be. holla at ya bed. peace. (bow to me)  ps. nuns really do get it in the butt, if you don't beleive me, i dare you to go to the nunnnery next to calder-1's and ask them. then youll see who is smart and who isn't!!
