  The "instant-on" is pretty cool. No more waiting for it to buffer up. That is critical for an impatient person like myself. I  have a broadband connection so it seems to work pretty good, although I have only played with it briefly. Check out the  urlLink demos here , and I highly recommended checking out the  urlLink Halo 2 preview .
