Here we go.  Ann was supposed to come into town on Wednesday night (June 25th), but due to tornadic weather in Minnesota she had to spend the night in the Twin Cities.  She was able to make it in on Thursday morning and we had a blast the rest of the weekend.  Thursday we met up with K$ and went shopping.  I had to get a new dress shirt for Devon and Jeff's wedding.  That evening we met up with Marissa and went to a Korean restaurant in Northern Kentucky.  We sat at a two-foot table.  Friday Ann had an interview downtown while I was at work.  When I got back we attended the Kinne wedding rehearsal and rehearsal dinner.  The dinner was at a winery north of Cincinnati.  The best man of the wedding was Mike Matera.  It was good to see Mike.  He has been in Italy the last year and is coming back to attend grad school in Milwaukee.  The dinner was awesome.  We did some wine tasting and we grilled our own dinner on this really big grill.  I say we, but Jeff's grandfather took to Ann and I and did the grilling for us.  Jeff and his brothers got a kick out of that.    Saturday was the wedding.  Got to see a lot of out-of-towners including Gustavo, Beth Keene and Justin.  The reception was great.  There was a lot of dancing and an open bar.  Or was it the other way around.  After the party we went to the Greek Festival.  There were a lot of friends there and Ann got to see a lot of people she was hoping to see.  Sunday the mavericks had a double header.  After kicking another team off the field and coming up a player short we lost two games.  Had the field not been 275 all around I am sure it would have been a different game.  Ann was a trooper staying for both games.  We were both fried from all the sun.  After the game we ate at Amol India and saw are favorite waiter.  he was worried because we had not come in for a long time.  Ann said she had been in Montana and I had no excuse.  The Saag was good, but I got it a little too spicy.    Monday Ann headed back to Montana.  It was great to see her and I can't wait to fly out and drive across the country with her.  The rest of the week was busy at work.  It was busy for a regular week, but even busier because Canada was off for a day and it was short week in the US.  These are usually things that make a week less busy.  I have not done a lot this weekend.  My family is floating in the Caribbean and Tom has spent most of his time hanging with his family.  I did cut the grass today including the grass down in the valley behind the house.  Not too much has gone on.  I have tried to stay out of the sun for the most part.    I am going to try to update my blog more often.  Today while looking at the route we are going to take from Montana I looked for free Wi-Fi hotspots, but there were not too many.  I am sure we will run across a few.
