Thats a scary thought. Vermeil was typically upbeat about and mentioned that the rookies were getting more reps than normal, so maybe one of them will exhibit some serious talent and challenge the starters to get healthier faster and stay that way...  There is also a new  urlLink article  on the Chief's site...enjoy.
