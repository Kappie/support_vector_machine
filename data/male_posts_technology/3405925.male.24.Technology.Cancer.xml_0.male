I first encountered Gretchen Lieberum in the year 1999 or 2000, not sure; on  urlLink mp3.com  and was thrilled when I heard the cover of The bed's too big without you, originally released by The Police. It was nothing like the original, it was pleasant, yet touching; sad, yet made me smile, it was simply amazing. I have always been a fan of ladies singing jazz, acid jazz if possible, and this one lady gave me heaven for 5 minutes and 2 seconds.  I downloaded all of her songs on mp3.com; burned it to a disc (yes I am cheap :)) and that disc didnt leave my discman for at least three or four months, the album was named three a.m. which is the name of one of the songs on the album. The arrangements on the album are really naive, drums, bass, piano, sometimes the trumpet, rhodes piano but the flagship is the vocals, man she is good. The strongest songs in the album are The Bed's too big without you, green apple, jumped the gun and three a.m.; its a must have and I do recommend it strongly. You can check her gigs and her new album (which I havent listened to yet) from her  urlLink homepage
