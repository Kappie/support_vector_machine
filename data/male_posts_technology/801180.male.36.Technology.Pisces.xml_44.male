They keep blaming the building inspector, but I just think that they are busy on other jobs.  Not that it is a real problem, but we do want to keep a little momentum up.  To that end we had a guy round from Builder Center yesterday to help with the materials planning for the rest of the build.  I opened up an account with Build Store which should mean that all our materials are cheaper.  The Build Store account brings with it accounts for Jewsons and Builder Center, and allegedly with good discount rates attached.  So it looks like we will be plugging on with the build shortly - that is if the ground workers pull their fingers out........
