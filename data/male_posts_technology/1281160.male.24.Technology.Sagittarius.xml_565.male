In that workshop they mentioned "Mind reads what it wants", and they explained that with few examples. The following one is somewhat similar to that.   Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at an Elingsh uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is  taht frist and lsat ltteer is at the rghit pclae. The rset can be a toatl mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae we do not raed ervey lteter by it slef but the wrod as a wlohe.  to Xavier, xavy there is no point in asking whether to add someone from our msitmmb group to blogger or not. bcos u clearly mentioned in ur mails to msitmmb as, "If you want to become a member, the only requisite is 'active' participation." "The blogger group is not a form of elite group where only a few are welcome. If the bloggers have made the other msitmmb members feel unwelcome, I apologize." so after said all this, u cant avoid someone based on existing bloggers view.
