It was fun but when I sat at the corner of the large manse I cud the see my collegues dancing and having fun just to make the client happy. We the sofware coolies do anything just to ingrain our client's heart.The bottom line is we are coolies with a royal tag.Anyway we can also claim that we are the leaders in IT, I'm not interested in arguing who is what n all? Just realized that Iam workin as a Coolie 50$ per day at onsite. In tamizh they say thina coolie. Just imagine how bad will the fate be if there is no Cut and Paste :-))  I will surely be back with my strong views about Sofware Coolies in India... till then... .. Gotta weeknd plan .. Study for saturday and have fun on sunday....
