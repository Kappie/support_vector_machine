Microsoft had a complete line of Wi-Fi products including base stations, laptop cards, and USB and PCI add-ons for desktop machines.   i am myself an owner of a base station! what happens if i need support? well, the 2 year support stays with the product.. the product will be available for some more time in the stores..   someone told me that it is illegal to possess a 802.11g wireless device in India.. :(  does this reflect a broader range of changes wherein MS exits most of the businesses that are not core to its functioning.. like hardware.. does this mean no more MS mouse or keyboard? or is there a partnership in sight?  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.
