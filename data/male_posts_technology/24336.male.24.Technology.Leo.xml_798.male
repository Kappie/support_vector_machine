I could probably look it up, but I really don't have the patience right now.  For a couple months after that, they would play hour-long themed blocks of music:  80s punk, new wave, grunge, etc.  Finally, they brought in Marconi and Tiny for the morning program.  About a month after that, The End changed formats and  dropped  them.  Sucks!  

At the time, they were on two radio stations, The End and a station in "Porkland" (their infantile name for Portland).  Well, looks like they got  urlLink booted from Portland  as well for joking about the Berg beheading.  D'oh!
