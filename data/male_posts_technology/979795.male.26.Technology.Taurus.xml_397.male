Starts off just before the Korean war, the simple but blissful life they were enjoying then. When war soon broke out, both brothers were forcibly drafted into service and sent out to the front lines. Younger brother was a the weaker one. Student before the war and on his way to enter University. Elder brother was a shoe polisher who gave up school to support his brother, their mother and a fiance (with her 3 younger siblings). Mother and fiance spent the day tending their own noodle store.  At the front lines, you'd see how the elder brother tried protecting his brother. In their first skirmish with the communists, the younger brother felt really lost and almost suffered a heart attack. The elder brother would think of ways and means of getting his brother out of the army. His only aim was to watch his brother survive the whole war and get him out unscathed. The commanding officer somehow gave the elder brother an idea that one way was to distinguish himself above and beyond the call of duty so as to get the Medal of Honor. With this, he could put in a request to get his brother transferred. This led to his brother volunteering for almost every risky mission that came along the way of the platoon.  Soon, the unit found themselves cut off from the rest of the army. To delay the enemy, a group was ordered to plant mines. The elder brother volunteered for this. On completion, they were ambushed. Here, you'd notice that the elder brother was brave and exceptional in soldiering. He managed to pull a wounded comrade to safety. But he would risk everything and more in his quest for the Medal. When ordered to pull back to escort the wounded back to camp, he insisted on staying on to fight the remnants of the enemy ambush party and finish them off. They were that close to losing the wounded soldier as he was losing a lot of blood. The SGT told him never to disobey his orders again during a battle.  Days passed and the cut-off unit were low on food, water and medical supplies. The sight of maggots gnawing away at the wounds of a wounded soldier was really disgusting. Morale was low. And in despair, one of the wounded got his hands on a weapon, shot the wounded soldiers in the tent before blowing his own head off. The elder brother suggested that they go on an all out attack. A logical idea as everyone had nothing to lose anyway. That very night, they striked back. The elder brother would put himself at risk time and time again in the same battle. The most exceptional was him taking out the command bunker and killing the enemy commander himself. The younger brother would also take his first life on that very night. This was the night of nights as it saw a transformation in the both of them. The younger brother would learn that sympathy to the enemy during a battle could mean the end of himself. The elder brother would let his heroic exploits get to his own head. He was branded a hero and the army was quick to use him for their own propoganda. They would feed him 'lines' to read out to the press. No doubt all these would fall under psychological warfare but I think there's nothing worse than playing with a person's mind. The US soon joined in the war to assist them. Elder brother was quick to get himself promoted to SGT and as leader, he would often put his fellow comrades at risk to accomplish the mission, even when the mission had been designated under somebody else. There was a difference between taking the initiative and going all out unecessarily. Very soon, in an attempt to capture an enemy captain alive, he indirectly caused the death of a platoon mate. Younger brother, having learnt the trade of soldiering, blamed his brother for this. It was quite sad to see a rift come between the two of them.  Even more heart wrenching was the scene where the communist, while retreating through civilian villages, would kill everyone in the village , women, children and old folks. They even hung bodies out on trees and booby trapped some of these bodies. These traps kill and wounded many soldiers. But the scene of slaughtered civilians created a lot of pain and hate within many soldiers. They would kill the enemy without remorse and slaughter the enemies they captured. It was scary to see how they changed and each one of them holding on to so much hate. Only the younger brother seemed to still retain a bit if humanity. One day they managed to capture some enemy soldiers, one of them being a good friend of the two brothers. He had been forced by the communists to join their army. The elder brother, overcomed by so much hate ordered that all captured enemies be shot as these soldiers would be 'excess baggage' for them. Only the younger brother protected the PoWs. I know that war changes many things, I've heard of gentlemen's war, guerilla warfare and such. I have no idea how one should balance both. To have a war without honour, you'd see the same atrocities that were televised regarding how US MPs treated captured prisoners in the Gulf. To fight a war with too much honour opens you to guerilla and unconventional tactics.  Anyway, China decided to join in the foray and the communists started fighting back and gaining lost ground. The US were quick to lose ground and soon the winning side started to retreat. During a scuffle, the PoWs managed to overcome their captors and held a soldier hostage. The elder brother started firing on the PoWs and even shot his friend. Amidst the retreat, the elder brother was finally awarded the Medal of Honour. But he had 'lost' his younger brother for it. The latter hated everything the Medal represented, he felt that he didn't know his elder brother anymore. While passing through their hometown one day, the younger brother decided to look for his family as he heard they were still in the area. He found his brother's fiance. Unfortunately, she was soon arrested by the Anti Communist Army, a group which weeded out communist in the community and executed these traitors. The younger brother found himself arrested as well. I found this hard to swallow. The abuse of power but this party was frightening. They were able to just pull people off the streets and execute them without trial. They based their accusationa and charges on papers they retrieved from the communist parties. These papers were namelists of civilians who had attended communist talks and rallies. However, to attract civilians, the communists used to exchange food to attract people to attend. Quite possibly most of them only went for the food and they didn't really understood the difference between democracy and communism. I just felt so helpless at the level of misunderstanding I was seeing. All these could be cleared up (though not without time and a great deal of effort), but instead cicilians were executed based only on  suspicions  of being Marxists!  The elder brother, recently promoted to Staff SGT was quick to arrive. He tried to protect his fiance and get his younger brother out. In the ensuing struggle, he shot several members of the Anti Communist Army. The fiance was shot and killed by someone and the brothers arrested again. While the elder brother was interogated by a superior officer, the communists arrived. In all the confusion, the elder brother managed to get free and held the officer at gun-point, ordering the latter to free his younger brother. The officer instead ordered that the makeshift prison be set on fire. The elder brother tried to rescue his younger brother but did not manage to do so and somehow got injured as well. When he came to, he found a pen he had bought and given to his younger brother before the war. Thinking that his brother had died, he went into a frenzy and killed the officer who ordered the torching of the prison. At that time, the area was controlled by the communists already. It seemed that seeing his fiance killed and thinking that his brother had died in the hands of his own army was too much to bear and that drove him over to the communist's side.  As it turned out, the younger brother did not die in the flames. He was shot and rescued by a fellow comrade and was recovering in a military hospital. By the time he recovered, both Nth and Sth Korea were in a stalemate along the 38th parallel. News of his brother's defection to the communists soon reached him. His army decided to use the younger brother to try and get the elder brother back to their side and for their own propogandas (again). Somehow the younger brother escaped and ran over to the enemy lines, he was captured. During the confusion of a battle, both brothers finally met. The younger brother could hardly recognise his own brother who was in a murderous rage and killed like a wild uncontrolled beast. The elder brother was so blinded with hate and rage that he even tried to kill his brother. It was a long fight and struggle before he snapped out of his berserker rage and both brothers were reunited. By then the elder brother was wounded and could not move easily. The communists turned the battle around and began fighting back. As they came nearer, the elder brother told the younger brother "Go back, I will surrender and return to you after the war is over." After much persuasion the younger brother returned back to his side. However, seeing that the communists were gaining ground on his brother, the elder brother decided to try and buy him some time. He grabbed the nearest machine gun and started shooting at the communists. Though he killed many, he was soon overwhelmed and died that very day.  I have a lot of thoughts and feelings about the whole show. I was well impressed with the affections the brothers had for each other, despite their disagreements and squabbles. I can only imagine a small part of the horrers of war. Deaths to civilians, slaughter and butchering of innocent people. The lawlessness we can only imagine from books, newspapers of wars fought in countries far from Singapore. It also drew an immediate interest of the Korean conflict. I had done a fair bit of reading on World War II in the European Theater and only a small no of the Vietnam War. The Korean War is something I know so little about. The way the Army would create 'lies' in order to boost morale for their side is something I found really hard to swallow. I can understand the reason why, but I can't agree with it. I may find myself singing a different tune if I was ina  real war, who knows? I felt sad that one of the brothers died, but I was glad that they did manage to meet one last time despite everything that happened.  Of comraderie; the following comes to my mind:    "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;     For he to-day that sheds his blood with me     Shall be my brother."   -- Shakespeare, Henry V, Act IV, Scene 3  Of personal heroism:    "In thinking back of the days of Easy Company, I'm treasuring my remark to a grandson who asked, 'Grandpa, were you a hero in the war?'     "'No', I replied, 'but I served in a company of heroes."   -- Mike Ranney, Easy Company Sergeant, from the book Band of Brothers by Stephen E. Ambrose  And of war:    "It is good that war is so horrible,     Lest we get too fond of it."   -- quote from somewhere/someone I can't quite remember.
