So shall it be! Amen."  This one's for all you who are having a bad day today. This is for all of you who woke up on the wrong side of the bed. This is for all of you who snapped at your mom or dad and feel really bad. This is for you who feel like you're always alone. This is for you who don't have a car so you have to take the bus or walk every morning. This is for you who came in late to work and had every one scream at you. This is for you who hate high school and homework. This is for you who are far away from home missing your family. This is for you who didn't make the honor roll. This is for you who don't feel listened to. This is for you who don't feel like you're taken seriously. This is for you who are struggling with your time with God. This is for you who no matter what, all you want to do is be like Jesus. Whenever stuff just doesn't go the way you would've liked, just remember, you're going to see Jesus face to face soon! Start praising Him and get out of that funk! "For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal," 2 Corinthians 4:17-18. So shall it be! I can hardly wait!
