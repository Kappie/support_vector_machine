When ambushed in the first Gulf War, Raymond Shaw (played by  urlLink Liev Schreiber ) saved his fellow soldiers including his commanding officer, Ben Marco ( urlLink Denzel Washington ). For his bravery he receives the Congressional Medal of Honor.  After the war, Raymond, pushed by his string-toting mother ( urlLink Meryl Streep ), eventually becomes the vice-presidential nominee. Meanwhile Ben has nightmares. He dreams of them being brainwashed and that the story of Raymond's heroism was made up - it never happened. And so he starts to investigate. Who is responsible? And does Raymond have the same dreams?  I found myself to be unable to see this movie without constantly comparing it to the  urlLink 1962 version  (starring  urlLink Frank Sinatra  and  urlLink Angela Lansbury ). Unfortunately it is lesser in every respect. That is not to say it is a wholly bad movie, but if you had to choose I'd recommend the original.  To list some of the things I liked better in the original: The characters were more fleshed out. The original contained scenes that took place before the war when the characters where younger. This meant that the relationship between Raymond and Jocelyn got ample screen time. Now it has been relegated to a few lines. The same goes for the relationship between Ramond and his mother. However, some of that is made up for by scenes taking place in the present day. Something else I found to be presented in less detail is the time spent by Raymond and Ben in captivity being brainwashed. Yet another thing I missed was the information that no one in the unit really liked Raymond Shaw, yet when any of the survivors where asked about him later they still instinctively said "Raymond Shaw is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I've ever known in my life".  I find it interesting that both movies are of similar length considering I found so much "missing". Obviously they spent much of time on things I didn't find worthwhile. -->
