Early morning i went to UQ to check out what the ah beng and ah nian who have studies have been talking about and lo and behold it is as described . Beautiful  and nice view with sceneries and carefully structured campus.  Beautiful people and nice view from the top.. (meaning groups of people )  There are tons of people sitting on the grass of the campus, basking in the sun and enjoying the fellowship of many people and indeed there are varities of people .  Out in the field, is OPen market, where huge amount of students pitched the tents up and market their clubs, societies and guild of the university ranging from political, religious, adventure and even sports. I tried a sumo wrestling which involves wearing a heavy suit u know like the one showed in the charlie angels and wow ....lot s of  fun.  Met also Fats and her gang....called her fats is because she want to be called that way...her name is Fayette.so in short everyone in YF called her Fats, there is also sam, michael, alvin, williard...this guys are YF members who are studying in UQ except Fats have graduated and is now working in UQ part time as well as Michael who is studying Arts in Griffith Uni.  While i was sitting under the tree to meditate and enjoy the view, two person by the name of Steven and ummm...forgot the name of the other guy.(he looks like Malay except that he is from Brunei ). We introduced ourselves and later we talk on the things. I knew that each time time people come to talk to you in University is to get you into the club and they are from Campus Christian Movement CCM one of the many christian movement ...actually it is 1/3 christian movement in UQ,  What differientiates it is  Evangelical Students is a CF under the supervision of FES and OCF (Overseas CHristian Fellowship) is well Christian fellowship .  CCM is one christian fellowship which is linked to my old church which is Hope OF God Brisbane,  I come from that church in KL and when i told them, they were shocked and they didn't expect talking to a innocent cool guy under the tree , to be coming from the same church movement. But now i told them i am attending SIB, the boy from Brunei had a sparkle in their eyes and nodding knowlingly of SIB>  We had a great time and man i thank God for the great time i have and thinkking of going back to explore the rest of UQ. I mean it is bigger than UKM and UPM combined..and i have to get a bus to get around.  Come to think of it, it is almost 1 months i have been in Aussie and i have gone used to it the life which is kinda laidback and much nicer with the quality of life improving day by day. When i look back to malaysia , i prayed that we will reached that stage and i also prayed for the politics of the country .  I mean it is high time....that we forget our differences between our skin tones and the special rights and start to strive hard for the countries interest .  Opps doesn't sounds like me...  Another thing worth mentioning is that all families i have visitted in Aussie , is that God became the center of their family lives and these families have become strong because of the presence of the Lord. Their lives are made stronger everyday by God and testimonies that flowed out are normal . They really encouraged to strive forward for and with the Lord and prayed for my parents as well. This family here, serve the Lord as a family , though not in the same church, they still serve the Lord fervently and i believe God have a major purpose for this family.  This family here are also bonded by funnily sports, especially footie which is american football with OZ rules. Nice beats soccer anytime..man..go broncos.  Buttered smooth bread always taste so much better with kaya....kaya... ahhhh.....cannot tahan the temptations already gotta come back ......ahhhh.....Not enjoying myself here.  It is nice to know that most of the time i dreamt of time basking in the sun and not feel cold , i woke up and can really do that and  i am continue to enjoy it no matter what wai nyan says...he miss me a lot..u see.
