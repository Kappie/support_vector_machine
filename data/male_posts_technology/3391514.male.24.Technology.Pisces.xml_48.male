The last few days have been uneventful.  My sight continues to improve, although the drops and stickiness of the eye on mornings is irritating.  I finally saw some of my associates, although few of them actually bothered to find out how I was, which was most disappointing.  Also disappointing is the response to my PBeM, which has not been great.  I got to play some more  Fallout 2  today, which was nice.  I also got  UFO  working again... I think the main executable must've been corrupted.  Work continues, "up here" ( points to head ) on my forthcoming  Mage  campaign, and the other games haven't been running of late.  I've also been watching some season 2  Transformers , and for the most part, its awful.  Makes me wonder why I bought the boxed sets at all...
