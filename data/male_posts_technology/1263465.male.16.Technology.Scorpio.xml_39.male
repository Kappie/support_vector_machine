Nothing fancy, but it's cool.    Got to talk with  urlLink Mike Minor  today.  Very great guy, super cool.  It was good to get back in touch with him.  Only $1000 away from the mac.  I should get some freelance to get there faster.  Also, new friends are listed at right.  Thanks for your support guys :)  peace out.
