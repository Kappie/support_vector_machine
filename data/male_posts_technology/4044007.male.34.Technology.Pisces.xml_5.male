We all know Bush and crew lied about the circumstances getting us into the war. This just sheds some light on what exactly was lied about and how the language and intelligence changed as the war progressed. It goes though why Iraq was not and immanent threat to the United States. Saddam was smart enough to destroy his weapons of mass destruction as he wanted to keep his regime in place and him at the head of it. Why would he do anything so stupid as keeping the weapons around to jeopardize that? As time went on the language changed from 'they have weapons of mass destruction' to 'we know they had developed programs for weapons of mass destruction'. The video takes you through their change in language as the war progresses and there are no weapons found. Now here's the other thing that gets my blood boiling. We impeached Clinton for lying about sexual acts while he was in office, not to mention spent a ton of tax payer dollars on it because Star had a hard-on for him. Bush lied to congress and us to get into a war with Iraq that wasn't necessary. Which here seems to be a more sensible thing to impeach for. Lying about sexual acts that had no repercussion or involved anyone getting killed, or getting us into an unnecessary war causing the death of our troops, damaging the already fragile view of America, and making us look like the terrorist. Now lets look at the definition of terrorism, well...at least one version of it. Terrorism is defined by the FBI as: "Terrorism is the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives." Now lets look at this. We unlawfully used force against Iraq and it's civilian population as we lied about the reason to go to war and without proof of Saddam's involvement with Al Qaida and other terrorist organizations. As a matter of fact Osama and Saddam hated each other. Saddam didn't like giving up his control for anything. Saddam viewed Osama as the grates threat to his regime. I'm not saying Saddam wasn't an evil man, but just want to put things in perspective. We did use it to coerce the civilian population, to overthrow Saddam, even though we're still fighting some of the civilian population. We did it to further our political and social objectives, i.e. there is a lot of oil and money for US contractors to be made there. If you think no one is getting kick-backs from it you're nuts.
