This set of six-month goals was, in the words of my manager's manager, very aggressive.  After my 1:1 with Chandana today, I see that we are almost finished with hitting almost every goal and target on the list!  There are one or two that we have chosen to defer and a half dozen successes in areas we didn't anticipate.  Those deferred are acceptable as priorities change and things that seem feasible up front can turn out to require much greater resources or investment than their value warrants.  The areas where we've had unexpected success are just icing on the cake.  All-in-all, FY04, spanning from July to June, is shaping up to have been one with enormous value and success for our endeavors in these area, and I'm very pleased.  It is my hope that my management chain will both recognize those successes and perhaps even reward me richly for my efforts.  As the only cautious part of this posting, I am well aware that success and recognition of success are all too often disconnected.  But the optimist in me swears that I'll be seeing much favor from above come September.
