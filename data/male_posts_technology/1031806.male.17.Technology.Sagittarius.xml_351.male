(LOL) Adri was the only other person I know going to Beaverton to take it too and we somehow got into the same room. That was cool. I gave her a ride home and am looking forward to her party later tonight.  On Thursday our entire school up and went to see a play at Heritage called Happens Every Summer at 11:something. I love my school, so funny - mandatory play patronization. The play was pretty lacking in content, bad script choice, though the talent was wonderful. By the end of it I wanted to run up and punch the Georgian hoe (though the fact she was, after all, just an actress taking the form of the character held me back - LOL).   Thursday also, my mom had to take our orange cat Leo into be put down. Sux, but he's been in a ton of pain and stuff from his leg all his life so I guess it's a good thing. We got another cute cute black kitten a couple hours ago and my sister's occupying herself with that one now.  Speaking of pets, Gwen has to take Rascal, her dog, to the vet today at 2:30 to put her down too. Sux... That's gonna be a ton harder on her than my sister's cat has been on her since Gwen's had her dog for something like 12 years. Yeah, I'll see how she's doing at the party tonight I guess.   ... Heh, if I can go that is... My mom's being weird about homework again - might not let me go tonight.
