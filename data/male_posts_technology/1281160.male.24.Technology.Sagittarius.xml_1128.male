Every weekend, I find myself spending the weekend out of town. I had been to  urlLink Madurai ,  urlLink Bangalore ,  urlLink Coimbatore , and coming weekend, Bangalore again and then to Coimbatore next weekend. I wonder when I can get to visit the sights and sounds of Chennai other than commuting to work.  Kicha, expecting a treat from you for getting a new mobile and Rini, expecting your birthday treat. My plans for a mobile are posted  urlLink here . Leave your suggestions/comments for my mobile there.
