Chris Evans is leaving  as a music teacher and going to a high school in Orleans to teach another music program. Chris had been a teacher there for 7 years and it was his way of saying goodbye to his students. The performance was a surprise to the students. When we went on, the kids were screaming so loud it was Beatles-like. We only played a coulpe of songs, but it was quite a rush. It was weird to talk to the kids afterwards and sign autographs.
