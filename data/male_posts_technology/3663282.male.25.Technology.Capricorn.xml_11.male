I chose to ignore the voice, since I was too deep in slumber, and anyway I couldn't find my way back to the land of the living. So I kept on sleeping. Only to be called again. This time is was more persistent. I tried to wake up but to no avail. I struggled against the dark cold place I was in. Finally, I managed to be the victor. And as I shaded my eyes against the sun light, I heard my mother's voice saying, "It's almost 8 o'clock, aren't you going to the office?". What!? 8 o'clock?! I start work at 8 o'clock!!!   That was how I started my day on Saturday. But it went well enough, since I managed to get to the office by 8.20am. Amazing, huh! And none of the bosses were asking for me. Hehehe. The big boss did a short presentation on CVS. Don't even ask. Anyway, after that, went for the department's bowling tournament. It was a fun activity for us to get to know one another better. After that, went to TTDI for a wedding. I was the  pengapit . I wonder what they call  pengapit  in english. Hmmm....  Well, anyway. Yup! Me!  Pengapit ! Hahahah!!! But I was. Seriously! Anyway, it was the second time for me. And my brother was the MC. It was the umpteenth time for him. And he's getting better at it.   Now about me being the  pengapit , we started the procession from outside the hall. There were 10 of us. The married couple, both the  pengapit s, the two flower girls, and the bride's 3 brothers and a cousin. So there we were walking towards the hall, with the  kompang  group right behind us. Right before we started moving, one of the flower girls asked me, "What are we suppose to be doing now? I didn't go for the rehearsal!" Well, neither did I! So, there we were, moving slowly towards the hall, not knowing what to do next. Hehehe. But it turned out ok, in the end. The flower girls were safely at their respective places, which was in front of us  pengapit s, and we were doing pretty ok, if anyone was paying any attention to us, that is.  I thought I would be nervous, but I wasn't. Because I knew people were there to see the bride and groom, and not the  pengapit s, although, who can resist hairy face. Heheheh. Just kidding. Anyway, after the ceremony, we stayed back to chat with the relatives. Me, I was chatting with my brother and his wife for a while, then I went on to chat with my brother's sister-in-laws's friend. After that, I took my parents for supper at NZ, the place I hang out with my friends. We had  char kuey teow ,  satay ,  ais kacang , and  carrot juice . Slept around 1 o'clock.   On Sunday, woke up early to wake my beloved up, since it was her first day at the new school. Then continued sleeping, only to be woken up by a phonecall from my beloved around 9 am. Then continued sleeping till 12 in the afternoon. Woke up, had lunch in Kl with my parents, then went straight to KLCC with my best buddy. Believe it or not, everytime we go out to KLCC, it's for my buddy to get phone numbers from girls. And he has managed to get a couple of them. But on that fateful Sunday, it was not meant to be, since he picked a fiesty young lass. Hehehe. He told me later, he was taken aback by her response, because she wasn't responding to his charms. And in the end, the girl got his number, but he didn't get hers.  By the way, I saw Shrek 2 the other day. And it was hilarious. I mean, it's actually better then the first one. And I love the first Shrek! It's about how Shrek adapts to Fiona's parents and vice versa. Throw in another cute talking animal, a couple of bad guys, a funny dialogue, and you get a fantastic movie. I love Puss in Boots. He's so cute when he does his googly eyes routine. And donkey, he's still the annoying ass from the first movie. Well, if you haven't seen it, then go watch it!
