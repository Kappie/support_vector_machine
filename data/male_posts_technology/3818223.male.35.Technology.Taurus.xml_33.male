Now I hear the musical number from  urlLink John Carpenter 's  urlLink Escape From New York . It's from the scene where Snake enters a dilapidated theatre and finds a bunch of convicts (all men) in drag singing an Ethel Mermon song (I think) in off-key baritone voices. It's an improvement.  This morning I woke up and began the day as always - wishing I didn't have to get up, then getting up and packing my lunch pail. For some reason I noticed I had loaded the refrigerator with cans of Dr. Pepper the night before instead of my usual mix. I wondered why I did that, then I woke up. I realized I had been dreaming about starting the day, so then I actually did start the day. When I got to the refrigerator I saw that I had actually put several cans ofPepsi inside to cool. Then I woke up. The next time around I found that I had loaded the refrigerator with a mixture, although they were all Coke products. Then I woke up. What's really bizarre about all this is that my favorite is  urlLink Mountain Dew .   urlLink Stephen King  was right when he said "Hell is repetition."
