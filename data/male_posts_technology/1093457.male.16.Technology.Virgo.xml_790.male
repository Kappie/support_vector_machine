I have read everyones blog since my last but I won't comment on them all as I can't remember what they all said!!  So far I am finding Sixth Form mang! There are only one or two aspects I am not liking but thats mainly teachers I'm not keen on. I love all the new folk we have in our ickle group. Jenni, JAMES....lol. Hush. I am looking forward to the geology trip we are organising for half term. We get 2 days off school which means we also get to miss the sponsered walk!!! Yea!!!  September 11th. R.I.P.
