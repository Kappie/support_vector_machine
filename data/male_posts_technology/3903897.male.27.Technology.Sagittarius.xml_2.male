I figured it was likely Jenifer -- possibly Melissa or Leslie... maybe even Stephanie or Nancy... nope. A familiar voice on the other end at first sounded a bit like Jenifer -- because that was what I was expecting, but I knew it wasn't Jen.    So, I asked who it was. It was Candi. She finally decided to call me out of the blue. It's been nearly a month since we last spoke -- and longer than that since the last time she called here. It wasn't an unpleasant call. It was nice to know that she still thinks of me and misses me some, I guess.     She tells me she got her A in English, so she keeps her scholarship. She got her permit and has been driving some, though she was pulled and given a warning b/c her tail light was out. I hear Ernest and other friends have been dropping by at night to keep her company, and she's been visiting her church every weekend and is now part of the choir along with her sister.    She told me that I could call her sometime and invite her out if I'd like. I told her that she could call me if she wanted, but I doubt I'd call her... though I might enjoy spending time w/her. I'm a bit torn. I have mixed feelings about hearing from her and spending time with her. It's more fear of emotionally spinning out of control than anything. I think a part of me is still in disbelief that things are over between us and will motivate me to try to date her again. If all we'll ever be is friends, then I'm not sure I can handle that b/c I'm much more emotionally invested than that.    I guess time will tell. In any case, I'm not going to make the first move or invest a lot in trying to build a friendship with her after all that's happened between us. Less investment = less risk, so I'll just go with the flow. If being friends is important to her, she'll make the effort and I'll do my best to meet her half-way. I think that's the best strategy. It doesn't burn any bridges and allows some room to grow together or apart naturally.    In other news, I've had several professors volunteer to be references for me and I sent three of them forms to fill out for a job I'm applying for. :-) I hope I get it.     Once I get a job, then I can work on all the other things in this so-called life ;-)        There is no "I" in TEAM, but there is ME !!!   :->
