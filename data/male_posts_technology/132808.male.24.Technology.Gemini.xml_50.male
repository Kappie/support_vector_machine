And we're talking about a history that includes MacGyver, where hair and wine equal a powerful magnifying glass, and Matlock, where old Andy Griffith equals a competent lawyer.  Look, it's one thing to know a bizarre reference to "Don Quixote de la Mancha", but it's a completely different thing to be able to pull it out smack dab in the middle of a conversation while you're fucking painting.  Nobody quotes Shakespeare in the middle of a conversation, and he was the greatest writer in all of recorded history.  AND WHO CRIES THIS MUCH?!?!  I swear, I watched that episode for like 15 minutes and four different people cried, one of them twice.  It doesn't make any sense.  I was just pissed off by the end of it.  I was like, "Agghh!!  This is so friggin fake!!"  And remember, I'm the guy who's clamouring to buy Saved by the Bell seasons 3 and 4 on DVD.  Zack can stop time, and I have no problems with that, but this much crying, and the retardedly complex things that come out of the mouths of every character (so long as they're not crying at the time), it makes me want to pull my hair out.  Or at least go to Capeside and whip some Van Der Ass.  No show leaves me more pissed off by the end of it than Dawson's Creek.  It makes me wonder why I skipped class during first year just to watch it in the Science Lounge.  Then again, I skipped class because Danny spilled 7-Up on his shirt, so I guess it makes sense.  I also bought three more DVDs, bringing my total to 99.  What should be magic 100?  I want it to be something special, something sweet, not just any shitty movie.  Maybe I'll buy one of the Special Edition Lord of the Rings.  Bizarrely, with 99 DVDs, none of them are the special LOtR's.  One of the movies I bought was American History X.  At one point, they're talking at the kitchen table, and the dad starts talking about Affirmative Action.  I, for one, am ABSOLUTELY OPPOSED to Affirmative Action.  I never, in my life, want a job because of the colour of my skin.  If I was the most qualified for a job, and they gave it to a white person instead, would you call that racism?  Of course you would.  So why isn't this?  I would never want to lose a job to someone because of their race, so by the same token (no pun intended) I would never want to win one by my skin tone, either.  I don't care if you're white, black, brown, yellow or fucking striped purple, the best person for the job, gets the job.  That simple.
