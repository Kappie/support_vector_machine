As such, he needs as much "sending up" as Bush.  I appropriated the photo a couple of years ago (maybe even in 2000) and added the text.  I am not an actual Merry Prankster, but I do what I can with what I have.  The  urlLink picture  is 70k.  Sorry, but it just looked better at 256 colors.  Uh-tee, ah say, uh-tee-hee.
