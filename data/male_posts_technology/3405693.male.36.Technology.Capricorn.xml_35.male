I've been trying all morning to upload an MP3 of my band to various places...of course it's to big to post anywhere and for whatever reason I can't edit it. So now i'm a little frustrated with the whole dealio. I even went to audioblogger to try that...I should have read it more carefully...I didn't know that it had to be sent from a telephone there. Sigh... I suppose I could call it in and then play the mp3 real close to my phone...  Ahhh the joys of technology. I'm sure this stuff is all real easy but I'm just too much of a luddite to get it sussed out properly. Sigh.
