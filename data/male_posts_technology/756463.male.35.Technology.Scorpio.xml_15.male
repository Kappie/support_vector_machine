Pardon me for the language, but who the hell do they think they are?  How can a body made up of people who have NO idea what marriage really means make choices for the rest of us who actually CAN and DO get married?    Marriage is a bond between two people who love each other and want to support each other for the rest of their lives.  How is THAT a sin?  Who cares if they're straight or gay?  The day I got married was the happiest of my life.  Who is the Vatican, whose ruling body can't get married at all, to say that someone can't enjoy that same happiness because of some stupid rule?    Suffice to say, I will never step into a Catholic Church again (barring a funeral or some stuff).  I'm done with them.  This is the one that pushed me over the edge.
