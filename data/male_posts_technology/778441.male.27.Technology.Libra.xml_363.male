This time, the company is  urlLink Microsoft  and the blogger who has been fired, is  urlLink Michael Hanscom .  Last Thursday (October 23 rd ), Michael  urlLink posted an entry  on his blog mentioning how Microsoft was using  urlLink Apple Power Mac G5  computers in its Redmond campus. The post also contained a photo of a truck offloading the G5s. This seemingly innocuous post was either noticed or brought to the notice of some in Microsoft. And on Monday (October 27 th ), Michael's manager called him to inform him that he was " urlLink no longer welcome on the Microsoft campus ". In short, Michael was fired for allegedly violating security.  While blogging about the company you work for, is a dicey practice ( and I strongly advise people to refrain from doing it ), the way Microsoft has reacted in this incident can only be termed as knee-jerk and haphazard. By summarily firing Michael Hanscom, it has, no doubt, courted a PR disaster. What might've stayed fairly unknown, is now spreading across the Net at the speed of blogs.   What I fail to understand is... the photo contained in the  urlLink post  was completely innocent in itself. Michael chose to qualify it as being a pic of inside the Redmond campus. It was his word against that of Microsoft, had Microsoft chosen to merely refute Michael's claim. But by choosing to fire Michael, Microsoft has implicitly admitted that the photo is indeed what Michael claims it to be and that G5s are indeed used within Microsoft. ( I have it from reliable sources that Microsoft uses LINUX quite heavily inspite of publicly deriding claims that Linux is a serious competitor to its Windows line of Operating Systems ).  Surely, Microsoft cannot be this naive!!
