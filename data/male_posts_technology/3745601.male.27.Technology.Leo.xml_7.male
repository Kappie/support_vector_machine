The first section with the links is just there as reference material for the last section that has the costs association. Scroll near the end to see the actual cost             *Edited: 07/17/04*   I've decided to document a couple things about the two people running for President here as a way of centralizing the research I have found on both parties. Today I'm going to post my research on Kerry and  next week I'll do one on Bush . I think my favorite is about Kerry promising to break his promise. At the bottom I have posted the cost, as I could find them, of the promises he has already made. What I find interesting is that he promises to lower our taxes and also spend more... that doesn't make cents. He says that he is going to get his money from taxing the rich. How many rich people do you personally know? How much money can he possibly raise by taxing a couple people? Now I know it is more than that. Somewhere along the lines of 3 million millionaires with about 38,000 having more than 10 million. What you have to compare that to is the 350 million of the rest of us working joes. By the way, those numbers sound good, but you have to take away 1 million of the millionaires if you want someone who actually has that much in cash.  urlLink Source  Also next weekI'm going to talk a little about food.
