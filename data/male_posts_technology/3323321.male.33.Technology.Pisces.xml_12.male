I used readysetconnect.com as the hosting provider, but I'm not sure how well this is going to work out, I've already had several problems. If any body else wasn’t to set up a site send me an email and I'll help you out (if this works out that is)...  Fourth of July was fun, Dan the Man had some good fireworks and we had lots and lots of food.  -Casey
