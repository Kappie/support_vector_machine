Afterwhich I had about an hr before my class. 1st class was OK. 2nd class was more difficult. I found one girl in particular quite a handful. Vanessa Toh!!!! (EEAARGGGHHH!!!!!!)   The class in general tends to be pretty noisy. Vanessa is a hyperactive girl who sometimes stubbornly refuse to obey instructions. Anyway, she was constantly doing her own thing when I give out instructions. I found her placing her foot to her face (I'm not kidding!), sitting with her legs up on the chair, shaking the chair non-stop, typing something completely different on the keyboard from what I instructed the class to do, etc. I was amused for awhile but towards the end I got pretty frustrated just trying to control her antics. Finally I went over and switched off her monitor (not PC), "Since you're not interested to listen, then you don't need to do anymore." Vanessa was an intelligent girl. She knew that I still left her PC on, so the moment my back was turned, she switched on the monitor again and proceeded with her nonsense again. I went back to her and switched off the PC straight away (yeayea, I'm guilty of not shutting down the PC properly but I was really pissed). Then I said in a really stern tone, "I SAID you will NOT do anything, since you DON'T want to listen." She tried to act rebellious by shaking her chair or doing something I can't quite remember. I decided to place my foot down and said "Do you want me to make you STAND?" She simply gave me a look. So I said, "OK STAND UP." in a firm tone. She refused and continued sitting down. I was furious, such audacity to openly defy an instruction like that so I said in an ever more fierce tone and face "STAND UP!" and she still sat on defiantly. I repeated myself one more time, "VANESSA I SAID YOU STAND!". And yet still she sat. I looked her straight in the eye, gave myself a few seconds to give her the evil stare before I said, "Do you want me to drag you outside and make you stand outside?! You don't believe I will do it?!". Actually around that time, it struck me. She might be mroe afraid of answering me than defying me. So I asked her "ARE YOU GOING TO LISTEN TO INSTRUCTIONS OR NOT?" Silence followed. "I ASK YOU AGAIN, ARE YOU GOING TO PAY ATTENTION AND LISTEN TO INSTRUCTIONS?! ANSWER ME YES OR NO!" I received a meek nod. My temper immediately subsided, it was the signal I wanted. One which implied that I had scared her enough to gain her obedience for a moment at least. "OK, switch on your computer and login again. Next time you listen and obey instructions."   I never got a peep from her for the rest of class. I had embarrassed her enough to make her submissive for awhile. Usually she'd relish the attention she'd get by being notoriously naughty. Anyway, towards the last 5 min when I found her hyperacting up again, I got her to 'assist' me by shutting down 3 unused PCsnearby. She was quick to react and proud to have been 'selected' for the job. She pretty much shoved other girls who wanted the responsibility out of the way. I was amused. She would make a good leader someday, if only she was kept on a much tighter leash and properly groomed. Hopefully she'll mellow down a bit as time passes.   After work I had to rush down to meet Tang at Somerset MRT to collect my spare specs (which I had absent mindedly left in his car last Sat when he gave me a lift down to PS). I actually intended to rush down for Aikido at Bt Batok East. Met Tang and rushed to board the MRT. Halfway through I realised I took the wrong direction because of the north south line being a loop now. I hastily jumped onto the one which said Jurong East instead of the one heading towards City Hall Interchange, I was heading NORTH! Hopped out and took the next MRT back. At City Hall interchange, I jumped across and afterawhile noticed I was heading EAST! EAAAAAAGH. Hopped off at Kallang MRT and took the westbound (correct) train. But by the time I cleared half the journey, I knew I was going to be late and I was in no mood to rush around anymore. Decided to grab dinner at Clementi's MacDonalds and read my book "Killing Pablo". After a relaxing moment, I decided to head back home.   Deciding not to rush down and continue my training turned out to be the right decision after all. Think I was stressing myself too much since the afternoon. Nervous breakdown liao...
