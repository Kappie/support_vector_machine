I would have to characterize this thumping head routine as a fault with wine, but obviously not one the winemaker can do anything about.  You see, by US law, the wine must be treated with sulfites which is often the culprite.  But since this blog is about,the Science of Wine, we need to look a 'little' deeper.  So below, I have outlined a bried treatise on wine and alcohol allergies.     Alcohol is a natural product   Alcohol (ethanol) is a normal by-product of human and animal cell chemistry/metabolism. Cell processes result in normal physiological levels of 0.01 to 0.03 mg of alcohol/100 ml of blood. By contrast, a blood alcohol limit for driving of 0.05 per cent is equivalent to 50 mg of alcohol/100 ml of blood.   Alcohol is broken down in the liver  Alcohol (ethanol) is broken down by liver enzymes within minutes. Conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde requires the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase. Acetaldehyde is then transformed to acetic acid ("vinegar") by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase. If individuals can't break down alcohol easily, problems may occur if alcohol is consumed.   Flushing is not an allergic reaction   Some people will experience intense facial flushing after having even small amounts of alcohol. These symptoms are most common in those with an Asian background. Other side-effects of fluttering of the heart (palpitations, tachycardia), sensation of heat, headache, tummy discomfort or a drop in blood pressure (hypotension) are related to high blood acetaldehyde levels. Individuals with these problems appear to be partially deficient in aldehyde dehydrogenase, resulting in high levels of accumulated acetaldehyde.   Alcoholic beverages contain ethanol and other substances  The liver breaks down the alcohol (ethanol) we drink and converts it to a chemical called acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is then transformed to acetic acid ("vinegar"). Problems occur if alcohol cannot be broken down. As well as ethanol, alcoholic beverages contain a complex mixture of grape, yeast, hop, barley or wheat-derived substances, natural food chemicals (eg. salicylates), wood and fruit-derived substances (eg. Histamine, tyramine in chianti), added enzymes (like papain) and preservatives (like sulphites). Severe allergic reactions have been described in people with allergies to proteins within grapes, yeast, hops, barley and wheat. These patients are not sensitive to alcohol itself. Furthermore, "fining agents" (like egg protein, parvalbumin and seafood proteins) are sometimes used to remove fine particles. Whether these occur in sufficient amounts to trigger allergic reactions is unknown.   Asthma can be triggered by sulphites  Up to a third of people with asthma complain that wine will worsen their asthma, less often with beer or spirits. Beer, wine and champagne contain sulphites (additive 220-226), used as a preservative since Roman times. Some people, particularly those with unstable or poorly controlled asthma, may wheeze when they consume these drinks. In general, there is more preservative in white wine than red wine, and more in cask wine than bottled wine. The amount of metabisulphite also varies from brand to brand. Some "low sulphite" wines are available, although those with extreme sensitivity may not be able to tolerate them. This is because some grape growers will dust sulphur powder over grapes in the weeks leading up to harvest. Other sources of sulphites include vinegar, pickled onions, dried fruit, or when dusted onto crustaceans and some restaurant salads or fruit salads. Sometimes grapes are transported with bags of sulphites to keep them fresh. Even when people complain that wine triggers asthma, sulphites may not be the only explanation.    Asthma can also be due to enzyme deficiency  Patients with aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency accumulate high levels of acetaldehyde after consuming alcohol. Acetaldehyde has been blamed for asthmatic reactions to alcohol in up to half of Japanese asthma patients. Sometimes histamine within alcoholic beverages has been blamed for allergic reactions.   Histamine and other substances may also cause problems  Histamine can trigger sneezing, runny nose and sometimes wheeze, stomach upset and headache. There is more histamine in red than white wines, although the amounts will vary from wine to wine. Some small studies have shown that antihistamines can help reduce the severity of symptoms, but as the amount of wine challenge was equivalent to only one glass, probably won't prevent hangovers! Others substances within wine may also cause problems to some unlucky individuals, but these are not well defined.   Serious allergic reactions to beer or wine may occur  Anaphylaxis has been described in patients with severe allergic reactions to proteins within grapes, yeast, hops, barley and wheat. These patients are not sensitive to alcohol itself.   Anaphylaxis to alcohol is rare  Allergic reactions to alcohol itself are rare, but described in a few dozen published case reports. As little as 1 ml of pure alcohol (equivalent to 10ml of wine or a mouthful of beer) is enough to provoke severe rashes, difficulty breathing, stomach cramps or collapse, a condition known as anaphylaxis. Given that the body constantly produces small amounts of alcohol itself, the reason that such reactions occur is poorly understood. Allergy tests using alcohol are usually negative, but sometimes positive to breakdown products of ethanol such as acetaldehyde or acetic acid ("vinegar"). Provocation tests with alcohol are usually positive, but only sometimes when acetaldehyde or acetic acid are used. Finally, alcohol can sometimes act as a "co-factor", increasing the likelihood of anaphylaxis from other causes.   So what does this mean?  A reasonable summary would conclude that most allergies are caused by sulfites and histamines.  While some wines consumed in Europe have very low levels of sulfites, most US wines are maintained as relatively static levels and thus can cause problems in those with sulfite allergies.  I have friends with histamine allergies, one can take an antihistamine (Claritan D) before drinking wine and it seems to help.  The other, it does not seem to help...   Next installment, who's burning the rubber?  Peace
