To the powers that give us strength to perform our daily tasks and the resilient, undying American mindset that so fuels our ambitions, and to all who shall hear these tidings, greetings. On December second, two thousand  four, my whole life was forever changed when I was blessed to cross paths with an emotionally wrought young woman named Mellanie Nicole Triplett. I was immediately fascinated by her obvious quirkiness  open-toed feistiness. It was rare that I could go online and come across a decent chatter to spend quality minuteâ€™s conversating with that wasnâ€™t already on my buddy list. I happened upon a yahoo chat room and there she was. My first comment to her wasnâ€™t hello or hiâ€¦or even yo ma wassup? To my recollection, it was a borderline insult! We talked for sometime that night, and from that point, grew to establish a very close internet friendship. There was nothing I looked more forward to than conversing with the velvet peach from ATL. I met her during a period of her life where she was very unhappy with the way things were going and was in desperate need of a change. She met me during the greatest moment of uncertainty  transition I have yet to experience in my twenty six years of existence. Through our respective personal quests to make our lives more complete, preferably on our own, we found each other.  On January of two thousand  four, I asked Nicole to be my girlfriend. I asked her on my knees in front of the computer where I had previously confessed my love for her, the vehicle by which our kinship was founded. We were on the phone together, musing about sweet nothings. In all the world, there was only one place I would have rather been, and that was directly in front of her, holding her hand  looking into her eyes as I spoke those words. Twenty six years of living and I had never felt so aliveâ€¦ I never had a girlfriend that was such an attractive package, such an unpolished gem with so much potential. It had been almost two years since Iâ€™d been with someone I truly felt this deeply about. So many avenues of opportunity began to open for I could feel in my soulâ€¦in my very spirit that it was meant for us to be together. The lord God gives unto His children visions, prophecies of what could be if we trust in Him, and the Lord showed me my wife one night. One night when I was continuing preparations for training at Ft. Benning, hardening my mindset to deal with the inherent dangers before me. I care about her sooo much. To say that I love her with all my heart would be an understatement. Nothing on earth makes me happier than to know that my baby was taken care of  content. The question was would I truly be able to do so, finding myself in the position I was in.  Conversations before  after this night escalated heavily on the subject of sex and its inherent pleasures. At one point, we had come to the mutual decision not to have intercourse for fear that it may in time ruin the relationship. From this point, the relationship itself began growing really complicated. It began with the well documented Valentineâ€™s Day excursion and has now festered to the point where it appears that the ties that bind have been severed.  Jesus, upon being questioned by Pontius Pilate, responded to one of his queries with the famous verse â€œI am the way, the truth  the lightâ€¦â€? Pilate responded, â€œWhat is truth?â€? To this the scripture documents no response from Jesus. It took me quite some time before I realized what the truth was. Simply put, it wasnâ€™t about the manger or the depth of dreams. It was about an individual, superhuman, yet uninterrupted, charged with a mission that was either the most important of all time or just a run-of-the-mill taste of box office candy at your local theater depending on oneâ€™s beliefs. There is a spirit inside of myself that would like to be called a prince but there is only one son in the monarchy and Iâ€™m proud to know of him. Elated for his example  cognizant of the inherent disciplines necessary to be a complete Christian. One day Jesus was born in a lowly manger, captured  beaten by his captors, head drooped low as He carried his cross. Hung so high and because of which, mankind has a right to the tree of life. I am not the light and have never claimed to be. All I could ever be is what I was raised to pursue. Anyone that I end up with in the near future will be dealing with a work in progress, who has never claimed perfection yet seeks daily to find  nurture strength. One day I hope to be Nicoleâ€™s perfect man.  It is with this knowledge that I leave the fate of this relationship, its potential and every pertinent aspect of its possibilities to the woman who would have to deal with my ups and my downs, my victories  my defeats. God has blessed thus far to an extent that I have never known with another human being. I have felt things that I did not know existed. Furthermore, I believe that our greatest strength lies in the stillness of the fiesta, nestled somewhere between the raging silence and the boisterous lauding as the band plays.  I love you Nicole, with every fiber of my being. Every corner of my heart speaks your name. Presented to you this day are a series of words that in time shall be proven. Perhaps we could survive a breakup but such is a life that would have no meaning for me. You are my meaning and my motivation. You are my greatest triumph and my best friend.  As I leave you tonight, I would like to remind the world of the situation in Iraq once more as the 111th signal battalion has nearly completed sending their troops overseas. They are mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, uncles, aunts, next of kin  someoneâ€™s best friend. Please pray for them and their safe return as surely we are living in the last days. Thank you  goodnight.
