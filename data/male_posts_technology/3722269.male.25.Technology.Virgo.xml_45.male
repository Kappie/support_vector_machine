Prompted by a friend saying 'you have been quite the unlucky one, havent you :/ ' When I tend to think of myself has having been extremely lucky, at least with my life, so far. I'm certain too, that the future will give me more reasons to be greatful - hopefully many more. On the surface, having had two open heart surgeries, one planned at age 3 and one spontaneously after my aorta exploded, and cancer probably does seem 'unlucky' to most. The heart surgery in 1999 was by far the single most physically taxxing thing I have ever and probably will ever undergo, it's a weird sensation to labour on every breath - it really makes you confront head on, your reasons for being -here- , your reasons for being alive... because right there, you could just as easily give up. I nearly did, but while I too and fro'd the deciscionpeople turned up to visit me.. friends.. a couple at first, then in groups.. I was too weak to really even acknowledge their presence.. but come they did, more and more, dozens.. to give up would be selfish.. easy on me, hard on all them. My friends, my family. Within my power, to not bring them that hurt. And so I found the strength to fight. I'm glad that it was me, that was in that position, and not someone younger, weaker, more vulnerable, and not someone older, weaker, and less surrounded by good people.. surrounded by love. I love my life, and it loves me back. The cancer thing, in 2001.. well that was a whole heap different, and much more emotionally taxxing.. for a start I was in Rotorua, a whole new ballgame when all my friends were in auckland, and merely visiting would've been a mission and a half. My mother, recently in Australia, made the judgement call to not return to give me support while I was in hospital.. mydad - visibly pained by being there, I sent home at least a dozen times. My elderly deaf grandmother, would sit and smile, sympathetically. And visitors the few that came, Ididnt have the heart to tell them, at the time, just how much I feltlike dying. This time from somewhere deep inside I found my own strength, my own reasons to live, and chose to be here. I'm a better person for it. I'm a greatful person for it. I'm a strong person for it. And yeah, I know pain now, I knowdepression now, and I know loneliness now, but I feel like I've beaten them all. I'm in the process of beating weight loss now, I've been rediscovering myself.. I got scared for a while, as my last relationship broke up, that I'd defined myself and my life -by- my relationship, it had come to be who I was, I'd lost the definition of who I was.. I've rediscovered that now, and I'm not in a relationship, and I'm happy.. truely happy.. and life rocks. Every day is good, the air is fresh, and I smile at stupid things .. and stupid people ;) You need to, in life, I think be able to look deep inside yourself, and look at who you are, and what you do, and how you act.. your strengths, your weaknesses... you need to look at it all, and you need to be able to smile, and say to yourself, that you are a good person, that you like yourself, and I can do that. I'm a lucky person, -you- are part of why I'm lucky, as a friend, and I thank you, now, because I probably dont do it enough in person. Whoah.. this is getting long :> Thoughts before I go to bed.. ima haffta up the 'anti' or put in more effort, to maintain a 5kg a week weightloss.. so my new cheapy warehouse shoesies will be helping me walk walk walk my way to a higher calorie consumption. Sorted. Thanks, for listening. TTFN
