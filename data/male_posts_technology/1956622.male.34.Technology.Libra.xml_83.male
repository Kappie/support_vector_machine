I had a friend of mine serve   SFW   with a restraining order and motion for temporary custody of Jeremey.    Needless to say   SFW   is a little pissed at me!  I got to talk to Karissa and I actually went by and saw her.  When I talked to her on the phone she was laughing and stuff, I love to hear her laugh. Karissa asked if I could come by and see her and I told her I wanted to.    I called   SFW   back and asked if I could bring Karissa's swimsuit by and she said OK.  I went by and man she was so pretty and happy to see me.  It just felt good to pick her up and hug her.  I could not stay and so she painted a picture, a little pony picture, and gave it to me and said I want you to have this.   I left and 15 minutes later my buddy showed up and served her!  Of course I received a call from   SFW   telling me not to come by there anymore I could have Karissa on 8/17 - 8/24 and 9/1 - 9/8 otherwise I was not to come by.  In one way I am sorry that happened because I would love to go by everyday and see Karissa and I have now screwed that up but hopefully in the long run it will work to my benefit.  I know she hates me for what I have done and am doing and that is a little painful to have the woman you once loved hate you but then again the stuff she did was not done out of love I am guessing.  Instead I think she just hates me because I am putting up the fight that I am instead of rolling over and giving in to her like many do.  None of this process is easy but at the same time I feel it is necessary.  I feel if I leave Karissa with Lisa she will turn Karissa into a basket case.  I mean after all she told Jeremey that his aunt and uncle did not love him anymore. That is not healthy or acceptable.  Even if she dislikes the rest of her family and hates them she should not deny the opportunity to her children to have a relationship with their family.  That is my opinion and I am hoping it will be the courts opinion as well.
