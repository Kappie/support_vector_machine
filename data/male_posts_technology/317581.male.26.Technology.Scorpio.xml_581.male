But the question isn't whether people get in cycles, the question is, Can people change the cycles they're in, once they recognize them?   I know my step sister has a tendency to get pregnant everyother year, and that after she becomes pregnant, she ditches the father and goes back to church. Once the baby comes, she wants hardly anything to do with her other children... and starts sleeping with men again to become pregnant. Repeat   My question is, Do I sabotage my own relationships by opening up too little/opening up too much/opening up too quickly? Do I sabotage my relationships by wanting too much? Trusting too much? Trusting too little? Do I over analyze everything? I know I should just enjoy life and not think anything about my relationship, go with the flow (go with aunt flo?)    online peeps   I think it would be silly for me to try and hide who I am on my blog. Itry to be as open an honest here as I should be in the real world. I often wonder if I am too blunt, or too raw. Part of the problem with knowing people read the blog is I may want to cover some feelings up, or censor my blog. I can't do that. I don't have the energy to hide myself from the blogging community, so please be patient with me, as I do have some prickly edges...  Time for sleep, Peace- T
