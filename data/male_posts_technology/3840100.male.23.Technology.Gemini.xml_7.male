We just had one of the songs from the demo played on the radio which was awesome. I was so pumped to hear something that I'm involved in on the public air waves even though I wasn't in that recording. Very cool stuff!!! I'm enjoying being in the group more than words can describe. I'm finally in a group that is like me in drive and personality so that is very important. We know how to have a good time and there is really never a dull moment. Something cool is always happening.  I have actually given my bass a name. For years i have toyed with the idea, but I never really did anything about it. Now since Mike has a name for every one of his drums I just had to give my bass a name. "Vince Clortho Lecutis" is the name. If you can tell me in the message board how I got the name you will get 20 cool points!!! So look for me with “Vince Clortho Lecutis” the bass on the local scene with Third Rail!!  In other news, I have been writing quite a bit lately. I'm close to doing about a song a week now. Pretty soon I'm going to have to stop to complete the songs and master them for a new release. Yes, yes, I know, "Off the Deep End" is coming out. It's actually going to be for download so don't worry. I'm actually looking forward to the new release. It'll be nice to actually have it out instead of just talking about it.  That's it for the news, but check back soon!!! Resistance is Futile.  - Rick
