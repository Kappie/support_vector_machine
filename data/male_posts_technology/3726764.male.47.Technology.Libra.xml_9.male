I already have laundry done, the floors swept, washed and waxed. Still hafta dust and vacuum and I shold prolly clean the fish tank. The stores are having their first back-to-school sales of the season. It reminds me I need to get my books for my Fall classes yet plus any notebooks/folders etc. I may need. I met a nice girl online last night from Virginia Beach, VA. It was nice to have someone to talk to as I do get lonely for conversation at times. I sensed she wants more but I have negative feelings about online romances. Experienced a few myself. Anyone who wants to know more can ask. It's a great way to meet people and get acquainted but unless you live close enough to date and interact in person, there's a lot you will never learn about the other person from the internet. I know of at least 2 online romances that turned into happy marriages. But I know of lots more that turned into disappointment and heartbreak. I'm trying to steer my blog in the direction of thoughts, feelings, and opinions rather than just a boring chronological diary of my daily activities. Input from others would make it easier. Today's thought... ...Today is like no other. And in a mere 24 hours, it will be history. Things will happen that can never be changed. Opportunities will come around that will never come around again. The clock is ticking. When I am laying on my deathbed, I hope the list of things I regret not doing is smaller than the list of regrets of the things I've done.
