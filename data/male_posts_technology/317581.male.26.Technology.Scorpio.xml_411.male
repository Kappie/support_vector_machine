We're coming up on our year lease and I've decided to live here another year.   We're having to replace two roommates... Cindy :( and Sean :)  So, I'm kinda sad cindy is leaving. I'm pretty sure we won't get a girl to replace her, and there's just something nice about living with a girl, you know? Plus I feel like I've just gotten to know cindy and now she's moving to idaho:( Also, girls are clean, which is to say, much different than boys:)  and now on to sean...  OK, so if you're going to be an alcoholic, don't be an ass about it. And if you're going to fall off the wagon, don't do it in my living room. Got home thursday night and Sean was drunk. He then continued to be beligerent/drunk all weekend long. It was fuckin AWESOME. oh wait, was that sarcasm ;-)  Well, I should get back to work, if anyone reads this please email me:) I've missed you all so much ;)
