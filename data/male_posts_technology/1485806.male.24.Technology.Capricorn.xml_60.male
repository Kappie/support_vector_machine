Indeed all the time we have been living with the deliverer mentality and living our lives like that but it is time to go to the enemy's camp and take back what is ours. It is time for us to live lives that are of victorious mindset. With that , we can start to IMPACT THE NATIONS...SIBKL 's vision for this year. Oh yeah if you guys read this tonite, well we are the greeters for SIBKL second service tomorrow at 8.00am ..which by the ways means ...i have to go to church just after work...so if u see me yawning , don't ask why..heheh  Right , if u guys that are reading this but not attending the cell, well my invitation to you with open arms to come attend cell. BTW , we are not going to have cell this friday but i am sort of thinking something out so that we will have something to keep us occupied. See u in church then.
