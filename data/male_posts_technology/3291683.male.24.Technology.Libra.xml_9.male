It actually has quite a good selection, but the prices are kinda high, and the store store looks extremely bare - it looks like they have one or two copies of most games and puzzles, and nothing else.  I guess it might be good for finding things I can't find anywhere else local, but with the prices they have (typically slightly above list) I think I'll find myself searching at the other local stores or just ordering it instead.  I'm sad; I had high hopes.  It looks, though, like a few people from the old store that used to be there decided not to just close down when the store went away.  I give them my best wishes, but I don't currently hold high hopes for their doing incredibly well, even in a mall as busy as that one.  The weather is still just very poor around this area, too.  It feels like the rain hasn't stopped for weeks, and that isn't far off the truth.  The amount of rain we've had around here recently just feels unreal; I don't remember the last time there was anywhere NEAR this much rain in New York.  Maybe it's just my imagination, and it really secretly happens every year, but it feels like a new experience to me.  So for those photography buffs out there, check out  this article .  I read through it, and it interested me quite a bit.  I'm not a photographer, but my wife is in her spare time, and the technology interested me.  I read a lot of the discussion at  Slashdot  about it, and people there seemed to be a lot more cynical about it.  Me, I figure that even if it IS pretty much all old tech applied in a quasi-new way, the results are gorgeous.  It may not be some amazing revolutionary new technology, but the guy should still get credit.  So I should finally be getting new links for my watch, soon.  This is a  Citizen EcoDrive Skyhawk , one of the older (original) models in the line, that I got from my wife as an engagement/marriage present.  (I actually got it before the wedding, but its primary purpose at the time was to go with my suit for the honeymoon.)  It's a really nice watch, but the band is a tad too small.  Do you have ANY clue how hard it is to get links for this thing?!?  I tried six or seven jewelry stores over six months, and most of them just referred me to the company.  The company, of course, said they don't direct-order them, and I should do it through the place I purchased it.  I eventually got one guy to say he'd call them and order them and then contact me, but he never did.  But I have a receipt now...  And I was TOLD they'd already been ordered...  So I'm hoping they'll come this time, and I'll be able to start wearing my watch again without cutting off circulation or pinching a nerve - or whatever it is that makes it so darnedly uncomfortable on my hand.  It's actually a really really nice watch, though.  It's got the main dial, of course, which is digitally driven.  It has two smaller dials: 24-hour time that matches the main dial, and UTC (Universal Time Code, I believe) that typically matches Greenwich.  That is, it always SHOULD match Greenwich, but doesn't necessarily, if the time's screwed up.  :)  Right now it's showing, ummm, 19:58, which I hope is correct (3:58 +5 +1 for DST?  Or should it be 17, 3:58 +5 -1?...  I can never remember...)  Anyway.  It also has a digital display that, in normal operation, shows the time of the city you choose.  It comes with like 20 or 30 pre-programmed cities, and you can add a couple more, using a 3-letter city code.  You can also "turn them off", so that when you're cycling through you only get the ones you're interested in; for example, I left Anchorage and London active, but killed Paris, Mexico City, and Moscow.  It has at least one in every time zone, plus a few spares.  The cool part is, though, that you choose the city you want, and then hold both buttons for a second, and it trades the digital and analog time-zones!  So if your analog is set to NYC time, you can set the digital to London time, hold both buttons for a second, and poof!  The analog sets itself to London time and the digital shows NYC time.  I love that feature; it's incredibly useful for travel, because not only can you show two different times and save yourself a headache, but switching between times is really easy; easy enough that you can do it painlessly even on a layover in Chicago on your way from New York to Vancouver, for example.  Yes, that case really came up.  :)  Anyway.  In addition, it holds the date (of course), has a stopwatch/chronograph/timer, and three alarms.  I love this thing.  I'm glad I'll finally be able to wear it again soon!  The one thing I've really just never taken the time to learn is the circular slide-rule that's included on the inside and outside of the dial.  Some day, I'll figure it out, but not today.  :)  My friend Andy actually recently got himself a new watch, and ended up going with the "blue angels" Skyhawk.  It has a leather band instead of metal (I really prefer metal, he apparently really prefers the leather), and different trim, and a slightly different-shaped dial; otherwise it's the same.  I told him I already had one, and he looked a bit crestfallen.  He makes more than me (more than my wife and I together, in fact), but I feel like he takes a little too much joy sometimes in having better toys than me.  He's a good guy, and I enjoy our time together, though.  I have my own list of faults.  :)  I'm finally going to get to try Aliens vs. Predator 2 today.  A co-worker hasn't played it in months, so he said I could borrow it long enough to decide if I want to buy it or not.  The demo was horrific, but all the reviews said the game was a million times better...  Yes, I know, I know, another evil vicious shooter game which will send me straight to hell...  Eh, whatever.  I'm in it more for the ambience and the technological bits and the twitchy action.  I'm not homicidal.  Promise!  Never even have been!  Really!!!  :)  Seriously...  This game got amazing reviews, and I just never quite got around to buying a copy, and I'm glad to finally see what's behind it all!  The first game was good, but had a lot of weaknesses; by the sounds of it, the second one fixes pretty much all of them.  I'm excited.  My favorite in the original was always the Predator.  I've always done better as the ninja-type player than the line soldier, just because of my reactions and such.  The Marines always just got me killed.  The Aliens...  Oi, they were HARD in the original!  Far too easy for even the civilians to kill you, sometimes.  Not to mention the lack of ability to save during a mission!  But this is supposed to have improved even on all of that, and made all the races more fun to play, so we'll see how it goes.  Ah, well; I guess I'll sign off for today.  Take care.
