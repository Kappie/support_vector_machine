So here goes the lines from Lucky Ali's "Jeena" (with 'my' interpretation in parenthesis)   ek din aisa hua jo ke hona tha (one day it so happened; it had to happen anyway)  aaya tere jahan mein main par mujhe na aana tha (I came in your world; but I should not have come)  marzi meri nahi thi na hi mera tha khayaal (It was not my will; it wasnt my thought either)  apne hone pe khud se karta hoon main sawaal (I question myself of my own existence) ------------------------------------------------------------------  anjaane sare yahan inhe kab tak main sahoon (all of the people here are strangers)  jeene ki khatir dil badlein to mein kuch kahoon (if they change their heart to start living, then I say something)  sunne ko raazi ho to mein inke saath rahoon (if they agree to listen then I will be with them)  har ek chamak ke peeche na daude to main sang chaloon (If they donot run after every shinig object, then I will tread with them) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
