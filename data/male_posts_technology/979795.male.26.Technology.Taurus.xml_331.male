Had loaned it last Sun to photocopy (cheap cheap :P) and die die needed to return coz he need to do the homewk. Anyway, that kinda made me late for practice.  Heh,  urlLink you  had to give us your wonderful warmup again :P But can tell lah it's not as tiring as the other time. But I still dun understand how on earth you can hold your leg up so long. I can feel my whole body quivering and straining in jus a few seconds.  Hmm ... Sensei kinda lost a bit of patience with one of the kids in class. But seriously lah, he's quite a joker. Maybe coz of his age that's why he still feel like having fun rather than train seriously. Oh but something Sensei mentioned today that stuck. He likened aikido with horce racing. Sometimes horses would run really fast but lose stamina later, some horses which look like they can't even run but start to pick up later on in the race. The latter being the good horse of course. But it's the same in Aikido too. I was recalling the time when I had really wanted to train 4-5 days before I returned to UK. But all along in my mind I was expecting to slacken down my training to just 2 days. Of course lah, commitments in NS can't be helped either but still ... (Alamak! I'm a lousy horse!)  Oh btw, I've tried and tested liao. it doesn't matter if you put 'www' in front of the address of your blogpage. I was wrong. Publishing didn't seem any faster than the other time. So pple, dun bother updating my add/link. I'll change back later.
