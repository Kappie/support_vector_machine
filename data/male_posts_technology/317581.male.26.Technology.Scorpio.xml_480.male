Not that I won't miss them horribly, but we're only a phone call or an instant message or email away. In a society of instant messages, cell phones, and email, it's difficult to feel that someone has moved away.  I will never turn down a friend. NEVER. I'm not the type of person that would let down a friend. If something is within my ability to do for a friend I will do it.  On another note, There's a FUCKIN FLY IN MY ROOM!!! It's like 50 degrees out, and there's a fly in my room! WTF!!!!  Anyway, my heart is big enough for all of you. Let me in, let me care and you will never need to wonder if I care. I do, I will, I am. I cannot change who I am, or can I?  Time for bed, Time for work, Peace-
