So we went along to the JADC production of "Beauty and the Beast" it was a good laugh but I always feel these things go on a bit too long. I didn't expect to be molested by a pantomine horse and be forced to sign "i'm a little tea-pot" complete with the actions.  Plus I didn't catch a single one of the fricking sweets.
