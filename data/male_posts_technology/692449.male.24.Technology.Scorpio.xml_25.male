I'm going to get some sushi tonight with my girlfriend few things in life are better then sushi. My surreal experiance continues as I was about to leave my friend Mikey's I hear a knocking on the window it is my friend Taylor. He got into a fight with his girl, who he lives with, and he needed a place to chill out for a while. It was very wierd trying to talk him calm just as I thought the night was done. He eventually left and I was stuck going to bed at 4:00am not a good time for bed. To early to do anything but to late to say you had a hell of a night. Besides all that I'm starting to have an obsession with fractals appearing in nature. I look and a dandilion and it gets a little wierd.
