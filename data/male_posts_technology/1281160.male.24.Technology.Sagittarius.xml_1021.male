One thing I have done is to remove the movie and book information from the main page. So now visitors will not see posts that are about the movies I had watched and the books I have read. They will instead be listed under 'Recent Reads' and 'Recently Watched'. But even this might change soon.   It is really a pain in the neck trying to fit all information in a single page. Maybe  urlLink this  might help.   Rini, Your post was a refresher course in CMM. So when do you plan for CMM?  Till the next post,
