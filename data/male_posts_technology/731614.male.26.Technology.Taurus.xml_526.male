It siad "Hey Marci I need to be opened right now" so it is Jonnie's fault. I will hold off putting pictures of me playing with all my goodies, but I just want to say that he did a good job.  He even has my back on certain pregnancy concearns, or maybe he is just smart enough to know that it would be very bad if I was to ever have a kid, either way I love Christmas in June.    Maybe we should do Kwanza in August.  That might be fun.  Also, I want to expand on the name of car question.  I have a friend that named her genitalia and I found that nuts, is this normal practice?
