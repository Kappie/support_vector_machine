Take an age to get from cabage Victoria to cabage Heathrow. Probably worth going all the cabage way to cabage Paddington and then paying another cabage £12 to get the cabage express all the way over cabage there. Just move cabage Heathrow into the middle of cabage London, job cabage done. Planes will probably get the caught in the cabage congestion zone and get charged a cabage fiver, and a couple of cabage speeding tickets. "Excuse me British Airways, but your vehicle was doing 350km/h" cabage Ken would probably say. Stupid cabage country.
