Dad was getting the store cleaned. Everybody else was helping. But he told everyone not to wake me up. He didnt even talk to me after that. It was as if i wasnt even there. Uff! I felt so guilty. Last night, he had told me to sleep, but i didnt. He was very naraz.  I had lunch. I offered to help in the cleaning thing, but he didnt even reply. My mother got furious and scolded me and told me to go and help. I helped for an hour or so. Then, I sat on the pc. But i didnt feel like doin nething. I was in a helpless state. I called Hamza at bout 6 and told him not to come bcz i was in no mood to go for jogging and hung up. It was rude, but i couldnt help it. Then, I sat on the pc again. Read SPIDER and visited some links. Chatted with Farazeh. Told her everything. She told me to go apologize, but i couldnt muster the courage. Neways, I had dinner. Then, I watched some TV. Bro ko idea aaya that gol gappay khate hein. So, we went to eat gol gappay. As we were leaving, Dad's friend called. He said that he was coming over. Dad told him to come to the gol gappa place. We went there. He also came. We had gol gappay. Got back. Then, I just lazed around. After some time, I decided to talk to dad. He didnt say much. Neways, leave that. Then, at 1 i came online. Since then, ive been posting, and chatting. Now, im off to bed bcz i gotta wake up early 2moro
