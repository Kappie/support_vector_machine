All day I've walked into the room just as someone said my name, or picked up the phone the second someone called me.  I was thinking of writing a letter to someone and they appeared in front of me.  Needless to say, things are good. The apartment's great - my roomates, likewise - and my neighbors are quite friendly.  I think this is going to be a great summer.  At least it's been a great week.   I was a little bothered that I wasn't going to be able to make it to my brother's bachelor party - I still have two more weeks until I get paid, and I'm sufficiently broke to be unable to make it down to boston.  But true to uncanny form, the party I was fretting missing got cancelled.  Things have a funny way of working out. So I'm making dinner with Kate and Laurel tonight - two classy chicks who redefine the meaning of cool.  This came as the end of a long held phobia of mine, asking a girl out to dinner.  Don't get me wrong, I've been in numerous relationships of all levels of intimacy.  I've just never felt comfortable asking someone out to dinner.  Requesting casual sex hasn't posed a problem, but, there's I've always been reluctant to ask for their culinary company.  This may say something about my priorities. Anyways (stalling for thoughts)...   work has been good so far.  I like my job, picking up where I left off last summer after I got laid off during the school year.  Nothing's more embarassing than being laid off from a campus job.  Well, I can think of a few notable exceptions, but it still sucks. So I'm here, back at college but without the homework.  Just how I like it.  I can tell the group of people I'm living with (there's five more or less living in my apartment now) are going to be a load of fun.  We're already planning the 50 Drinking Games in One Night Party.  *Sigh*  Irresponsible young adult life is good.
