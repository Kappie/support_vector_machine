Work is going great, classes are going smoothly and i'm ace'n the friggen college thing. For once i'm smart again! Hahaha.   Tonight i'm kickin back, relaxing and fixing to just enjoy some tv and writing my assignments. Exciting eh? Rosie came down yesterday and me and her had a wonderful time eating at Bandana's, gigglin , laughing, and she even had breakfast when she woke up! :O Wow i got groceries *L*   Paid my cable bill, friggen high as hell 130 is to much for cable, but oh well, least it in cludes business cable speeds and i'm powered up enough to power like 40 pc's here.   Finally got me a laptop, for on the road and on trips, its quite tight. And oh man Corpus Christi was beautiful! I love traveling on business trips.   Well nuff blabbing from me... ZAP! Nugga!
