Finally, here I am blogging :-)  Ok, I'm a bit unsure about wether I should be doing this, anyway here I am ;-)  Er... well I guess the best thing is to introduce myself: I'm a 27 yo Italian, Delphi programmer and now exploring the dotNET side.  What will you see here? Whatever passes through my brain and I feel like sharing.  Why would you want to read my blog? I don't know, but if you do and post comments I definitely don't mind :-)  See you on this page, and hope you enjoy it!  Andrew
