Peter and I did get to learn how to ski-skate (or skate-ski). We learned the V1, the V2 and the technique for going up hills since the ski bottoms don't have any treads so you slide easily. Well I think my homework is almost done for tomorrow and Wednesday (this is only a 4-day week). 
Other news:
I am updating my website (with cool aqua-pill rollover buttons for my navigation)
iLife '04 is NOW shipping (with GarageBand).
Spymac 3 was released (you MUST check it out - it's still a beta though)
