Over on  urlLink LightBlueExtra , we're planning on having a  urlLink Bench press contest , with one division being the  urlLink least weight possible . So far, it'll be comprised of  urlLink James , Abbas, and I. I have the feeling that it's going to be really awesome.  hmmm... I'm almost done with  urlLink Angels  Demons  by  urlLink Dan Brown . The only thing that I can say is that it has the exact same twist that  urlLink The Da Vinci Code  dide.   I'm gunna go to bed now.  Y'all can lick my balls.  Kidding.
