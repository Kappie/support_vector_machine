This might be a good way of increasing my blogging frequency.   The jury is still out.  Anyways, I read an interesting newspaper article today on the reasons why the U.S. is going to war on Iraq, and the reasons why Canada wasn't enthusiastically supporting this war:  urlLink Jeffrey Simpson at the Globe  Mail .  Well worth a read.
