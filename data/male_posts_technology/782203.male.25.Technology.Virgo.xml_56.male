I-admin hasn't called me yet so I dun think I got the job, if i did they would have pretty much called me earlier i think. Hopefully i will get to see Harry Potter next week , two friends already said it was a pretty good movie.  Tried to watch the 2nd half of 2001 Space Odyssey but got way too sleepy , i dun think i will ever get the movie !  Arrgh totally forgot to watch Temptation Island, was so engrossed with Silence of the Lambs on Channel I that i forgot.
