But what distinguishes Visio from other prototyping tools is its use of layered backgrounds."

 Visio is my tool of choice for site maps and  urlLink wireframes , or anything I want to explain visually. I have used Illustrator, but it really isn't built for site mapping and prototyping unless that is the only tool you know. The drag and drop capabilities and custom stencils of Visio is what I like best. However, the one thing that bugs me most is I need more layers, instead of being limited to one layered background. Of course I would need to move to an Adobe product to get that functionality.
