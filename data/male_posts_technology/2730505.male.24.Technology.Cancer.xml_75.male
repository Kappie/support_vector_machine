So it started with me wanting Meghan to be able to drive my car comfortably and like a pro.  So before we went shopping for dinner, I wanted to have her drive around the apartment complex for a little while.  So we got in, got everything the way she needed it and everything was set.  I took the parking brake off so that we could get started.  I told her to let off the brake so we would roll forward and to a stop.  I was being stupid and didn't think that the ground right after the parking lot surface was wet and pure mud.  So we rolled and rolled so more until we hit the mud and I said okay, here we go, "let off the clutch slowly....blah blah blah"  Yeah, she was doing everything correctly until I realized that we were in the mud.  It sucked.  I didn't anticipate the damn mud to be that soft.  I didn't anticipate that we were going to get stuck.  We tried and had a few ideas but finally it was just Mark who was going to be the saving grace.  He came to help us out right away.  Fortunately he had a tow rope and a 4x4 SUV.  It had no problem towing my car out of the mud.  It was nice to see Mark again and I'm glad that he's not too wierded out by me and Meghan.  Thanks again Mark Pulver.  You saved the day.  Saturday was just a lazy day, as much as I wanted to do something, I really didn't because I could feel my gout starting to flare up and I didn't want that.  Besides wanting to see Meghan, I also didn't want to go to the St. Patty's Day parade because I would most undoubtedly drink me ass off and really kick up my gout and that wouldn't be cool at all.  We went and ate Japanese.  She ordered Suki Yuki (according to a very reliable source, it translates to 'meat liked by all' ooooo sounds dirty!) and I just had the sashimi combo.  It was good.  We went back and was lazy for a couple of hours, it was nice and relaxing.  Went back out to go drive around, watched Kung Pow! ('we're children, we're children') and then we finished of Memento, which was a good movie.  Retired around 4 am and wasted away till about 2 in the afternoon.  I feel all refreshed and everything.  Sunday afternoon consisted to Bell's Greek Pizza on M.A.C.  That was filling, afterwards we went to CVS and then back to her place for a little more laziness.  It was beautiful.  I started reading something that I honestly didn't think I would like Milan Kundera:  Book of Happiness and Forgetting, it was a good read.  I was then "ordered" to read Unbearable Lightness of Being.  That too was by Milan Kundera and was just as captivating.  I can't wait to finish the books that I started.  I guess I better get started on the one that Meghan let me borrow, it's in the car somewhere.  That was it, a nice relaxing weekend filled with movies and reading.  I can't remember the last time I had that much fun being lazy.  We also cooked breakfast for dinner.  That was different.  Pan cakes, eggs, maple sausage, bacon and cherry coke.    "Yummy, Yummy, Yummy in my Tummy" -J. Lo of Cartman's hand.  Woke up today without any problems (well except for some sore muscles), the drive was perfectly fine.  I was averaging 85-90 MPH all the way through Michigan and 75-85 MPH Indiana/Illinois.  Got to work 1/2 hour early.  Brand new week.  Moving out some stuff this week.  Saving the little things for the weekend.  Futon and shelving units with the computer table today, closet and clothes tomorrow.  Little things all through out the week and weekend.  Thankfully, Meghan will be in town to help me out.  That should be a good time.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is also showing this weekend.  That should be a good view.  It's probably going to be drinking at the new apartment this weekend along with some video games so if anyone wants to stop by, it's all good.  This work week has already started out busy and I hope this trend continues so that the weekend will come even faster.  Thanks baby, see you soon!  Here's a pic of the sunrise as I drove south on I-69 this morning.  It was a beatiful drive back.
