(Taken from  urlLink  Short Term Missions Workbook )  Wow...  It's been a great set of meetings with these students.  Are we ready?  Are we setting them up to be successful for these trips?  Will they come back with a missional attitude and worldview?  Will they understand more of the world and God's passion for it with and thru them?   I think so... and somehow I think little of it has to do with these meetings...
