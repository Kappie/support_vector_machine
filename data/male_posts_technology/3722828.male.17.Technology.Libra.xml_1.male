Nobody to offend, no groups to post on or member with.  A fresh start, so to speak.  Let me introduce myself. My name is Justin.  Justin N, for those who want a sort of formality.  Only good friends know my last name, and fewer know where I live.  Call it paranoia, but that's just how I am.  I'm a geek.  There, I said it.  So now that you know I'm a geek, you can leave if you like.  Your choice.  I build and repair computers.  What started as a hobby has now become my life.  And I wouldn't change it for the world.  I prefer doing this sort of thing, since it's like a big puzzle.  Only this puzzle happens to be hundreds of dollars or more of very sensitive pieces.  But I'm rambling on a tangent again.  Hate it when I do that.  I also play games.  I'm not biased to any particular console, also known as being a fanboi.  In fact, I own and play a PS2, Gamecube, Xbox, and Dreamcast, as well as some retro consoles.  The games make the console, not the other way around.  Anyways, I also play games on my PC.  I used to be a software pirate, but I gave that up long ago.  The thrill just kinda wore off, and I realised what I was doing was wrong.  But again, another tangent to blog about later.  Anyways, that's just my little introductory post.  I'll try to write at least weekly in this, to let my readers know what I'm up to.  Afterall, this is days in the life of a geek, right?  This is Justin, signing off.  Take care everyone.
