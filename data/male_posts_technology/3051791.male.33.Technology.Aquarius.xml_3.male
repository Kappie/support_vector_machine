After another annoying commute to work via Metro, including standing room only on the D6 bus, standing room only on the Red Line, and standing room only on the Orange Line from Metro Center to Ballston, I finally arrive at West Falls Church to meet the 425 bus to take me to my office. Mind you this is the same 425 that smashed into the bus terminal two days ago taking out a sign and cracking a window on the shed, not to mention the damage to the "kneeling" bus which from thereafter only knelt on the driver's side.  This morning, I walk sprightly out of the Metro station towards the 425/427 shed, soon joining the small throng of commuters already assembled. Along comes a bus, but the signboard has numerous burnt out lights such that it is unclear whether it is the 425 or the 427. However, I see a fellow commuter carrying a tote bag identical to those distributed by my comany, so I believe this to be the 425. I embark, and once we reach the bus transit station (where I note the unrepaired damage from the incident two days ago) and again leave it, I realize this bus is taking me anywhere but where I need to go. Oh well, I say, this is obviously the 427, so I will wait until it returns to the transit station and get off and wait for the 425. So, I ride around enjoying the spring scenery of Tyson's Corner (which consists of exactly 3 potted trees surrounded by a pavement casing, and about a billion cars) until we return to the transit station. I see another bus at the 425/427 shed and quickly ask for a transfer slip and inquire of the driver if that was indeed the 425, to which he replied in the affirmative.  With my best effort to recall my 800 meter sprint training from my days on the track team, I vault and bound across the parking lot yanking my laptop bag behind me in acrobatic feats that would make OJ Simpson's Hertz Rent-A-Car commercials look lame, only to arrive at the shed as the bus is pulling away. Undaunted, I run alongside banging furiously on the side of the bus, and the annoyed driver finally stops and opens the door a narrow crack for me to enter. I sit roughly down and try to ignore the "who is this idiot" stares of the other passengers. I prepare to ease back and catch my breath when I realise *this* bus is not taking me where I need to go either! I quicly beg of a neary passenger what bus this is and find out it is the 505 to Reston! Christ!  I yank the stop cord, and the driver, quite confused (there is no stop around here for this bus) pulls over at the next bus stop anyway, and without explanation, I disembark. The bus pulls off with its cadre of passengers staring at the moron who has twice now stopped their bus. I take my bearings and realize I am all the way across Tyson's Corner facing a heft walk no matter how you shake it. Fine. I light a cigarette and pound on the crosswalk button. It of course does not work, since pedestrians are not second, not third, but fourth class citizens in Tyson's Corner. Second Class citizenship is reserved for those motorists who drive automobiles with a sticker price of less than $50,000. Third class citizenship is reserved for mass transit commuters. I had just abandoned my right to claim third class citizenship and was now trudging along the dirt path (no sidewalk) that led along the 45 MPH, 4 lane "street" that leads to my workplace as a bona-fide 4th Class citizen. I arrive to work exactly 44 minutes late (I'd have been 10 minutes early if that had been the 425 bus originally). Once again, thanks Metro PD, thanks alot.
