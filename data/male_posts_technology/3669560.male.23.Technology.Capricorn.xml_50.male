I was thinking about the terror level, Burt in most of the country and Ernie in New York City and DC.  I was thinking about fear as a vehicle for recruiting conservatives.  Think about this. Why do we call Republicans "conservative"? Look at their platform. Legislating to ensure the survival of "traditional American values" and leaving the rest to big business. They want to conserve the way of life begun by our--predominately--Puritan forefathers. This is fine in itself. I like Jesus and his teachings. I think Jesus was a great guy.  I think Jesus, were he alive today, would be more inclusive with his love and respect than both the current Republican Administration and most of the groups who have devoted their lives to his worship (the Catholic Church as a whole, the Southern Baptists, et al). But that's kind of beside the point.  They have a conception of a country and of a culture they like. They feel these things are in jeopardy; they desperately want them to persevere unchanged.  Let's look at culture as a function of evolution. Cultures are fluid, this is an observation, not a partisan value judgment. They change, this is inevitable. Conservatives, by definition, are resistant to change. Republicans, as a party, are resistant to  cultural  change. They think our country is in danger of falling into a moral fissure. Certain others feel our country is struggling to climb its way out of that fissure. These are value judgments.  So culture. How does it change? More importantly, how does it change the fastest? I'm not going to cite sources or attempt to convince you, I've got a concert to get to. Cultures, in my opinion, change the fastest when imposed upon by outside cultures, this kind of synthesis is much better at evolving a culture than a culture left to its own devices. Realize that I'm not using evolution as a term of teleological movement. When something evolves, biology teaches us, it isn't "better" per se, it isn't moving towards perfection, it is merely changing.  Just as scientists propose a spike in the pace of biological evolutionary change when asexual reproduction gave way to sexual, the pace of cultural evolution speeds up when cultures are fused, or when people of divergent cultures integrate.  If you buy this idea, what then, is the most present danger the our cultural sovereignty faces? I submit it is influence from other, radically different cultures. Outsiders.  What is the best way stifle this? I think it's fear. Fear of the other. Xenophobia. When our nation's terrorism alert system is inextricably linked with a group of people, we send the message that outsiders are inherently dangerous, or at least suspicious, and to be avoided. Similar in its functionality is the doctrine of unilateralism pushed by this administration.  GWB said, "America will never seek a permission slip to defend it's sovereignty," or something to that effect. It's them against us,   all   of them.  How much hatred of the French has this caused? France, a country who has been our longtime ally. Now the French are selfish communists and a divisive global element only concerned with their own (evil) agenda and a thorn in the side of the peace-loving world. Just like the Terrorists (Islamists). The peace loving are made up of a curiously small number of countries: England, Canada, Australia, etc.  Hmmm.  The coalition of the willing is not only deeply tied to us economically, but  also very similarly composed culturally.  I'll probably add more depth to this later, but these are my thoughts and I have a concert to get to. Discuss amongst yourselves.  Photos (of the concert, not coalition) to (hopefully) follow.     Spellcheck works with Mozilla, now I really need to change my blog title. Strangely, blogger's spell check doesn't contain the word "blog".
