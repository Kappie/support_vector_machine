"When you have termites, you don't solve the problem by painting the porch."  Plus a  urlLink new column  on Dennis Miller - not that I care particularly about  that , but Mr Card raises one valid point leading up to his drubbing of Miller, that resonates with simple truth. He says :  "Folks, it's the first mark of fanaticism when you assume all your opponents are either stupid or immoral. "  Amen.
