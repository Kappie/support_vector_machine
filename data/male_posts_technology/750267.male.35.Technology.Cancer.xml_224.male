Imagine if Canada (alone) invaded Iraq instead of the United States/Britain? Saddam would still be in charge. Canada against the Taliban? Sadly, our troops are still being killed in Afghanistan and there hasn't been a war there for years.  I hope the next Prime Minister, Paul Martin, decides at some point to completely reform the military. First, the military needs a clear and well-defined purpose. Let's assume the purpose is international peacekeeping. That is, let's publicly declare that Canada will never be involved on the military aspects of invading a country (except in financial and logistical support). While we're at it, let's clearly define the situations in which we will act as peacekeepers (relatively stable country) versus those that we won't (a country with many active guerrilas/terrorists).  Once the purpose has been defined, let's create the appropriate military structure. Do we need 400+ generals? Or can we flatten the reporting hierarchy so that we're not so top-heavy? Do we need better military vehicles -- tanks, SUVs, planes, ships? Do we need updated technology -- radar, bullet-proof vests, camoflage? Do our troops need better training to handle deserts and mountains?  This all costs money, and takes time. But if our country had the nerve to do it, it would be worthwhile. Worthwhile in terms of troop morale, in terms of lives saved (both inside our military, and the citizens of the country we're protecting), in terms of making consistent and explainable decisions on what missions we will accept. We also have to know our limits, and stop trying to do things that we're not equiped for.  Maybe we don't need nuclear weapons so much as we need new ideas. The Canadian military, to me, is like a dying garden. It's time someone watered it, pulled out the weeds, and did some relandscaping.
