I think I may have been giving slightly the wrong impression of the situation with Gwen and me as a whole, through my rather emotional outlook on the whole thing. (Warning: arbitrary assertions to follow – standby for possible recall) :) As far as I can tell, Gwen does like me, but she’s just not sure of what to do with it… much as I am. The whole thing with her asking about dating another person is, in my opinion, completely justified at this point in our relationship. I just think that it surprised me and unnerved me a little when she brought up the question. Keep in mind, also, that these posts were from a viewpoint that has been suppressed for a while – it’s only natural, in an open forum, to give vent to the feelings that I cannot anywhere else. I may not be necessarily feeling as drastically as I am portraying (then again, I might...), but it makes it easier to figure out what I’m feeling myself, by putting my innermost thoughts into writing (and, ironically, laying them bare on a website for all to see).   Btw: on a side note, addressing Steven’s post today; You and Cori have known each other pretty well for almost exactly a year long than I have even known Gwen period. It’s kinda natural that you’d be more comfortable looking at a prospective relationship in the future… But, on the other hand, it seems like Gwen’s looking for a closer relationship sooner in life that Cori is (dating vs. courting), so, I really have no idea. Well, I guess I’ll leave you with that to think on for tonight. Sleep well~
