       
      This is what happened on Saturday:
about 7:00 am - Got up, did some early homework (I didn't have much)
Computer, morning cartoons
around 9:00 am - Got dressed and went out to breakfast at Highland Grill with my dad, had breakfast.
10:00 am - My SSC class started with Amit (really boring, stupid, long)
4:00 pm - FINALLY WAS OVER!!! Went home did some chores/jobs, practiced piano.
6:00 pm - Mindy came over and we watched National Security again (REALLY FUNNY MOVIE!) after we had dinner and played a bit
9:20 pm - Movie ended, hung out until bed time
10:00 pm - Mom/Dad came home. I quickly got in bed.

Well - there is my day! 5 hours was the stupid SSC TV show production class thing with Amit. (I DIDN'T LIKE IT VERY MUCH).

Tell ya more soon! :-)
