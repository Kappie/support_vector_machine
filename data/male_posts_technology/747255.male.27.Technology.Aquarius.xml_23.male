There is a quote in there from the fashion editor from Seventeen magazine touting the sex appeal of more modest clothing. Sort of a naughty librarian idea. This is an 11-year-old girl asking for more MODEST clothing. Something makes me think she wasn't looking for sex appeal in modest clothing; probably quite the opposite I'd imagine was on her mind. What business does a preteen girl have trying to be sexy anyway? None... that's Ella's point isn't it?
