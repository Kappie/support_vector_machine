The ddr machine was broken and I played magical drop, which was a hell of a time...  I came back at around 3:30.  I was looking for a rom for magical drop and failed. There aren't any on the net and kazaa has none. But mame supports it...so wierd.  I thought I would sleep until dinner so I fell asleep on my bed only to wake up at 10.  I ruined saturday...  Things I missed during the 5 hours of sleep: 1. Looking for emulators 2. Going on a DATE 3. Eating 4. Having any time to do anything.  Sry Shelby, Brando, and Leanna. I screwed
