Sun has created a new version of the software--code-named Alameda--that runs on any Java-enabled computer, said Peder Ulander, senior director of marketing for Sun's Desktop Solutions Group.   Interesting.  I was wondering who Karelia's "big company" was.  It seems like kind of an odd way to make an attack on the desktop, though I guess this is yet another XAML fighting move.  Still, rich client UI's could be a strong future, and Macromedia isn't the only game in town.  Personally, I prefer  urlLink Apple's take with dashboard  more myself.
