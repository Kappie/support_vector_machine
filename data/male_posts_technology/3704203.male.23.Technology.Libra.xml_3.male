For example, the CLEC in my town  urlLink Mediapolis Telephone Company , now offers dsl and has offered dail-up internet access independently for some time, they do not have a technically proficient enough staff to make sure that service levels of critical services, read:email and web browsing, are not interrupted continuously by the threat of virus traffic.  I understand that small CLECs have limitations, I just dont see how these limitations should cause degraded service problems for paying customers.  I think that if more local carriers who offer internet access would treat their services like a WAN environment, where security is important, a lot of the problems people have with email viruses constantly going around from local user to local user and as recently problems with worm invasion of the networks would go away.  But in the mean time, I am happy fixing the mess left behind by our incompetent telephone company- the more service calls the better!
