This surprised me immensly, normally Follies makes me want to kill myself because it gets too packed with Versace bound muscle boys and girls with egos the size of a small family saloon. It was mostly old-school dance and rave music which was okay, except if I here "Set you free" one more time i'll rip out the speaker cones with my teeth.  Custard and Mr. Speed left about quarter to two, and I left about ten past two and got invited to a party at the nurses flats near the hospital.  The rest i'm keeping for myself, but it involved and stethoscope not very much sleep!
