Instead of b, use strong, and em instead of i.   When you are including quotations, use the blockquote tag, instead of using align=center.   Whenever possible, give your post a title and avoid the apostrophe sign    Hope no one is inconvenienced by these suggestion, these are to improve your HTML skills and also have a semantic blog. If you want to know more on semantic, try googling.  I'll post my views on the last few posts later.
