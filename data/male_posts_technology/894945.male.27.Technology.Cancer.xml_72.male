Thanks for the link, I will post it tonight. However if it causes anyone to have cardiac arrest i'll send the cops your way.  Why don't you come over to Jersey for a holiday? We'll get the boys together and enjoy a sophisticated evening of stimulating conversation, no lighting farts or drinking games.. honest.. ;)  Adam
