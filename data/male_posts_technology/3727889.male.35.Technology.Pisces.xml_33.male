You check on 2-3, and flop a boat! You know you are on one of these super streaks when even the fish start folding any hand you are in. You are a shark like shadow causing them to scurry in all directions. All bow down to the mighty power of SIR!  There is no worse feeling than being on a super cold streak. A streak where nothing you do can go right. Your trips are trumped by higher trips, your quads by a straight flush. Has anyone ever had their straight flush trumped by a Royal Straight Flush? You bet your Rockets hard and crash and burn. The cowboys ride off in the sunset. The Hiltons suck off your pot. The Hookers bleed you dry. You start trying to make something with A-2 because nothing else is coming up. You start playing your cards really slow, which slows the bleeding, but does not stop it. You become scared of every hand you play. Even the fish are feeding on your dead sharky carcass. All come and feed on the mighty SIR!  I prefer the average nights. You have your “A” game going on. You make the right decisions. Figure out when to lay down, when to bet more. Your pile fluctuates a little, but steadily it starts climbing, and before you know it your walking away with a nice pot. All come and watch the game played the way it should be.
