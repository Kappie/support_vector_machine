Top pick would be Seattle, WA but the growth prospects for the particular IT niche that I belong to is not that great there.  If anything San Jose, CA would be a great number 2 (along with anything in CA; Sacramento, San Francisco-Oakland, San Diego) but I would pick San Jose just because it seems to pay better than the rest of the CA cities.  I wouldn't want to live anywhere that had snow.  It's just aggravating to drive in it to clear your car of it, your drive way.  It's something that I can do without.  Seattle isn't too hot, isn't too cold.  It's got a coast, mountains, forests, it's a growing city.  I think that is the biggest allure for moving there.  Take for example Chicago.  It's an old city.  It's established, not much more room for growth.  I want to be able to grow with a city, that's exciting.
