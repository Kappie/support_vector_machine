What are my short and long term goals?  What is the meaning of life at this moment?  How do I embrace life?  How do I embrace my life?  How do I embrace the future and the past?  How do I live in the present?  How do I be me?  Who am I?  Sometimes it's hard to fight the desire to commit suicide.  It's so inviting.  The end of everything.  Pain.  Grief.  Suffering.  Yeah, and happiness and joy and all that bullshit, too.  What keeps me going mostly is my kids.  That and I think that while things are dark and I'm in the pit right now, things will get better some day.  Maybe I'm just deluding myself, though.  I think a better alternative to suicide is drastic change.  Another alternative is a fantastic adventure.    Adventure is just one step away.
