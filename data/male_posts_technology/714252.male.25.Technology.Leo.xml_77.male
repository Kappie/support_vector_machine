Have a look at  urlLink WilliamShatner.com - The Official William Shatner Website   From the main page: Hot Topic: Are there any Star Trek quotes that you find yourself using in everyday speech? I'm tempted to say "Engage!" whenever my daughter starts the car!  AND for a video called Mind Meld: Bill Shatner and Leonard Nimoy boldly go where neither man has gone before. This is the video that StarTrek.com calls "a strikingly candid conversation between two cultural icons."   This site is just hilarious
