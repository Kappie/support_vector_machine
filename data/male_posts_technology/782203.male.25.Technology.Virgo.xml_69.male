Would have loved to see more of Anthony Hopkins though i think he was rather underused.Oh ya Jiaqi and Yeh Li forgot to pay me for the movie tickets and i also paiseh to ask them for it....Cos i didnt wanna seem too money minded mah ...  Oh ya why are women late for dates/outings so often, its so irritating, Jiaqi and Yeh Li were more than half and hour late ! They should have at least given me an expected time of arrival so at least i would have an idea what time they will reach.   After that we went to Youth Park to see a couple of local bands perform in this band competition. A couple of bands were pretty good, and i really enjoyed their performances but the rest of them were average. And i did come away with a poster of the Foo Fighters they were giving those away. Left around 7pm cos Yeh Li and Jiaqi wanted to go back and i didn' wanna really stay there by myself kinda sian also.
