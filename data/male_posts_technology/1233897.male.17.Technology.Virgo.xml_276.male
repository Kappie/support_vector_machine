I need to buckle down and get like, a week's worth of schoolwork done ahead of time too, before the 26th when I'm *hopefully* going to Vegas with Cam and Andrew for 10 days. ... That will be soooo fun if only it would work... My parents are fine with it, but Cam's sister Char (whose house we're going to be staying in, and whose kid Cam's going to be babysitting while we're there) is acting badly about it. I'm kinda confused cause she's fine with another person coming with Cam (Andrew already got the ticket like, two weeks ago), but she seems to be baulking at two people. Kinda annoying since I thought up the idea in the first place. (lol) Whatever...  Winter Banquette's this week... I wonder how that will go... I think I'm having a small party at my house afterward. (Well, I know I am having a party, the only thing about it that I don't know is how 'small' it'll be.
