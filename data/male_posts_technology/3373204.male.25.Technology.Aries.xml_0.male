I use the word ‘emotion’ loosely here, because the act or feeling of jealousy is really a complex combination of many elemental emotions- primarily fear, anger, loss, the need to be validated, the need for attention, and so on.   There are so many theories as to the roots of the matter, and all valid in their own rights, that it’s hard to focus on just one or two. However, in this post, I have decided to stay within my own experiences, and elaborate on two theories- historical and developmental.   The first talks about how insecurity within a relationship is, to a certain extent, built into our psyche from the get-go. From a female point of view, since males can procreate with any number of partners, and at a much higher rate simply by inseminating multiple females, while women can procreate only a certain amount of times, and with only one partner at a time, they have much more invested in their offspring. Hence, they are keener on keeping track on whither and when their chosen partners stray, and have an active interest in keeping that straying to a minimum.   In the case of the male of the species, since they can not procreate on their own, rely on the females to do so on their behalf, the threat of the genetic bond between a father and his offspring is by definition, doubtful because of the female’s ability to have extra-dyadic relationships. Neither gender is so strongly bonded to the other without the volatile concept of ‘love’, that there is no possibility of doubt in the relationship.  Another train of thought explores how infants, particularly those with a high level of imagination and hyperactivity are prone to disregarding the possibility that their caretakers have a life outside of the relationship shared between them. The children that, as they mature, realize that their guardians have relationships, interests and activities in their lives that are completely removed from their wards, usually tend to be less insecure through adolescence and adulthood. However, those that can’t accept that fact, tend to surround themselves in these fantasies wherein the child is singularly important to the caretaker, and most often, in cases where the caretaker tolerates these fantasies, as the child matures, these fantasies not only grow in intensity, but they are also transferred to others in his/her range of vision. Here, the child goes to the extreme of attempting to destroy the connections and thoughts of the caretaker that do not pertain to the child and its interests.   The extreme of this phenomenon leads to the child (and the adult) becoming unable to make the distinction between attacking the ideas of those it cares about having outside relationships and interests, and attacking the subject of its jealousy.   Another reaction that the subject has when affected in this manner is the development of a strong vigilance in monitoring their partner’s behaviour, their actions and interactions. Stemming from their own feelings of inadequacy, fear of rejection and abandonment, they tend to take a more than healthy interest in the comings and goings of their partners, believing that the partner should be responsible to them in all respects of their existence. No action should be taken that is perceived as unnecessary or ‘wrong’ in their eyes of the subject. This is especially important when it comes to outside relationships between the partner and those of the opposite sex. The subject translates all their feelings into the conviction that the partner (or the friends) are sexually attracted (to their partner), and are actively making advances on them in their (the subject’s) absence.   In my own experience, the second theory holds true. In a fit of bad judgment, I spent a fairly large portion of time pandering to what I knew were unhealthy and unreasonable requests by this person I was involved with, and ended up losing a lot more than I had gained from the relationship. Receiving neither comfort nor support through that period of my life, I found myself constantly having to explain my actions to this man, having to give up on external relationships that meant a lot to me, and at the same time, watching as every request granted turn into another, more unreasonable one. The tendency toward violence was present also, and though never brought to fruition, was a definite threat, and ultimately what ended the relationship.   Upon discussion with a psychologist (namely, my mother) I found that this problem of insecurity was caused in a large part by his feelings of inadequacy, that he felt that he was unable to be loved, appreciated or admired. He would go out of his way to point out his fallacies, and then demand to know whether I still loved him. Eventually, I realized I didn’t. Entirely too much of his own life and how he looked at himself was dependent on how much I was willing to give up for him, it almost got to a point where if I wasn’t willing to give in, then the relationship wasn’t working, or there was something wrong with me, which lead to the conclusion that I must be cheating on him somehow.   What is possibly the most discouraging fact is that these issues are most often so deeply indoctrinated within a person’s psyche, that it is virtually impossible to conquer them. Most people live their entire lives in this manner, and their partners (especially those that don’t have this problem) have a hell of a time dealing with it. The same fights will happen, and more so in a long term relationship, the more secure of the duo will end up sacrificing relationships and external interests in order to keep the peace.  The more insecure of the pair, possibly due to these problems, tends to be the more aggressive of the two, and the cycle continues- where at first it was the caretaker pandering to the child’s fantasies, now it is the partner. The problem is that, especially in Indian households, where the woman is still to be the submissive of the two, an insecure male dominates her life, and since she is expected to acquiesce, her life becomes meaningless outside of serving him and his needs. There is no way to break this cycle however, without extensive counseling, and frankly, I’m yet to encounter someone taking themselves to a shrink to get over being jealous, at least of their own accord.   As for me, I’m just beyond relieved that I’m not in one of those situations any more, and as wonderful and philanthropic the idea of 'saving' or 'helping' someone is, I ain't got the patience.
