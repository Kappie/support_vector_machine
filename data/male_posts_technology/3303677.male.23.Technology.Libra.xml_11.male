All that needs to happen is for time to reverse and we all have to re-live Tuesday and Monday all over again. I take comfort that the universal laws of physics are harder to break than that. One of these days I will get up the nerve to do what I have been wanting to do. It is a good thing I am not trying to alter the course of time otherwise I might never get up the nerve.
