I actually didn't have much time to begin with so when I sat down I was amazed that I came very close to a final master to one of the songs as fast as I did. Hopefully the rest of the songs will go as fast as this one, but quality comes first. I don't want to rush things. Here are a couple of photos from today's session.                  The weekend definitely went by very fast this time. Mostly it's my fault for being out too late at bars and parties, but I only live once so whatever. Stay tuned for more cool news on the new Third Rail songs.
