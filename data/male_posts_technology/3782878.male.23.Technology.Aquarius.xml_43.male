She will post her thoughts as they come to her as well. This way not everything has to come out of my mouth :P Welcome SammyCaine, let's get blogging.   Anyway, SammyCaine had most of the adventures last night, she hooked up with an old buddy and went to a bar, she'll probably tell you about that. I had a long day at work yesterday, but a lot of it I spent blogging and surfing, which goes to show just how slow my work place is. I came home, cleaned the house for the arrival of Sammy's friend, and he never showed, then I got on Everquest, made 899 platinum last night helping me break 1k of plat for the first time. I then did some tradeskilling, making smoker's to boost my pottery skill high enough to make prismatic dye's for Sammy's characters.   When Sammy came back, we decided to play our lowbie characters, so I played my necro, which was fun, I played the necro because our regular mage was not playing that night, and the necro has a skeleton that is highly useful in combat when you don't have anyone to tank(take hits) for you.   Ended the night with a pull of 3 giant badger things known as burnies, which almost wiped the whole group. I knew then that it was time to camp for the night. Snuggled in with Sammy for the night, talked about the usual stuff, and went to bed.  Try not to feed the stupid people Phoenix
