Google claims that the search results, atleast the first page of results would be  tainted  with preferences I had mentioned in google.  urlLink This  link will give you more details. I have selected few interests which you might have by now gathered if you're one of the bunch of people (wanted to say handful, but who knows who) visits this blog once in a while. Do let me know if the results you find are really tainted :)
