No trust me I am not filial or anything, my mom made me sign a legally binding document as soon as I turned 18 which states that I have to give her a 1/4 of my salary every month. But she was kind enough to add a clause that allows me to pay only 5 percent in the unlikely event that I suffer loss of any of my limbs or am declared clinically insane. Sniff... there is nothing purer than a mother's love is there ? I love you Mom !  Just to clarify I got paid 2 months salary hor. Heh 4k a month? I wish !!
