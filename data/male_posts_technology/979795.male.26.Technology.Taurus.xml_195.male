It's an indoor climbing centre (Rockface - www.rockface.co.uk) in town. I've got to admit, it was scary for me. But there was a certain thrill and adrenaline rush to it as well. I have a great fear of falling even thought I was very well secured with the rope. Last week, I went for my second try. I think I've gotten worse at it. But I'd really like to go again, juz to get over the fear of falling.  It was a bit depressing to know that the girls (some of my friends before me) actually climbed better than I did. No lah, of coz I know I'm not competing against them lah and I won't rush it either. But I think maybe it's kinda a guy thing. But I hope that's not going to stop me. Gonna try. Well if schedule permits, I might take it up back in S'pore too. We'll wait and see.  Term starts next Mon. Argyh!! So much work I need to do. On the other hand, it also means Aikido class is starting soon. And I'm still thinking of joining swimfit in school to refine my swim techniques. Sigh so much to do and so little time. I'll see how things goes, might just stick to Aikido. Still my strongest passion so far.  Talking about Aikido, heard that Jesse might be stopping Aikido. Might not be true, but it'll be a real pity if he does. He's got a natural talent for it. Sigh, wish I'm half as good as him. Can't even get my ukemi right. I hope I can train and improve my ukemi under Sensei Pauline this term. Gotta work harder.
