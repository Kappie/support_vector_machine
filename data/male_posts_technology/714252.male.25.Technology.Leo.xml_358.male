There was always a few friends that I knew read my blog but in the last week loads of random people have started reading it (Hi Krista :D Everyone go read her blog: http://krista-rant.blogspot.com/ )  So now here comes the pressure. I'm no Silver Tongued  Alvin T. Grey , all I know is random useless facts and of course how to search for weird things online (It's my own personal hobby, like this search for aardvark related riddles:  urlLink Click Here )  I do occasionally blog about the most inappropriate things, but hey who doesn't so nothing strange there. (Like the  urlLink Aardvark Porn Video Store . Noticing a theme today??)   urlLink This is quite a funky aardvark site..   Anyway, I suppose I better write something about my day really.. I'm afraid today was a bit boring really, This morning was a pain in the ass work morning, Wayne went onsite to a customer where we spent 3 hours going round in circles trying to get their net connection when suddenly it just started working again when we put it back to the original settings that had stopped working in the first place, I hate it when that happens..  Then this afternoon I actually had a really good work meeting, met a guy who will probably start selling our techie services to his customers which is a HUGE help.  Now I just need to put together a few quotes for customers and things will be flying!  Now what.. Hmmmmm, No, think that is about all I can say.. If I think of anything really interesting I'll make sure to post it here.  hehe
