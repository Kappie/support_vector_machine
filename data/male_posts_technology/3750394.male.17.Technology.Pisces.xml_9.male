It was my client saying I cannot come and install his new computer until next Monday, cause he forgot he was busy, which sux, cause I was up until 3:30 in the morning configuring Windows XP Pro for him :@. O well, I'm gonna have to wait for money until then, but I should have at least one small computer job I can do until then to get me some money.  Eric
