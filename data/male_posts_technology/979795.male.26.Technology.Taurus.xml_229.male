I don't understand it, it sure looks like I don't practice enough tact when I'm talking to her because the same thing seems to be happening over and over again. But it's weird because we're quite alright friends in the house.  Basically 2 days back, I had pointed out that she tends to forget to clear up some of her stuff and it was becoming a sort of a habit. I wasn't really nasty about it. Her bf did mention something as well. Maybe she felt we were picking on her so she kinda just lost her temperjust a little because you could see her face turning red and her pitch increasing. Well, I have to admit we weren't picking on her lah. It was meant more as a joke and a reminder. But I was very surprised that she got the impression of "why she's the only one being reminded instead of the other people who've been doing it as well". She has a small point to this, but the way I see it, when a problem comes up, it's natural for me to approach the people I feel closer to as I think that together we can help to make things better. I'm thinking she feels picked on lah basically. But I honestly don't feel that I've said anything or outstepped my boundary. I'm sorry about whatever unpleasantness there might be but I really don't see an apology coming from me over this matter. I don't think she's taking my intentions the right way as I wasn't trying to make her the scapegoat for anything. Past 2 days, I noted that she's always making statements like "I'm going to use this particular cup, instead of xxx" => personal cup => can wash at personal convenience, or "OK, you said you'd wash it. I didn't force you to do it huh" ... Sigh ....    Granted, we're all imperfect and forgetful at times. I also tend to forget to do things like clearing up after I'm done. I'm grateful for the next person who comes along and does it for me (which may / may not be all too often), but I really don't think that the next person should clear up after me if they feel that they are being taken advantaged of. There's nothing wrong to just leave the old dishes wherever and just point out to people that they've overlooked clearing up. It's a good reminder, ONLY if you don't get too nasty about how you 'remind' them.  This incident brings to mind the situation we had (have??) at the BV dojo. Where people tend to just leave and not keep all the mats. In an ideal world, if everyone just kept one, it would make things so easy. But as things turn out, the world isn't a fair place. The sooner we accept that the easier we can proceed with doing our job.  It's alright to NOT do some stuff, just don't be too difficult about it. In contradiction, don't push others too far by taking advantage of them, if we just opened our eyes a bit now and then, we may realise that there are rubbish or dishes that disappear even though we never seem to clear them daily.  Also realise 1 final point. I appreaciate what some people have been doin for me in an invisible sense, maybe it's high time I showed some form of appreciation instead of keeping quiet about it.
