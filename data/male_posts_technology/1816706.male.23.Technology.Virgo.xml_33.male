Hope everyone has been able to get a chance to check out the pics - Kauai was spectacular - an absolute blast - I would love to stay there longer, but it's easy enough to get over there from here, and all the work is on Oahu.  Speaking of, I came back for an interview with Inets - www.inets.com and on Wednesday, they offered me the position.  My official title is Level II Tech Support Engineer.  Basically this company has a whole bunch of other clients, banks, clothing, etc.  And I will go to their clients and fix whatever they need fixed.  It should be a good job to meet people, see some more of the island, learn some more about the island, plus I should get the chance to do some inner island travel for work also which will be cool.  I start Monday at 8am.  Also had Halloween last night - a huge thing in Hawaii.  On Maui, in the main tourist town of Lahina, they say that Halloween is the Mardi Gras of the South Pacific, expecting 35,000 people this year.  It was pretty crowded down here on Waikiki too though.  Did a little bit of drinking and then hung out in the streets and checked out peoples costumes and stuff, put a new section with some haloween pics on the site too, so check those out.  It was a good time... as usual.  One last note.  A couple of people have said to me recently when asking how Hawaii is - "You are so lucky".  IT'S NOT LUCK!  Just get off your ass and do it.  My dad gave me an article to read shortly before I left about this couple driving from somewhere in South America up to Alaska in a piece of shit car and not a whole lot of money.  What they said is right on the head, "the hardest part is just starting."  It's easy to do, it the best thing that I have done.  Whether I am here for another year, or 10, it's where I wanted to be, where I love being, and it wasn't that hard to do.  People have come out here with nothing and done something.  You don't have to go to Hawaii - if your dream is to live in Australia, or Europe, or Montana, get up and just do it.  You won't regret one step I promise.
