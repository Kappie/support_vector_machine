But my superiors there were really friendly; there is this ang moh guy (Appie) who is like goofing around all the time, he is such a riot ! The others are very friendly also and I think I am gonna enjoy working with them. Gonna go back on Friday cos Thursday i will be going for the scan on my enlarged heart....
