The music wasn't exactly my type, for the most part, but i thought grits rocked, and so did pillar, and 12 stones. skillet kina bored me...and i can't remember the name of the first band for the life of me. It was rockable though. So, i did. I rocked. I jumped around. I got in a mosh. So, tomorrow, if i come to school looking like a zombie, you will all know why.
