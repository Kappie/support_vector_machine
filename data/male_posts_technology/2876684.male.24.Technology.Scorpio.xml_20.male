How does 300 pushups during a fitness class sound to everyone? I know, it's sick. Trust me, it wasn't voluntary. Anyways, I'm glad that my weight has dropped to a consistent 76.5kg now but that is probably more due to the fact that I've changed my eating habits somewhat.  Now to work on building some muscle...
