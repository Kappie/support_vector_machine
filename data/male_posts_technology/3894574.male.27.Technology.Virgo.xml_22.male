We bought a dining room set 3 months ago that is supposed to be our anniversary gift to one another, and we're saving money up to spend on a cruise in October, but it still seems like I shoud have something planned. I'd love to sweep her off her feet and wisk her away for a romantic weekend stay in a cottage somewhere.  I read online that the traditional gifts for this anniversary are iron and sugar.  Suggestions welcome.
