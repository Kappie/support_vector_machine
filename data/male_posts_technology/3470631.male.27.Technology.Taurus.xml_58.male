Anyway, I picked up the Qdog from the Norwood train station and we made our way down to Great Woods - parking next to the hottest girl we had both seen in quite some time. She told us the guy she was at the show with was NOT her boyfriend so we both thought she was ready to party. She got weird after the show thoughtasdl;f sorry. I love the after-show scene - for the diehards only.   Some random highlights of the night:   Cusick interogating the girl who does the between innings Sweeper routine at Fenway Park - she was amazing!   Cusick bringing beers to the aforementioned hot chick up on the lawn l;aksdfj don't ask.  We ran into John Markunas - he's running a Baggataway store and had a tighty 21 year old girlfriend - I slapped him high five over that.   Cusick and I debating on whether or not to go to a strip club when it was only open for another 30 minutes.  Cusick and I going to Squire's Gentlemen's club in Revere ;lkajdsf at 1:35am.   Cusick disappearing into the private dances room for the remaining 20 minutes of the night.  Cusick passing out on the couch.  Seeing Cusick passed out with an informercial blaring on TV at 335 am.   What a night.
