Regarding the walls in your house, do you prefer neutral colors or bright colors?  My personal preference would be bright colors (with the exception of the bedroom and bathrooms) -- as with many projects around this house, the status of painting the south wall of the 'studio' purple is officially PENDING...   3. When hanging pictures on your walls, do you like things symmetric or asymmetric?  I tend to start with a goal of symmetry and eventually settle for something along the lines of a Zen-like asymmetrical 'symmetry' (if that makes any sense this time of the night...)   4. How about where you'd like to live; country or city?  I kinda like living on the fuzzy DMZ betwixt the two, meself: handy access to late-night Taco Bell without the worst of the rush hour congestion...   5. Your blog; Blogger, Blogdrive, Blog-City, or another one altogether?  Been on Blogger since Day One of my blogging career -- not so much out of brand loyalty as sheer laziness and cheepnez, but still...   6. Email; Yahoo, Hotmail, Gmail, or other?  2 Yahoos, 1 Gmail and 1 other -- my first Yahoo email is more and more just a repository for spammage these days, but I still use that one whenever I'm required to give an address for comments or such...   7. Air conditioning or just a fan when it's hot at night?  I  *loathe*  having fans on at night, particularly if they're pointed anywhere near me (tends to fire up the nasal passages rather fiercely) -- if  absolutely  necessary, I leave the AC on, but it's rarely for my benefit (usually because She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed decrees it...)   8. Dinner; seafood or steak?  Out of those options: 1st choice, breaded shrimp; 2nd choice, chopped steak; 3rd choice, breaded fish patty square thingamajigs -- given J's aversion to all forms of seafood (and most non-poultry meats), not standard options at home...   9. Your all-time favorite music media; CD's, cassette tapes, or vinyl (or 8-tracks)?  I think I've finally come to like CD's best for the flexibility of programming the CD player around songs-I-can't-stand (although I still miss the interesting effect when an 8-track would start to break down and simultaneously play two sequences of songs at the same time; or the ability to manipulate the playback speed of a turntable so that a Beatles album could be slowed down into something sounding like The Jesus and Mary Chain on barbituates, or a Stevie Wonder ballad sped up into a hyperkinetic Chipmunk...)    10. When learning a new software program, do you find it easier to follow a book or an online tutorial?  This old man, he reads the book (often again and again and again...)
