It's fittingly quite surreal with lots of morphing objects, flashing backgrounds and other graphical effects. It's almost like a demo. Maybe that's because it is by  urlLink Melon Dezign . If you didn't own an Amiga you may not have heard of this crew but they did some lovely little intros.  It seems they even do web design now and their  urlLink design site  has some more nice flash anims including a very good version of  urlLink I Feel Fine    via  urlLink linkfilter
