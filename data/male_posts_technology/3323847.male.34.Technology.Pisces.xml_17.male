Turns out a tornado touched down just north of us.  Luckily, it was a short-lived and very weak one.  Wisconsin hasn't got it as bad as some, but I'm about ready for the rain to stop.  With reports of more severe weather on it's way (which is pretty obvious at this point if you look at any Doppler map), I don't think my wishes will come true any time soon.  Let's just hope I don't hear the severe weather siren again tonight.
