Yup!! ... a domain name for myself!! ;-)  Being a Libran has its advantages... lots of them!!  (and am I glad for them!!) . But it does have one disadvantage too! I can be notoriously indecisive at times. And now is one of those times, it seems!! :-|  I have to decide what kind of domain I should buy...   i.e.   .com  or  .org  or  .net  or  .name  or  .in   The next decision would be... what domain-name should I choose. Some help required here!!... :-)  Right now, I have one in mind...  super-sam   (because,  supersam  has already been taken!!) . But I feel,  super-sam  is too plain!! ;-)  So... I cry out for help!    H  E  L  P ! ! ! ! !
