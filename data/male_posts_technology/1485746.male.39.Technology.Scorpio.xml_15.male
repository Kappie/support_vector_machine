It is one of the few titles that I am really looking forward to.  I don't know if I will pick it up right away, though.  I think I will monitor the reviews first.  Phobos22 was jonesin' for Driv3r - I had to warn him off.  Whew!  That was a close one.  Few things at this point are worse than wasting good money on a bad game.
