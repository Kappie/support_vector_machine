I've worked way too many hours this week, not only quantity, but the issues I've had to deal with have taken a toll.  I joined conference call this morning and just went off.  Not good, this is not the way we attract people to who we say our God is...  Ok, I'm going to go back to the call and be a lot nicer.  Maybe I'll even try to be helpful.
