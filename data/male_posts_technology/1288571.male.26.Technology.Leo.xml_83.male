I've formatted my computer and now the ones from Windows Update aren't there anymore! It's the suckiest thing that ever sucked!!!  Soooo... if anyone out there has a Logitech ClickSmart 510 webcam, and they managed to download and archive the drivers from Windows Update, please do contact me. I would very much like them!  Thanks!
