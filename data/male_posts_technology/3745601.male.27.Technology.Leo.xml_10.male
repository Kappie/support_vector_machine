First, I've a topic that I found interesting.  urlLink Gator  has a post about men getting women's phone number. She feels that we view the number as the trophy. While I can understand her angst at not being called by the young gentleman, I would like to attempt a rebuttal.    Asking for a number isn't like a trophy. The trophy comes when you actually get a working number and not Taco Bell. The problem is that most girls don't have the guts to tell a guy that she isn't interested in him. This leads to mixed signals. You gentlemen out there can will have no problem agreeing with me when I say that the less mixed signals that a girl gives you the better. Ladies, it's not like men are known for their perception; nor their understanding of the opposite sex. So in this scenario, she is shady with him. Now, instead of just being rejected, he has been duped. You've doubled the pain. I normally weigh the signalsthe girl was giving. I base my decision to call the number she gave me on  if  she seemed interested. I still get the occasional number of a friend or a restaurant. This comes with the territory.       My Life     I forgot to call my sister and my brother on their birthdays. They were born one year and two days apart. What really stinks is that I had been looking forward to calling them. I let life get into the way and didn't set my priorities right. I would have completely forgotten had I not received an e-mail from my step-mother. So long story short, I need to get up a couple hours early tomorrow and call my brother and my sister.     My mom called me day before yesterday. She hadn't heard from me in a couple weeks and was missing me. As you can tell I have been dropping the ball on my family. I think this is something I need to work on.
