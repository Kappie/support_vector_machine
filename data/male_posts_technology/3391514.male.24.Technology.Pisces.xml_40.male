More usefully, I was finally able to type up some stuff for the oft-mentioned  Mage  game, and also play a little  Fallout 2 .   Also tried out  Space Taxi 2  and  Stick Soldiers II ... a pair of shareware demos. They're on this months PC Gamer in case anyone cares, and are quite decent.  Anyone noticed it yet?
