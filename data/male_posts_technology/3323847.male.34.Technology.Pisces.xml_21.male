I can easily to sit back and say "I'd trade 7 months of my life for a smooth death experience" when conceivably I'm nowhere near the end of my life.  My tune may be very different when actually approaching the end of my trip on this big blue ball.  Two things I've observed over the years are: 1) You're never really 100% certain how you will react to a situation until you are  in  said situation, and 2) When it comes to actually  facing  one's demise, humans, more often than not, cling to whatever hope there may be to remaining above-ground as long as possible, no matter how irrational the reasons may (or may not) be.  Now, if these 104 people surveyed are actually coming close to facing that final goodbye, then nevermind.  I, however, suspect that's not the case here.
