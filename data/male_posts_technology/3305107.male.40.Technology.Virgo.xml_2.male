As this is my first time, I am naturally a little apprehensive, but excited to see how it all works. I am the CEO of a small company with 16 employees, and aside from needing support from time to time, I just need to vent a little too. This morning starts off with a managers meeting to come up with a solution to replace a customer service rep. We want to promote from within, and have a great candidate, but he is doing a great job where he is and his manager doesn't want to lose him. Because pulling the candidate from where he is will cause more problems in the short term, we have decided to fill the csr position temporarily with someone from another dept who knows that job, and she can train our candidate as he is doing his regular duties. Now we need to find another entry level person to train so that we can promote our candidate into the csr area. I am thinking about how to get the right person in the right job with the least amount of disruption to our customers.
