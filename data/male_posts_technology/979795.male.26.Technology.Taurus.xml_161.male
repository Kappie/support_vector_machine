It is something that Warriors after hundreds and hundreds of years of dedicated endeavors, of life and death situations, have finally figured out that there is a point of least resistance, and that there is something that works beyond strength...physical strength. It is 'Ki', its attitude and its adept movements that seem to go beyond force, and that a lot of times using strength is completely secondary to learning a way. A kind of moving without resistance, a non-resistant movement, a relaxed movement. So you have to unlearn in order to learn. It does take longer."   -- Steven Seagal, 7th dan, Shihan, Shinto priest
