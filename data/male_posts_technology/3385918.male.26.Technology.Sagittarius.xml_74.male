It's been a crazy month, which is why I have neglected my blog during this time.  Okay, intro to the show is cut by HHH who pops in and screams: "I'm stopping this program". And, of course, the intro stops abruptly. This is so stupid. I would expect this silly stunt from a kiddy program, but not the WWE.  Anyway, HHH talks and nobody listens... well, except the "captive" live audience who can't do jack about it but listen or go to the concession stand (like normal people often do during the Diva contest).  Regal interrupt and gives HHH a verbal bashing which gets a cool reaction from the audience. Damn, I really like William Regal.  A match is set up for later between the two.  Next, a Diva gets cut. Boring !!!  To be fair, I'll admit that I am curious of who will win, but I would rather the selections would be shown someplace else.  Here is my short impression of the finalists for the Diva contest...  Michelle McCool - Didn't impress me  Christy Hemme - Okay, this firery read head has got my vote for sure. She really seems like she likes being there. She has the look, the moves and the style. This girl IS RAW material. The way she talks and moves. This girl looks like someone who will be willing to give 100% as a Diva and probably will do anything that the WWE asks of her. Perfect!!!  Maria Kanellis - This one is cute. Didn't impress me before, but shy looked great in a bikini.  Tracie Wright - This girl is pretty and hot in a bikini, but she has no style and doesn't know how to get the audience pumped up. Not Raw Material.  Carmella DeCesare - Okay, she is gorgeous, but this woman does not want to be here. Look for awkward and uncomfortable she looks. She just waves and smiles. This girl looks like a model and I'm sure she has the preparation and intelligence to know that this shit isn't forth it. Not even for the money she is being offered. It's obvious she is sabotaging herself by not giving 100% or showing any spunk. Would be extremely funny if she wins. What will the WWE do then? Would be the ultimate fan rebellion for having to put up with this shit.  Chandra Costello - What a bimbo!!! Oh my God !!! Please someone guy this girl a clue. Damn, I even feel sorry for her. It's not enough that all the girls are being exploited on national TV, but this girl is coming off as such a retard. Damn !!!  Amy Weber - Is cute and apparently, judging by the crown reaction, a favorite. Could be something.  Joy Giovanni - Wow, what a body. Could be something too.  Anyway, I'm at the voting both section of the WWE web. My vote goes to...  Christy Hemme  Anyway, back to the show.   Rhyno  Tajiri defeat La Resistance (non-title match)  Rhyno  Tajiri... I like this team. The crowd loves this team. It's not a comedy team. This is the real deal. Real wrestlers that have chemistry together. While I am not convinced that this is the best way of using both wrestlers, I am glad that they are getting TV time, especially Rhyno who I thought would be totally castaway to RAW Heat and never be seen on Monday night.  Good, short match.   Tyson Tomko (with Trish Stratus) def. Rosey (with Stacy Keibler)  Boring !!! The only good thing about this match was Stacy Keibler. I mean, look at Tomko's offense. Pushing. How the fuck did this guy get here? Rosey's credibility is shot. I liked him as part of the tag team Three Minute Warning. After the other fat dude got canned from the WWE, this guy's career has gone down the crapper.  Bad ending. Crowd killing match. Hope this doesn't become a feud.   William Regal def. Triple H (DQ)  Well, it was short. Would have liked an actual match. God knows, Regal can take it. It's starts as a brawl in the top part of the ramp, goes to the ring, HHH uses brass knucks, pulls out the sledge hammer. End of story. Too bad, I was really looking forward to this.  And so, we get HHH VS Eugene for Summer Slam. Which means that Eugene's push is about to end. What happens when HHH beats you on a PPV. Yep, you guest it. Midcard hell !!! Eugene will be joining the ranks of Booker T, RVD and Steiner (who won't be joining us any time soon).   Kane def. Maven  I actually didn't see this. I had to take out the trash and ended up talking a long while with the security guard of my complex. It was a good conversation. Much more interesting than this shit. It's funny cause when I came back to the TV. I was upset because I thought that I had actually missed something important.   Evolution def. Chris Benoit, Edge and Chris Jericho  Okay, Jericho was on fire tonight. Also, funny how much Ric Flair got used much more than the rest of the guys. This was really Flair and Jericho's show.  Good match, except for the ending. Come on, WWE, Benoit can't be that weak !!!  Well, that's the show. The only thing I didn't mention was Jericho's Highlight Reel where we saw the start of Edge's unnecessary heel turn. Think about it, why would we need Edge as a heel? Then again, why would we need Randy Orton as a face? (Yep, the WWE is planning to turn him face so he can feud with HHH... doh!)  Also, Kane VS Hardy... Again? Winner marries Lita? Oh, fuck that! Didn't Matt need Knee surgery?  Anyway, ok show, not great. I've seen better. Much better. I will give this one a C +. At least the buildup for Summer Slam was good. Don't know if the card is as good as it should be. All I know is... Eddie Guerrero VS Kurt Angle... enough said.   urlLink Sailor Ecchi
