I can only remember stupid flashes of the night which include: Sucking on the midge burrtang table...smoking multiple blunts in multiple locations...seeing mike davis covering his bald head in a hat completely wasted...tackling yast, falling through a chair and getting flagged @ 8...getting stoned and listening to swansonite playing...drunk driving with yastine into the heart of trenton and back (and we DO NOT know how)...passing out at autumn...getting cheered on for chugging water...  WHEW what a night.  smashey out
