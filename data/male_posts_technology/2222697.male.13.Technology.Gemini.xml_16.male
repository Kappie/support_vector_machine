It has no comparison, and thats what we decided to do instead of going to the Football game.  Ok lets start from the begining....After harry left my house after my last post I left it up to his family to figure out what to do. He called me and we agreed to go see Matrix III. So we get our tickets with his season pass and his dad goes and gets seats. So when his mom is looking for our other friend (Ryan) we try to get in THEY WONT LET US we're freaking VIP'S and the faggot that was going to rip our tickets said we couldnt pass so we got his mom, and we were going to yell at him and probly say "cant you take a joke moron" because harry said he was 17. But their was a different ticket lady when we got back so we couldnt piss him off. Well the girl lets us pass and we get to the entrance to the screening and a guy stops us because harry's mom left to go look for ryan. So harry runs in and gets his dad, we buy popcorn and we finally get in at the preview for the last samurai. So im tired and i have other stuff to do so I'll will write about the movie tomorow after i see it again. Later.
