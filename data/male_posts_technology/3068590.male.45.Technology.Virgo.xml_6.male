This requirement was invoked due to the probable size of the market cap is in excess of some predetermined number of billions. Google has some proprietary data that they do not want in the public domain regarding their financial situation.  Nonetheless, parallels to the Netscape and .com IPO's has begun with the expectation that Google's value will exceed $25 billion on its IPO. Far greater, by a substantial margin, then any other valuation. The average investor will be wary of the market price of google, however, if microsoft can top out at $400 billion, I would suggest that Google may be worth at least that.   Given the lead start they have over their competition, evaluating their use of the technology, and their pipeline of products. The only concern Google has is the speed of acceptability of their application of technologies. (Gmail for instance.) This company is a thinker and an innovator, and that in addition to the billions in cash from the IPO, will be the reason that the internet and technology continue to morph into its potential.   It certainly is going to be an interesting ride, and start the countdown for the demise of Microsoft. (My Microsoft countdown started 15 years ago.)
