However, I have just removed the site from my favourites list. It's come that time again where I'm going a little bit "too" crazy. A bit of rest is needed. Unfortunately, a quick 5 minutes to scan for any new books/cards/dvds usually results in some impulse buying. One or two impulses is enough. 5 or 6 is waaaaay bad though.  So I'm going to have to stop for the next couple of months. I've got some travelling and a car to save up for, so I'll just have to focus on that.  In the mean time, I've picked upmy "Best of the Muppet Show" DVD. It consist of 28 muppet episodes. That's right, we're looking at 12 hours ofMs Piggy going "Hay-Ya!!!"! So I'm going to watch an episode each lunch time to unwind nicely.  You can never get fozzie, animal, beaker or swedish chef in my books.  Happy f*cking Days.
