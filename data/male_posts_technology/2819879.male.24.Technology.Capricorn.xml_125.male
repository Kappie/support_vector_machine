From the ashes a fire shall be woken, A light from the shadows shall spring; Renewed shall be blade that was broken, The crownless again shall be king.  An interesting poem in Book I foretelling what'll happen in Book VI...  THIS is something that Harry Potter can never do.  Yeah, yeah, the bolt-head and Harry's relationship with Him-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named, those are just baits for readers, secrets waiting to be revealed, not a foreshadowing of anything.  This Poem is especially interesting because it it written by Gandalf the Grey, order of Istari, a Varda of the race Ainur.
