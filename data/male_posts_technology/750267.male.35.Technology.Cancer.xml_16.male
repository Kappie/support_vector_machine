Right away, they started asking so-called experts which state had the toughest death-penalty laws. And often times the media suggested that certain states are likely to prosecute them first because of various rules around death penalties (particularly since one of the snipers is considered a minor). The term "death penalty" is used more than the word "election", and we're only a few days away from that!  Honestly, who cares at this point? Will these two get convicted? Yes. Will they ever be free in society again? No. Will they get the death penalty in at least one of the three trials they are likely to face? Yes - of course. Why does it matter which state has an easier time killing people and which has a tougher time? Why are we rushing them to the gallows? You have them in custody. Trials, appeals, and death sentences take years, even more than a decade in most cases. Drop it, and move on.  The other two legal cases that bother me are Winona Ryder and Martha Stewart. Winona was caught shoplifting. You know what? My sister was once caught shoplifting. The police brought her home without charges, and she was banned from going to Towers department store ever again. Why is the Winona case being treated like it's a murder or something? Geez, fine her $1,000 and ban her from Saks 5th Ave if you must. Why is this such a big deal?  And Martha Stewart. Millions of taxpayer dollars (and lots of time) are being spent investigating whether she had a sell order or not. I once worked for a company that went completely out of business three months after being bought by another company. Our company had $30 million in cash when it was bought. Where did that money go? Noone really knows. But why are the police spending time investigating the crooks who bankrupted my company? Why aren't they investigating the dozens of billion-dollar accounting irregularities with such vigor. Poor Martha made a piddly $40,000 off her stock sale.
