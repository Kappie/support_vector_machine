I figured I didnt want to just drop the audience, but i need to scrap this and write something funnier. ===(one excerpt from the scrap heap)=== "Hey main, dis here taco is one of the tastiest tacos i have ever eaten main," quipped Sergio. "Youre right ese, Carla really does something to make her tacos taste real good. How does she do it main?" asked Hector. "I dont know main, but I wouldn't mind an extra side of sour cream if you know what i'm saying ese." "Dig it" concluded Hector. =======================================
