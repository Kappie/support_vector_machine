Apparently, the Burn wants to change their name, and they're changing it to the bland "FC Dallas."    I have BIG issues with this.    Soccer is a sport that, around the world, every country has made their own and in their own way.  Look at the Salsa Soccer of Brazil, or the Reggae Boyz of Jamaica.  And in the U.S., we have Sam's Army and MLS.    Now let's look at sports traditions in the U.S.  American sports teams have nicknames, traditionally.  Would the New York Yankees be the same if they were the New York BC?  Or the Boston Celtics as Boston BC?  Or the Detroit Redwings as Detroit HC?  No.  And MLS teams shouldn't be any different.  They have nicknames... keep 'em.  Or, if you're going to change them, look at what San Jose did.  Go with a name that has some history to it, as they did when they changed from the Clash to the Earthquakes, the name of the old San Jose NASL team.    Secondly, why "FC?"  What exactly does that stand for?  "Football" club?  I've got news for Dallas's ownership, but "Football" in this country is not soccer.  Football is played with an oval ball and lasts up to three-and-a-half to four hours.  It's a much more established sport in this country.  And to publicly call Soccer "Football" is just going to cause more derision from the U.S. sports media.    I will never understand the need of U.S. Soccer fans to be more European, or more specifically, more English.  U.S. Soccer is an American version of the world's game.  Do they call it "Piede Sferra" in Italian?  No, they call it Calcio.  America has a strong sports tradition already, there's no need to supplant it with any foreign stuff.  Be proud of being American!
