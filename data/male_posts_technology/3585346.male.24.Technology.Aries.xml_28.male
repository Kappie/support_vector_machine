She bought so much because I always skipped my breakfast before going out for work. And thus skipped my lunch as well. So now I can have my honey baked ham before I leave for work!  Ok OK weekend is coming and damn my pocket is almost empty! Please kindly donate some money by emailing me ok? thanks! hahahaha
