Only problem is that I was 30 minutes late today :( I hate alarm clocks, they need to be more precise, this is not to say that they aren't precise about the original alarm going off, but it seems once you hit that snooze button, life becomes a gamble. Will it go off, and when? I don't think it's too much to ask for a snooze button that is reliable(will always go off again) and consistent(will go off at X minutes later). Oh well, I woke up to it at 9am, could've gotten up then. But I still blame the thing for not going off early enough. I got up at 10:57am, 3 minutes before work, it takes 5 minutes to get to work, and it takes my fam about 15 minutes to prepare for work on a rush day.  Hate alarm clocks, absolutely hate them. Anyway, Played more EQ last night after eating some corn dogs. Things went well, but I about passed out while playing, and that's never fun. Was just totally drained. Had to call off our hunt on pirates, though we did get some diamonds and other high sell items, we each ended up with 75 platinum, not a bad haul. Put my character on Trader last night to try and sell some velium I had on me(very pricey ore sells really high) but apparently my internet was going wonkie, cycled the router today and resetup my trader in EQ, so hopefully he stays up tonight, and when I get home, I hope to see mountains of money :)  Anyway, typical day on the helpdesk, they've put me on the Customer Service side(I've done both and like Tech better) which is alright, except the angry customers hunting for money, but that's only a small portion of my calls. the rest are definitely getting all mixed up in our systems and I have to unravel the strands to get them back on track. There's rarely a wait on my line, so most of my time I'm sitting here relaxing and writing stuff like this :)   More to come as it happens.  Please try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix Malakai
