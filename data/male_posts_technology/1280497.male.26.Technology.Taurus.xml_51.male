She wasn't impatient for me to do so, but she wanted to say something so I didn't hibernate until twelve.  I'm back on the herbal tea kick. I had forgotten its ability to soothe the soul. By "soothe" I mean "taste" and by "the soul" I mean "good". I have managed to admit to myself, though, that tea is better with sugar or some sweetener. I'm no purist, it turns out.
