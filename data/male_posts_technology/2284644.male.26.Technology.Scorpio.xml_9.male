     
        So my latest project at work has me writing code to  customize a huge software package IBM sells.   Everything is on a remote AIX  box, and is written in C++.   My brain is churning trying to remember the  easiest way to do this shite.   So far I am kicking cygwin on my xp laptop, and  using remote emacs to get to the files.  It feels strangely comfortable, like  reuiniting with an old girlfriend.
