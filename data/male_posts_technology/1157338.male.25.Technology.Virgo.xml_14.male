Internet Explorer is the best browser for my site there.   That part was NOT serious.  We require our users to use Internet Explorer.  Being an admittedly big-time mozilla firebird (formerly phoenix) fan-boy, I was kinda ticked about that.  I was even more ticked when I found out how crappy IE can be to develop websites for. Since we're using ASP.NET, we are really pretty much stuck with IE as a client browser, since Microsoft's Technologies tend to play best when they play together.  Unfortunately, MS's bastard child of a web browser doesn't play well with Cascading Style Sheets or PNG image files (you know, the standard way to format web pages, and the recommended Web Image format - according to the W3C).  CSS is horribly nasty in IE - but PNG is even worse.  See there's this thing called an alpha channel.  an alpha channel lets you determine how  transparent  or  opaque  an image is.  PNG's lets you specify it on a per pixel level, with varying levels of transparency across the image.   The only comparable popular graphic format we have on the web is GIF.  GIF's have only recently come out of a problem with the compression algorithm patent, which was a concern before.  But on top of that, the format is WAAY too dated.  You're limited to 256 colors, and the alpha support is really nothing more than an on/off switch for transparency - as in all or none.  So hey, PNG overcomes all those limitations, and they render great in every modern web browser, on every platform. Except for Internet Explorer on windows.  ya.  sucks...  even IE for Apple can render them properly.  Just not, you know, the biggest audience with the largest market share.  It can't quite do it.  So what's a web dev to do?   Hack it up. Seems there's a workaround using some direct X image style filter that ONLY works with IE, and isn't a real clean workaround.  But at least it does something  Sad sad day, that I'd be bitching about web design :(  on another note - the Game development is doing well, we're supposed to go code freeze for demo this weekend, we'll see if that happens.  I only really have one thing to work out now,  one last bard song implemenation.   We'll see if I can swing it in time or not..  I got 2.5 done this evening, even with changing the tire on my wife's car, and driving around town for a bit after I got off work to show her some places she's trying to scout out for employment.  This last bard song is a bit more complex than the others that I've done, but I shouldn't have much problem getting it done given an entire afternoon.  I'll post more details about everything once I get some more free time.  Phil.
