If Hitler had not opened a second front and had focused a little more on atomic science, we would have had a Teflon fuehrer.  Getting through/around political trouble is not a measure of skill; it's a measure of the citizenry's contentment.  That said, the American citizenry seem very content.  As long as this doesn't change, a president can do whatever he or she wants.
