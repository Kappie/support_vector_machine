Actually, this month surprisingly they introduced a change in the .NET Matters column. This amazing change (I feel this is really good and expected in future issues) brings stories from the trenches; developers in product groups within Microsoft describing how they use .NET technologies to get their jobs done and develop their products.   This month we got some true programming/development story from XBox Live Team and Core File Systems Team, very good!  After reading this, I have a suggesstion to the magazine editor that we can have such stories in alternate issues of the magazine. Because even the Q column is also a useful stuff and is very much needed for developers like me.
