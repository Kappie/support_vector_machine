Maybe it's because we grew up with quality items, such as He-Man and Thundercats, rather than the shameful crap that seems to haunt toy stores these days. Dougal recently placed an order for some AIRZOOKAS.  What's an AIRZOOKA you ask?    urlLink www.iwantoneofthose.com  says:  "This monster is a highly effective close-quarter wind weapon that had the office in stitches for far longer than adults should laugh without sitting down for a little rest. Basically a large bucket and a bag, this wonderful thing is the ultimate air defence weapon that fires an incredibly focused ball of air up to twenty feet. It's hard to imagine how much fun this is until you've tried it - it's a blast, quite literally."   Is it ever! We had such a laugh with these. You pull the plunger back and release it, it fires a ball of air. No batteries needed. You obviously can't see it, but you can hear it ripping past your ears and sending your buddies screaming for cover like a bunch of jessies.  Unfortunately Scott got a little over-excited and there was a small windmilling incident with one of the office contractors, but they are great fun and well worth £13.    Loverat demonstrates the Iraqi "duck and cover" technique with an Airzooka.
