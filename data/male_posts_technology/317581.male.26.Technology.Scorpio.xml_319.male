What do you want? How can we make you know that we love you, yet not have to spend every ounce of energy trying to prove it. Can you not just be delighted in knowing we love you?  Why is it any time I want to spend any time with my friends you say, "You don't care about me, just go do whatever you want to do..." and then turn a cold shoulder. Do you honestly believe that that makes us want to spend more time with you?  Grow up! Don't make us always decide what we're going to do. If there's something you'd like to do, then TELL US.  we aren't living in the 20's, you can tell us what you'd like to do, you don't have to be content with whatever we plan to do.  God knows it would help us alot.  Thanks- Guys
