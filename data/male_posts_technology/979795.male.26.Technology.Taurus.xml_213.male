I'm not proficient at it but I think it's just wonderful. Before term ends, I'm gonna copy every past year project I can find on the module site. They make for fantastic references. Gonna burn them on a cd and go back Singapore to study it properly. Kewl man.  Anyway, I finally finished my book, Warriors of God, by James Reston Jr. Yea yea, I'm surprised I still have time to leaisure-read books, but it took me quite a long while. Been getting back into reading since I came back to UK. Think I owe my thanks to one of my housemate. He's like a freaking walking encyclopedia. Well, navy regular studying Economics lah. 1 of those award/scholarship/bursary winners (think not considered scholarship), so must be a real smart fella I guess. Quite interesting to hear his views on current affairs and all that. Anyway back to the book, it's about Richard the Lionheart and Saladin during the 3rd Crusades. There were 5 Crusades in all, and the only 1s that were really considered a success would probably be the 1st and the 3rd, but the latter is really debatable. Some interesting facts, Richard the Lionheart was a gay. Apparently he had an 'relationship' (ahem ahem) with the kind of France (who ultimately became 1 of his most direct enemies). Richard hs always been made out to be sort of a war hero and goodie goodie guy when in actual fact, it seems like Saladin had exercised more kindness to his enemies than Richard did. There was this particular moment that I remember in the book where they were going through some diplomatic discussion for a possible peace treaty and when Saladin didn't reply, Richard actually marched a the Muslim prisoners of war to the front lines and had them executed in plain view of the Muslims. Saladin on the other hand had displayed a great level of graciousness to his enemies by releasing his prisoners of war during the capture of an enemy fort/town. During the final battle of the 3rd Crusades, Richard was unhorsed. Saladin sent him a horse only because it did not 'befit the status of a king to be standing on the same level as his own men'. But despite all these, I really must agree that Richard was one helluva tacticion and strategist. In that sense, Saladin might even be just a notch below him. 2 great leaders.
