Melanie and I just got back from Wolf Park (more on this at another time), and, when we came back in the house, she saw the printed copy of Joe Conason's interview with President Clinton still lying in my printer, with Bill's face on the front page, and said "ew, Bill Clinton."  I didn't think I could have heard correctly, and asked her what she had said.  She was reluctant to repeat it, but finally did.  She went on about how she didn't like how his wife sat there with a frown, and how he fell asleep and President Reagan's funeral.  I explained to her that he was praying, just as many other people at the funeral were, and she got upset and left the room, as she does many times if she senses I am angry.  For now, I'm just mad as hell.  I'm tempted to say "well, to hell with that, she isn't going to be visiting there anymore, if he is going to be filling her head with lies," but I'll reserve on that until I've had time to calm myself.  Back to your regularly scheduled program.
