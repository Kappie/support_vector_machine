Whoever made the law apparently believed that evil is okay when it's not out in the open.   I remember going to one bottle shop called Fatzos. My mother was visiting and she sent me in to buy lottery tickets for her. She is a devout christian (read: hypocrite) who doesn't think it's sinning if you get someone else to do it for you. Anyway, this place should have called itself the House of Sin. They sold lottery tickets, tobacco products, booze, girlie magazines, sodas, and a few unhealthy snacks. I bought her lottery tickets and aMountain Dew, for which I will spend eternity in the  urlLink 7th level of Hell .
