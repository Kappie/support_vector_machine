What do you think? If there's something blue I'd probably be happy with it.  Man, I was sooooo tired this morning. I was up until like 1, after getting home ar like 12:20, after trying to clean up something that's talked about in  Armaan's Blog .... yeah it was interesting.  Today at work I'm actually working on some stuff. We're changing some phone ports into fax ports and going to put fax software on people's computers/laptops if they want it. It means I get to play around with the switch board in the phone room... not my favorite activity (when you go to press the wires in they spark a little, it's creepy). But at least it beats sitting in front of the computer trying to make my character counter go up more.... so I guess that's good.  It's almost lunch time, thank goodness... I'm hungry.
