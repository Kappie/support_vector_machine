There's a good chance I won't be able to get my honours even. I really have to acknowledge that fact after my 2nd last paper. I dunno how but I guess a degree is what I'm hoping to look for at this point. I'm still trying hard to accept this fact. No choice. Can't do anything now but pray.  Went back and slept and slept. But I dunno why I think the adrenaline is still rushing and I didn't quite sleep for as long as I intended. I definitely need to force myself to bed and catch up on some rest which lost. Especially so during the last 72 hrs.  Tonight the house is really empty. But it's good lah, coz I got Aikido anyway. Going for practice in a few minutes.  Tomorrow night I'll be heading off to Oslo, Norway for a trek with Justin and Daniel. Cool man. Can't wait for it. Will probably be trekking for about 5 days or so. But don't think it's out in the wild lah. There are towns and cities and hostels along the way for the trek. Civilisation really isn't far away from our route. It's suppose to be a simple and comfortable route in Oslo. After that, we'll hit Copnhagen and take an overnight ferry to Stockholm. Will buy a train ticket to go down to Karlskrona, Sweden to visit my naval friend, attached there for submarine training. Oops, reminded myself that I need to call them up once I get my hands on the ticket. Finally I'll meet up with my housemates in Stockholm and fly back to UK to get my results (which won't be good).  After a few days of rest, I'm heading off to Scotland for trekking again. Lake Coniston all the way up to Edinburgh. Will be back just before my parents arrive and hope to prepare for the convocation.  All in all, I think I'll be back in Singapore on the 2nd / 4th Aug. Hope to resume my NS around the 18th Aug.
