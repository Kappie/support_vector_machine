It has taken me a good 5 years of chasing my own tail to realize that I wasn't hitting the furthest point on my production possibilities frontier with reagrds to time away from work.  In the past, I would accumulate as many vacation days as possible, with hopes to take one long vacation (yeah right), or that I would get a nice bonus when I leave the company.....well fellow blogga fuckas, I'm done with that shit!  When the company gives me a day off, I show that I'm no pussey by requesting an extra day off in addition to the one given to me....this method of matching days has increased my ability to be away from work, whilst not pissing off the management.  I highly recommend this method office avoidance....you come off smelling like a rose in that you are still the "Company Man" with the best interests of some fucken corporation in mind (because shouldnt entities get compassion too?), while you selfishly live your own life like a person who puts themselves first.  What a concept!
