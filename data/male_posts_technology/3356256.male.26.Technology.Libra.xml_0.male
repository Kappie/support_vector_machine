I also understand that this is not your fault and in no form am I blaming you.  However, I have been trying to resolve this issue since January 17, 2004.  To avoid any further confusion I will explain the problem.     The LCD on my laptop cracked and that was the reason it was sent to the depot. On February 24, 2004 I was informed that the broken screen was not covered under warranty and that I would have to pay for the replacement of the LCD.  I was not thrilled but I wanted the screen replaced and placed the order.  That same day I checked my email and the order placed was for a 15.4" LCD when it should have been a 16.1".  I called once again and they canceled the order for the 15.4" LCD and placed the order for the 16.1" LCD, which is what I had on the laptop to begin with.  A few days later, I received a call from Customer Service to inform me that the order wasn't placed because they needed my payment information.  Once again I provided this information and received the following order #******.  I have recently received another order #****** via email; followed by an email stating that it would take 4 to 6 weeks for my laptop to be shipped out.     This would be the third time that I have been asked to provide my billing information. Two months have passed since my laptop arrived at the depot; however,my laptop has not been repaired nor the part ordered.     Prior to my purchase I had heard many good things about Alienware but to be honest I have been disappointed. I expected quality service from such a well reputed company and that is not what I received.   I will call customer service as you have advised and provide the information need to get this issue resolved.  I hope this can be resolved as soon as possible. Thank you     23 day's later I received my laptop!! Well I did learn a few things: 1) If you ever have 3k to spend on a laptop you might as well go away on a nice vacation with the money. 2) Get a friend who works or use to work as customer service to make the calls.  They'll most likely get the issue solved faster. 3) Never get a 3 year warranty that doesn't cover any parts 4)Never buy from Alienware  You have been warned.
