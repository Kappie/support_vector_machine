I went later to the crime stoppers website only to see that someone had been shot on a corner that I had just run by, how comforting.  It was a great run though.  I got strangely tired on the way to Clifton and had to stop and walk for a minute.  I was able to pick right back up though and hammer through until I met friends briefly.  It was a good break and I was able to take off at a faster pace (sub 9 minute) all the way back home.  Some things I learned on this run.  Taft is significantly darker and eerier than MLK at night.  The residents of the 'hood will always be confused about a white man like me running through the neighborhood.  Finally, I learned that a coffee shop is an ironic place to stop mid-run for a break.    No final thought for the night tonight.  Sorry  Until the next run, whenever it might be.
