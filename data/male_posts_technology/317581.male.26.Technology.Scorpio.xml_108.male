But one time when he was in the bank vault a bunch of bombs go off and kill EVERYONE.  He comes out and is like, "What they hey?"  Then he walks around and sees all these books laying on the street and he realizes this is where the library was.  And then he's like, "Cool dude!", because now he can read forever and no one can bother him.  You know what happens next?  The stupid idiot breaks his glasses and he's like, "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!"  Sad story eh?  So be careful Tim...
