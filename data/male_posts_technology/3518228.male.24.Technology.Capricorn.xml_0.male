I spent more time than I care to consider just trying to get  urlLink RCS  and  urlLink EMACS  to play nice under Windows 2000.  I'd blame the GNU software, but I've been able to get it to run flawlessly under Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, and HP-UX.  With Win2k, the only way I could get anything useful to happen was to install the  urlLink cygwin  tools. Does it really count as installing under windows if you need to throw in a Linux emulation layer?
