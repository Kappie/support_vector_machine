When I was a senior in high school, she was like 7 yrs old, and had already read more books than I ever would!  so she can communicate just a little better than I can. Well maybe that is not is 100% correct. she can write much better than I can, but that does not mean I cant get someone to understand what I mean. a 2x4 upside the head gets a point across pretty good.  for some good reading check her site out.
