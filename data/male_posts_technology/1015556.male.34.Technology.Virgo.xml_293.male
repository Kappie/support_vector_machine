The phenomenon of church shoppers has profoundly shaped the contemporary church.  The entire conversation is not about relevance but convenience.  The focus is not in serving the world; the church itself became the focal point.  This move has made the pastor the only minister, while making the members the only recipients of ministry.  What is lost in this process is an army of healers touching the planet. The cultural environment because comfortable and the gospel shifted from a church 'on mission' to a church that supported missions.
