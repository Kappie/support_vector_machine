The dog was walking around outside the car as he drove down the park's road.     He could have run his dog over.   If something happened to the dog, like another dog or a raccoon attacking it, he wouldn't have been able to do anything.     If he was watching the dog, he wasn't watching the road.   Next time I see this bastard, I'll post his license plate number.  Anyone in Columbus, feel free to egg his car.
