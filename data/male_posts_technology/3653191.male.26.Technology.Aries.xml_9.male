"   The whole essence of 'pranayama' - a breathing exercise is based on staying in a thoughtless state by retaining the inhaled breath. Indeed when you inhale and just retain the breath, it is quite difficult to "think", especially disturbing thoughts don't dare enter you...    I find it especially useful..  Have a nice day guys  Cheers !!!
