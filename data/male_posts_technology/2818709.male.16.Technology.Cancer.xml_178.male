Every god damn student at astec puts in hours of homework, on one or two assignments, and we get SHIT for grades. We all deserve "A"s for sheer EFFORT. I mean, wtf? We do exactly as they tell us, and we get horrible grades on them. Maybe it's not us? Did you self-righteous fuckers ever think of that? We try, god damnit. I TRY. I dont know if everyone tries as hard as I, but, damnit. I deserve an A for effort. The only class that I fully understand is Geometry. I have a 78 in there. And you know what? 9th graders understand that damn class better than i do. Swagerty's been being a bitch to me lately. Coe trys, but he cant teach worth shit without any textbooks. That's not his fault. That's deskin and her 5 car's fault. Christ. You do not need 5 cars. You do not need a Z3 when your damn school has the funding of a brothel in an amish community. I'm probably going to get something near a 60 on this retest. You know why? Because effort doesn't matter. All that matters, is sheer genetic luck. If you are born with the proverbial "smarts", you succeed in life. If you are born with the intelligence of a stump, you'll end up with a job flipping burgers until you are 50-70 when you decide to start leeching the government for money. Then your salary will double, because apparantly, uncle sam is the wallet of the entire fucking nation.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and have a nice night.  Fuckers.     Crawling in my skin without a sense of confidence...consuming, confusing....crawling in my skin, without a sence of confidence I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take...there's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface...Consuming, confusing..this lack of self-control, I fear is never ending..controlling, I can't seem to find myself again...My walls are closing in...without a sense of confidence I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take I've felt this way before So insecure...
