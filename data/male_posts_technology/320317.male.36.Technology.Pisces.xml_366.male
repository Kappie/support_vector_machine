 This has to be one of the most annoying navigation paradigms I have seen in awhile. First of all, the "orbiting" links or navigation elements only tell you the first letter of the destination, so your pretty clueless of where to go to unless you mouseover all the elements. The fact that the navigation elements are moving is only the beginning of your aggravation.  The real fun is when you try to mouseover an element, and then try and move to another element . It's basically torture.
