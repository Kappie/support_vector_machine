I'm in this really really awesome mood, because I connected my laptop to ChoiceRadio and then, using my kickass 3.5mm Mini Stereo to RCA jacks, hooked THAT up to my Aiwa stereo just so I could listen to ad-free radio all day. It's great. Picture is  urlLink here.   I've been reading blogs randomly for the past...ten minutes. So far, it's a god-boy, two librarians and some kid named Mike who likes Pokemons.   I really like reading random blogs. I wonder...secretly, of course, if anyone other than my homies (Kel, Britt, Dylan, Teej, CH, JQ, ROZ...all my homies) read it. It's rather interesting, right? RIGHT? Oh...ok.  Anyways, I might go out to do that there wardriving. Can't be a network tech without some security knowledge! (even though I'm wwwd'ing on the 12th.)
