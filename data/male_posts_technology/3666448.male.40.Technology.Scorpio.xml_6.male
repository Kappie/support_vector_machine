To hire an employee in America is expensive, there are government regulations, insurance, health insurance, vacations, facilities, etc to pay for.  The companies didn't make the situation expensive, they're trying to survive in an environment that makes it attractive to outsource.  The answer is to make keeping jobs in country attractive.  A good idea might be to, I don't know, LOWER TAXES!! My job is in danger of outsourcing, if it happens I won't blame the company I work for, I'll blame those that made it so damn expensive to pay me, and we all know who that is.
