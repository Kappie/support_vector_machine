See wasn't that a heart felt apology, but now on to more important things.  I work at a helpdesk as a Customer Service Rep., meaning I'm the one who has to go out to the end user when the brain trust answering the phones can't walk the user through the process of turning on their computer.  Now I know you're thinking this has to be an exaggeration human beings can't be to stupid to figure out button pushing and other tasks lower primates can do, but this really does happen, frequently.  As a matter of fact a particular customer, let's call this person "Fat Douche Bag", decide this week to make a play for the crown of asshole-of-the-month.  On Tuesday of said week "Fat Douche Bag" calls the helpdesk to complain her speakers would not operate, through a trouble shooting method I can only imagine involves making chimp sounds and slamming your genitals in a desk drawer, it's determined that the speakers are broken and need to be replaced.  Captain Dipshit answering the phones foregoes the common practice of trying to resolve the problem and dumps the ticket into our laps.  So I called up "Fat Douche Bag" and ask a very basic question.  Are the speakers turned on? "Fat Douche Bag's" reply is "I don't know".  So I ask if the little green light directly above the On knob is lit.  "Fat Douche Bag" answers with an mind boggling "I think so, but I'm not sure".  I'M NOT SURE!?!?! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.  Can you not tell the difference between light and the absence of light, my God!  How does one function in a industrial world without the basic skill of recognizing light.  Next I ask "Fat Douche Bag" to make sure the speakers are plugged into the wall.  I hear some grunt and wheezing so I assumed this meant "Fat Douche Bag" is actually checking the power strip, I will soon learn that assuming was my mistake.  "Fat Douche Bag" tells me that the speaker are in fact plugged into the wall and then complains about having get out of the chair to check.  At this point I realize that any conversation over the phone would be an exercise in futility, so I joyfully drive on over to "Fat Douche Bag's" location.  First thing that I noticed was that the light above the speaker knob was not on, I determined this by using the theory of wave-particle duality and also the motherfucking light was not on.  I then proceeded to exert the effort to lean over and check under the desk where I saw the plug was out of the goddamn power strip, see I was wrong to assume.  So being the professional that I am I plugged "Fat Douche Bag's" speakers back in and nicely explained the issue to "Fat Douche Bag", who then said "That was it?  Kind of a waste of a trip."  That when I went into the nearest bathroom and slammed my face into the mirror.  Some people are prime example of why abortions are a good idea.
