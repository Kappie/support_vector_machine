The  urlLink FTP site  has been so bogged down that not even the mirror sites can download the necessary files.  Even the  urlLink support site  that only paying customers can access is busy!  I have successfully connected to one mirror site that had RH 7.0, but the did not have the CD image files (ISOs) that I wanted.  99% of older Linux distributions fail in some way on my hardware, so I figured there would be hope with the most brand new version.  When will I get to find out?!
