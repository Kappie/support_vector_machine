It was pleasant, but, she talks a lot! During the service even!  She even whooped!!  Needless to say, I was caught off guard. Hahaha.  I took Communion, but I only mention it because I have a proclivity to visit new churches on the day when they have Communion. I've got to sort of speed-observe whether or not the particular church conforms more or less to what I know is in the Bible while simultaneously evaluating my past couple days to make sure that I'm spiritually in a place where I can participate.  So that's kind of stressful.  I'm so used to going out to eat now, a habit I basically was required to pick up from Misty, then I went to Rudy's for some solo bbq after the service.  It kinda sucks eating in public alone, but then again, I was hungry and there was naught but 'tatoes in the fridge.  And I got a new toy. Yay!   Update: Check out the content-sensitive Google banner ad up top.  A couple days ago, it was all about trance and climbing.  Now it's got love poetry and the ten commandments. Bwahahahaha.  Google's always good for a laugh.
