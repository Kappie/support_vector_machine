It was a welcome feeling, even though it only lasted for about 3 minutes. But it was a shining light on what may be.  Well I was up until almost 2am last night, so I have been fighting sleep. I am gonna go to sleep a bit after I am done with this. Actually as of now I have a problem keeping my eyes open.  What do you think about the new stuff that's on the side bar on the right side of this page. E-mail me at xhero0 AT hotmail I will respond to every mail.  well nothing exciting else to report...  I am gonna go to sleep...  See you Saturday!  Joe
