And what increases the difficulty is trying to balance yourself while walking uphill to the mountain of God, my analogy of drawing close to God. The life lessons are needed but painful, enough said.Idon't like repeating myself.   Life Lesson #2, Well Actually there have been hundreds, but this one is significant one in my life. The lord has taught me this one over and over. I'm just beginning to grasp the lesson's depth. You see I'm a bit dense sometimes, not near as smart and spiritual as some that may read this. #2 Life lesson centers around self-reliance. In the last few years, I have come to the understanding that this presently is one of my biggest weaknesses. The lord, through some of the somersaults, life lessons, has humble me over and over on this subject.   I maybe splitting hairs on this next thought, but hay its always fun to split a hair or two. When I mention seal-reliance, the normal picture I have is of a proud, arrogant,and self willed individual that thinks he can do anything if he works hard enough, thats not me. My self-reliance is of a different vain, rooted deep in my childhood. Without going into the bloody details, I would just say that I felt fortunate to make it out of adolescence alive and coherent. My brother, Nolan did not make it out at all. To me self-reliance was more of self-survival. I Couldn't rely on my Mom and Dad to keep me safe, or even inpartbasic life skills. I came to the conclusion early onin lifethat if I was going tosurvive, I was on my own to do so. Granted You must understand, at that time, I had no earthly clue of who God was. I becamean expertat survival (self-reliance).   Even after I became Christian, my self-reliance was deeply ingrained into me. To show you an example of this self-reliance, I would tell you that from the age of 19 years, other than a stint in the Army, I have always worked for myself. This happen naturally, I couldn't think of putting my future inanother person's hands.   Ah, now you see the problem arising. It has been difficult for me to rely on God. Since the time I became a Christian(19 years old), I have always love the lord, and loved to worship him.loving and worshipping Goddid not immediately mean that I was able to fully rely on God. For years, I didn't even realize how big of a problem it was. As I drew closer to God, The lord would not allow my self-reliance to stand unchecked. He has humbled me over and over on this subject.   This next part isonly my opinion so take it as such. I have slowly, and painfully come to the understanding, that God loves it when we are weak and broken, and in need of relying on him. I see it clearly in the word of God that God loves to use weak, broken vessels.   If you find yourself caught up in a belief system that is telling you that God loves those who help themselves or any of the self-centered mumbo jumbo, you might do well to reevaluate were you are at and who this God you serve is. God needs nothing from us. He is complete and infinite by himself, and it is because of this that he has such vast mercy, grace, and love for us weak, broken individuals.
