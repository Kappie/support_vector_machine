I weighed myself and I've lost another 4 pounds and I'm now at 286 this morning. WOW...     Kinda felt sick to my stomach this morning before eatting, but I think thats because I was hungry. I felt better afterwards.     6:00 AM   This morning for breakfast I had 3 pieces of bacon, and 2 peices of sausage, and 2 eggs for a total of 2.2 carbs again today for breakfast... This might get old soon... :(    Took chili and jello and turkey to work for lunch. The chili will be 1 carb...      1:35PM   I atesomeJello and Turkey for lunch today for 0 carbs total. I didn't eat the Chili. That means I've eatten 2.2 carbs TOTAL today. I still have 17.8 left!!!! Sound like a gooddinner to me :)      5:30 PM  For dinner I had some steak with A1sauce for 1.5 grams of carbs. I also had salad with bacon anddressing for 1.75 grams, and some Ice cream and Pork rinds for 0 carbs each. That means I ate 3.75 carbs for dinner and 5.95 total for the day. I have 14.05 carbs left for today :)
