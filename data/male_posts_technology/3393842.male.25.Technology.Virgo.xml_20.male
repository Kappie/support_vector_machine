Folks of the older ages must have some how realized this and should have worked on these religion stuff. Somebody someday very very very long back should have found it very difficult to keep up the motivation of somebody he had to deal with on a daily basis, probably himself. He/she must have finally decided that discipline works better and that should have been the start of these religion things, or is it civilization .. whatever !!
