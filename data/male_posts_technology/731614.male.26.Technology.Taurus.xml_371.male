A) a burger with a bun and a slice of cheese and nothing else,  or  B) a burger with everything imagineable EXCEPT cheese.  i more often than not get the morons in the drivethrough who think it is B (or some undefined C), which is precisely the opposite of what i want.  i want A, dammit, and is that too much to ask?  i'm only swinging through these damn drivethroughs now and then cuz my current work hours lead to much time in between meals.  woe is me.
