Here it is...    ******************************************************    The Insanity I have created...   There are days when I wake up and I feel so alone that its like I'm being sucked into some kind of vortex that I will never get out of. I fight, I cry, I try and I try to escape that feeling, yet it persists. But today, today was different. I woke up with that feeling...like I was being pulled into something that I knew I would never escape, then the miracle of friendship happened. Yes, I have friends, and while I have never touched them, or hugged them, or kissed them on the cheek, great friends they are. They are but a font on a computer screen...yet they are so so much more than that. They are the ones I can tell anything to and have no fear that they will desert me. They are the ones I can pour my heart out to, and I know that they will understand, or if they don't, then they will try to. They are the ones who are like me, sitting in front of their computers, searching as I am, for the ones that will do for them, as they do for me. They are loved and needed...and I dont know what I would do without them.    This world is such an odd one. Here I sit, in front of my computer, typing out a spiel that I'm not sure will be read or not...and yet I still do it. I go into chat rooms, I am greeted by cyber hugs and kisses, and the occasional lick, and I feel wanted and liked and needed. The words I type bring laughter to some, anger to some, disgust to others...yet...I do not leave. In this life, the one called reality, if I brought anger to another person, I'd likely get an ass kicking for the things I freely say in that world of chat.    Some think I'm a touch insane for living so much of my life in this world...but I think they are small minded individuals for thinking such things. The fonts I see on the screen are put there by real people...flesh and blood human beings who have feelings and wishes and dreams just as I do. They aren't unreal, they areat timesmore real than those who I know in this thing called reality. Had I not discovered this world, I would have missed out on so many friendships that I find I cannot do without...and I would have missed out on a love unlike any other.    I am thankful for my chat friends...I have turned to them so many times to help me make it through my days and they have always pulled, pushed or dragged me through that vortex I would almost get lost in. So my friends...always know that you are appreciated,you are needed and most of all, you are loved. Thank you so much for being my backbone at times...or for giving me laughter when I needed it the most, or for offering me much needed reassurance that above all, I am not the horribleperson I sometimes feel I am. I treasure you...    "Alone is not a bad way to be; it clears your mindand focuses you on the journey. Cherish the short intervals during the quest you have with others, but be prepared to walk alone in the darkness."    ******************************************************  Her writings never cease to amaze me...oh, and here's a quickie thatI just wrote. A bit cheesy...but oh well. I have other writings that are half done or less than half done. I need to get back to these...mind block is a bitch.   *DOWN*  Alone in the darkness  is this all I need  what can I say  is this how its going to be  need to get fucked  do you feel thatdeed  say it aint so  is this really creed  Fuck it all  just let me bleed  I ask you  could you take the lead  Copyright Â© 2004 SJohnson
