It's probably more accurate to say what I "like" changes over time, while what I admire or value remains the same.  I will always admire and value the craft and artistry of Pink Floyd.  But I rarely listen to them anymore.  When I do, I find I'm only visiting old stomping grounds.  The appeal is only in appreciation of craft and nostalgia for a time or place.  I am grateful for what they gave me at that time, but I now go to other sources for meaning or sustenance.  That said, I experience my changes in preference as a slow continuum.  If they happen rapidly for you, perhaps it is as I initially proposed -- that your relationship with art is largely, if not exclusively, personal and emotional.  In the context of this post, the heart changes more frequently than the mind.
