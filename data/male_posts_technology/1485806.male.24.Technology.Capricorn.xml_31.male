A year of Cross-over , crossing the River Jordan which marks the end of the era of Moses and move unto the Joshua Era. A year of moving from studenthood to professionalhood. So many things have happened, so many challenges, so many hurts and so many things that requires 1 thing. Surrenderring . Surrenderring my entire life..the things that i hold dear..my careers, my studies my plans..my dreams..my..umm..life partner to the Lord. Yeah I still remember doing things with  own strengths, the amount of worrying and insecurities...and it seems so easy when you are delighting in the Lord..no worries...no strings attached. The hardest things to do was to confess and to surrender every bit of my life...  There was a few life changing points of my life..particularly when i returned to Malaysia from Aussie..I stepped off the plane and straight into ERL. When i arrived in KL Sentral , i realized that i have dropped my wallet and have no way to go home ..And it was my burning bush experience..i mean God have caught my attention...the peace of God was so strong that it surpasses understanding.  After i made a report, I went and sat down in KL Sentral . I look up to God, expecting something great to happened that day...I told God..Okay ..something have happened...I am not going to do anything more...I am gonna fold my hands and I am gonna wait to see what You have in Store for me. ..What do you want to teach me from all this... God says be still and know that I am God..God doesn't just mean literally..God meant that i stopped my actions...physically,..emotionally..close my eyes and begin to worship Him there and then...so i did..I sing in the spirit, I prayed in the spirit...I practically have praise and worship in KL Sentral.. ...My fren came and pick me up...to my house. Later on, a lot of people asked me what happened later...Siew Ching..(angel in disguise) ..phoned to tell me that this lady found my wallet and was very suprised that I am so calm and not excited about it..as if I have been expecting it all along and yeah i did...There was a lady that found it was on the way back to Sabah, a member from SIBKL....a christian and saw my cards in there...and decided to phone Siew Ching and well I 've got my wallet back. One of the many testimonies in my life in 2003...How I 've got my job was another...I've beeen trying attending all the interviews and decided to get the job i wanted thru my own strength.with my own abilities and skills i thought i could get a job...I was cocky ...and although i prayed...i was very confident ..self confident. But after 5 months of doubts, hurts, rejection ,pressure,,....i gave it all to the Lord...i prayed everyday and believed that God is preparing me all this months...allowing me to contact every old friends that i have developing that humility,..that willing attitude...I continued to serve the Lord even when i am doubting God,.not sure of what lies ahead...My parents(suprisingly) asked when i have spare time....work with the church...my parents are not even Christians...and yet..God really knows how to plan someone's life.  I gave it all to the Lord...I clearly states that I am a fervant Christian...that i served in the Lord and that i am new to all this working life...but i believe God have a purpose and I willing to learned and starts from the bottom. This is part of the answer when i was interviewed for the last time...actually last 3 times...3 interviews for the job. God gave me that job when i was encouraging one great brother to let go of his laptop and  his working time to be prayed for ...Kevin Tai. That was when i was offered a job..  Of course there are also difficult challenges,...and definitely failure in 2003...but faithfulness of God prevails all.... I 've learned one major thing in 2003 ...and that is God is always in Control...  So Cross Over ...Join the Joshua Generation and run forward to the promised land in 2004  Fellow JesusFreak Joshua Tan
