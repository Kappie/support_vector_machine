Firstly review of the ISM manufacturing and non-manufacturing indexes for the month of April 2004 reflects that the American economy is under a massive increase in GDP. There are various pricing pressures that put the pricing index under a severe strain, registering 88 for the month. The review also reflects that although there are inflationary pressures, there appears to be a trend for increases in productivity to meet the constraints. That although the inflation pressures are impressive, the productivity is offsetting the trend and mitigating the impact.   The pricing situation discussed previously, has an odd anomaly in the long term energy prices are not accurately reflecting the shortages in the future. The energy industry uses these long term prices to determine and allocate their capital budgets to the greatest return. Costing exploration and development on the economics of $28 oil is fundamentally different then the current prices of $40. Not until the long term prices reflect the current prices will there be any reaction by the industry in allocating funds to riskier projects, or to increase their overall capital exposure.   Based on this dichotomy in energy pricing, the need to ask if a revision of the pricing model to better reflect the supply and demand in the long term is required?   I would also postulate the need for the higher energy prices is only beginning to be reflected in $40 oil. The future of cheap energy solutions is over and will never be seen by this generation again. With the increasing productivity of the U.S. economy, and the level of economic activity increasing the demand on energy, a further doubling and tripling of prices may yet occur.
