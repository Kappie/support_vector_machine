Basically I wanted somewhere I could host midi files so I could download to a WAP phone without using a cable - tagtag.com does that (and has a huge free ringtone and gfx library) for free.        DOH!  - actual link is to a WAP emulator showing the page - to get there using your phone you need:  http://tagtag.com/mmchronic/
