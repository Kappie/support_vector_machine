Funny thing is, in between bouts of self-aggrandizement, Mr. Clarke says nothing about the Clinton administration's eight years of failing to address the threat of Al-Queda, despite repeated attacks that resulted in the death and injury of hundreds, including American citizens.  And why do you suppose he gives his former democratic bosses a free pass but dumps hard on the Republicans?  Well, turns out Clarke is an old friend and colleague of Rand Beers, and jointly teaches "Post-Cold War Security: Terrorism, Security, and Failed States" with him at the Kennedy Institute.  Rand Beers is National Security coordinator for John Kerry's presidential campaign.  Do you suppose this influenced Clarke's stance?   urlLink Maybe .  Or maybe he just  urlLink has a book to sell .
