This week, we start a discussion on Microsoft's next major release of Windows, codenamed Longhorn, which will come packaged with a number of new technologies that you need to make sure you know.  One of the new technologies being release with Longhorn is the new presentation subsystem, called Avalon.  Avalon is positioned as a new graphics subsystem that serves as a foundation for Longhorn's shell. Avalon will also come with a full set of the user interface components for Longhorn. By integrating user interface (UI), documents, and media into the next generation of interactive client applications and experiences, Longhorn will achieve a more unified approach, as well as a fully integrated development and user experience.  Avalon will better utilize the power of the PC throughout the graphics stack, bringing designers directly into application development.    A major capability of Avalon is its support for XAML (Extensible Application), which provides a one-to-one correspondence with the object model within the presentation layer of Longhorn, with its key role being to enable interoperation between UI authoring tools and developer tools.  Avalon will also provide built-in support for recent advancements in the Windows OS, such as the Tablet PC and the Windows XP Media Center Edition operating systems.  Join me next week when we talk about how to use the "run as" feature in Windows Server 2003.
