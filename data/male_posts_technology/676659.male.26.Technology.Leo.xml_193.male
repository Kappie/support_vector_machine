I was in Panaad with the church youth kagina, and upod ko dul-ong sa mga kataohan then I'm here na after freshening up! hehe I had a very fun day afternoon + night with Gemma. Food trip! hehe Imbis na lose weight, gin bawi lang for one day! hehe Diba Gems? Cge lang ah! ;) Enjoy gd ko katama! :D   Scuba would be a nice adventure to try out. :) Sadya na... and I know you could go back to Gen San Edmar... pero get well ka lang anay. :) Hmm... next month probably, a bunch of us will be going there (Mla) para sa FCCF. And hopefully, YOUTH ang sa Caliraya, although it would be fine kun Church Worker's, pero it'll be more fun kun Youth. :D   Cge, goodnight all! God bless! :D
