Doesn't QUITE sound like me. :) But then, you'll just have to take my word for it. Things like that have always amused me. Their accuracy, though, varies pretty widely; after all, they're all created by people like me... (Read "Too lazy to be doing something useful.") And isn't it just thrilling to know that I will soon be an epic miniseries event from TNT?!?!?   So it's my anniversary today. Doesn't that sound like fun? It is, I suppose. We're going out to dinner tonight; it's looking like Red Lobster. I know, I know, that isn't very fancy or nice or anything, but it's much cheaper than a black-tie restaurant, and that's something that concerns us both. Besides, at Red Lobster she can get her seafood fondue and pretend the carbs don't count, which'll make her very happy for a little bit. She actually got her present yesterday; a Precious Moments thing, "Bringing You my Heart". I'd link to it, but there don't seem to be any pictures of that particular one online. Suffice to say, I thought it was cute. Maybe I'll take a picture of it sometime, and post it myself, just for my very special Blog readers! Wouldn't that be great? Exclusive access to that picture... ;-)   Okay, so it really isn't all that exciting. But I can dream, can't I?   As a last treat (*cough cough*), for those of you who are bored, try reading through  urlLink this  short story that I'm working on.
