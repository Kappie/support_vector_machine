Shame with those black circles under her eyes... - The guy sitting next to me by the window, trying to hide that he was picking his nose.  - A young man I see quite often, who always wears sunglasses. (Today it was actually sunny, so nothing strange about that, it is just a bit strange all the other days when it is not sunny).  - A chubby little man, sitting down next to another chubby man, and they are both shifting around uncomfortably, trying not to touch each other. - A woman with big, curly, just-out-of-bed hair, sitting exactly in the middle of the seats, with one bum cheek on each seat.  -A woman with big, thick winter boots. They were suede and looked expensive, so I guess she wants her moneys worth and wears the boots any day of the year it is not raining. - A normally build man with a big bum in nice pleated trousers. The trousers were a couple of sizes to small, making the pleats disappear where the trousers were clinging to his bum.  - A short, tubby Asian woman wearing a white skirt with Danish flags, pointy, high heeled, buckled boots, a black buckled leather jacket and a huge turquoise bag with metal nails.   The bus ride to work takes about ten minutes...
