I really think it's cool when we send out communications that are intended to reach extraterrestrial life. And I guess signatures might strike a nerve with the alien life forms who have to sign the backs of their credit cards just like we do. But on a DVD? Are we assuming that aliens develop their technology at a similar rate? What are the chances that the aliens are going to have a DVD-compatible computer handy to read the things? Do we expect the aliens to print the signatures?  It seems like they're being redundant. Let's assume that the alien life form has received the DVD capable computer from the last time NASA sent a spacecraft into orbit (and sent the computer as a preparatory gift), and now they're going to play the DVD. Don't you think the aliens are going to already sense that there is some other life form out there, based on the  huge spacecraft that just landed on their house?  Maybe the computer they're using to read the DVD could be a little hint?  And as far as the DVD format goes, it seems sad to think that the odds grow even longer as the years go by that the signatures will be read by anyone, humans and aliens alike. I wonder if NASA ever included in their spacecrafts 8-track tapes with people introducing themselves and the human race.  Meanwhile, other life forms from far, far away are wondering when we're going to see those huge flaming balls of ice, gas, and rock that they keep sending across and around our solar system every so often. Little do they know, we don't have a computer that's compatible with that format yet.
