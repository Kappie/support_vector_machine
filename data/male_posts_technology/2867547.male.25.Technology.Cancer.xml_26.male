The weather forecast is not very encouraging about the first couple of days, so I am taking with me some books to read. One of which is  urlLink The McKinsey Way  which my friend  urlLink Issidor  lend to me. I already read the first part (out of five) and there are some good insights that can be applied to any problem solving business. The chapters are short and sweet. it's a good piece of writing.  The next book in my bag is  urlLink C# Programmer's Cookbook . Reading this book is intended to boost my C# productivity. I don't expect any great insights.  Just good examples how to handle everyday coding challenges in C#.  I definitely need to get  a better understanding of Unmanaged Code Interoperability and much more. This book may make it easier for me.  I am also taking with me the  urlLink The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing For Geeks  by Eric Sink which is just a series of 22 articles. This guy has a great  urlLink blog  that is just a must read. I remember I had read two of his articles a while ago. But this weekend I got a chance to read a lot from him and it was really worth it. Now I syndicate him to make sure I don't miss a thing :)
