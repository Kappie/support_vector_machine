It used to be a lower buy in with re-buys and now they've increased the entry and eliminated the re-buys.  Last nights turn out was a little lower than I've seen in the past but we still had 156 people.  I caught a couple of unexpected hands early.  In the BB with no raies in front of me I had 36s. The flop came 663!  I slowed played the flop and the other guy in came at me with T100.  since we start this with T800, I thought if I could keep him thinking he had the lead I may be able to pick up almost 25% more chips here.  He came at me again on the Turn when a K hit the board and I smooth called one more time.  A rag hit the river, there was no flush or straight draws and once again he came at me with T100.  This time I raised to T300 hoping he would think I was trying to bluff, but he folded there and I took the pot.  I managed to steal a couple of blinds and basically played tight through the first hour. Then remembering what I had read about trying to make something happen just before levels increased or going on a break, with about 5 minute left before the 1st break, I caught AKs from a late position.  I came in with a raise of 3XBB and was called by one guy. The flop brought KQ8 rainbow.  The other player checked, I came in for about T250 and he smooth called me.  The turn brought a rag so I thought if he checked again I was going to put him to a decision since he only had about T400 left, and I was at about T2100.  sure enough, he checked and I pushed all in!  He was on QQ and I got no help on the river.  This put me in a postion where I had about T600 left and just a couple minutes before the break.    On the very next hand I get QQ in the hole, the flop comes 789 rainbow and once again I'm in a raised pot with the same guy I had just lost the last hand to.  I figured he thought I was probably tilting a bit ( I don't really think so though) and also that since he had just popped me, I was sure he was probably playing this hand a bit looser.  I pushed all in again, expecting him to fold to the straight possibility and he calls!  He has TT and sure enough the river gives him a 6 and I'm out.  I didn't check the board but I think I was right about 100th.  Not a very good showing, but overall I think I played my hands as well as I could and caught a tough break.
