So I pulled off the side of the road and drove home at 30mph.   I notice that as I brake the van shakes a lot too. I had plans to goto the dump and empty out the van and then goto the hardware store and buy lumber to frame the back porch, but that isn't gonna happen at this point.  I got home safe and sound and the left front wheel was noticibly hot.  I am thinking I have a busted rotor or something, but can't really see anything under there.  Instead I jump in the car and head over to my friends house and help him put a tree in.  2 times up and down his back yard with a load of sod in a wheelbarrow and some digging and I am whiped out.    We had pizza and then I went home.
