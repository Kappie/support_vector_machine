Being brand new at the whole blog world,  I've just been visiting my friends' websites or just browsing the internet searching for things of interest.  But I decided to try one of the RSS aggregators, I tried  urlLink Bloglines | Free, Web-Based News Aggregator . I chose Bloglines over the other aggregators because it's web based and free.  I use Windows and Linux at home so it's nice to get to use the same program on all machines.  After setting it up and subscribing to a couple of blogs I found it to be a most usefull tool.  It's a big time saver, all of the sites that I usaully visit are brought together in one place.  It's very simple and straight forward, that's good for me being as I just got into this whole blog thing a little over a week ago.  One of my friend's,  urlLink Chris , is the one who talked me into creating this blog in the first place, is a web developer and mantains his own site and blog.  He told me that he reads about 80 to 85 blogs a day using his RSS aggregator. To me that seems like alot but he insist that if I continue blogging I'll get hooked and start reading more blogs.  How nows, maybe he's right.  Until next time...
