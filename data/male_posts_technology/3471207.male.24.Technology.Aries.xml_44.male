It was a very attractive offer because i was thinking  of signing up next time too  but then i told her that until i get a job,  i won't sign up. So she gave me her number to make sure she gets my  business when i get a job..haha...well, i hope she's still working  then.hahha..  So when i was going to have my dinner, i took out a plate and went to  the rice cooker to get some rice. Just when i opened the lid, i saw Mr  Lizard!!!! He was there 1 foot away from the rice cooker and was at a  sideways position. He saw me but he didn't move you see. But i wasn't  freaked out by it because i know Mr Lizard is there 50% of the time i  take rice. I also wanted to take a picture of him but then aiyah, the  camera was in the living room and i didn't know whether it was charged.  And the whole time i was taking rice and when i closed the lid, he  didn't move at all!! Until i walked away then he walked away  too..hahaha..so cute!!!!! You should see him!!
