It is a higher level language than C++, but retains the ability to write high performance code and interface directly with the operating system API's and with hardware. D is well suited to writing medium to large scale million line programs with teams of developers. D is easy to learn, provides many capabilities to aid the programmer, and is well suited to aggressive compiler optimization technology.  You could explore much more about the language and its specs from the link to resource.   [Resource-Type: Weblink; Category: Programming; XRating: ??]
