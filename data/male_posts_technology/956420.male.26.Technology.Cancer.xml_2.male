Hence, the new title and directions.  New resolutions? Well, first up, I'm going to use this blog as my diary since my forgetfullness is getting serious. So pardon me if my blogs sounded a bit technical and obscure to some, me thinks only me and my my new collegue will understand it better.  About my personal life, I am pursuing back the woman that I love once more (give her name then...'NM' should do it). i don't want to cheat myself by hitching myself to my current girl (let's call her 'NZ'). Sure she nice and all but my feeling for her is just a brother-sister kinda way. Hope NZ understand though. Wish me luck on NM then...  On my financial side, I think I have to frugal. My roadtax  car insurance is due in 5 mths or so and I am missed one mth payment already!!! hope I can scrounge enough money by then.  Hope all my new resolutions can be met...  until next time!
