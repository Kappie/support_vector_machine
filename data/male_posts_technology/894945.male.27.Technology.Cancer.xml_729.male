It's been 24 hours and I gave up some 23 hours ago. It can be broken down into two problem areas:    1. Script/audience    Dire. Hollywood formulaic #3 kids-rescue-parents-in-peril (despite all original Thunderbirds fans being near or over 30) with a helping of #7 learn-valuable-lessons and #4 two-dimensional-villain (who has money, power and brains but somehow just wants illogical revenge).    It has kids being chased around by adults, goop, nobody getting too badly injured and a rather low joke count - all of which fall flat. I knew I was in trouble when Jonathan Frakes showed up as director in the opening credits.    2. Casting    Errrr. Well.. I like Bill Paxton, he made me laugh in True Lies and somehow managed to pull off Twister - but he is so wrong as top Tracey in charge of International Rescue. I didn't recognise any of the rest of the cast - which is normally a good thing but few made any sort of impression or seemed suited for the role. Brains was equally short changed. The villian seemed vaguely familiar as a crap baddie from somewhere else.    Penelope and Parker were passable although I think thats only because the actress playing Penelope is damned hot - male judgement tends to be skewed somewhat by such things.      The CG, ships, sets and locations looked great alas they needed to be  attached  to a somewhat better script and cast.
