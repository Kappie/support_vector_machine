I found that I was starting to do things that I usually only do when I am drunk....  Anyway, to answer kevin's bitching question("Don't worry Kev, I didn't take it personally"). I think we tend to complain when... a) we're bored b) we don't know what we're doing c)have really stupid management d) have a job. If anyone of these things is true, you're most likely not doing the thing you'd be choosing to do for 8 hours on a given day. Like take sleep for instance, I know an individual (perhaps 2) that loves to sleep almost all weekend:) Now preferably this individual would stay up all night surfing the internet and working on projects, unfortunately said individual has a job and therefore can't stay up till all hours of the night(although he does)  In other words, Bitching comes with a job:)  In other news, Travis is a bitch:)
