Ganja, what was it about you being a cowboy? Has the Tiruchi sun affected you?  Valli, the photos were nice, Sindhu where are your photos of your UK roundings?  Vijay, hope you reached Chennai safely?  Manny and Kavi, how is Chennai now, hot or cold?  Rini and Ram, any interesting news? Seems both of you are very busy for the past week.
