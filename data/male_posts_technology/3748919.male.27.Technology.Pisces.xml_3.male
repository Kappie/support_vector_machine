She ended up acting like the old bitch that she is by going to Bingo at the last minute and leaving me hanging for the evening after canceling or turning down any plans that I may have been asked to do. Word to the wise Gentlemen, DON'T GET MARRIED!! My top ten reasons fornot getting marriedguys:    10.BINGO!  9. When you get married you lose all rights to the remote.  8. The nagging gets worse.  7. Every sentence out of her mouth starts with "Can you" or "Will you".  6.You lose half of everything.  5. Your house becomes a Martha Stewart factory.  4. You have to visit with her parents on a regular bases.  3. You don't get laid on a regular bases.  2. You are stuck having sex with the same woman for ever.  1. NO MORE BLOW JOBS!!    These may not be the most amusing reasons for someone to read but their mine. I'll have a more amusing list when I'm not so pissed at my future ex douche bag.    Stay tuned to more breaking news about the "BIG D". This is only the Beginning.
