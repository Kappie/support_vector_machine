Sarah called me around 7 from camp which was cool because I was missin her a bit (hehe). Nothing much else happened today, which was ok.  Saturday... today was a really busy day that never actually ended. My morning was pretty dull... just hanging around the house cleaning up my room (it's still a mess, but I can see the floor!). Later in the Evening I went to my Aunt's and ate chinese food with the folks... Mmmm, I love Fried Rice. We came home at just the right time, because not 10 minutes after I sat down I heard my name from outside, and Peter was there. So he came over and we talked for a bit and played with computer stuff, and then he had to go catch his bus home... which he missed... and it was the last bus out. So we decided he'd spend the night (with permission, of course). Well around 2 we started getting bored, and then I noticed good ole Carinsdev on AIM. So we IM'd Armaan and it ended up he picked us up and we hung out all over.  We went to this cool construction zone and explored and had interesting exploits with spray paint, cones,  and wireless network cards. Then breakfast at McDonalds.... Mmm good times. I got home around 7:30 and went to sleep while Peter did stuff. Then we went to Church and dropped Peter off at a bus stop so he could head home.  After Church my mom went to her friends house and I went with her and saw The Butterfly Effect. It's a very weird and twisted movie, but actually pretty good... though I wouldn't suggest seeing it if you're depressed. After the movie I went to Becky's house and hung out for a while. They're so funny... they made some (really real looking!) dummies and stuck them in their neighbors living room... amoung other things. Over there I watched The Secret Window... which is a really creepy movie. I actually kinda liked it though... because I've always kinda wished the "bad guy" didn't get caught for once, and it happened.  I rode the bus home because I didn't want to wait for my mom to be done at her friends, and I found out that Sarah's bus broke down in the middle of nowhere on the way home... though as I woke up this morning I discovered she'd gotten home and told me she was safe, so that's a relief.  Now here I am at work... listening to The All-American Rejects and not really having much to do. I can't wait until payday.... I need to figure out what to get someone for a 6 month aniversary....
