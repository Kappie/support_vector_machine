The course was well run and concise, and fortunately it was shortened to a day's length instead of two full days as originally planned. So yes, I have half my weekend back! Still, I gotta complete my copy of the workbook and send it in for assessment before I'm awarded the certificate in senior first aid.  I was ready to jump on public transport home and Shihan asked me whether I was going to the kickboxing show at Town Hall and since I was broke I had no intentions of going. Well, turns out Shihan was given 4 ringside tickets to it, and he gave me one! It didn't seem like he was going to go anyways so I guess he would have given away all of them if he could have. (They're $150 a pop by the way!)  The night was pretty good - Town Hall is a great venue, but sadly they didn't pack the place, so the vibe was a bit dead. The undercard wasn't fantastic but the show definitely picked up towards the end with a war between the two lightweights  Reindhard Badato  (Australia) and  Hiroshi Mizumachi  (Japan).  Badato was strong in the initial 3 rounds and busted up Mizumachi's nose to the point he was bleeding constantly. Mizumachididn't seem to be very aware of the rules either as he was penalised for using illegal moves on quite a few occasions. However, he seriously picked up some steam going into the final 2 rounds and gave Badato a serious run for his money - ultimately Badato won on unanimous points decision (I expected that considering Mizumachi was penalised earlier on), and the Japanese crowd sure wasn't happy!  The main event was somewhat of an anti-climax as one of the fighters pulled out and was replaced by a relative unknown.  Nathan "Carnage" Corbett  who is a multiple title holder made short work of his opponent in the 1st round by ripping a hook into the poor bastard's ribs. I have never seen someone in that much agony from a single punch before... he was just outclassed.  Oh well, I took advantage of the opportunity to get an autograph and a picture as well, as you can see from my previous post.
