While the Taliban brought peace to the country after decades of war, one can argue that the destruction of the Taliban has left Afghanis worse off than they were two years ago. So, recent history does not bode well for the Iraqi conflict.  And today, we're  urlLink reading  that Iraq has denegrated into lawlessness, while the U.S. troops stand by. I can understand Saddam's palaces being raided -- hey, raiding a palace is truly a symbol of a country's new found freedom. But Iraqis are raiding UN buildings, foreign embassies, homes of private individuals, private factories, banks.  Religious leaders (both Saddam supporters and U.S. supporters) are being killed by mobs inside Mosques! Families (mother, father, children) are roaming around trying to find something to steal.   This proves the American plan was not well thought out.   I, like many people in the world I guess, have been undecided whether this war is a good thing or not. In theory, I'd like to see the world freed of all brutal dictatorships. Sometimes a revolution needs a gentle push to get going. But what is happening in Iraq? Is it a revolution? Or is it just pure chaos?   And exactly what is the real American motivation for this war? Don't talk to me about oil or freedom. WMD I was starting to believe. Perhaps the purpose is to start a worldwide peace? Or worldwide U.S. domination? Or is it just fun to flex your military muscle sometimes? Use up some of the old bombs so we can have an excuse to buy new ones...  Look forward to more uncertainty on this issue. From me, and from the President.
