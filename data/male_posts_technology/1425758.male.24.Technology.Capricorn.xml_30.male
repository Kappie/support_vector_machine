 Last Saturday Hadar talked me into buying a pair. Very cool-looking, Prince-branded, purple-tinted. I paid 340 NIS for them. The morning after i wore them and went out to work. In the few minutes that followed i avoided sunlight just like i did without them; the difference was that it gave me a horrible pain behind the ears, just like every other pair of sunglasses i ever tried (i don't care if it disappears after a few days, i didn't pay 340 NIS for pointless pain, even if it's temporary). We talked about it and Hadar said that i should keep the receipt, put the sunglasses back into their case, and return it to the store. She's so great. 
 The worst thing about this affair was giving up my principles, even though all the way i knew i was right. I should have stopped the shopping spree right there when i saw items sold for 59 NIS next to items of the same style and brand for 259 NIS. The clerk's explanation: "last year". A simple proof that sunglasses is  only  a matter of fashion -- not eye protection. 
 The  best  thing however, and the really important one is that we didn't fight about it. It's really amazing how we go on for almost a year and a half essentially without fighting. I love her.
