He advocated free health care, no pollution, limited forestry, animal rights and etc.  Today's  urlLink progressives  would've loved him.    His name was Adolph Hitler.  Hitler was a progressive.  That's my theory.  He and his cronies didn't come to power by promising to destroy a generation, and ruin the continent.  They came to power by promising a lot of "puppies and kittens" cowplop.  They probably believed it themselves early on.
