C#   I've been programming in C# ever since 1.0 came out. I've used it on my own and I've been using it at work and I find developing applications in C# is faster and sometimes easier than it is in C++. However, I've found it difficult to convince my co-workers and supervisor that there's nothing wrong with C#. Almost everyday I hear something like "Well the problem with the app is it's in C# and I don't know if..." or "We're going to have all these problems integrating because your app is in C# and it can't...". Some of them just don't get that I can do anything in C# that they can in C++.  Not all of them are like that. Some of them are impressed by what it can do and would learn it if they ever had the time to do so. If only we switched to C# full time here :)    Management Simulations   In an era where game companies spend millions of dollars developing games with really high end graphics that make all the geeks drool, I spend all my time playing games without any 3D animation. I spend all my time playing games where where you take charge of an organization or team. Welcome to the world of Management simulations. The first one I played was a football game on my IBM AT/XT way back when I was a kid. I don't even remember the name of the game because it's been so long, but I do remember that if I ran this one specific screen pass play I would score 9 times out of 10. I would run up a score of 300+ points without a problem.  In the time since that game I've played several really good management sims(Championship Manager, Front Office Football, Out of the Park Baseball, Eastside Hockey Manager) and have even started to write my own sim. It started out at first as a hockey sim, then it moved to rugby, then finally stopping at the one sport I know and play...basketball. I started working on my game, which I kept calling "World Basketball Manager" a few years ago...ok more than a "few" years. I'm planning on using this blog as a motivational tool to get me moving in some areas of the development and as a place to vent my frustration during the development of the game. For instance, there is a company in Greece that released a basketball management game called....."World Basketball Manager". Now while I'm upset over not copyrighting that name first I'm not at all upset at them for using it. A name is a name and a game is a game. I've seen their game and have read user reviews of it. They can keep the name as it seems to be the only thing good going for them!  Oh well, not bad for a first entry.
