Her: I'm calling about the Camaro. 

Me:  Ok, it's still available. 

Her: Can I come see it? 

Me:  Sure, when works for you. 

Her: How about this weekend? 

Me:  Ok, when? 

Her: Oh, I don't know, lunchtime?  

At this point, I got a little bit frustrated.  I dont want to hear "lunchtime", I want a specific time and date.  Anyway, I finally got her to decide on Saturday at noon.  She calls me Friday morning (a call I missed since I was in the parking garage) and says that she can't do it on Saturday and that Sunday at 5 PM would work better.  Ok, that is fine.  I get a voicemail Sunday at roughly 4 PM to say she can't make it at 5 PM and would Monday work.   I call her back, no answer, so I left a voicemail saying that Monday would be fine if she would please tell me a specific time.   She emails me this morning to say that either 6 or 7 PM would work.  I told her to give me a specific time and if she was going to change that time to tell me by 2 PM.  She writes back, saying 7 PM would be fine.   Here we are, 5:30 PM and she calls:  

Her: Hi Mike, I just wanted to see if we could meet earlier. 

Me:  Well, we decided on 7 PM. 

Her: I know, but I was wondering if we could meet at 6 or 6:30 PM. 

Me:  I already said that I would need to know by 2 PM if you were going to change the time. 

Her: I know, I was just wondering if you could get off work early. 

Me:  No, but 7 PM works for me. 

Her: Ok. 

Me:  (Cutting her off) Bye.  ::CLICK:: 

Holy cow.  I bet you $100 that she is going to show up 15 minutes late and then not know how to drive a manual transmission.  Just wait. 

UPDATE:  She can't drive a manual!   But, this is a car for her (I think) younger brother so I will give her a little slack.
