Today has been a very frustrating day.  You know when you still live at home (i.e. ME) and there's all this shit that your parents want you to do or ask you to do and they're just being parents it's fucking annoying.  And when they send you bitching emails to your corporate account, yeah, that's fucking retarded.  I need to get the hell out of my house.  I need that raise to be significant enough to allow me to get out.  Fuck the bullshit, period.  Then at work today, there's this one person that kept fucking bothering me for piddly little things everyday since last year.  I mean I dread seeing the guy in the halls because I fear that I might just snap and punch him in the ear.  I seriously feel like I want to land a nice right hook into this guy's face.  I'm sure he's a nice guy and shit but for real, I don't understand how this guy could reproduce.  Who could stand this guy long enough for him to ....UGH...Nevermind.  Bad visual.  Yeah I don't like the guy.  And the beer at north beach was a little shitty, it was shitty last night and I was shitty (literally) this morning till after lunch.  UGH!  Speaking of which.  Yeah I got my car back right?  And my darts were in there.  I finally brought them out last night and it was complete and utter domination.  Now I know that I'm confident about a number of things but I know that I am good at darts, that's a fact.  It was just insane beat downs that me and Jerry brought to Mark, Dave, John and Chris.  Lopsided wins with them having no chance to win it at all.  We won the first 7 games easily.  Average 2.7 - 3.5 marks per round.  Yeah that's not bad.  The score was also pretty bad it ranged from 120 - 0 to 450 - 119 or something like that.  Yeah I was on, except for the white knight I didn't get that.  We did lose 1 game.  This one guy got hot, opened with a white knight and just tore the game open right there.  It was bad.  I was able to get the score pretty close around the 7th round but he hit 3 triple 18s and just slammed the door shut for a possible comeback.  UGH, we came back the next game and whooped them though.  So record for last night was 8W 1L.  The only people that could quite possibly beat me 1 on 1 are Sam and Derek.  Sam still owes me like $45 coz he lost that many times against me.  Pay up BIATCH.  He won few but not enough to clean the slate.  When Derek is hot he's hot for the whole night.  It's hard to beat him.   he doesn't even play anymore so I think I could drive his dart game to ground and tell him "You Just Got Served!" like that dance movie that's out now of whatever.  Tonight will probably comprise of drinking while playing XBOX then hitting up the bar to watch a band later while playing darts, again.  602 I think has some sort of drink special on Fridays, I believe that it's $2 you call it's.  In any event, that should prove to be entertaining.  Tomorrow is back at North Beach.  There's a free party under the name Mark Mesa.  Anything free is always good.  Hang out there for a while and then possibly go to Alumni Club.  Of course I gotta take my car to the dealership to get it checked out and what not.  Eh.  I'm done.  Time to go.  You - Iwillcallyoulater  Everyone have a wonderful Friday or whatever day that you read this.
