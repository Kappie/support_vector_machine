(Cell groups are small groups where we come to share and encourage each other in our spiritual and personal lives) I could see that we are heading in the right direction to make cell group a much more conducive place for personal growth. Indeed there were alot of new ideas that came up and the overall tone during this meeting was exciting. Once we formulate a determined structure, i can see that we would be more comfortable to bring more friends too. Will talk about it next time.  Today was a day where i was working on the jurong website again. I completed the "free courses" page where free correspondence courses are available to anyone. Will post the webbie next time once there is an official launch. This jurong website thingy is taking me more time than i expected. Hmm..perhaps i'm not working to my full potential, like multitasking...haha.   Oh yes! Federer won another grand slam once again! Wimbledon 2004! I was hoping Roddick to lose. Actually both of them reminded me of David and Goliath with Roddick being the Goliath because of his power serves. Especially during the first set where you can clearly see Federer having trouble returning or even hitting his serves. On screen, they even calculated the reaction time you needed to return a "Roddick Serve". The time was 0.547 seconds...i was thinking..that's crazy! You can't even blink as you need all those milliseconds to capture the time the ball starts to hit off the racquet. Oh well, i'm still a beginner in tennis with an NTRP(http://www.sfu.ca/~tennis/ntrp.htm) of 2.5 so i'll just work my way up to get better.
