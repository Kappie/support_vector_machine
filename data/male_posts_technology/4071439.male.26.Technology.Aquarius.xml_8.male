She called me up on Sunday and asked if they could come. During the week I didn't get to see them that much since I was working till 6 almost every day, but we still went out for drinks on a couple of occations and I showed them my favorite hang-outs  urlLink Thor  and  urlLink Waynes . So come the weekend we decided to head down to  urlLink Juan-les-Pins  . We took the train, cuz I had been out with friends (my cousin+husband were tired) the night before to a rock club called Subway and didn't feel like driving.  We spent the whole day basking in the sun on the very busy beach in Juan. It's important to mention that it's the first decent sand beach between Nice and Cannes, that's why it's always packed. There's not a m² that's not occupied. I still prefer it to the beach in Nice. Early in the evening we walked up to Antibes, which is only 15 minutes away, and looked around the old town. After a refreshing cold Kronenbourg  urlLink 1664  we took the train further down the coast to the glamorous city of  urlLink Cannes .    As we were getting kind of hungry, we took a short stroll by the  urlLink Palais du Festival  and the Croisette before finding a restaurant. We had pizza at this Italian place. It was excellent. I would probably have chosen something else if I had been alone but, hey, pizza is good (if not very original). At ten we had finished our dinner, and we went back to the Croisette to watch the French entry in the International Fireworks Festival that's on in august. Fireworks are a great way to end an evening, and these were particularly good. They used lots of color, and finished off all in Gold.  Sunday morning we got up kinda late, and after breakfast we took my car to go on a road trip for the day. We headed eastwards along the coast to visit the peninsula of  urlLink Saint Jean Cap Ferrat , witch is beautifully situated between Nice and Monaco. The area is full of villas and luxurious palaces, some with their own private beaches carefully hidden from view by huge garden walls.     We parked our car in St. Jean town, on the eastern side, and after refreshing ourselves at a local bistro we walk to the nearby Paloma Beach. The setting is beautiful, with a view over  urlLink Villefranche  on the otherside of the bay, and the water crystal clear. In afternoon we picnicked on the beach  At 5 we decided to explore the rest of the peninsula, but it's wasn't easy fining your way in the narrow streets. We finally found the main road and headed towards Cap Ferrat, the southernmost point of the presque-île. On the western side the coast is rougher and the cliffs go straight out into the sea. We just couldn't resist the dark blue water, so we found a path winding it's way down through the rocks and dived in. If possible the water was even clearer on this side. The rocks went straight down to at least 20 meters, but there was some shallower parts a hundred meters out. I swam there with my cousin's husband and there was lots of coral and algae, and I wish I had had a mask and fins. The place was really calm and as the sun started it's descent the scenery seemed almost magic.
