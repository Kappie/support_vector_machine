To prevent such memories from fading away, i shall type it out.  Its about one fine evening. We had our dinner at Chinatown. As usual, we will walk along Swanston st, to Flinders St. station, where we would wait for her Cranbourne/Pakenham/Sandringham/Frankston bound train before i walk home.  BF: Hey! want to have a game of Table tennis? Stan: Sure, orkay!  So, my best friend and I walk to my apt, becoz at the basement of my apt, we have a blue table tennis table.  I dunno what got over me, i guess it was "Kid Mode"  Stan:"Hey, why not u take the lift, and i dash up the stairs?" BF: "Bu yao siao la"  But i guess i was rather adamant and want to break the usual rountine. I lived on the 10th floor. Each floor is separated by 2 flight of stairs, having 8steps for 1 flight. U must be wondering how come i know the configuration so well.  Stan:" Ok la, but u have to to press lvl 1,2,3.. then we start together. Med: "...."  So i help her press lvl 1,2,3. And the Race began!  G, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9------------>10  Stan:" *pant**pant**pant**pant**pant**pant* " BF : ( med, can u fill in on this part? i cant remember coz i was panting)  All these as mentioned, i could have forgotten, if not for a spark that triggered it. Once again! Credit goes to my best friend and tracy whom were talking about it.  Stairs, basically i would climb it when the following situation occurs 1. Stressed 2. Can't solve a programming bug 3. Gym routine.  Besides that, i feel that stairs, although its a simple object in everyday life, is often overlooked. Its there when u want to use it. It helps u achieve what u want to do, while staying rooted faithfully.  Will Blog again.
