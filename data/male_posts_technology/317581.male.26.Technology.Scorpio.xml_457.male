I think the question is more relative than anything. Am I good compared to the next person? Or am I good compared to Charles Manson? Or am I good compared to Jesus Christ of Nazareth?  I think before you ask if you're a good person, you need to decide what you're shooting for. Am I good compared to ghandi? Probably not?  Being a good person is a daily struggle. You take 1 thing that makes you a good person and I could maybe point out 1 thing that makes you a bad person. There are no good/bad people. There are just people.  If you aren't a child molester/rapist/alcoholic/non-motivated/drug addict/constant complainer/murderer/stealing candy from babies person then you're pretty damn good in my book. If people aren't constantly leaving the room when you enter, then you probably have friends somewhere:)  Be content to know that you are loved beyond your ability to comprehend. And love your neighbor as yourself.
