 Well, you know what I say?  I've got some life stocking to do.  Here I am, on the verge of my big trip to fabulous  urlLink Las Vegas , yet I can't help but feel down.  Why?  It's quite simple, actually.  There are too many parts of my life that are pulling me in opposite directions.  Here's a sample in no particular order:
 
      1.) My current work -- I won't lie.  It's kicking my ass right now.
      2.) My girlfriend -- I won't lie.  She's really bidding for the rock right now.
      3.) My family -- I see them maybe twice a year.  Three times, tops.
      4.) My career ambitions -- A bit muddled right now.
      5.) Money -- There never seems to be enough to go around.
      6.) My friends -- <Chandler Bing>Could they  be  any more geographically dispersed right now?</Chandler Bing>
 
 As you might imagine, more than just a few of these issues are in direct opposition of each other.  You wanna talk about the job?  Okay, let's talk about the job.  The job is killing me.  I lead a group of three (myself included), which is supposed to do the work of about 20.  If you do the math, that's roughly seven jobs per person.  And they're not even seven of the same job.  Oh, no.  I'm the manager, the analyst, the architect, the product carrier, the support guy, etc, etc.  Our company wants the world without committing resources.  A brief discussion with my boss this afternoon yielded an interesting nugget: The company, realizing that my team is severly under-staffed, has decided to commit off-shore resources to the project "soon."  What does this mean?  Well, it probably means that they are going to hire people from China or India, who cost about one third the price of hiring people to do the same work here in the US at twice the management cost minus a fifty percent hit in performance as we get the new people up to speed.  It all comes out in the wash.
 
 You may be saying, "So what?  Companies do that sort of thing all the time."  Well, I've recently put myself in a rather awkward position.  A couple of weeks ago, I told my boss that I was interested in moving to Northern Virginia.  Why Northern Virginia?  A few reasons:
 
      a.) Said girlfriend lives there,
      2.) Living in Northern Virginia places me within range of my parents (4 hours driving or so), and
      d.) Northern Virginia is the epicenter of two career options that are weighing heavy on my mind.
 
 Now things start to take shape.  So we have a girlfriend in VA, unwilling to move.  We have a steady income stream in New York.  We have the family, which we never see.  We have friends and business contacts who we shouldn't leave.  School and starting a business with old college pals beckons from the Commonwealth.  The Empire State has, well, it has stability.  What's a guy to do?  Punt.
 
 Debbie-  "So what's your business?"  
 Martin-  "Professional killer."  
 Debbie-  "You get dental with that?"  
 
 Yeah.
