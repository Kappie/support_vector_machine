Google is seting up its R  D division in Bangalore . ( started man  ?) and Intel is developing the next generation 802.11g and wireless chipsets at Bangalore.  Now, these are not cost cutting moves.   The first news, I tried to /. but they did not find it much interesting to be posted and turned down.
