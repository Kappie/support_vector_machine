I'd like to debunk that thrice-accursed philosophy, but I'm afraid die-hard optimists permeate the world, so I'll simply have my say and hope people will listen.  Possession is relative, just like everything else. A person's status quo- that is, the way they are- is the baseline for possession, and as such there is no 'galactic standard' for whether somebody is poor. The beggar in the street is as used to his condition as I am to mine. The exception is the addition of permanent discomforts of the physical senses in the extreme. For instance, repeated instances of nearly freezing to death, constant agonizing hunger, or parching thirst. These things, since one cannot become 'accustomed' to them, denote a person as poor.  Now I can't see how 'remembering all the things I have to be thankful' is going to make me a better person. Given it's a good idea to keep in mind how blessed one is- and this is coming from a teenager particularly blessed- but at the same time I refuse to be dragged down by guilt over the advantages I've been gifted with in life. When people tell me, 'how dare you be depressed with everything you've got,’ my answer is 'because teenagers all over the world struggle with it and I value my sense of community'. Which is a load of bull, of course, but it counters a thoroughly sentimental and hence useless idea with another of the same sort.  Just so that I can pretend that this blog will be productive in some way, let me encourage you never to settle for less.  Never take less than what you can have for the sake of guilt.  As long as you keep in mind that giving is more beneficial to you than taking, that approach will take you far in life.  My civic duty being done, I’ll leave now :)  Dan
