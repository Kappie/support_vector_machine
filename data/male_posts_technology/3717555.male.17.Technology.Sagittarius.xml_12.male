I mean, think about it, if nobody was able to download illegal windows copies, would they still pay for it? And how many amateurs would actually  buy  photoshop and 3d studio max - when they can use  urlLink the GIMP  and  urlLink Blender 3D   and  buy a few cars for the very same price?  Perhaps it's the open source community that should fight software piracy much rater than the propietary software industry? Sure puts the  urlLink BSA  in a whole new position...
