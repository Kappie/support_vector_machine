Had an absolutely brilliant time, I had he bestest house m8's EVA!  I only realise afterwards that I only went to two classes all weekend but it was still a great time..  Myself and Bubbles decided last Tuesday that we would enter the Open floor competition but only started working on the routine at 4PM on Saturday.. 7 Hours later we were performing it and it actually came out surprisingly well.. We managed to hit all the cues we had planned for ourselves and kept the routine reasonably in order. Also had an absolutely amazing time performing it.. It was a great laugh and we managed to do what have fun as we did it.  Quite tired now, maybe that's what has me down.. Anyway, dum de dum..
