The commanders believe that the spectre of the deposed leader and his two sons is fuelling the growing resistance to the American occupation."  So the U.S. believes that the reason they are under attack (500+ attacks so far) is that Iraqis still fear Saddam Hussein. If Hussein were dead, they figure, their job would be easier.   Why isn't anyone suggesting that the reason why they are under attack is that they  are not wanted  there? That would seem to be a more logical explanation. Things are worse in Iraq, not better, since the war started. As well, American troops have been heavy handed with the average citizenry (house to house searches, hands above your head, on your knees, blindfolds, etc.).  Don't get me wrong. If I was a U.S. soldier in Iraq, I wouldn't trust anybody. If you let your guard down, a six your old child can throw a grenade at you. But if I was a resident of Iraq, I would hate to have troops pushing "innocent" people around. Or pointing guns at me on a regular basis. Or opening fire in a crowded market. Or just making me feel like a piece of dirt in my own country, while the leaders of the troops sleep in Saddam's old palaces...
