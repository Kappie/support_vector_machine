Instead it has come into my mind that he may indead have found a new girl!!! Lets look at the facts shall we...  a) He hasn't been seen for a long while, b) He hasn't spoken to anyone via phone for a while, c) He hasn't answered any of his answerphone messages, d) He hasn't riddled us with twisted sexual inuendo for a long while, e) He hasn't posted a thing for that matter in a while!!!  I think it is obvious that Gristy may have been sedused by some Mongbat of some description! And therefore it may be a good idea to change our MSN names from 'Save Custard from EverQuest campaign' to 'Where the hell is Gristy campaign'....just a thought, so let me know what you guys think.  Going back to my first point of motion, why is Adam's erect nipple on the girls site??!! I found it extremely disturbing that during one of my many daily trips to their site that I was confronted by this horrific display of our gracious leaders nipple flesh (grimaces at the thought). If only I knew how to post pics on our main page I would put something up that would put Toaster's pic to shame hehe!!!  Well thats all folks...Baity signing off.....
