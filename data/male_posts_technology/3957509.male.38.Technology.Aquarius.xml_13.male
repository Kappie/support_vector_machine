My head is still spinning, and Chris is so lost and hurting right now. I wish I could just take Chris' pain, but I know that I can't.  Colm is such a wonderful man! When he and I decided to move our relationship forward, I don't think he knew what he was getting himself into. Life seemed simpler two months ago. No tragedies, no family drama. But since we said yes, my Dad went into hospital with a major heart attack, another good friend of mine was diagnosed with colon cancer, Drew dies; and yet, Colm has been by my side through all of this, being my strength, the shoulder to cry on, the arms to hold and comfort me. After the funeral, I think Colm and I need to get away for a few days.  Jumbled thoughts today from a frazzled mind.  Peace!
