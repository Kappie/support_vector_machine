Well not really I do actually enjoy the time.  However this weekend I kept on thinking I had studying to do, but there was none at least not of too much importance now.  The only studying I am going to do is to learn the zip codes for UPS so I can become a sorter and make a dollar an hour more.  I am also going to try and keep up on my Chinese and review my math for next quarter.  Other than that I am free!! for now at least.
