They are probably laughing all the way to the bank.   Quote taken from a PCS union e-mail: 'Members may like to know that the amount on offer is 2.2% on the base competency points for all with box 3 or higher. Those who have achieved a box 2 will have £120 as a non consolidated bonus and those with a box 1 get £250 as a non consolidated bonus. Pay progression is once more not payable because of the current climate within EDS. However they have agreed to "enter into meaningful dialogue with PCS on a fair, reasonable, and affordable mechanism which provides all employees a realistic opportunity to achieve pay progression". To this end we have an initial meeting scheduled for October.'     As everyone one knows a percentage pay raise of naff all is naff all, thats basic schoolboy maths. Funny how the ex-ICL employees get approx 3 to 5 percent and I know some standard terms staff got upto 9%. They really are complete bastards, civvies who are about to be 'out-sourced' be warned.
