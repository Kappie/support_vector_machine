  It's all about the budget. If you design to web standards you need only develop one code base instead of writing to a specific browser or spending many hours writing hacks to old proprietary browsers. You have to let go of the 4.x browsers which only has a 5% market share. If you can sell that you can make your life much easier. I think the best way to sell losing Netscape 4.x is to mention the additional budget dollars you'll need to support the lame browser.
