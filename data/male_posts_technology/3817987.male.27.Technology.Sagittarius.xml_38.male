They were labeled as being part of "Frank Balck Album", yes Balck not Black, and all the track titles were Pixies songs.  I figured what the hell and downloaded the lot of them.  The tracks them selves are pretty impressive.  They are experimental reworking of Pixies classics with new vocals from Frank.  At first I thought they were from some strange internet mash-up type thing but it turns out they are from the forthcoming album  Frank Black Francis , a collaboration between Frank and Two Pale Boys.    These tracks are really amazing.   Holiday Song  has a marching band arrangement,  Monkey Gone to Heaven  is a slinky almost bossanova tune, and  Nimrod's Son sounds like a deconstructed Residents song.  Their are lots of Jazz type arrangements and other weird stuff.  Frank's new vocals are awesome.  I can't wait to pick this up when it comes out legitimately!
