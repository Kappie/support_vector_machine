I'm lazy today so I'll be quoting from almost the entire review of  urlLink Roger Ebert  to describe the story:  The film follows the traditional pattern of many other teenage comedies. There's a clique ruled by the snobbiest and most popular girl in school, and an opposition made up of outcasts, nonconformists and rebels. /.../ What's different this time is that the teen queen, Hilary Faye, is the loudest Jesus praiser at American Eagle Christian High School, and is played by Moore /.../.  Her opposition is a checklist of kids who do not meet with Hilary Faye's approval. That would include Dean, who thinks he may be gay; Cassandra, the only Jew in school and an outspoken rebel, and Roland (Culkin), Hilary Faye's brother, who is in a wheelchair but rejects all forms of sympathy and horrifies his sister by becoming Cassandra's boyfriend. There's also Patrick, /.../ the son of Pastor Skip, the school's principal. He's thoughtful and introspective and isn't sure he agrees with his father's complacent morality.  The heroine is Mary (Malone), whose mother Lillian (Parker) has recently been named the town's No. 1 Christian Interior Decorator. Mary's boyfriend is Dean. One day they're playing a game that involves shouting out secrets to each other while underwater in the swimming pool, and Dean bubbles: "I think I'm gay!" Mary is shocked, bangs her head, thinks she sees Jesus (he's actually the pool maintenance guy) and realizes it is her mission to save Dean. That would involve having sex with him, she reasons, since only such a drastic act could bring him over to the hetero side. She believes that under the circumstances, Jesus will restore her virginity.  Jesus does not, alas, intervene, and Mary soon finds herself staring at the implacable blue line on her home pregnancy kit. Afraid to tell her mother, she visits Planned Parenthood, and is spotted by Cassandra and Roland.  Cassandra: "There's only one reason Christian girls come downtown to the Planned Parenthood!"  Roland: "She's planting a pipe bomb?"  You see what I mean. The first half of this movie is astonishing in the sharp-edged way it satirizes the knee-jerk values of Hilary Faye and her born-again friends. /.../  At the time Mary sacrifices her virginity to conquer Dean's homosexuality, she's a member of Hilary Faye's singing trio, the Christian Jewels, and a high-ranking celebrity among the school's Jesus boosters. But the worldly Cassandra spots her pregnancy before anyone else does, and soon the unwed mother-to-be is hanging out with the gay, the Jew and the kid in the wheelchair. They're like a hall of fame of outsiders.  Dean's sexuality is discovered by his parents, and he's shipped off to Mercy House, which specializes in drug detox and "degayification." Once again the screenplay, by director Brian Dannelly and Michael Urban, is pointed: "Mercy House doesn't really exist for the people that go there, but for the people who send them," says Patrick, who is having his own rebellion against Pastor Skip, and casts his lot with the rebels. Lazying it up further by quoting from  urlLink James Berardinelli's review  to express my opinion of the movie: The film's main flaw - the kind of narrow-mindedness of which it ironically accuses its subjects (in this case, the less religious a character, the more positively they are portrayed) - might be forgivable if Saved! made an interesting or original point/.../. But /.../ the characters are developed in facile ways, and [the] message lacks subtlety. Just because I may sympathize with some of what [it] has to say doesn't mean I'm impressed by the way [it says it]. Sermonizing is sermonizing, regardless of whether the doctrine being preached is based on the Bible of the Church or the Bible of Liberal Politics.   [Religion is treated] as a disease, not a life choice. It's something people need to be cured of in order to live a meaningful life. (Maybe they don't have to give it up altogether, but the fundamentalist aspect needs to go.) In order to refine this point, Mary is made increasingly sympathetic the further she drifts from her beliefs. Most of the "true believers," like Pastor Skip, Mary's mother, and Hilary Faye, are shown to be hypocrites. And the sympathetic supporters are non-believers Roland and Cassandra. It doesn't take long before it's apparent that [the] objective with this film is not just to lampoon fundamentalism, but to express contempt for it. In this world, the path to salvation comes through renouncing Jesus, not embracing him. To end on a more personal and positive note, I'd like to mention some of the actors and say that I blame the script for any faults of their characters, not their acting abilities.  I've never seen a bad performance by  urlLink Jena Malone  in any of her many movies, and she's not bad here either.   I was happy to see  urlLink Marie-Louise Parker  in it as I adore her Amy Gardner character on the  urlLink West Wing .  It's great to see  urlLink Macaulay Culkin  back on the screen again, especially as he's quite good in this one.  Finally, the actress who is the reason I saw this movie in the first place,  urlLink Mandy Moore . I've eagerly awaited every one of her movies especially since her first one  urlLink A Walk To Remember  turned out so good. Unfortunately none of her following movies have been as good, but her individual performance have always been good. She has consistently proven herself to be more than just a pop-princess, both in acting and singing. For example, her latest record,  urlLink Coverage , contains covers of songs from the '70s and '80s and is surprisingly good. -->
