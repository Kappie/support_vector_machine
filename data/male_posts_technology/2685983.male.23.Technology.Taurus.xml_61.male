I gave Dean a call and we both wanted to go see the A.C. Newman show at  urlLink Amigos .  We got there around 11 and the show hadn't started yet and there were a lot less people than I expected. Cover was only $8. We sat right up front.  Opening was The Neins from Vancouver. None of them looked older than 20 years old but, damn, they did impress me with their songs. I'd say they pretty much did everythimg right. The singer was a lot like Jonathan Richman in his lyrics and mannerisms and they way he stared into the audience. Musically they had the vancouver sound and a bit of the Beatles via Elephant 6.  After the Neins played I bought A.C. Newman's LP and The Neins CD (both excellent, btw). Deans and I talked to the drummer and bassist/keyboardist of The Neins for quite a bit. It's really good to have Dean in our band because he's a born schmoozer. Anyway, they're really nice people.  Next A.C. Newman played and the place started to fill up a little more. Still nobody got up to watch which was a little disappointing. The girl playing bass was from The Gay and the drummer was from Copyright. I don't know where the guitarist/keyboardist, Shane, was from but he was really good. Various Neins came up and joined on some songs. Overall I found that the vocals and guitars were too quiet and it would have felt more livelier if people had gotten up. The set seemed really short but was altogether really good. I still have "The Battle for Straight Time" in my head.  I grabbed a poster from the wall after and saw that the drummer was about so I had him sign it. Some other kid was getting things signed too so the drummer led us into the back room to hang out with the bands. They had tons of beer to spare so they offered us some. I had a Sol. Everyone signed my poster and I got Carl to sign my LP jacket. I hung around for awhile and talked about The Pixies and transportation and then I left to find Dean. He was talking to The Neins again and I let him know there was free beer back there. LOL. I swear me and Dean probably talked to Mr. Newman for an hour. It felt like we were interviewing him after awhile but he was really nice and didn't seem annoyed at all. We talked about doing the solo thing, Neko Case, The United States, touring, festivals, Vancouver, The Fiery Furnaces, Clinic, Spoon, Modest Mouse, Franz Ferdinand, the last Pixies show, San Francisco, Austin, The New Pornographers...  We chatted with The Neins a little more and they demanded we take some beer home with us so I did. Those two Sol were sure refreshing on Monday afternoon
