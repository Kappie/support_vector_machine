Anger, as they say, is a hot coal, let go, it fades away, held closely - it burns. Someone wronged me a while back, bit the hand that fed, so to speak.. but the person in question , I'm convinced, had no idea that what they were doing was hurtful or decietful.. I believe at the core of every person there is goodness.. and that in there own way, every person does whatever they do because in their mind, there is justification for doing so. If we feel wronged, it may be just that we dont understand them, and their reasoning, rather than that they were intentionally hurtful toward us. I'm a happy person, I have a fortunate, and good life, I dont know of any god, to thank for this.. I think to some degree we're the creators of our own destiny.. but I do believe in fate, and that things happen for a reason. Every day the people around me, remind me, just how lucky I am. Those people make me smile when I'm sick, angry, upset and tired. Those people are why I am here, that I might spend my life, trying to return the favour. Gracias. ttfn.
