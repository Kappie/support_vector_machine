I think it is about time to take the gloves off before this guy starts to inspire more followers. I donâ€™t know if we are still using psychological warfare on these Islam-o-fascists but it is their only weakness. Also, if they run into a "holy" place, [Mosque, outhouse, or whatever] they put that place in jeopardy and we need to make that clear by bombing the hell out of these sites if they are used as staging grounds.
