The master and his servant have exactly the same fate.  From a cradle to a casket. There ain't no way to escape.  But everything you do is leading to the point where you just won't know what to do. And at that moment you may laugh but there is someone there who will be laughing louder than you. So it's true, the trick is complete. Now you have become everything you said that you never would be. You're a fool!  You're a fool!   ~ to the  fools
