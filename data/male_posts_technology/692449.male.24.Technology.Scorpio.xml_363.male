I still need to find a new job, but I'll have plenty of time to do that after I stop working at that shitty place. In other news school work is really piling up so I'm going to have to stop going over to the guys house and do homework. I picked up Morrowind last night and started playing it and it is a super cool game. I think I'll have to pick up the add ons.
