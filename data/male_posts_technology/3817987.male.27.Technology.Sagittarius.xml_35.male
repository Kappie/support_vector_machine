I didn't think he could top "Icicle Falls" from the last issue of Eightball, which was better than both Ghost World and David Boring,  but his new story "The Death-Ray" is beyond praise.  I can't find the words to describe how good it is.  It's nominally a super-hero story about a boy named Andy and how he discovers his super-powers, but it is far more than that.  It really is a character study but to say more would spoil the fun.  And the art? It's puurrty!
