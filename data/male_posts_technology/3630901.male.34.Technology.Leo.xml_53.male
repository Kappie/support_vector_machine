She watched a little TV with me until I turned it off ... gogde it hadke to writke when Im lying down om y stomach.  I'll try to type a little more clearly.  Out of a big bag of chocolate chips, we had about 2/3 cup left.  Not much to go on.  That's about 1/3 the recipe on the back of the tollhouse package.  So, let's see ... what is 1/3 of 3/4 - that's easy, 1/4.  What is 1/3 of 2 1/4 cups flour?  That is 1/3 of 9/4 cup of flour -- again, easy, 3/4c.  Here a harder one.  A cup of butter consists of two equal sticks, 8 tbsp each.  How do I get a 1/3 of that?  Rather than take 1/3 of each stick, take 2/3 of one stick, leave the other alone.  2/3 = .66.   5/8 = .62  so I need a little more that 5tbsp of butter (I can't believe it's not butter}.  Then the hardest one -- 1/3 of 2 eggs.  Again, a diet substitue, using fake eggs (the have a more markting friendly name).  1 carton contain 2 eggs.  So I want 1/3 the carton, whch hold 1.2c of liquid - 1/6 cup.  I broke it down to the number of tablepoons, using butter as the baseline -- so I use 2 full tbsp and about 2/3 a portion of a tbsp.  I think was right.  The cookies came out great, and Ivy had a fun time make them  with me and licking the batter from the mixer, and from the bowl  While they baked I saw that Lisa had called around 9pm, but no message (caller ID).  I called her back and maybe woke here.  I aksed to join her for temple, which was meeting 8 off Park ave.  L said it would be fine while she took care of the kids.  I guess Saturday was my day.  I met Lisa at temple and went in sat next to each other.  She introduced me to serverl other poeple that she knows at the temple.  Then they read and chanted from the hymnal.  Everyone was friends, a probably wondering if I was Lisa new  boyfriend.  After that I tried to persuad her to let me into it apartmet to change, but she refused on grouds that her home was a message.  I kept pushing when I should have just let it to.  I waited outside for a few minutes, then she joined me in my car and we drove to the meeting spot in trumbull.   We hiked on the pequonnock river valley trails.  About halfway in, Debi wa tired and ready to head back.  We crossed over  the strdy brdge to the other side where it's a lot of walker and runners, and bikes casual and serious.  It's a bit less that it our trail  By the time we got to the bottom,  they realized that w'ed need to walk back daniels farm road to the lot to get our cars.  It was fun but I would have prefered to stay on the side of the road with the real trails.  Aftr the hike, Lisa and I had lunch at bloodroot.  I had vegan burger sandwich, rosemary chipe, small salad, apple raspberry juice, and an water.  After that Lisa invited me to see Fahreneit 9/11 with friends from temple.  We were a little last, and when I didnt see lisa, I was tempted to go see spiderman 2.  But then Lisa popped out and had me sit with her between some cuouples.  After the show, we all went to Circle Diner to discuss politics, the movie, and local events.  I had 1/2 phlly cheese steak  dipped in au jus.  Some onion ring.  And a great chocolate shake.  The food was surprisingly good for a diner, I thought.  Then we made our separate ways and I drove home.  I wathed a little tv and then went to bed, consiously taking no ambien.  So went to sleep and woke at 1:30.  I laid here for a minute, and popped on the TV.  I masturbated, eved though I schould control that need / desire sh that on to perform, something bad doesnt' happen.  Then I thought I'd take an amdien  I also watched more TV.  Until  taxi driver ended at 2:30 or 3.  Them I started to get dreary and I'll work a little.   >> i sense a woman at my lamp, looking down at me.
