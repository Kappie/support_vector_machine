Checking the wayback machine shows that this list was updated on an orderly schedule by some family members of his. The websites are all gone now, of course.   I have occasionally considered military conscription, in the form of draft or similar. I'm not really sure how I would handle it. But we'll see what happens.   In the meantime, enjoy this list of things that Soldiers are not allowed to do.
