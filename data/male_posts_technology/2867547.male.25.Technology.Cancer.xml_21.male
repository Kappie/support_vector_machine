And  Hristo asked the rhetoric question:"Why would anyone want to do this to himself?" The two possible answers are ignorance or reluctance to experiment and change one's working habits. Since in my company source control usage is still an emerging practice (we used VSS in only one project so far) I have to convince some of my colleagues that it's worth it. So I included most of the ideas from Hristo Deshev post's and added some new points about the benefits of transparency etc. I also made it clear that working in a common environment requires more discipline. This also includes using standartized naming conventions (C# language is targeted). Let's hope that my efforts are not wasted...  P.S. If you are interested in this 4 page Bulgarian essay, I can e-mail to you right away.
