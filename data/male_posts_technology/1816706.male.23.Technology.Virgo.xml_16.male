So make sure that you go to both because most of the new ones are on the second page.  I got an email from some people on Oahu yesterday and I had to come back to Oahu to do an interview in Honolulu so I am staying at the hostel in Honolulu for 2 days and I got a chance to upload everything, still hoping to be out to Kauai for a week, or at least thats the plan, but it was good to be back on Oahu, kinda felt like I was coming home.  Still some people that I know at the hostel and I got to room with one of my old room mates Adam who is pretty cool and is working on getting some kinda connection for finding a place to live!  Anyways check out all the new pics.  There's some new ones in the Misc. section, the 4 Maui sections, and Oahu Pearl Harbor and Oahu North Shore.  Aloha!
