"THURSDAY, December 31, New Year's Eve - Consider, if you will, the morning boner. What a metaphor of hope and renewal! How can anyone give way to despair when one's groin greets each new day with such a gala spectacle of physiological optimism? And what an anotommical prod to philosophical contemplation on the final day of the year" pg. 493 - Youth in Revolt, C.D. Payne   And now I can't remember the other quotes I wanted to share:( Well, Cliff is supposed to come back tonight(cross my fingers)  Check you guys latah
