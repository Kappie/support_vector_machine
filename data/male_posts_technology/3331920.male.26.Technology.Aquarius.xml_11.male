It's produced right here in Halifax and it definitely takes some getting used to, but after 3 episodes i was hooked.  Beyond that, I was talking to my Mom today and she had gone to a New Waterford wedding shower.  The bride and groom pulled in about 3000 dollars, needless to say it was a big turnout.  Two days away from Triplets of Belleville.  I'm amused at myself for being as pumped up to get a movie that i've never laid eyes on.  With the weekend winding down i'm looking forward to Triplet's on Tuesday, and i'm taking a trip down to Cape Breton this Friday with my wife to visit my folks.  We're also bringing the 'orangutan', our kitten Ginny.  Spring/summer trips to Cape Breton are actually really nice.  The trip along the Bras'dor Lakes has some terrific views and hopefully one of these days we'll actually stop take some pictures instead of driving right by.  There's a good excuse to get a new digital camera.  And on that note,  I'm out.
