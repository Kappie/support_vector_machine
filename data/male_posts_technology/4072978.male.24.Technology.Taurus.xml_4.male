Basically it started off with this family, a man and his wife and a child (young girl).  The man was a baseball player, for what team I don't know, and I don't know what position he played either.  This man, was a kind man but NO ONE liked him, he was clumsy and could not play baseball well anymore.  His team mates would always play pranks on him and these pranks would often make him delayed in coming home to his family.  So his wife was not to pleased with him either.  His wife was pretty, still young, bright blue eyes and dark blonde hair.  Then there was me, I came in on the seen and I was not unlike this other man, but I was confident and I was very kind and I was very helpful.  I helped the wife get things done that she needed to do, I was supportive to her daughter, and I was a good friend to her husband and helped him out of the pranks that were put forth to him.  One day though three things happened... His wife told me that she fell in love with me, and I told her that the feelings were mutual... the man's work called and told me they were going to fire him and wanted me to take his place.. and on my way to the baseball field I found the man, and another prank was being pulled...  He was buried up to his neck in grungy dirt.  I fought of the guys that were guarding him and went to find a shovel to dig him out, but then another guy came and used a hose to make the guy neck deep in mud.  At the moment I "lost" the shovel and I always found another excuse not to find the shovel or find to did the guy out.  Hmmmmm.... so I am not really going to analyze this until after work.  I'll put it in my comments... I have some interesting ideas about what this dream means to me.  Feel free to comment.
