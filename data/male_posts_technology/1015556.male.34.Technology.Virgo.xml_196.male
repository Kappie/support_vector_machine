First, was their list of core values: -passion for God -unreached peoples -church planting movements -the local church -team centered -innovation and flexibility -ethos of grace -participatory servant leadership WOW - does this make the hair on your neck stand up?  It does to me, but I guess that's just my thing... The other thing they said in the report was that for the past 3 years, they have sent one missionary to the field every week.  Man, that is intense. I'm also glad to report that we have a family that we support through Pioneers, and they are all about these values.  The are money.
