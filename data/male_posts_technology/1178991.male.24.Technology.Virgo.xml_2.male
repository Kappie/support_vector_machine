This will also be a collection of links that I have found useful.  Right now I am reading through a bunch of books on test driven development and OO development recommended to me by  urlLink John Gray ,  and they are quite excellent.  Here are some of them :     urlLink Object-Oriented Thought Process  by Matt Weisfeld   urlLink Test Driven Development: By Example  by Kent Beck    urlLink Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture  by Martin Fowler   urlLink Peopleware : Productive Projects and Teams, 2nd Ed.  by Tom Demarco, Timothy Lister  The last one is especially interesting, particularly if you are a manager of any technical kind.  Also, here are a few software tools I am currently working with, or trying out :     urlLink JMeter  for stress testing   urlLink HttpUnit  for web unit testing   urlLink Simple Test  is a PHP unit testing / mock objects framework  Lastly, for you PHP developers out there that want to take a walk on the wild side,  urlLink Sitepoint.com  has the best advanced PHP forum out there by far, and  urlLink this post  is one of the best collections of useful resources I know of.  I encourage you to read each and every one of those links.  It will completely change the way you code.
