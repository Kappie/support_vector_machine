That, kind of, was the goddamn point of right clicking on your sorry ass in the System tray, and selecting "Exit" !  And stop sending me popups every 3 minutes "informing" me that I'm signed into multiple locations. And stop displaying logs of my conversations at these remote locations. Log me the F**K off remotely you dimwit !  And you're supposed to make sounds when messages ARRIVE, not when I send em out ! Jackass.   Arrgh. Why am I using AIM again?    There goes that notification.  * slams head against wall *   Ok so I'm sure all this can be fixed by setting some obscure "Stop making my life hell" checkbox in the prefs. But I can't help but feel that the bozos at AOL went the extra yard to make AIM the "annoyingest" app ever, when used as installed.
