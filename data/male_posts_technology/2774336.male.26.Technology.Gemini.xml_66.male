 Today was my first day of work.  The nerves were running hot most of the morining and I was afraid to eat the rest of the day.  I got home at close to 6:00 and I feel like making up for lost time in the food department, so I'm staying home to eat tonight. 

  Update:  Seems like I've been packing it away tonight!  I've had what feels like a lot of food, but its only little bits of food in a variety.  Everything was going well until I had the last of the Rotini, about 20 noodles, with heavy salt.  They didn't go down too well and I had a hard time belching afterwards.  Now I have heart burn.  Is it the salt?  I do feel full though.  Not the sick, bloated kind of full but the more satisfying kind.  It is already 10:00 at night and I know I won't be laying down to bed anytime soon with this heartburn and full belly.  Damn.  I've  got  to eat durring the day! 

 So after the food tonight, the belching continues with a little bloating and nausea topped off with heartburn.  If I were in this condition at work, I would definately be hiding in the bathroom.  Maybe I can take my laptop into the stall with me!  I'm not expecting to feel better until around midnight, which means I wont sleep until at least 2 am again.  Well, it was almost a plan. 

  Update:  My guts just made something like a cramping - convulsing feeling and I got real nauseous.  That sucked.  I still cant get the feeling of acid out of the back of my throat and that is also making me feel sick, along with the bloating.  My mouth says "eat something to get rid of this acid" but my stomach says "don't you dare send anything else down here, or I'll send it back!"  I'm not getting to sleep until well after 2:00 am.
