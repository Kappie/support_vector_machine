Alice, Jaimie, Mike and Dave.  We started at the Head of the river which is one of the more stylish and prominent pubs in oxford.  It greets all travellers coming along abingdon road from south Oxford when they go over the Thames and enter central Oxford. A great pub that has wonderful atmosphere which you ultimately end up paying extra for.  But you can't put a price on good times right?  I know I've whinged about friends being fashionably late, but my flat mates and I managed to get in about an hour and a half later than anyone else due to us being sensible and cooking up some sheperds pie to have before hand.  Of course, what do you do while you're waiting for everything to cook?  Have a couple of beers and a few bottles of wine.  By the time we actaully reached the pub, people there were having to catch up to us instead of the other way around!  It was a fair turn out of about 30 people from work and 10-15 other people that I didn't recognise.  I assume they were friends who though they could brave going to a work party.    We then went on to go to Checkers and then Thirst for cocktails and a bit of a boogey.  By this time it was roughly 2 in the morning and the full days work was starting to kick in.  So with more drink and a couple of rough piggie backs from friends, we all hopped on the bus and headed home!  Any surprises?  It can't be a work party without a bit of gossip.  One of my good friends, Kirsty ended up pulling another good firned of mine Bush.  The fact that Bush had been chasing Kirsty for months was turned on it's head when she ended up going after him.  I think everyone was taken by surprise no less than Bush himself.  Still.  Happy days and it's very cool to see them all kissy and huggy huggy.  I'm sure I'll get tired of it in the next week and tell them to "Get a f*cking room."  Saturday involved playing cards.  I got home at about 3 from the pub crawl and was up at 7 again as I was going to pick up some friends for a tournament in stokenchurch which is about half way between oxford and london.  There were just over forty competitors and I managed to make top 8.  It was GREAT to see a friend of mine, Neil, whom I get to see rarely these days on account of him being a respectable new father.  As soon as we finished I headed straight back into Oxford and picked up Prudence and Miriam.  Prudence is a very sweet lass that I know from back in Adelaide.  I knew her from her days in the Adelaide Jane Austen society.  Fortunately, those days are long behind us.  In case you were wondering, my mother is the Chair of this society and i would go along and offer support as the dutiful son pi.e. break legs of any hecklers].  I'd like it known that my interest had nothing to do with Colin Firth whatsoever.    Miriam is an old family friend of Prudence and I gather they have known each other for years.  After picking them both up and taking them back home to wash up, we went back into oxford.  I took them to the Eagle and Child pub whose claim to fame is it was the "local Pub" for both J.R.R.Tokien and c.s.lewis.  We managed to fit only a pint in before the bar was closed which was unfortunate.  So we moved onto O'Neils which was doing a special in classic Irish music.   Aparently the listing of "classic" irish music is anything that is done by U2 or the Pogues.  Neither are in my top 500 bands and if it wasn't for the fact that it was the only pub around with a late license, I'm sure we would have moved on.  My flat mates met us and our drinking continued until the early hours and we took the bus back home.  for some reason everyone was in a fighting mood that night.  We must have seen about 3 different fights .. .. all at our bus stop outside the kebab van.  Apologies to Pru and Mim! Oxford normally isn't that bad! Honest.  I guess people had been drinking since 3 that afternoon as it was the FA cup final [ManU 3 vs Millwall 0].  Sunday was a mixtue of stonehenge and punting with a bit of chinese food thrown in.  Trying to compress that into one sentence was remarkably easy.    As the weather was so glorious I took them to stonehenge as it had been about a year since I had last gone and it's not too long a journey.  The girls always wanted to go punting as well, so I organised to go with a large group of us.  There was 11 of us that got together and we managed to fit on two punts easily enough.  Unfortunately, we were in the middle of oxford for convenients sake and no one had told us that there was a massive College rowing regatta on the following week.  Everyeone and their brother was out rowing to get some practice in.  It was very VERY tedious as we managed to get in every teams way.  I'd say I felt bad but we had every right as they did for being there and they really were THAT rude about it.  God I hate toffs and rowers are always the worst.  If they want the river that badly to themselves, I don't know why they don't ask "daddy" to buy them some little creek out of the way to pratice on .. .. .. .. .. say pluto.  Punting was great fun if a lot harder than I initially thought.  I admit though, I'm a dab hand at giving criticism.  No dramas there.  Tips for the would be punter: 1] Have a couple of beers before hand.  This gives you the confidence to get up on the stack at the end of the boat which is about half a foot above the cold murky water and be the only one with control over the 12 foot boat with nothing but a big chopstick. 2]Go somewhere quiet.  Being hit by rowing people is not fun.  Even if it is an all girls rowing club.  They all "cycle" together and if you get one in a bad move, they will ALL be in a bad mood.  Not pleasant at all. 3] Go somewhere shallow.  Sticking your chopstick into the water to find it slip through your hands as the water is over 14 feet deep is not much fun.  It's even less fun trying to explain this to an oncoming group of very angry and hormonal rowing girls. 4] have more beer to handle point number 3 better.  The eveneing was round up by going to the chinese and having some sweet and sour MSG; some crackling msg; some MSG chow Mein and some MSG with black bean and pepper.  Not bad, but I found myself bouncing of the walls at two in the morning meaning I have had even less sleep today than the previous two nights.  Oh well.  I guess during the week is when I'm supposed to be having a break but today is another dinner party.  Bushra is cooking us some sudanes dishes.  I'm not sure what to expect, but I believe it will come with couscous.  Will let you all know.  Anyway.  back to the daily grind.
