I have been trying to find, which I now have, a padded envelope to send a video to Brazil. I have annoyed someone in America. Oops. I have also, shockingly, tided up my room! dear god what is the world coming to when I tidy my room! Now I must make a start on my IT coursework after I change my 4 calendars over. Lets see, February: Josh Hartnett, Tom Welling, A1, Buffy. WAHOO! Don't forget Taken, 9.00pm, BBC2, Ryan's episode tonight.
