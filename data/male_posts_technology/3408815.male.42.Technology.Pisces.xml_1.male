With my wife on the couch, my son is watching cartoons, and my daughter on the computer (playing Sims). Working around the house makes me feel good. Do I feel a little used? Sure I’m not a not a dope, but if there is one thing I have learned is I have to take care of me.   Most people think that’s relaxing on a couch and catching your favorite shows, or playing a game or two on X-box. I have decided that is not what it means to me. Taking care of me is looking in the mirror each night and seeing someone who has done something. If I can count off a few accomplishments (they don’t have to be big ones), I’ll be able to sleep well that night.  When my ticket gets punched and I board that afterlife express. It is important to me that my days were filled with getting something done. I need to contribute. Everyone else will have to work out what they need for themselves.
