There is no unique, there is no different - maybe just different combinations of choices in life that form the "unique" you.  If you strive to be different, trust me, you're still conforming in some ways.  Conforming to cultural and social standards.  You can't help but be a consumer in this culture.  Some companies specifically market to the counter-culture, such that the counter-culture is a culture in itself.    For example, tattoos, body piercing, body modification of any kind is an attempt to be different.  But really people see other people who have modified their bodies, and they want to be like these other people.  Simply waving hello to someone, or nodding your head, or whatever - these are culturally accepted standards of behavior.  Imagine instead when someone says hello to you, that you respond with something random and unexpected.  People might think you're a little crazy.  But if you continue to respond to hello in this way, you are now conforming to a new code of behavior.  What does it mean to live life fully?  To enjoy life?  To enjoy living?    Whenever I go to a restaurant and order food, I am at odds with myself over different things, like the cost of the meal, what I want to eat (I never really know), what's good for me, I'm at such odds with myself that I change my mind frequently, never really happy with what I've chosen, always thinking I should have gotten something else.  Will I like what I'm getting?  Maybe it's good to eat something that I don't like, just for the experience of it.  Like eating octopus tentacles, for their chewy texture and odd feeling in the mouth.    Should I just get whatever I'm familiar with?  What if this place doesn't prepare it the way I like it though?  I find that a lot with salmon - restaurants frequently overcook it, leaving it a little too tough.  Fish can be so delicate to cook.  Maybe I should eat vegetarian, because what right do I have over the animals to eat them.  How barbaric!  Maybe I shouldn't use any animal products or any products that have been tested on animals, because it's inhumane.  But do I really want to spend my life trying to keep in mind what's been tested on animals - only consuming from certain companies that are conscious of animal rights?  Is that what my life is about?    How should I spend the time that I have on this earth?  I waste so much time.  So much.  Watching TV - movies at night, porn, masturbating.  It's very enjoyable at the time, but I don't really gain any value from it.  I play computer games - that a big time sink.  I sit at work surfing the web, blogging, reading and writing email, checking my stock quotes, reading stock message boards.  Oh yeah, and I work once in a while, too.  I haven't really worked - and I mean worked - a 40 hour week in I don't know how long.  So what the fuck am I doing at work?  I'm getting paid for sitting on my ass basically wasting my time and doing a couple of work-related tasks -- just enough to get by.  Then again, maybe my manager is out of touch with what's really going on.  It would be cool to be doing something self-expressive, something artistic with my life.  But then I might be stuck in a different rut - stuck in the rut of having no money and not being able to afford decent housing for me and my kids.  Not being able to afford nice vacations.  Not being able to afford netflix and cable tv and a broadband connection to the net.  I need broadband so I can remote into work occasionally and do real work.  Mostly I need broadband for porn.  It's sad, isn't it.  I guess I'm addicted.  So many addictions, so little time.
