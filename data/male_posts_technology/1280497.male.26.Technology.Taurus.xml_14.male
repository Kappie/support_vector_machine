Secondly, whenever I try to call somebody and instead get an automated message from the phone company, I can't help but wait for the message reader to say what message number it is, e.g. "We're sorry, but all circuits to voicemail are busy. Please try again later...[one second pause].  Message S-L-331" I'm waiting for the day when I get a call from a phone company, and when they offer me a long distance plan, I can say, "I'm sorry, but I already have long distance that I'm satisfied with...Message 442"
