And my workplace remains cool and calm today for some reason, while i am writing this.I am hearing songs as well !! Can't get these times very often. As we don't have much work today, we decided to search online for ISPs here in northwich.Not many provide this facility here. Telewest broadband seems to be the choice of all of us. Online quote shows that we would need to spend around 35-40 poundsper month, which is quite ok if we all are sharing. I can see trouble brewing already, as we start to discuss about TV channels to choose.Each one has their ownchoice and we have to go for a compromise, else it will blow our budget.Lo! here is noon, time for lunch. Nothing much to smile about.Got to eat the rice with yoghurt(can be called Curd rice).Let me see if i get something for work after lunch.
