I remember getting mails from variuos newsletters about Route64. Why didn't people know? More than doing a post-mortem of why didn't people know, I set out to find how could people know? I have seen something very interesting in seminars world over. People refrain from taking calls while the delegate is presenting but would look at their SMSs and punch in the reply. Very non-intrusive way of communicating with someone breathing down your neck. It hit me that SMSs were the most effective of notification mechanisms. You carry the mobile phone everywhere (even when you are not checking your emails!!).. you can check the SMS whenever you want to.. and the retention of SMSs seems to be more than emails (given the sheer nos of emails that you receive). The solution i think would work is SMS notifications. Currently, MS doesn't have an SMS gateway that i can utilize. The other way is to send the notification via my hand held device. Is there an application that can send a blast of SMSs to 60 people at a time? they exist.......... for charge..... and I can't buy them.. Will have to write one on my own.... Here i come Mobile Application Development :) Will post on my experiences with SMS Notifier Application soon...
