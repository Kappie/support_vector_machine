This is an information and it is a must for bloggers to know. After reading the comments provided by others on this, I was wondering about, Is there any etiquette rules on blogging? I don't think it is needed for blog. Because all bloggers know about blogging and understands its power (there are some exceptions!!). This post provides more of it.  Here I want to mention about my own post on blogs tilted  urlLink   Bill Gates on Blogs   . For me, Blog is all about an individuals own thought and sharing them all with peers. Here there is no scene of C, but can have a reference to some others blog. These reference should just include some points about the post and provide link to the blog. That would be more professionalistic.  Finally, I prefer monitor myself carefully while posting any blog in order to avoid the situation encountered by Brian.  Hope everybody will...
