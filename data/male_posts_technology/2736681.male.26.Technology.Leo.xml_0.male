Also, the type rules we talk about with objects make it a little bit more complicated, but these can probably be expressed as a series of default rules that must always apply. For example, if an object has a certain type, it must have values for all attributes of the type (and, with current typing rules, must not have any  other  values, although i find this a little weird myself). There is also the problem of object existence - integers and reals just exist, but objects have to be created, and generally deal with identity a bit differently.
