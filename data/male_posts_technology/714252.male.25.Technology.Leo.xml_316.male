On Tuesday my Mum and Dad agreed on their divorce settlement.  I don't know really what to say about it actually. Being honest I am ashamed of my Dad. I love my Dad and would do anything for him but the one thing I wish I could do for him is knock some sense into him. When it comes down to it the most important thing in my Dad's life is him. Last Tuesday he had an oportunity to actually do the right thing, to give my Mum a decent offer that reflected what she deserved, instead what she finnaly managed to haggle out of him for a deal is something I would have been ashamed to make as a first offer in his position.  It's a terrible thing, being ashamed of a person you can't help loving.  Since Tuesday I have also felt completely exhausted, some of it is the hours I have worked but a lot of it is all the stress. Ahh I dunno, I'm sure I'll be fine in the end.
