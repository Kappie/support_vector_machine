I joined with a coupla my friends and walked around the campus. It was such refreshing. Saw M:R in the evening before going home. Could make a lot of sense watching it first time itself, as I had already read a lot of reviews. Its really a unique deal with fiction. And to realise how much truth a fiction could radiate, u need to watch that film.  If u also concentrate on the conversations there's a lot more to enjoy. Some conversations are still lingering in my mind...  "You see only what you choose to understand"  "Comprehension is not a requisite for cooperation"  Neo to the Oracle: "You already know my choice. How is it a choice then? What if I do not choose?"... Oracle: "Even that is making a choice"  and lot more...
