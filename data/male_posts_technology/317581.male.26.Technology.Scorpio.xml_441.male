I was just thinking about how we are unable to go through life without hurting someone. I have never purposefully tried to hurt someone and I think I may have gotten into a situation where someone is going to get hurt. I wish I could find a way out where everyone involved could happy and not hurt. But I can't see the way. I'm trying to get to a much more flexible life, where I'm not planning things out 2 - 3 weeks in advance, but things keep on filling up.  It's my birthday.  Today we're going to ballard bar and grill. The matrix. and Tony Romas. Tomorrow is dinner and anime with Jarred. Thursday is dinner with Cindy. Saturday is party at my hizouse for Cahlen, karla and my birthdays. Should be a good time.  OK, I'm going to burgers now. Check yous later-
