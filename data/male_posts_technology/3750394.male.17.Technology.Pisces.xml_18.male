I have an excellent teacher that taught math for many many years, so that was good to know :D.  Have no one I know in my class, but what can ya do, got to take the good with the bad I guess.  Hopefully getting 2 things tomorrow, which 1 of them is a for sure, the other is on the bargaining table:  1.) a new LG 8x DVD +/- R/RW Drive for my Mac, and; 2.) a Eye TV USB Remote Edition so I can watch TV on my Mac  I have enough money for both, just want to check up on the Eye TV thing, cause its USB and all.  Hmmm..., what else is new o yea!, MY BROTHER IS GONE FOR AN ENTIRE MONTH :D, HAHA, WOO HOO!.  That's all for now  Eric
