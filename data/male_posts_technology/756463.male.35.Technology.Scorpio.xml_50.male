It's amazing how much better you feel when you do some real work during the day - not just sitting at a desk.    Larkins has a big wrestling room (luckily it doesn't SMELL like your typical wrestling room) with a thick mat so I can do all my Combat Conditioning exercises without having to move around too much.  It also has a rope to climb and pullup bars.  Heck, what else does a bodyweight exerciser need?    Felt good to do some wall walkers - I did ten today and actually got my chest to touch the wall a couple times near the end.  Naturally, that's not all I did - threw in some Hindu Squats and Jumper Squats, plenty of Hindu Pushups, and some other ab and back exercises.    Looking forward to continuing this habit...
