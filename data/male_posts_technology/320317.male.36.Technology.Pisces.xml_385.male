 Yet another tool to build web pages, although this targets "hand-coders". I use this integrated within Dreamweaver MX to do all my CSS work. Now it can do XHTML pages as well, so I am not sure how this fits into the Dreamweaver integration scheme of things. Which editor should I use? I think the answer will be both, but we will have to wait and see.
