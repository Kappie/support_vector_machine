Some walls have mossy toupees, others are patterned like lost tetris games - it's truly a visual cornucopia.  I thought "I bet you could get a grant to explore the art of noise barrier design and how it relates to the American Dream."  
Then I found out that barrier design is actually  urlLink mandated  by the US Department of Transportation.
