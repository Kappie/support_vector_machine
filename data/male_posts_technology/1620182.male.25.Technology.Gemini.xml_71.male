Even the best laid plans cannot hope to stand before the rampage that is executive management with a neat new toy.  In terms of revenue, we were on the right track.  We were a coiled snake ready to destroy our competition.  Then the stupid crocodile hunter came along and grabbed us by the neck in mid-flight.  Crikey!  When the executives start telling the engineers "how" to do something before they know "what" they want done, it's time to consider moving on.  And that's just what some of our key people have started to do.  Me?  I'll see how things play out over the next few weeks.  I still have faith that we can bring them to their senses.  I can't speak for my colleagues, though.
