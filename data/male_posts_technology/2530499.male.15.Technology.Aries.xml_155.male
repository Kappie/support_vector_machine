Ok, so I'm trying to buy a Sierra Wireless AirCard 750, and from TMo, it costs some ungodly $350...but I google it, and I can get it from  urlLink WirelessGadgetGuy (WGG)  for ONLY $90.00. This guy is awesome. Not only that, he has the BEST customer service of ANY company I've gotta go now, but make sure you check out WGG!!!!!! (I'm serious. He's fucking AWESOME!)
