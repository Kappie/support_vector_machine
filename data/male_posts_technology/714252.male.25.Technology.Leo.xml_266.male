You know that feeling in your stomach that says something's up but you can't put your finger on it??  Anyway.. Also got a shock today.. Someone I know got married two weeks ago.. Surprised but it all sounds good (Congrats babe!)  I have no idea what to write.. I think I must just be in one of my low points.. I get them every now and again..  Guess that's all :)
