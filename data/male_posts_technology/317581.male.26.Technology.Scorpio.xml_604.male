I dreamt I woke to check my email and had 2. One was from my ex and another from work. Before I could answer either, a coworker came into my bedroom and started asking me about a bug they had found while I was sleeping and whether or not it was a known issue. I followed him over to where Peter's room is and our computer lab was all setup and running with my boss asking me if it was a known issue. I told him I didn't know and would have to see the bug to know if others had seen it. I woke shortly after looking at the problem and telling my coworker that we didn't have it recorded and he should write up the bug.  The past couple of nights I've been thinking about Faith and religion. I KNOW I could never vote for Bush, but have I strayed so far from the Christian faith? Do I believe that all religions are a crutch? Do I think that faith in a religion is only for those who have given up thinking for themselves or do I still believe? Do I want there to be someone/something/(an all loving God) out there that wants to see me succeed? Is there a plan for my life and am I on the right path? Should I worship at the church of Microsoft and bow to the almighty dollar?  Of religion, I can say for certain, they do re-emphasis the spirit as the most important thing. People are the reason I was put on this earth. Without friends and family, without new acquaintenances, without people, life would be ever so dull. I'm just not sure "saving" the soul is what is needed.   Well, I need to get ready for work. Peace- T
