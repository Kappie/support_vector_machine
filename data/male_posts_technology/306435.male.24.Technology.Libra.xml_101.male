Marissa and Bethy made a great chicken dinner with rice and green beans.  Jeff Dake and Elise were there too.  It was very good and fun.  We then headed over to Bethy's house and met up with James Williams (his 22nd b-day), Allison, Audrey, and Elanore.  We then went to Serrento's.  It is a small bar/pizzaria that has Karaoke on Friday and Saturday.  It was fun and we sang a lot.  Barb (the dj) really liked James and Jeff.  The whole night was just wild.  Saturday-  First I woke up and went to ppick up the equiptment from General, because he is not going to be at the game on Sunday.  I am supposed to take 75 South and meet him at the Shell Station off the Cresent Spring exit.  Problem is there is not a Cresent Spring exit.  So no equiptment.  Then Tom and I watched a Soprano's marathon.  Then Jeff Kinne and Devon were in town and went to the Greek Fest with Justin, Sarah, and Tom.  Jeff and his crew didn't stay long, but Tom and Justin and Sarah had fun.  We then drove around in Justin's new car and got shakes.  Sunday-  The General won a game.  I was managing.  We won in extra innings.  We lost the second game, but a split is more than I ever could have hoped.
