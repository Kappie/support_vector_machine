Don't feel like waffling on about the site and stuff but don't feel quite ready for the emotional purge I feel coming on..  I was talking to Jonny last night and I said to him that I realised for the first time in about 6-7 years I actaully feel unhappy. Not just upset by something for a brief period or depressed for a day or two but geniunely unhappy. This may sound wierd but I REALLY amn't used to that.. I usually feel pretty damn good.. I keep things seperate as in when I am in work my personal life isn't an issue and when I am at home I don't let work stress me because there is nothing I can do about it till tomorrow.. But recently I have just had a general unhappiness that is alien to me..  Ah well, I'll just have to go home and get drunk :) Actually, that has never really helped me but I'm sure I can give it the old college try. Have decided not to head to salsa tonight, gonna try to go Sunday instead..  K still waffling.. gonna go now.
