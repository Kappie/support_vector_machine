You tend to lose your game.  Yes, game.  I had a little bit of game going, actually I had some good game going at the bars and clubs.  Meeting girls, getting digits, meeting up with them in the future came so easy.  I was able to polish that for a little while and then BAM!  A special someone comes along and you forget about that thing you have and it gradually it becomes like a dull knife instead of that sharp thing you once had.  Sure it wasn't the best of everythjing but it did the job.  I wasn't out to pick up chicks for one night stands, just get digits and call them and have them call me or whatever.  My game was not perfect but it did the job and that's what counts.  So today, at work, I have deleted shortcuts to her websites, I removed all of our emails and placed them in an archive file.  Yeah, I'm a nerd.  I have a lot of bad poetry jotted down and they're all just saved here rotting.  They're about the good times and the start of the bad times.  Yeah, I'm still reeling.  I gotta move on, I have to.  I really don't have any time to go to East Lansing to give back her book.  Maybe during camping trip, I'll give it to Mark P and he cam give it to Meghan.  In other more news worthy events.  I was out helping one of my co-workers with thier problem with their computer.  It was still working but it was definitely not working correctly.  I just reformatted the whole thing.  It took longer much longer than anticipated but I got it done.  I received an envelope today with a card that was made by her daughter with $50 in it.  That made me feel better.  I felt appreciated.  I didn't ask for any money and I said that I would do it for free but they appreciated it enough to give me some credit for the job that I did.  Well at least I made some dough this weekend.  Hmm, maybe I'll get a date too!  $50 should be plenty for a first date right?  Yeah, starting over is one of the worst feelings in the world.  It's also great because soon enough you feel new again.  There is someone out there, there is hope for me.  In the mean time, all I can do is pick up the peices and move on.  I feel shitty but I'm sure I'll get over it someday.  There's always light at the end of the tunnel.
