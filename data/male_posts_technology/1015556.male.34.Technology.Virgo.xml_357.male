The fam has been gone all this week, and won't be back for another few  days.  Real meaning - the house is really boring.   So instead of doing great things, I did little meaningless things.  Real meaning - I spent more time at work.   I guess I could have done a bunch of stuff for the middle school  trip.  I'm starting to have some second thoughts about that, but  its too late now.  And I think I have an atmosphere I have to  cultivate from the very beginning about that... But thats kind of a  tangent.  Real meaning - I should have just stuck to leading  mission trips for high schoolers.   Here are some other things I did this week, to give you a sample of those meaningless things:   - painted most of the trim in the kitchen.  (just a few minutes ago) - worked from 11-1am last night, building a database of 4 tables to  load some data from a system that decided to go to production without  telling us of their need for this data to get loaded in our  system.  (see what I mean) - played pool on yahoo games with my friend M^3.  (actually that  wasn't meaningless, that was really fun.  And his initials are MM,  but I like calling him M^3.  i like calling him that in this blog  anyway.) - mowed and trimmed the lawn - sprayed weed killer on the lawn.  chickweed, its a tragic disease. - watched Spiderman 1 on DVD. - watched SWAT on DVD.  I liked it, it was filmed in LA. - went thru all my old mission trip files so that I could relive those glory days.  uh, right.   - i will probably go buy snacks for the middle school trip tomorrow.   - i will probably finishing doing some more painting tomorrow.   - i will probably work a 12 hour marathon release tomorrow night,  starting at 10pm.  isn't there something more to a career than  this?   - i will probably take a nap tomorrow.      Real meaning - I'm really ready for my wife and kids to come home.   Wow, this was seriously pointless.  I'm proud, I think its a whole new level.
