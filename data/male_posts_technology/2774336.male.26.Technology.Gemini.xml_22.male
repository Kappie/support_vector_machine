       Nausea, Heat 

    

     

 

 

 I just had a bad wave of nausea.  There was an uneasy feeling in my lower abdomen, but nothing specific.  My stomach was not involved, but my throat was constricting as if in preparation.  My mouth still tastes like the "candied" mint chocolate calcium chew, which isn't bad when you take them, but the aftertaste is nasty. The anxiety related to possibly throwing up made me very warm very quickly, and my heart began racing. It's passing now and my intestines are beginning to gurgle again. 

 There was a definite trigger with this one, psychologically.  My mother just walked in the door upstairs from a weekend trip. I already wasn't feeling terrific because I was working on something that was stressing me out.  I hear my mother enter and was expecting she would come down here and want to talk for 40 minutes while I was already not well and stressed out.  That was clearly the trigger for this episode. Multiple Stress Induced. 

  

  Update: My intestines (or at least the area just below my belt buckle) are constricting in painfull waves since the above was posted (3:30 pm and it is now 4:10 pm).  Something is moving around down there, and it doesn't like me.
