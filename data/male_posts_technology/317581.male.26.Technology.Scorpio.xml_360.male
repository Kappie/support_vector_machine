Then you'll have to live with that for the rest of your days. And then, even if you find someone that you won't get an STD from, then you'll get her pregnant and you don't want a kid now do you?   Then there's the 80's when it seemed like everytime I saw a movie the women didn't want to have sex with the man and then he got thrown in jail. and so it seemed like there was no woman that wanted to have sex, so if you ever tried anything with a girl, she was going to be like, Date Rape. So don't even try it.   Then when you get out in the real, real world. (aka after college, or in college if you don't go to a private christian university, or aren't me) then you realize that girls wanna have sex also, but you've had it drilled into you since you were just a little kid, and you can't figure out what to do. I mean you're as horny as hell, but you're so scared of gettin some disease, you're left an outcast, by your own choosing.
