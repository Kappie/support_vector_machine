Hahahaha, I woke up at 8am this morning full of energy which was awesome, so I went and worked out.  Time to coax those climbing muscles back into shape!  Ah this feels good, my forearms are still twitching as I write this which is mildly annoying, but ah well.  The only downside here is that I still need a climbing partner, maybe I can find someone on texasclimbers.com .  Really though, I need to move to a city with a rock gym, and not stick around college station anymore.  But I need a new job to do that.  Anyone need a crack .NET programmer?  Hehehehehe.  I've got the whole day, it's only 10:30 am, what am I gonna do?  I think I'm gonna shell out the $15 to go boulder at the A rock wall...
