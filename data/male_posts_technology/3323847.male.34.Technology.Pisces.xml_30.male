It is, by far, one of my most favourite and cherished movies of all time.  Without fail, I almost always cry during the opening sequence, which only leads to a cry/laugh jaunt for the next two hours.  This movie is one of those extremely rare ones which didn't just  move  me, but touched my soul.  Anyone who knows me knows I don't throw out phrases like that on a whim.  Anyhow, it wasn't until later that I learned that this was a "steaming pile of shit" that nobody liked.  The truth of the matter is that this movie appears to be one of those "like it" or "hate it" types.  Those who like it, like me,  really  like it.  Those that dont,  really  don't.  In any event, if you  think  you may be interested in seeing it, forget what everyone else is saying, including me, and give it a shot.
