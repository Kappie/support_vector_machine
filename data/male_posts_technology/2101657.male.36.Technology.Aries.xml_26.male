I took my cubscouts out this fall to play, and really enjoyed it. I used to play heavily when I was a teen, and am eager to play again.  We have a course here in Dubuque thats not very old, and Waterloo/Cedar Falls, where we moved from 5yrs ago has 3 courses, with 1 added in the last year.  I'm really looking forward to nice weather and then hitting the "links" so to speak. Will be a great way to get some exercise in as well.  Also for Christmas I got X-Men2, and Pirates of the Carribiean(sp).  Both really good movies. I was surprised at how good POTC turned out to be. Johnny Depp was actually GOOD in it!  A most enjoyable movie. X2 was good, in that they seemed to really get NightCrawlers character down perfectly.  I couldn't of asked for a better Kurt then that.  Plus it's obvious that X-3 is going to deal with Phoneix and her dark hidden bad self waiting to emerge.    Happy New Year everyone!
