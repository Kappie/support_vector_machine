It was in Louisville at Headliners.  It was a good show.  I had never been to Headliners, it is a noce place for a show.  Before the show I got to see Colin and Matt play a little ball.  They are on the big field now.  They have the unfortunate luck of being named the Devil Rays. I played my second game this week.  We got destroyed.  I went 1-2 with a double.  I broke up a no hitter then stole third.  I also pitched the last inning with 1 hit no runs no walks.  The team is 0-2, but I think I proved I should be pitching more.
