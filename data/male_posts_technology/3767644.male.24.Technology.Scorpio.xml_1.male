Sometimes You feel so lone that life seems like it is meaningless, My friends at Thane centre were more than happy to see me just as much as I was to see them. These are good people. My dearest kid was there too. I hope she picked up a lesson on saying no when needed.  If i could change the world I would wish a lot of people like the ones I know well. I could get them the world.  I think i am too tied up at times.  I am such a loser I think. My life is lone. I lost all i could have procured,  1) Education 2) Time 3) The women i like (never thought i was fit enough for them anyway.)  I hate to be called a Winner, each time I am called one I realize how much I've lost. Maybe it is my ego, my depression, I try hard to make people laugh but then how much can I fool Myself. I am the fool who plays the fool. I dont have to pretend.
