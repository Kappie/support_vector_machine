This may be due to a worm being on your computer!!!  So I've been directed to a page to perform an online scan of my system. My ISP has also blocked my Port 135 until I reconnect my Broadband connection. I don't run any anti-virus software, haven't for a while but as I'm a techie I can spot a virus a long way off. My Windows XP machine is always up-to-date with the critical updates and I have ZoneAlarm and hardware based firewall protecting it from the outside world. So how did I get this worm?  Sadly as I have around 400,000 files on this machine it's going to take a while to scan the machine but so far, after two hours and 250,000 files it hasn't found anything. I've got a feeling that it was my eMule that tripped their sensors but I'll have to wait for the scan to finish, for me to get a clean bill of health before I get the opportunity to lay into my ISP for being over-sensitive.  ...  I'm also amused by the Google Ads at the top of the page. You mention one word in a post and there they go, advertising bath products. Maybe I should pay more attention to the words that I write or maybe that's the way to fool them into showing other things. I wonder what happens if I mention Mary Poppins, Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, Cor Blimey and Dick Van Dyke. What Ads will I get tomorrow?
