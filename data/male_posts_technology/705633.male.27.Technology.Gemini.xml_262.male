I would have been nice for my boss to have actually organised for someone to do my work during my absence, although that's far more than what I expected…  What I expected was for her to actually do the *Small* job I left her to do, sort out some filing into date order for our auditors.  Why then am I surprised that it hasn't been done? Why do I even bother… All I ask for is some R   For a slight smile…  A guy with a black eye boards his plane bound for Pittsburgh and its down in his seat. He notices immediately that the guy next to him has a black eye, too. He says to him, "Hey this is a coincidence, we both have black eyes; mind if I ask how you got yours?"  The other guy says, "Well, it just happened. It was a tongue twister accident. See, I was at the ticket counter and this gorgeous blonde with the most massive breasts in the world was there. So, instead of saying, 'I'd like two tickets to Pittsburgh, 'I accidentally said, 'I'd like two pickets to Tittsburgh', and she socked me a good one."  The first guy replied, "Wow! This is unbelievable. Mine was a tongue twister too. I was at the breakfast table and I wanted to say to my wife  'Please pour me a bowl of Frosties, honey.' But I accidentally said, 'You've ruined my life you evil fat slut.'
