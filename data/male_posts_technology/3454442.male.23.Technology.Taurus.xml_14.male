I did not see the speech and I'm probably better off.  I have watched a total of 38 seconds of the 2004 Democratic National Convention. You want the real truth? I was watching, last night on CSPAN 2, the 1968 Republican Convention and the 1968 Democratic Convention.   Do I care about conventions? No--neither Demogogue nor Republicrap. It is one big ol' infomercial that the parties need not pay for, and thus can rampage me with their ads during prime TV time come September.  I know who I am voting for, and not need to hear a bunch of people call my candidate a "liar" and "hateful" and a "fascist" (as Robert Kennedy, Jr. did at a Boston bookstore). Nor do I need to hear a group of people sing blindly the praises of George W. Bush. He';s done good things, he's doen bad things. In my mind, the good things he's done in certain areas outweigh the bad at this time. And I see his good things being important for the next four years.  Meanwhile, Spinner, you seem to base all of your opinions ona future President on the fact that he is a) black; b) a Democrat; and c) gave a speech that was purportedly good. Well, I've heard Martin Luther King, Jr. meet all those elements. Could he be President? No, because he'd never be elected, even today.  Barak Obama is this great hope for the Democrats because he is a young man who the color-conscious Democrats note repeatedly is black. So what? And what happened to Harold Ford, the last great "black President" hope?  I'm done ranting. I hate blind partisanship.  JPF
