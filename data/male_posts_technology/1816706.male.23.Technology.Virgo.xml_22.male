What a cool experience!”  While I could certainly never live in Maui, it is definitely a very cool place to visit and vacation at.  I started the day by going with the tour at the hostel to the “Big Beach” in Makena which was a nice beach with very clear water and some decent waves breaking at shore.  We played a little beach volleyball for a while and I did a little bit of snorkeling.  Getting towards sunset we climbed over this little cliff and walked down a little ridge to a nude beach.  It was quite interesting, my first nude beach.  There were definitely more naked guys than girls, but not all old farts either.  It took a little to get used to, but one of the guys that works at the hostel I’m staying at brought some beer and we had a few beers and a few laughs.  What makes this place so great is that the people that were at the beach were really big hippies for the most part.  I mean it was really a lot of leftovers from Woodstock it looked like.  They were naked and smoking some pot and a lot of people had bongos and were playing those while other people danced, quite interesting.  When the sun sets at this beach it hits a couple of other islands, some small one, Lanai, and Molokai, and another one.  After the sunset all the hippies playing on drums keep playing but then people on the beach start twirling fire.  One guy in particular was really awesome, he was twirling fire on a stick and then on a rope, it was pretty awesome, got some good pictures, and even video of one person.  Then we got a ride home with someone who didn’t even know our names, but lives at the hostel also, quite a night, one for the books.  Also found out that hitch hiking on Maui is fairly common.
