But I can't show anything I have designed as it is all proprietary.  This is one thing that sucks about working here.  I am getting great project experience.  Great design experience.  Great usability experience.  I get to research (some, not as much as I would like).  I get constant updates to my training.  Okay, why do I want to leave here?  Mostly because creative solutions are balked at too often here.  Even when I show how things might work it's, "Well, the other area did this so we want to do it that way too."  I am all about consistency, but consistently bad?  No thanks.  Anyway.  I'll just try to make the best of the sitch.  On a related note.  A small (yet talented) design/usability company is hiring.  Perhaps the economic storm is passing?
