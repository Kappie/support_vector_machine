She was just moving in, so luckily most of her stuff was in her trailer still.  She just lost a DVD player, a VHS player and some tapes and DVD's.    I am going out there next weekend and put in some screen doors and screen windows onto her trailer.  The mosquitos were really eating everyone up.    At work I am trying to stir up some action on getting the feature requirements on the current project done.
