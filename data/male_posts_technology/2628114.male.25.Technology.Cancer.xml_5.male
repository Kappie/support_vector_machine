For difficult translation, read mine.  5and2 = 5 mins forward, 2 mins backward, 5 to finish = Do you really need a translation for this one?)  My legs and knee felt great especially as I kicked up the difficulty throughout the workout.  I finished on the level 12 (of 20) and just for fun did the last minute on 15.    Even after the workout, my knee felt great.  It has acted up a little today, but I am working to be diligent to ice it regularly.  No matter how good my knee may feel in the coming days and weeks, I still plan on staying on the ellipticals for another two weeks to continue to strengthen my legs.  I will also start (probably Friday) to do stair climbers in conjunction with ellipticals so I can get some hillwork done.  I will slowly work back into running (knee pain dependent) the week of 2/9 after my Red River Gorge trip.  That trip will as good a test as any to determine if my knee truly has recuperated and if my legs have strengthened.
