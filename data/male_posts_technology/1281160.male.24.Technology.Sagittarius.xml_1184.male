Only a few members have the enthusiasm to participate in this blog. Moreover, this is a ideal time to work(idle time of work). Pats to Kavitha, for such an wonderful article on lead management. We already have a software called ANGLER CRM, a part of the software already focuses on lead management.  Today, I had my ISO internal audit, out of the 15 parameters I got 5 Non-Compliances(NC's) in which 3 goes to my team. I have to prepare my corrective action report within a day or two. I am crewing up with my team to discuss the ways for eliminating the NC's.  Nothing much to discuss, Tomorrow I will be in Erode and tomorrow night, I will be watching Mani Ratnam's Aaiyatha Ezuthu. I have been told that the hindi version of the movie Yuva is not much to expectation. More Comments will follow through after seeing Aaiyatha Ezuthu....
