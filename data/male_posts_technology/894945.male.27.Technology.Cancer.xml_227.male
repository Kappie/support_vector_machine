At least for those of you that walk, I feel for you when a car goes through that puddle and splashes you with a wave that would make the Japanese wince with sympathy. But then I remember that I cycle to work each day. There is nothing quite like getting a stream of dirty road run-off water directed straight at your rectum whilst struggling to keep in a vertical position on a bike that, for all intent and purpose, renders itself and the rider, ie me, invisible to approximately 70% of car-bound road users.  Why, with very slippery wet roads, do cars think that is perfectly safe to overtake me, doing 25 mph on a 90 degree corner and only leave me three and a quarter inches to manoeuvre? Then they complain at ME for the reactionary size 14 (49 Europe, 15 USA men's sizes) shoe print on the side of their polished car? Humm, the phrase "Give a cyclist the same room as a car when overtaking" springs to mind. If I can put my foot through your passenger window, you shouldn't be so bloody close mate!  Me getting my latex, My hair is as long as the time I dyed it blond and I have some clippers… Looking forward to Halloween!  And today, on a scale of one to cant be botherd to work, my boss scores  "Cough Cough, I have a bad cold. Sorry, I Shave da bad colshd."
