But, golly gosh, didn't we have fun while you were home? I especially enjoyed the leaving barbeque (complete with evil  urlLink punch ), Chocolate Buddha (that squid! YUM!), drunken dork chats at Fanny O'Dea's, the  urlLink Victorian Wine Precinct  and just you being here.  WE MISS YOU!  But, there is so much to look forwards to - particularly The Engagement Party Planning. Heh, James and I are taking Kaia to the Australian Bridal Expo next weekend. Well at least we're talking about it. Chances are we'll end up sitting at home with our beloved  urlLink saviour  and watching Bridget Jones's Diary. Just for something new and exciting.  Oh, and I promise to look after Kaia. Mainly because she's my best friend but, to be completely honest, partly because she has the power to put me in one of  urlLink these  if I don't! Hee hee!
