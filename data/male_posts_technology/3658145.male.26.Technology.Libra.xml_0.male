He says what's on his mind and says who cares what people think they cant understand me anyway I have CP  Raw Started off with there Usual thing by this I mean Evolution came out (AKA Collection of Old Need to Be retired wrestler who need to be retired and 2 young Muscle heads that are on enough steroids that I cant count that high)!! And What is up with Kane and Lita Come on now do you actually think us red blooded American males are going to fall for something like come on now I am from the swamp and I want even for fall for that one. All though I do a few people who will for that !! And what's up with Bischoff and his so called nephew Eugene I believe that he's trying to portray this character as a person with an innelectual disability personally I think he should've asked for advice from some disability advocates like myself we all know that a person doesn't act like that with a disability like they portray  Who ever reads this post should send them an email And last but not least Major props to that good ole boy Chris Benoit thanks for kicking that big freaks ass Kane and making him tap. Kane you tapped and cried foul afterwards  3 words from good ole Wootang GET OVER IT you lost  Woot 10
