She was referring, of course, to my paper journal which no one sees but me (at least that's the intention).  And the simple answer is, I have things that I need to say to myself, that perhaps I need to go back and see another time, to review and remind myself, but not anythign anynone else needs to see, or indeed  should  see.  But that brings me to this blog.  This is a public journal.  Something that anyone can see.  She's made me realize, that maybe this isn't such a bad idea too.  No, I don't think I'm going to dump my deepest and darkest here, I have enough trouble doing that on paper.  But some stuff, some of the lighter stuff, should go here.  And it's a good lesson for me to learn here too.    Don't edit.    Just type.  So that's what I'll do here.  Don't edit, just type and tell some of the things I need to....  So I'm putting it back on(the)line.
