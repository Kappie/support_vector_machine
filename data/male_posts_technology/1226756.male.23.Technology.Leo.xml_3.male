I haven't had time to work on electronics or robotics lately, but I got the spark back a few nights ago. I have to teach myself everything all over again, but that'll just have to be OK. I will concentrate on electronics and robotics from now on, because I find that to be more interesting. My first attempt will be a WireRunner, adapted from one I found at Wouter van Ooijen's site.  urlLink (http://www.voti.nl/wire/index.html)  There will be some changes made to it, and I will document it all and post it on my website. (Not up and running for electronics yet.) On another note, I seem to remember the use of quite large capacitors in BEAM roborics. Most importantly in photo-poppers. 2200uF and 3300uF. I found a good and cheap source for these caps, and that is inside the powersupply of a normal computer. I collected 4 or 5 from an old powersupply I had lying around. I haven't made the RoBUG that searches for light yet, but when I feel comfortable with electronics again, I might give it a try. Hopefully it won't be over a year until my next post, but a couple of days. Friday's here, and a party I feel is the right thing this weekend.
