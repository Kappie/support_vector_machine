The Blessings the Power and the Grace and the Mercy. however many when it comes to the wisdom of God to make choices contrary to the standards of the world usually fall or fail to make those choices. I myself am guilty of this.  Many times we have people speaking against us. In a manner that is not encouraging or changing but it destructive. Sometimes the destructive realationship can sufficate the Gift that God has given you because yournot "Smart Enough" "Thin enough" "Strong Enough". Funny to know that Moses was a man who was not skilled in his speech. His was not articulate in his speech meaning that he possible stuttered when he spoke. Which is why the Lord gave him Abraham to speak for him. Interesting enough Gidieon was a considered to be a "Strong Warrior" when he was hiding ina nearby Cave in fear of battle. Or David who's heart wasa man's heart for God whocommited adultery, murdered the husband in battle and covered it up.  My point is that contrary to what people might say these toxic relationship will destroy the plan that God has for your life because their voice sometimes for many is heard louder than the scriptures themselves.  We have to be very careful what Toxic relationships are doing to ourlives. Toxic relationships can change our views. Change our mindsets. Change our goals and ultimatly lead us to destruction. In gods wisdom his says that if your eye should cause you to sin then you should plug it out. How much more a Toxic realationship.
