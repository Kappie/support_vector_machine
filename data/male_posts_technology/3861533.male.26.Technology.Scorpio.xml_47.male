I sometimes also give out an additional grade for a specific genre. For example: I gave  urlLink Spiderman 2  5 of 5 in the superhero genre and 4-4.5 in the general movie genre. I often use intervals when I'm not sure exactly how I feel about the movie.     What movies to keep    Generally I require a minimum grade of 4 of 5 (though a few 3.5:ers has slipped through). The grade is not enough however - I either have to want to see the movie again sometime in future, or I have to want to show it to a future someone.   -->
       My rating system goes from 0 to 5. The only really fixed descriptions I have are for 5 which means "abso-bleeping-stupe-fucious", ie. really, really excellent. The other one is for 2.5 which means "whatever, shoulder shrug" - I neither dislike it or like it.
