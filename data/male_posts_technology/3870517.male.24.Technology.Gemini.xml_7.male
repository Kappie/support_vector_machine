I might be the only lazy person who loves going to work instead of hanging around doing nothing.  I love going to work only and only because my time doesn't require me to report at a specified time. I am supposed to work 9 hour a day, but at times I just have 8 or seven hours. Hahaha... I am lazy indeed...  I don't know why i easily get restless especially in the afternoon where everything is hot and not a good time of the day to take a sleep. so i just opened some of my projects at work, do something which i think would require me to think much so i will not be thinking more of the sleep. at times i am tempted to drink coffee which i have been trying to avoid. i've been having at least a glass of coffee a day for almost a couple of months now and i want to continue this discipline.  After lunch break, most of us have at least 30 mininute to have a siesta or do something out of work. Sometimes, i do feel sleepy that i lay my head on my table and just think of a thousand sheeps jumping over the fence... But I feel like someone is calling my attention, my computer is urging me to surf the web... Aaaarrrgghhhh! There's Friendster, Yahoo!, Inq7, everyone... My Yahoo Messenger is giving me notices that i have a message and my computer beeps everytime i receive a message from Outlook... how can i ever take a nap...   By the time the clock's hands hits six o' clock, i feel like i wanted to sleep in the office and dont want to go home... i am sleepy... i yawn and yawn and yawn... almost every second... Is there someone out there who can help me with this?  Ooops, it's 1pm already. Time to go back to my work... Ciao!  Im Out!
