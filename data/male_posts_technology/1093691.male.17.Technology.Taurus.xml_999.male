I deinetly don't think we shoudl be allowed them, because there is such a fine line between 'self defence' and 'attack' that it woudl be so hard to tell the difference, and there would just be unlawful killings happening left, right and centre. Can you imagine what croydon would be like with guns? http://www.defense.gouv.fr/gendarmerie/ However, I do believe that we should have two branches of the police, as france do. They have the 'Gendarmerie' and 'Police'. The police are like the local units who just work in the rural areas, minor offences in rural areas, blah blah, i think. Then the Gendarmerie are the more military-style ones '[I think they actually refer to themselves as being a branch of the French Army, see  urlLink the official website (If not just for the pictures!) ) ], who patrol urban areas and cities. This reduces the crime rate in cities, and France have a very low gun-crime rate, I believe. I believe that this is due to the scary image of the Gendarmerie- they have bold blue uniforms (shirts, trousers and jackets, all of same colour), knee length leather boots, black caps, and they  all carry guns  , in highly visible places. Yet the french never have any 'incidents' of accidental shooting of police officers and innocent civillians. In addition, in the big towns like Paris, they have gendermerie armed with sub-machine guns. Now that is a scary site, but crime rates? What crime??! I believe our policing system should be changed to allowed armed officers in the centres of towns and high-risk districts, not to protect themselves and other citizens, but to deter and prevent gun-crime altogether. Say you were about to commit and violent mugging on a women, say you were going to knife her to ger her handbag, money and phone, you would perhaps consider it if you see two lone policemen walking down the street, say 500m away, not near enough to catch you. But what if those same two policemen each had a gun holster containing standard-issue pistols? I wouldn't even dream of it, and I don't think any criminal would either. I rest my case.
