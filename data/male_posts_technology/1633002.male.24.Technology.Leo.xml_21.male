I may take a day off work to finish moving.  I just want it to be over with.  I have to go back to the hell-pit(house) today to move more stuff.  I'm going to try to get all of the things except the furniture.  I hope i can get them all.  NICE.  I had a presentation to give at work on monday, and I think I did pretty well for my first time.  The people over at the Rockville office didn't have much to say, because they really don't know all that we are doing with GIS here in Silver Spring.  I think I'm getting a raise soon too, which would rock like a hurricaine (not like one of those wussy storms).     [Listening to: 03 - Rollover DJ - Jet - Get Born (3:15)]
