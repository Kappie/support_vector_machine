Further, I feel the weak link of the sentence is the term "best services."  It is impossible for more than one human to agree on what that entails in all cases.  Also, the term "social contract" makes me uncomfortable.  I have signed no such contract.  Finally, for the record, while I appreciate your aesthetic choice to use only lower-case, it can have unfortunate results.  For example, I consider myself a republican -- lower-case -- not a Republican, upper-case.  As with democratic and Democratic, there are subtle, yet important differences between the two.  As for the text preceding that sentence, I hope the tide turns in favor of those with this condition.  If the resources are available, and the public agrees on the necessary trade-offs, perhaps one day it will come to pass.
