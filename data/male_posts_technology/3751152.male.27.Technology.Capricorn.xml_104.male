Some conversation is going on about rides scratched at Alton Towers, but for this blog it is more important to reflect upon the events of the last 2 B10!  When I last left off, we were off to the beach.  Upon arriving, we broke up into a couple of groups.  Some headed straight for the sand, while another group of us decided to see some fish up close and personal at the aquarium.  We got to see shark feeding time from a submerged transparent walkway in a rather large tank full of sharks, stingrays, and giant turtles.  After boing up on our natural sciences, the others I was with decided to do bumper cars, but I decided to take the rare opportunity to allow this land-locked resident of Switzerland with no closeby beach to walk along the Bournemouth coast and take in the the local scenery and beach babes!!!  We then all met up and took the train back, linking up with another group of spods who had chosen to forsake the beach wonders for the safer realms of a local pub.  It was time then to prepare for the big night out at Jazz Juice!  We first went to a couple of watering spots in Bournemouth to soak up some liquor and then made our way back to near the beach and into the nightclub.  JazzJuice was basically a 70s retro night.  We danced or sat on the edge of the dancefloor until about 2.00 am.  Then we grabbed taxis and headed back to consume a midnight snack before hitting the sack.  We also got to observe why it was not a good idea for a taxi company to ever dissapoint our meet host ...  After the spods finally awoke on Sunday morning, we went to a local establishment for some traditional English breakfasts.  The Sunday afternoon event was either bingo or the water park, depending on one's tastes.  Your blogger personally chose the waterpark choice, and despite the long ques, he was not disappointed with the miriad of slides and tube rides ...  It was then dinner at KFC (a treat for me as there are none in Switzerland) and then bowling, followed by some goes at the Dance Dance video game machine.  Then back to Matt's for another renedition of "Fire Wire."  Its now 2.30 am and time for some sleep!
