Unfortunately, all they had to say about the movie afterward was what happens in the final moments.  The woman that's the primary love interest in the movie apparently greets some other woman with a deep, passionate kiss.  The guys that are there then go on about how they didn't know she was a lesbian.  She replies with something like, "I'm not a lesbian, I'm bisexual!" and continues the kissing with one of the guys.  Why?  This had nothing to do with the rest of the movie, but was merely an unnecessary, gratuitous sex joke that ruined the movie for my daughter and her friends.  I can only imagine how horrified the teacher was, as I'm almost 100% certain he didn't know that was in there.  I know he had to field at least one question of "What's bisexual?" from one of his students.  Frankly, this is just a shame and further evidence of the extremely liberal slant of Hollywood.  It's no wonder I don't watch as many movies as I used to, although it's hard to tell considering the number of movie related posts I've made in this blog.  Maybe it's really that I am more particular about my movie choices, not that I watch any less.
