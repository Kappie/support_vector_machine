And I felt like I really had the time to make sure the prep was done the right way.  I slept until 1pm today, and have spent the rest of the day laying around the couch. Specifically, it has consisted of pieces of:  - Die Hard  - The Real World  - Bugjuice Marathon (I'm really digging this show for all the lessons on group dynamics, etc.)  - Lethal Weapon 3  - Overhaul  - I Love the 90s  - The CMT awards  - City Slickers  Wow, there is a lot of quality tv on Sundays.  (That would be a sarcastic opinion.)
