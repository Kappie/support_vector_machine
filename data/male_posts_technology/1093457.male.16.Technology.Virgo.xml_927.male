All-American Rejects, London Astoria. Yay, that was brilliant. Fantastic place, didn't get squished, great music, nice venue, lovely to see Jo again with her super-cool short hair. They finished with The Last Song, and the stupid things is I joked about that before we went in. A couple of them had Union flag thongs, which was, um, nice? One of the support bands where a bit nutty, especialy the guy on the keyboard, he was bouncing around like a headless chicken. Funny though. Many more people crowd surfing than at Enanesence, but not quite as voilent. One guy got on the stage and started worshiping the second support band. So all in all a very pleasent evening, thanks Jo!
