We've even had the  urlLink mother-of-all swearword collections . But we haven't had a guide to  urlLink international obscene hand gestures . That's that sorted then.  The page features the English V sign including a lovely picture of the  urlLink Thatchbitch  telling her adoring masses to piss off. It's a bit fuzzy on the history of the sign though. I always thought it was first used after the battle of  urlLink Agincourt . This was supposedly due to the practice of the French cutting off the draw fingers of any  urlLink English longbowmen  they captured which then made it a little  urlLink difficult to use a longbow . The English archers gave the Vs en-masse to the advancing French just to let them know they were ready for action.  Remember kids - swearing  is  big and it  is  clever. It's part of your history. Yay!    via  urlLink The Flophouse
