He seems to be very experienced with Preemies.  She was weighed and measured...7lbs 8oz and 20".  He said that she appeared very healthy.  The poor little thing had to get three shots.  Not even one week in her life without some poking and proding.  This coming week we have another doctor's appt on Wednesday and hopefully her final optometry appt on Thursday.  We're hanging in there, figuring things out as we go along.  Still struggling to get her to allow us to put her down to sleep.  It is getting a little better though.  Dale gave me the night off on Friday so that I could get an entire nights sleep.  I felt like a new woman on Saturday....        Today she is 3-months old.  This Tuesday was her due date.  They call this her "adjusted age."  When assessing her developmental milestones we are told to do them from her due date not her actual birthday.  I think that she will be ahead of her adjusted age developmentally though as she is already smiling, focusing on faces and this morning she rolled from her tummy to her back.  I had to put her on her tummy again to see if I was imagining it.  :-)  New pictures to be posted shortly.  We'll send out a notice and post the link here.  Love you all,  Gina.
