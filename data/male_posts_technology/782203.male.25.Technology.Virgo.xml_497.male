To Y for looking hot as hell for me earlier. To everyone who made me feel like I need to leave this hellhole. Wish me luck people.   Just met this cutest sales person who recently joined one of our partner organizations and  would be working with us closely in the near future. Well to be honest I am really worried for her - she seems so naive and young and cutesy that she's probably going to be eaten by the sharks she's gonna work with - sharks = salespeople. Hope she pulls through it.   p.s. Will be back on Friday afternoon.
