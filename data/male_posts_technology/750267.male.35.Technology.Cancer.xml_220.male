Install starts - asking for CD. CD is in the drive. Why can't it find the CD? Argh! The most likely reason is I downloaded the boot disks for Windows XP Pro Service Pack 1, and my CD is the version without the service pack.   I just downloaded the proper (non-service pack) boot disks. Let's try this again.  (By the way, how is it the BOOT DISKS have changed between XP Pro and SP1?)
