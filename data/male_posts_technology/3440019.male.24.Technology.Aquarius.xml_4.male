But the fact is they are not.     When there is something bad happening, for example, people acting violently, it is always attributed to the so called 'Bad Influence' of films. This is absolute crap. Films not only show violence but also the ill-effects of violence. It is said that violence is glorified in films so it has its influence. But so is a Hero fighting corruption (by refusing to pay/accept bribes), evil forces, educated young and good people entering politics, societal illeffects (more aptly defects). How come this is always ignored?? Please let me know how many of us have actually changed for the better after watching the movies. We accept people kissing on the screens, exposing vulgarity and few of us are ready to do the same in our lives.    We see Kamal, Rajinikanth, Amitabh, and the others fighting corruption, trying to make India a better place to live in. I ask those who claim to be ardent followers of these Heroes as to how many have actually chosen this path. I say, there are none.     This is shameful. On top of all this we also curse that our country will never improve or the society is cruel. This is utter stupidity as we are also part this society and country. We have no moral right to either criticise the media nor curse or crib about the state of affairs in our country or the society. We have the moral right to talk about this only if we follow it ourselves.    Please consider and inculcate the good things that are conveyed even in the so called 'Extremely worthless, bad' movies as every movie has some good message hidden somewhere. This is a sincere request.    I only hope this will help us realise our follies and atleast try to change so that our country can positively and surely become a great country and more important make better individuals out of us. As for me I am trying to learn the good portrayed on the big and small screen.    This is solely my personal opinion. Please feel free to post the comments on my debut weblog. Thanks for your patience.
