In the end we collected over 11 bags of rubbish!  It came as quite a shock as to how much rubbish there actually was on the beach.   After about an hour and a half we decided to call it quits and head to Inchydoney for some longboarding. The surf was tiny but that didn't stop Ivan from snaking us all (including his own girlfriend! Bad form Ivan! :P)   Thanks again to everyone for coming down, here's a pic of *some* of us with the rubbish. ;)
