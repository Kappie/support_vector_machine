"I love these things!", I said aloud while putting them on. And looking into the mirror only reinforced the feeling. I had had this particular pair of sunglasses for only about 2 years. I found them at a gas station one day on the way to my great-grandmothers funeral. I am always on the look out for a good pair of sunglasses, but on the sorrowful day I found the most best pair in the world. I only wore them on special occasions, and today was one of those occasions. The occasion was only that it was sunny.  I had a few errands to run before going to work, so I gave my boss a call and said I was going to be late. I got out to the Jeep and started taking the top off. Oh, what a great day it's going to be, I couldn't help but think. At that moment my neighbor walked up to me and complemented me on my sunglasses. Now this neighbor wasn't just any neighbor but the neighbor. You know the one we all have down the street that you only dream of hooking up with. So we started talking about sunglasses and the weather and before you know it I had a date that night.  On my way to the back I was all smiles. As I was approaching the infamous red-light right before the bank I gunned it and as always it turned yellow just in time to make me stop. "Damn!" I heard a lady's voice say beside me. When I looked over I saw that it was my Senior year Prom Queen. What luck, I thought, could it be the glasses? So I said "Hey, what's it been five, six years?" "Oh my god, is that really you?" I gave a big smile and replied "In the flesh!" So we pulled into the back and got out of the cars. First thing I hear "I like those glasses! Where did you get them?"  I said simply "At a gas station a while back.". So we got to talking and catching up. It was a very interesting conversation cause she kept flirting. I couldn't help my self either cause she had only improved with time and of course she complemented my glasses. So after about a good fifteen or so minutes and another date, I started for the back. Man I can do no wrong today, was all I could think on my way in.  When I got into the back it was time. I pulled out my hand cannon and let three fly. To my astonishment right as I did that some jerk leaned over in the path of what were only meant to be warning shots. Two of the three hit him the head and neck, respectively. Blood went everywhere and he went down like a sack of potatoes. I hadn't meant to aim so low but I couldn't really see that well cause I had left my sunglasses on, but luckily I had slipped on my mask and left the car running. So back out the door I went with my ill gotten gains. I jumped in my car and started for the street and wouldn't you know a cop was pulling in and took notice to the fact that I was speeding off with a mask on. "Oh shit!" I heard the words coming out of my mouth as I realized that if it weren't for the mask I probably would have gotten away. I saw the blue lights come on.  With out a moments delay and with the mask still on I put the jeep to work. I jumped the curb and went through the light barely missing oncoming traffic. I looked back in just enough time to see the cop get side swiped. Man my luck had turned I thought. So I took the mask off. I couldn't help but think that maybe next time I would leave my sunglasses off during a back robbery. When I got home I washed the red paint off the Jeep to show the black paint underneath. I changed the license plate back to the original that was registered to me and disposed of the old one in the trash.  After a day like that I decided to have a drink and to call out of work. I picked up the line to call the neighbor to see what she was doing later that day. She was free and said she would love to come over to go out. When she got to the house we made small talk about a bank robbery she had seen on the news where a man had been severly injured and was in the hospital. I decided to lay low that night and we stayed in. I will leave the rest to imagination...
