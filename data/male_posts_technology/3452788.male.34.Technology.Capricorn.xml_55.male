A few blocks from the office, I had this barely controllable urge to turn off before I got within sight.  I don't know what I would have done, probably just sit and berate myself for being foolish.  So I continued to work, and pulled in the lot, and walked inside, and said perfunctory hellos, and got my coffee, and started working on computers, and started typing this entry, and wonder how the hell am I going to be productive today, when I simply don't want to be here?  Obviously, this is not just the Monday blues, but a continuation of last week's funk.  Anne and I were talking about this the other night.  I basically made her listen to me because I was so desparate, and she could tell.  Up until now I thought she really didn't understand what I am going through, but I the she is starting to.  She started talking about options how to pay for things on just her income for a month or 2.  She even suggested that maybe I could work 1/2 time for a while, allowing me to make some money, while having additional time for taking care of myself.  I think she understands now that I will go nuts without doing something different.  That is actually the best idea I have heard lately.  I have not thought it out very far, but maybe I could work about 4 hrs per day - not enought time to screw around or get distracted - and then have the afternoon to do projects at home, or take time for myself, write or talk to people, or whatever I need to do to help myself.  Just broaching this idea to my supervisor is (by my fucked-up rules) admitting failure, but out of anybody in management here, this person will understand and provide support.  If necessary, I may also be able to get my therapist to order me to cut back, thus taking the decision out of my hands.
