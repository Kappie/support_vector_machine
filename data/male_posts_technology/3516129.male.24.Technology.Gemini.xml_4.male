My staff from the office passed by behind me while I was tinkering with the graphics. And not knowing the muppets, she asked "Do you even like that?" with the most puzzled, grossed out look on her face. It was like she had just seen the ugliest creature ever. And to think that these are endearing characters from 2 popular kiddy shows. In response, I just gave a sneeky smile and said "yes~" Anyways, hope she doesn't see the resemblance there.
