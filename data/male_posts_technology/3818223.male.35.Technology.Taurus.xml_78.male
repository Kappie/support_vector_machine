Descriptions are slim, but not lacking; even though this is the 11th novel in the Burke series, enough detail is present to flesh out the characters without bogging down the action.  Vachss's  urlLink Burke  character is an outlaw private-eye who knows the crime-ridden streets from the wrong side of the law.  This was an interesting point of view, and should appeal to readers of  urlLink Cornwell ,  urlLink Leonard , and  urlLink Parker .  My main complaint... was that... all...  ALL ... the characters... constantly... lapsed... into... broken... conversations... with their... words... broken... by... elipses... which... as you... know... are... three... periods... like... this... ...... see?  - 3.5 out of 5 stars
