In other Firefox news, apparently all of the viruses and worms and such are making strange bed-fellows.  The US-CERT (Computer Emergency Readiness Team) which is a division of the Department of Homeland Security is  urlLink advising  that people use Firefox (or one of the other non-Internet Explorer options).  Non-Firefox users beware however, that link WILL try to open a pop-up window of some kind (I don't know which because Firefox blocked it).  So now it is the patriotic and intellignet thing to do!
