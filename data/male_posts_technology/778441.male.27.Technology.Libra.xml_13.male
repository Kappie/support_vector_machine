So, I had a holiday today. Spent it at home... relaxing completely! I did nothing... nothing at all, the entire day... slept... listened to radio  (these new FM channels are great!)  ... ate home-cooked meals  (something I miss when I'm at the workplace) ... and slept some more! *LOL*   Well, finally in the evening I went to this new supermarket which has opened recently at Phoenix Mills compound. Its called Big Bazaar. And boy!... is it BIG!!! ... just too damn big and today being a holiday... it was just too damn crowded! Checked out a few things there... a new Nokia model  (a cell-phone model, I must specify!)  caught my eye. It was loaded with features and was good looking too! ... but I wasn't loaded with cash and so I deferred buying it. But I liked it a lot! :-)  The I went to Planet M which is just next door to this Big Bazaar. It was supposed to be Planet M's 3rd anniversary. I picked up a few casettes n CDs...  (bought a casette of Bombay Dreams... Rehman has supposedly outdone himself in this album... will have to check it out!) . I also bought a computer game... its been a long time since I bought one! :-)  So, all in all... not a bad day!... and just one day to go for the weekend to arrive!! :-))  Ok... so I guess thats it for now!  cheers!!   ... and oh yes! ... if you want to check out some of my scribblings  (my pseudo 'literary' efforts!!) , then you will find them on the links on the control panel to the right of the page! ;-)
