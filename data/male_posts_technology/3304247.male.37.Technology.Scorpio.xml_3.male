He delights in taking jabs at them and winning (most of the time).  A human  in an alien society, learns how to live and thrive. He finds he has a knack for larceny and crime.  Something fairly respectable for a human.   This being the 5th book in the series, we see that Vlad is very good at being a crime lord though he can't quite grasp that he has his bosses who can squash him like a bug if he steps out of line.  I highly recommend Steven Brust's Vlad Taltos books.
