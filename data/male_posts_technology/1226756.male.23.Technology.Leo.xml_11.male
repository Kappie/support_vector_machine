Just won't work. I have planned a reinstall of slackware during the weekend, and I think I will upgrade from 9.0 to 9.1 or maybe 10.0 if I can download it. I just got a tip to try using Postfix instead.. Should be heaps easier to config and get up and running. Have to try that over the weekend... I'll be thrilled if I get it up and running. Been thinking of a server like this for ages. Thanks to all the people on #slackware who has helped me, and all the people taking the time to write tutorials for us newbies out there. When I get a little more elite, I'll write a few tuts myself. Both in Norwegian (my native tongue) and English.
