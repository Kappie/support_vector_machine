A considerably darker, more psychological book than its predecessors, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" occupies the same emotional and storytelling place in the Potter series as "The Empire Strikes Back" held in the first "Star Wars" trilogy. It provides a sort of fulcrum for the series, marking Harry's emergence from boyhood, and his newfound knowledge that an ancient prophecy holds the secret to Voldemort's obsession with him and his family.  urlLink BBC says Rowling has brought the magic of reading to a global audience  Rowling's magical formula, so hard to replicate, is that she can keep the reader - whether young or old - enthralled.  The pages seem to turn themselves as though some unseen force drives us through the book.    urlLink The Globe and Mail says the Phoenix rises to expectations  Flashy, fast-paced, but a little flabby, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is here — all 766 pages of it.  The most anticipated book of the summer, Phoenix, the fifth book in J. K. Rowling's celebrated series of novels about an orphaned wizard raised in the home of the Dursleys — that beastly suburban family of muggles — lives up to its advance press.  urlLink The Age says its pretty gripping and the best so far!  Phew! What a read this book is! After reading 300 pages of the 766-page book, I'm pushing myself to type this review because I want to go back to the gripping story  urlLink Edmonton Journal declares it to be worth every minute of wait  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -- the eagerly awaited fifth instalment of J.K. Rowling's revered Harry Potter series -- is as creative, engrossing and satisfying as any Potter fan could hope.    Now... only if Fabmart could deliver the book to me!! I'm fuming right now!!! x-(
