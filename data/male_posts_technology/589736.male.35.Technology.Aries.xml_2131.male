My own research has revealed that Gibson intended to film an interpretation, albeit one that is more "gritty" and "violent."  In that sense -- and in that sense only -- it seems that the film can be tested against realism.  In terms of event and image, it is, like all films, a personal visual exploration.  As Ebert often says, a movie is not about what it is about, but how it is about it.  As a sidenote, there is a curious need in modern society to equate "veracity" with "truth," as if they have anything at all to do with each other.  At least once a year, a newsmagazine devotes a cover story to the "real Jesus," the "real Muhammed," the "real Whoever" -- as if evidence matters in the search for truth.  Evidence yields nothing but data.  Data has its uses, and for many from the 18th century Enlightenment onward, its presence can evoke deep satisfaction -- but in the great cocktail party of the universe, beyond nodding to each other at the cheese table, data and faith have very little to talk about.
