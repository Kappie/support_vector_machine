I finally got back around 1:30, and got almost immediately on chat.christianlinks.com #youthfire (irc).  Steven was on, and told me about his morning... not the best... at all.  To read more about it, go to  urlLink his blog  .   Yesterday, I fell asleep around 2:30pm, and woke up again around 8:45, when my parents got home, and just walked around, in a daze until around 1:20am, today.   urlLink Mark Schultz - Time Of My Life (my favorite emo song)   He packed his bags when he was just 18 To see a world he thought he'd never seen But he knew when he met her That she was the girl He'd been waiting for  And each night they spent talking on the front porch swing Like it came straight out of a movie scene But one night she stepped out as the sun began to set And when she got to the porch she found a letter that read  You're the only girl I'll ever love And I'd do anything not to give you up If I could only stop the world When you're standing by my side See I'm having the time of my life Yes, I'm having the time of my life  The months went by it was their wedding day A church on a hill, wedding bells rang away She looked like a princess All dressed up in pearls It was her proudest day  And he stood all alone in a darkened church hallway And he got down on his knees and he started to pray He thanked the Lord for his family and the perfect bride But he couldn't hold back what he was feelin' inside And he said  She's the only girl I'll ever love And I'd do anything not to give her up If I could only stop the world When she's standing by my side See, I'm having the time of my life Yes, I'm having the time of my life  Forty years went by and she lived most of God's plan She stood alone in an attic, wedding dress in her hand And she held an old letter written so long ago But she'd never forget it No matter how old  And as she turned to put the dress away And pack up the years He was standing in the doorway With his eyes full of tears And he held her  'Cause you're the only girl I'll ever love And I'd do anything not to give you up If I could only stop the world When you're standing by my side See I'm having the time of my life Yes, I'm having the time of my life
