You can now have your own somebody@toasterfiles.com e-mail address.   You access it online like you do Hotmail, but you'll not get any  enlarge you penis now  type spam shite in it.  At the moment i'm only opening this offer to members of TF, or our very close friends. If you think you're one of these, get in touch and i'll set you up.  It's free at the moment, but in the future a small fee will be charged (less than a fiver a month) to keep the server up and running. Electricity ain't free, y'know :D  Much love.
