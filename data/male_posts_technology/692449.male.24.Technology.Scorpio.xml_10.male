To be goverened means to be, at each transaction, at each movement, noted, registered, taxed, stamped, measured, evaluated, patented, licensed, authorized, endorsed, admonished, hampered, reformed, rebuked, arrested,... held to ransom, exploited, monopolized, extorted, squeezed, hoaxed, robbed, and then, at the least resistance, ... to be repressed, fined, imprisoned, machine-gunned, judged, condemmed, deported, flayed, sold, betrayed, and finally mocked, ridiculed, insulted, dishonored."
