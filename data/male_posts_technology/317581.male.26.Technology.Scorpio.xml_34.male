I don't think you can really say that someone "makes" their own problems.  I think that whatever situation you are in your mind tries to create an equalibriem.  So if you are very well off then things that I would never cross the mind of someone less well-off as being a problem become more prominent.  An example:  Someone simply disagreeing with anything I said would really ruin my day.  I would blow it up into something huge.  While people who might be going through a bankruptcy wouldn't really worry about that kind of thing.  they've got other problems.  It's almost like their "worry quota" was filled.  So I think my point is if one minute you worry about something then something bigger comes up you forget about the previous.  You don't even give a second thought to it anymore.  And when you're not worrying about these things they still work themselves out without a second thought on your part.  There can always be something bigger to worry about so why worry about anything if it can be deemed inconsequential by something else.  Anyway, though worrying is pointless i think the mind needs something negative to meditate on.  Even in the best situation it's gonna find something.    And now for something completely different:  I really hate writing about serious stuff.  We take ourselves too seriously.  If you take a step back and watch we're really pretty hilarious.  An observation a co-worker made, "We're just a bunch of monkeys wearing clothes."  He was on shrooms at the time...  We just run around thinking we're accomplishing something.  Is there really anything we can accomplish?  It's a road going nowhere.  We think, oh it's coming.  If I just work a little harder.  Get through grade school.  It's coming!  What do i do now?  Well High School.  Ok, and now?  College.  Got it, now what?  Get a job.  Sweet.  What next?  Get married, have a family.  One day you're gonna realize "Wow, I'm there..." and you're gonna feel the same way you always have.  I think it's quite obvious there isn't a point to anything we do.  So we try to make a point and maybe it'll get us somewhere.  Really it gets us nowhere, there's nowhere to go.  Religion is the funniest thing when you think about it.  It's just us trying convince ourselves there's a purpose to us being here.  Why does there need to be a purpose?  We think we're different than everything else in the world.  So we're farther up the evolutionary ladder, so what?  Face it, you're gonna die why is that so scary?  I was listening to an Alan Watts lecture a few days ago and he said something that I think really sums it up.  He said it's like the moment we were born we were pushed off a cliff.  So you're falling and it's obvious you're not gonna make it.  There's a rock falling right next to you and you cling to it for dear life.  Well the rocks not gonna do you any good, so just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.    So maybe that wasn't something completely different, here ya go:  I'm a lumberjack and I'm ok...
