Archaic. At once; immediately.    Usage Note: An original meaning of presently was “at the present time; currently.” That sense is said to have disappeared from the literary language in the 17th century, but it has survived in popular usage and is widely found nowadays in literate speech and writing. Still, there is a lingering prejudice against this use. The sentence General Walters is... presently the United States Ambassador to the United Nations was acceptable to only 50 percent of the Usage Panel in the late 1980s.    02/02/2004 23:05.43 *** Auto-response sent to Inferno0777: I'm currently rather engrosed in homework... will be back presently, but I seem to have no idea what presently means... 02/02/2004 23:06.11 Inferno0777: Hope that helps
