Corbin, Steven and I ran outside, and walked around for almost ten minutes as the huge raindrops filled the skies and soaked our shirts. (lol) The heat (65 degrees – warm by our standards) and humidity kept us warm, and I felt like I was in the most tranquil spot on earth. Standing there, at the edge of the field around the church, with water pouring down my face, I felt so peaceful; it seemed to me like the rest of the world just melted away for the little bits of time between the awesome flashes of electricity and raw power behind the deafening noise set forth. Then, as we ran around the side of the church, we saw, amidst all this, a double rainbow; a full arc from one end of the sky to the other, shining bright. My, what a stark contrast to the deep black hue that was the thundercloud. I was reminded through this, really just how awesome God's creation is, and through it, how He allows us to get a tiny glimpse at His majesty.
