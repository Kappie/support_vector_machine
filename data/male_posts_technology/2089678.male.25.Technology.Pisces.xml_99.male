Although the AMS is still ultimately responsible for installing, managing, starting, and stopping MIDlets, MIDP 2.0 applications can now be started based on a request from a remote connection or scheduled timer. This new feature brings with it a wealth of potential applications. For example, a remote application can push stock quote information on an hourly basis to a mobile device. Or how about this -- notifications from the corporate office can be sent to road warriors to alert them of schedule changes. Using the alarm feature, a MIDlet can now offer up reminders of scheduled events, such as a reminder of a meeting an hour before it begins.  This tutorial from IBM will walk through the basics of using Push technology with MIDP 2.0, including development of  a MIDlet that will be activated based on an incoming SMS message .
