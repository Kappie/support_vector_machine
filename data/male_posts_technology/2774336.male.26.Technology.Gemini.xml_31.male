       Stomach, Waves of pain 

    

     

 

 

 I went to look at an apartment today.  The location was great, the apartment was terrific, but the price was too high. 

 Afterwards I went to my best friends place and we played XBox for a little while.  My stomach was really starting to act up - waves of pain just below the sturnum - so I knew I needed to get some food.  I decided to go home to eat because I still had an uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach and the dog needed to go out as well.  I think I'll spend the rest of the day relaxing on the couch.
