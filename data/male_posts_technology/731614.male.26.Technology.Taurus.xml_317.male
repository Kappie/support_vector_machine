I think it is would only be nice to leave Drew as a temp pict for me until I can get a good authentic picture of me and my new mug for my icon.  It seems only right to me, ......and should to you all too.  In other news.... I would like to apologize for my absence, but ever since Mad has moved in, my time has been spent ... um, elsewhere.
