Everyone now knows about WinFS, the Hype which it has created around.  Came to know that there will be Inbuilit CD/DVD burner software with OS. Sparkle a Flash Killer application. Integrated Search for Computer as well as Internet. 3D desktop. Lots of Jargons were there.  urlLink Longhorn at MSDN  and  urlLink Longhorn SDK Docs provided a good information. Also got a Monad Presentation which was delivered in the PDC. ( Monad is a ksh/sh Object Oriented Shell)  But look out for  urlLink Fritz Chip  - the Cyrptoprocessor , Hardware level security features coming up.    Hope this information does not serve any marketing purpose but rather interests you in the concepts.
