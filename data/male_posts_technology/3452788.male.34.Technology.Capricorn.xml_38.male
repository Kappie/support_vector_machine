However, the officials did not account for leap year when they made their spreadsheets with Excel (good 'ol Bill Gates!).  So on race day, Dan got lumped in with the Senior division (11-14 years old).  We did not find this out until after the race had begun, and he was basically stuck.  He had to swim 200m, bike 6 miles, and run 1+ miles, rather than half that effort as he thought he would be doing.  So at the beginning of the race, you are prepared for your race, your distances, etc., then you start and realize you have to do twice the work - how many people (not just 11-yr-olds, but adults also) would quit, give up, mot make it, or make excuses?  Dan did not quit, he ran the race and knew the error the whole time, but he just did it anyway!  Afterward I know he was proud, although he was trying to downplay the whole thing.  The officials even gave him an inspiration award for not quitting after their mistake.  His time? 51:20 (approximately).  He (and all the other 11-14 kids) had to work for almost an hour.  I know I couldn't do it in that time!  I am very proud of my son for working so hard.
