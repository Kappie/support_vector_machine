She told me yet again how she did not have the right color crayons to color a picture for me so I may just have to remedy that issue.  Not because I need a picture but if she is saying she does not have the right crayons I should be the stand up daddy and get her some.  Then I look like the Hero!!  She said she had a banana popsicle which sounded good.  I did not have much to return to her other then I was tired and doing homework.  After I said I was tired Karissa said "me too" so I asked her if we should hang up now.  She said yes because I am tired and have to go to bed.  I heard   SFW   say you are not going to bed now.  Then Karissa yawned and   SFW   laughed and said you are so silly.  Now normally I would not mention it just because although it was funny it is no big deal.  However, hearing   SFW   laugh and see Karissa's facial expression and stuff made me really angry for some reason.  I can only think it is jealousy.    Maybe I am losing it?  Maybe I was over reaacting but it made me want to jump through the phone at   SFW  .  Instead I gave Karissa hugs and kisses and told her I would call tomorrow.
