I am the Systems Administrator here at Phoenix Worldwide Industries, Inc.  I work with my buddy Adrian.  It's a cool job, lots of responsibility, but who the fuck cares.  I want to get drunk.  After work I'm gonna go home and try to go to the gym.  TV sucks now that summer is starting, so I really don't have any excuse not to go.  I have no money, no weed, and no girlfriend, so what else am I gonna do??  I'll write more later when I have better shit to say.
