Only I feel the effort was a futile one as Seonaid (like many people) will still see them as the flying incarnation of Satan. What the hell is it with those things anyway? Why single moths out for such speciesism? I mean, lets be honest here if you were a pair of pants or a particularly expensive shirt I could understand the phobia (those buggers go through clothes like George Bush goes through crayons) but for the humans amongst us, a fear of something so small and relatively harmless just seems absurd. Imagine how the moth feels being chased around the room with a magazine, getting smacked about and squashed whilst having to deal with high pitched human noises like "ohmygodohmygod killitandynowpleeeease, arrghitsthereitthereohmygod!". Its not easy being a moth you know, they aren't considered as cute and photogenic as their butterfly cousins, they don't frolic in the fields and pastures on an idyllic summers day. They have to fly round rooms at subsonic speeds kamakaziing into any available light source whilst making loud noises (much to the annoyance of the rooms occupiers). So please, spare a thought for the moth, give it a chance, don't get miffed by a moth, killer moths are a myth. (I see a teeshirt in the pipelines there!)      Oh and Part three of the Cardboard Jungle will be published in the next day or two, and that's a KinPromise(tm)
