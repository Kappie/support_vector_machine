 Yet another way Microsoft will prevent defections to Linux. I firmly believe Microsoft will take all the steps needed to prevent any real threat to it's monopoly  desktop  (not server). If they see any erosion of their market share, like the "Godfather" of the industry, they will give businesses "offers they cannot refuse". Is that wrong? Is that corrupt? I don't think soit's just smart business, and that is why Microsoft is where it is today.
