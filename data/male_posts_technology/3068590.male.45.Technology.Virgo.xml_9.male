Of particular interest is the alliance with Panasonic. Seems like Apple has prepared a method to secure the intellectual property rights of the movie creator and ensured that the technology respects that any copying will only be done in an authorized manner. I'll bet Pixar would never be interested in that. Doing a deal with Panasonic is a first for both companies and proves that Apple can establish standards with any electronic manufacturer. Somebody should think about doing that with Music, wait Jobs did but he only implemented it several years ago.  Ho hum another day that Jobs locks up another major future business, while all the others run around trying to get into the music business.  Jobs needs to understand that talking big is more important than products, services and strategic positioning years in advance of the rest of the manufacturers.  On a related manner the announcement of Storage Area Network services will be available in the fall of 2004 shows a distinct lack of understanding that Apple is a PC company and not a super computer vendor. (Virginia must have been a fluke!) Besides Intel is only now planning commercial versions of 64 bit processors with Microsoft announcing their 64 bit offering in 2005. Why does jobs not understand that delivering 64 bit processors, operating systems and applications will never win over customers. Just announce the stuff is coming, thats all that the consumer wants!  I hope that the press continues with their field day in making Apple look like a bunch of idiots, the press needs the company. It certainly will be a long time before Jobs realizes that execution is more important then strategy, at least so the saying goes.  In an unrelated manner, keep serving lunch Jobs, the press and your competitors don't seem to get it.
