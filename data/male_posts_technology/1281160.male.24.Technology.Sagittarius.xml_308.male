(which is just 15KM from TN border and 20KM from Hosur bus stand). Hope u got the context. Life is another matrix. There are invisible relationships between the many visible elements of life. You always seem to be understanding things but still never understand anything. Hindu philosphy calls precisely this, as "Maya".  The Vedas state that whatever is happening all around is Maya, a dream which Lord Vishnu sees as He sleeps. Maya, as a concept, is both fluid and unstable. It exists but, at the same time, it is fictitious.  This explanation is analogous to The Matrix philosophy, which states that we live in an illusory world and only an unplugged/awake world is the real world. In the movie, Neo, Morpheus and Trinity often leave the real world behind and, by computer wizardry, enter the Matrix. But it is not their physical beings, but their mental projections which fight all the battles. This recalls the Vedanta concept of ‘mithya’, the belief that only the Almighty is real.  As jax put it, Matrix (both parts) abounds with theological references and has a deep profound meaning than what looks at first sight.   Hail Matrix...!!!
