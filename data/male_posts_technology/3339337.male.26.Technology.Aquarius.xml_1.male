Light and small design, Opera implemented to connect to WEB, more generic mail application implemented following POP3 and SMTP, and reasonable monthly fixed payment! It's attractive enough for me, when I think of it without just one point that it's unusable in Hong Kong :( Anyway I heard he bought it already, so that hope he will enjoy it soon.   urlLink Check AH-K3001V out!  (Sorry for contents in only Japanese)
