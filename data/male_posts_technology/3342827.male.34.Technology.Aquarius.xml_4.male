I read a few reviews which were not very supportive, largely criticizing it for not keeping to the story of the Illiad. This made me feel somewhat naive as I don't know what the Illiad is all about. However, it's a good story, good bits of action and enough bronzed Brad to keep the girls happy. Although if I'd been Brad and worked out for a year to get that body, I'd be a bit miffed at only showing it off for a few seconds. Were all the dreams of eating pizza really worth it? In my opinion, no. *calls Dominos*  I also spent the weekend watching some DVDs; Black Hawk Down (3½/5), Magnolia (4/5) and Pretty Woman (4/5). Only Passion of the Christ has managed 4½ this year so I've yet to see a 5/5 movie but I've got my fingers crossed. The next movie for me will probably be The Day After Tomorrow in a fortnight's time, maybe this will be this year's best movie for me. I also read that Bus 174 should be a good movie but trying to find it playing somewhere is proving to be very tricky.  I also did very little work on my own movie site, Project TPR, largely due to a dinner date on Saturday evening and some Guanayan rum. We'll see how this week goes but I've just about setup a spare machine at work so I can carry on developing in between supporting the systems.
