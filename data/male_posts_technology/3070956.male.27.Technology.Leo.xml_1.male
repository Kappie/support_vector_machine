I had a nice relaxing morninig with my family.  I took my time, worked a little, read a little, watched TV with my father and my sister, toured my mom's garden's with her (they're really great this year), and proceeded to NY to visit with my client.       Jewel in front of my parent's house  urlLink         urlLink     urlLink     urlLink      My mommy  urlLink        It's been absolutely beautiful out this week and the traffic was less compared to usual all around.  My mom and I thought about going to the beach Wednesday morning since she's not busy, but I've got plans in Pittsburgh... on the way into NJ had a really great conversation with the real-estate girl for over an hour.  She's like me in that she quit a good job to take a risk on something else within the last year.  So we have a date, hehe.  Anyway, everyone has been working hard so were able to quickly pop out changes for the software that were suggested by my client on Friday already.  I implemented the changes there on Monday and at some point spoke with my best friend Warren who suggested we get some drinks in the Village.   I picked him up near his work downtown and we drove to Greenwich Village.  We ended up at this place called  urlLink 1849 . It was  awesome .  They had live music by this guy who was singing popular songs by people like Neil Diamond, Peter Gabriel, Elton John and other stuff one can sing along to, hehe.  Warren and I had a great time talking to each other, the bartender - Jessica Jacobs, and this guy we met there named Leonardo Mayorga.  We had such a fun time at this place.  We ate wings and drank a lot of beer, but on Tuesday nights they have a $2.50 special on all beer - what a deal in NYC.       Me, Warren and Leo   urlLink    Our bartender, Jessica Jacobs  urlLink      urlLink    Me and the performer at 1814... picture really suks tho'      Now, on my way to pick up Warren, I somehow got the idea to call Ariane Motylewski.  Now, when I was a teenager, my parents and started taking us camping in Maine for summer vacation and we always had a great time.  My favorite vacation ever was when I met Ariane.  I swear she was like the first girl I ever fell for hahaha.  We spent a lot of time together on that vacation, and she was from Brooklyn, NY and I was from NJ.  I remember that she also came to this big 16th birthday party that we threw at Warren's house.  That was the last time I saw her - my 16th birthday - almost 12 years ago!  But I call her once in a while... the last time was like 6 years ago just to see how she is and what she's up to.  I remembered her last name and called directory assistance.  They gave me a number and I called and left a message not sure if it was even her voice on the machine at the other end. Well, she called me back while I was with Warren, we spoke a little and caught up with each other a bit... and later that nigth diring a phone call I asked her if we could meet since I had to drop Warren off ot his apartment and she lived nearby.  She agreed and we meet for the first time in 12 years - at 3:30 AM on a Tuesday morning. WOW.  I still can't get over how neat that is for me when I think about it.  Ariane Motylewski, 15 years old.   Lake Pemaquid, Maine (1991).  urlLink     Friends I made in 1991 at Lake Pemaquid on vacation. I'm the one (15 years old) all the way to the left.  Ariane is sitting next to me.  urlLink     We had a nice time talking - she took me to this bar near her house called the  urlLink Wicked Monk . We went to the door and it was locked, but if you know me I'm pretty persistent and knocked because I saw that there were still a few people left at the bar.   urlLink Cozmic  comes to the door and I ask im if he could please let in two alcoholics who haven't seen each other in 12 years.  He thought for a few  seconds and said we could stay for one drink and then we had to get right out.  He later said that he looked up someone once after such a long time and that it was neat.  He also said there must be something special in the air because other people came to the door before us and he didn't let them in, but he felt compelled to let us in.  He was a nice guy.  The bar was also very cool.  I'd like to check it out sometime when there are more people.  We had nice conversation and a but not a very long one there since the place was closing.  We just sat in my car in front of Ariane's place and talked for about an hour... it was a nice time and the end to a  VERY  full day.  Needless to say, I was too weary to drive very far and ended up crashing at Warren's house and got little sleep. Yet, when I woke up I was suprised to find how much I liked the neighborhood where Warren's new apartment is (he  JUST  moved like.. two weeks ago).  There were little shops and stores and a Mall was in walking distance.  Very cool.  I could totally live in a place like that.    Warren in looking to get into real estate and he's asked me to help him since I have a couple of properties already and he thinks I know something.  So on my way out I saw a real estate office and went over and spoke with the President/Broker about the possibility of getting Warren started. It was a fun conversation.  I think her name was Betty.  Hopefully, Warren will go over to see her before she forgets all about our conversation.  I went to visit my client and spent the rest of my day there.  Leo said he might call me to go to Jones beach, but I didn't hear from him until about 5:45 when I was already on my way back to NJ... but I was glad he called becuase I'd like to keep in touch - we all had fun hanging out the night before.  I was hoping to visit my uncle Tony at the resturaunt he's working on getting open soon.  I haven;t seen him in a while, but we couldn't catch each other afterall this afternoon. Oh well.  Instead I went and bought my digital camera. I was considering purchasing the Minolta Dimage Xt, but checked the Minolta website just yesterday to find that there's an updated model - the  urlLink Dimage Xg  When I was buying it I saw even smaller (though more expensive cameras - notably by Casio and Panasonic - neat).  I charged my phone up tonight - so watch out!  I'm about to start taking pictures all the time now. I even bought a pouch for it so I can keep it on my belt, hehe.  I'm excited!
