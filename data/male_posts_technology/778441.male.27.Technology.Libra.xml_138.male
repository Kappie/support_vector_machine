" You no longer have to be embarrassed by the untimely passing of intestinal gas among your friends or family. " The  urlLink GasBGon  Flatulence Filter Seat Cushion " ...has been designed and tested to absorb the odor and sound of flatulence. " Buy one today for yourself, a loved one or a friend.  Hahaha... I think this will boost the beans business!! And the standard line at the dinner table will change from, " Honey, could you pass the salt please " to " Honey, you could pass the wind, if you want! "!!! ;) :p
