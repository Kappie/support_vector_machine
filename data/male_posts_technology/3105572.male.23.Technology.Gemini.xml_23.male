Don't you wish life was full of those!  I remember going to youth camps and conventions and stuff, and now even the Promise Keepers meetings.  It's nice to have those spiritual highs so that we can grow in Christ. However, we need to step off of the mountain to witness to others.  So, don't always be looking for those moments in worship services and the such because they are just that,  Moments.  They don't happen every time.  We have to focus on the real goal of witnessing.
