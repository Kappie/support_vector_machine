Both were interesting lah but neither was what I really wanted. Anyway, I spoke with a lady and I was told they weren't taking any SOs now. Each year there's only 2 batches of intake and sometimes just 1 batch even. My heart sank when I heard this. But oh well, I'm happy with this job now and I'm sure I will learn stuff here. Might as well make use my stay here and pick up what I can first.  Tang did advise me to take up the Coast Guard thing first and just go through the 9mths training in Police Academy first, then request for a transfer to the land unit later. But I know that approval is subjected to vacancies in the force. If there isn't any, I seriously don't want to be stuck within the Coast Guard.  Also spoke to the lady about the contract scheme. Bond is just 2 yrs, not 6 yrs which I initially thought. That's good news. But I forgot to ask her about UN Peacekeeping. Was also told that they will advertise in the newspapers and on the website when recruitment for SO is open again. She also that if they were taking anymore people this year, I could send in my resume sometime in Aug to the ManPower office. I won't need to send in my application anymore though because they've stored it in a database already. Well I hope the rest of this year I can build up my resume and get a reference from school. Maybe that will help my application then too. She also mentioned somethat the 3 wks overseas leadership training is conducted in Thailand now, instead of Nepal like I had thought. I guess they rotate the locations every now and then. Sure hope that when/if I get in, I'll be able to go somewhere either really nice or exotic. Thailand's OK, but it wouldn't be my first choice (as though I've any).
