Apparently it was not a 'normal' school shooting as such but a plot to wipe out the largest number of Americans in one go. It wasn't just a couple of kids that were hacked off at being bullied and laughed at - one of them had a messianic-grade superiority complex and if he hadn't taken part in,  died, at Columbine may well have went on to do something much worse in later life.
