Mainly because the people told me I speak good french. But it was okay. I booked a 2 week holiday to Austria to go skiing, and then Jackie and I are sharing a caravan tomorrow night, for 2 nights. What fun. I also bought some shampoo which cost me £18 (rip off!), and some coffee and cheese. Oh, and a hat. Jackie purchased the lovliest pink bag, have to say that it suited her so well! Ha ha. But the journey was awful. Hours of the tube (about 26 stops I think, on the smelly district line). Then it was raining, and the teachers didn't know whre we were going- they had to stop and ask for directions!! Then on the way back Ms Slark said we all had to  get off the train at East Croydon, even though the train we were on would have taken us straight home, and if we got off the train we'd just be getting striahgt back on it. But no, we have to get off. So after a lot of arguing I was quite cross. But then right at the last minute the 3 of us who wanted to get the East Grinstead train just announced that was what we were going to do and legged it before she could say much! But it would have been really stpuid otherwise, and probably ad ded about 30 minutes onto our journey. Bloody hopeless teachers. Anyway! What's everyone else been up to today?
