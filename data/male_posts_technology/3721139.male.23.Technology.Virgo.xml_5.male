The cops were out like I'd never seen before, and folks were getting MIPs left and right. Pretty crazy. Early on, Kyle and I hit up the convience store for some cigs, and when we came back there were these two girls sitting with our group. Apparently, they were sisters, and of course, one was cute. So there Kyle and I are talking to the cute one, and everyone is having a good laugh. What's so funny? Oh, just that she's FIFTEEN YEARS OLD. Stupified, we needed a drink, so it was off to New York Sub for $2 chuggers. When we got back we all had a lot of fun laughing about it.  Let's see, I ran into a girl from a past ski trip - she's going sky diving today. I attempted to get an invite to come along, but apparently you've got to reserve seats on the plane ahead of time. I had nothing better to do today, so why not jump out of a plane? Oh well, maybe next time.  I ran into another pair of sisters, one of whom I've known for a long time.  Yes, they are  old enough to drive , but not old enough to drink. The one I knew had gotten herself an MIP. We hung out for a while, I ran into some more old friends. I got her number, maybe we'll keep in touch this time.  Around closing time, we decided that we were hungry, so it was off to MickyDees for burgers and fries of various heart-clogging obesiety-inducing flavors. Unfortunately, what we didn't know, was that it was African-American appreciation night. Probably every black person in College Station was there. Now, being a progressive on race relations, I was all for going in, but the girls in the car vetoed that idea. We ended up at Whataburger, and you'd think that was safe from vocal, possibly mililitant, minorities right? Wrong, gay appreciation night at the Whataburger. I'm sorry, but some gay men look completely stupid; I know my fashion sense is bad, but who  really  thinks turned up collars on pink polo shirts on round gay men with spiky hair is sexy? Thankfully, tonight it was Kyle, and not myself, that got hit on. We all had a good laugh at the "well aren't you a pretty boy?" comment he received.  And then I drove home, turned on the chillout stream from di.fm, and went to sleep. 568 minutes of ambient/psychedelic/chillout trance later, I'm posting this, and damnit, I forgot to record the stream. *sigh*  It's a beautiful day outside, so I'm going to go play.
