I don’t know if many of you know but every now and then Katharine and I look after a friends dogs when he goes on holiday.  This weekend he came back from his trip away and while I went to pick him up at the airport Katharine packed our things away.  So this morning while I was getting ready to go to work I asked Katharine where she had placed my Security Pass for work.  After spending 10 mins tearing the flat to pieces we still could not find it.  Then Katharine all of a sudden remembers where she had put it and opens up the fridge and retrieves my Security pass form a box of Alpen chewy bars inside.    Obviously I kicked myself while walking to work for having disturbed Katharine and not having looked there in the first place.
