Well really, one that would outwardly indicate my sexual preference the other was more or less a secret crush.   I was in the second grade when I make friends with Peter Piotrowski. He was in the third grade. My family had a swimming pool and I invited him to come over shortly after summer recess started to spend the day swimming. I remember him being so cute and funny with very blond fine hair and I was so happy that someone actually liked me, I didn't have a lot of friends at the time. My parents were furious that I had invited him over, notsomuch that they didn't want me to have friends but I hadn't cleared it through them and they were uptight about the possibility of a strange kid coming over to use our pool. It certainly would have been sad for them should I have drowned but if an outside kid had an accident, well they didn't want the fiduciary responsibility. Of course I cried and cried. I couldn't possibly tell them that I loved Peter, and truthfully I don't think I knew that's what the issue was -I mean I was only 8; but all I wanted was to be with him. (Oy, even then, the drama) They eventually relented and Peter did come over at some point, but I remember it being quite anti climactic; even if I didn't have the mental capacity to understand why or how this was so. Once he was at my house, I kinda just wanted him to leave.Not only was I exhibiting the signs of being gay, I was acting like a typical gay male well beyond my years. We want what we want, but as soon as we get it we want something else.   The second outward sign of my homosexuality came about two years later. Keir Pellisero was a new kid to our school. He was athletic, cute with really nice tassled brown hair, with just a little curl to make him even more handsome. We had chorus practice in the schoolgymnasium andI was seated behind him; thisonly hard wired me into believing even at this early age that attractive people were moved to the front while the more average looking people are relegated to the back. One day during chorus practice I impulsively started playing with Keir's hair, twirling it in my fingers with abandon. When I look back I was probably freaking him out, or at least you would think that would freak him out but he remained still; neither stopping me nor indicating that I was doing something forbidden. This went on for several minutes until the teacher admonished me in front of the entire class with "Frank, stop playing with Keir's hair". Instantly the room filled with the laughter of the entire class which shot through me like a humiliation filled lightening bolt; though outwardly I would just shrug it off. I think that was my first realization that boys liking boys was bad, forbidden and should me kept to yourself. In 1974, at the age of 10 I wouldn't have been aware that 5 years earlier my older "brothers and sisters"rioted at theStonewall Innfor the expressed purpose ofexhibiting sexual freedom. It would take me another 10 years to come to terms with my own liberation.   Utopia is the only place I am aware of wherea boy or girl wouldn't have to feelhumiliated, ashamed, shunned or an outcast for being different. There's no denying that we are closer then ever to just such a society but still we are far from being free. Matthew Shephard was brutally murdered just for being different, I was simply made fun of and ridiculed for a couple weeks untilBilly Baker threw upduring class. Thank youBilly for taking the heat off me, even if that wasn't your intention.
