The second time I was able to get Gma  Gpa on the phone and they talked to Karissa.  Karissa appeared to enjoy the conversation and had a good time talking to them.  I had to go to work so I tried to keep the con call going but when I hung up the phone hung up on them.  I feel bad because that means Karissa got hung up on and she wanted to talk to Gma  Gpa more.  I told Karissa if it hangs up to have mommy call them back but of course that did not happen.    I have to figure out how to con-call at home so they can talk again.
