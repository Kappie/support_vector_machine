THAT IS a Can't Lose Combination!  Speaking of can't lose - North Shore tonight on Fox.   Speaking of single - it's good to be back! The relief from having to worry about someone's else is huge. No more feeling vulnerable, no more having to figure that person into the equation. Don't get me wrong - there are alot of great things I will miss, but the relief is palpable!   That said, I got debaucherously drunk Friday night at a local college haunt. GOOD TIMES! Yet Bad times when there was a pissing incident!!!! I won't go into details here. It requires a personal telling of an epic tale that will go down in history...  Let's just say, Timmy B- it's just one more thing we've both DONE. HEY!!!
