I needed to dispose of a few plastic containers that I used to move in and our apartment complex only offers a chute for trash bags.  These plastic totes barely fit into my hatchback, so they sure as heck were not going to fit down that chute.  

Thankfully, there is a large string of medical centers about a block from here because of the hospital being so close.  Friday night at 5 PM, the day after a holiday, few people are going to be in the office.  I found a dumpster and it found my totes.
