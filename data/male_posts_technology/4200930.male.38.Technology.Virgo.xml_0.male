I put the wins down to hard work and a very lucky dog! And of course my long suffering other half, Beth, without whom none of this would be worthwhile.  Didn’t sleep very well last night – too hyped up over the win, and awoke this morning at 6am ready to go straight away! Usually it takes an hour or so to get ‘with it’ first thing but it was like I pinged straight awake!  After shopping today I went straight around to the local ‘comping club’ and swapped entry forms and we did the ritual creep around the table to see what had been won etc? No one could believe my luck and requested I leave some prizes for them next month!  Of course I’m ‘paying’ the lucky dog back in treats, purchased today a very large bag of doggy biscuits to keep the dog happy.  What a great time this is, the memories may fade but at least I felt like a lottery winner for a time.
