It took me five years in Richmond, miserable and aimless, aware of something missing that I could never identify, to get where I am.   Think on it now. You may still have plenty of time, but it will fly by. Decide what you want and go get it, girl. I know that you can do it.   It's smart to have a fall-back field, but unless you make your dreams a priority they'll become your second choice. So don't forget the training for your chosen path (as well as the practical path), and start laying plans now to meet your goals.  And Mir, I don't know CUNY law school but I do have a friend in Columbia law school (an NYU master's in poetry who's becoming a lawyer to please his traditional Chinese parents). But enough about subverted intentions.
