It should seriously cut back on time spent in airports, and therefore save a lot of money on overprized foodstuffs. But I cannot help but wonder where I will find time to read books and magasines..
 The bigger problem is having a name with norwegian letters in it, as they do not translate easily. The obvious solution to this is to adopt a few foreign names. My norwegian name apparently means 'one who works the earth', a farmer. The british equivalent to this would be George, which also means farmer. Fortunately George has several well known foreign  
 "translations": In Spain it is Jorge, and i Catalunia it is Gorka. Any other translations or comments would be welcome, in case I need yet another local name on my travles ;)
