An antivirus program, such as Norton or McAffee, searches a users computer for things such as viruses, trojans, and worms. Every couple of hours it checks the Internet to see if there are any updates available. If there are, it downloads them and rescans the computer.                While this makes since to most people, I truly don't understand. Is it not the Operating system writer that leaves the hole for a virus to come through? Why do we continue to see products like Mac OSX, Linux kernel 2.XX.X, Windows XP or Longhorn? Shouldn't we finish a product before we move on to the next level. Shouldn't an Operating System by "hacker proof" or "complete" before they move on to the next OS.                Windows 98.                Yes, the old faithful, Windows 98. While it had its share of problems and quirks, it was a leap ahead of ME, 2000, and XP in regards to security. Maleware writers had a much harder time writing viruses with this OS.                 The Big Question is; why did Microsoft even move beyond this OS when even it, while in our eyes is perfect, still held many errors and holes. Didn't Microsoft think to figure out how to fix these holes and making it more "hacker proof" before bringing out completely new code in a new OS..                 Hmm, I think I see something                Mac OS9 - OSX                While Mac OS 9 and OS X may not be the main stream OS, it certainly is a popular one with the graphics and medical professions. This Operating System almost seems completely out of reach of Maleware writers, I believe it doesn't get attacked like windows only because of a lack of interest in the OS as a whole and therefore not complete as a "hacker proof" OS.                The Big Question is; I have a really hard time saying anything bad about Mac's OS's but with the recent release of security bugs found in OS X and up, one has to wonder whether Apple has their stuff together every time they upgrade their OS or if its just low usage of the OS that keeps it safe from attack.                Linux/Unix                While Unix is used in so many different industries, it tends to only be subject to direct attacks against certain companies. Why? We're not sure. Could be because if a person who knows Unix well enough to write a virus for it, usually is getting paid to maintain it.                Now on the other hand is Linux. Linux is riddled with security holes.                 So what makes it different? Open Source does.                With any Operating System, two things happen at the same time when a security hole is found. (1) Maleware writers quickly take advantage of the hole with viruses because the Company owning rights to the OS doesn't want or accept any advice or allow anyone to see the code and present possible solutions.. (2) The OS creator/company puts out a patch 30-90 days after the discovery of the hole, depending wholly on the Anti-Virus companies to protect the user until the correct answer can be found. But with Linux, when a new security whole is found, again two things happen but at different times. (1) Maleware writers and programmers put their heads together and find a solution to the problem and then submit it to the Linux Community. (2) the Linux community releases an updated kernel/Patch as quickly as possible.                The Big Question is: Is it because of Open Source that Linux/Unix doesn't need anti-virus programs? No, not wholly, but close. It is the simple facts that as a computer programmer looking to do something with his mind, he can simply find a hole and fix it. With any other OS, the only thing a programmer can do is write a virus because he has no access to the source code and henceforth cant fix the problem.                        What's the answer to the Anti-Virus cycle? Open source? No, we don't think so. But how about just finishing an Operating System before bringing it out and decreasing the need for Anti-Virus programs?
