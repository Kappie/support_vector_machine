I might be doing a fictional blog for them! Cool, right? You're damn right! You might have noticed I changed the name of RTH to "200 OK" and it has a meaning. (Helen, it has a NAME!)  You know how at the beginning of a link it has HTTP?  That stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. HTTP has a bunch of different codes for web pages. If it's not there, it's a 404 Not Found. If you're not allowed, it's a 403 Forbidden. Things like that.  BUT! If the page loads normal, the response from the server that is hosting the site is none other than:   200 OK   That means your page loaded normal, and you should never see the 200 OK code. It's good.  That's why I renamed it 200 OK. Because it's so nerdy, yet so fucking cool.  WORLD WIDE WAR DRIVE FOUR IS ON SUNDAY.
