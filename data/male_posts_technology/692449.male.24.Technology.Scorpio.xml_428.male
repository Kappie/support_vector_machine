An Iraqi judge issued an arrest warrant for the former darling of the Bush administration for counterfeiting Iraqi currency and money laundering. (He also has been under investigation for passing U.S. secrets to Iran.) His nephew,  Salem Chalabi , the chief prosecutor in the case against Saddam Hussein, has also been charged with participation in the June murder of an Iraqi official who had been investigating the Chalabi family and the Iraqi National Congress for illegally seizing hundreds of properties after the U.S.-led invasion last year. The  Los Angeles Times  reports, "Supporters like Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz were not available for comment."     ECONOMY – WAL-MART IS NO BARGAIN:  CBS News reports Americans are paying a stiff price for bargains at the mega corporation  Wal-Mart . According to a recent University of California, Berkeley study, Wal-Mart actually takes a lot more from communities than it gives back  in low prices. "Because of the low wages and because people do not have health insurance through their employer, people rely on public support to make ends meet," says the school's Ken Jacobs. In California, taxpayers pay an estimated $82-million a year to take care of health care, food stamps, and other social services for Wal-Mart employees.
