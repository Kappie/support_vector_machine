Upon pulling out the table, i saw some 'table art' courtesy of some guy.. that wrote R.M.I.T in bold and below, it said   R -icky  M -artin  I -nstitute  T -echnology  Wa kaoz, after spending 2.5yrs here in my favourite Uni.. and there we have it. a abbreviation that absolutely skew the meaning of university education, where u can find abbreviation and some idiot will try to skew the meaning of it. What a mook!  autumn, 13 deg cel
