So with Jemma still sleeping i snuck into my "server room", to see if there were any new caches in my area, as it so happened there was... about 8 miles away as the crow flies, needless to say i was out the door by 07:30 and had the cache in hand by 08:00, first to find (my 5th), andback in time to have breakfast.    Because Jemma was not busy working or doing her nails etc... she decided to come with on one of my little adventures, she is not as keen as i am, she likes to take things slow, I don't,so she tends to get left or dragged along the trail.I am going to have to get a couple of Garmin Rino's (they have the ability to let you know where in the world the other gps is, and is a two way radio too).    Watership down and surrounds is a place i have wanted to visit for a while, and it was not far from home either, feels like a million miles away when you are there it is really picture book stuff.   A place that also deserves a mention is Ashley Warren, which has chickens andGUINEA FOWL running around!!!   Visited a few places mentioned in the book, "Nuthanger Farm", "Caesars Belt" and not to mention Watership down itself, all these places actually exist, which makes things quite weird.    Will post some photo's hopefully they will be of a better quality as i took them with my digital camcorder.
