Namiss ko magbasa ng mga post, namiss ko yung mga kwento sa buhay ng iba. Hehehe… well honestly on that particular period of time in the center of love and hate, I have lost my passion in writing and right now medyo inaantok pako at wala ako sa sarili dito sa office. Well this is not about lovelife, puyat lang ako. Nagising ako 8 wherein I supposed to wake up at 6 because my work starts at 9. Because of these big eye bugs na namamaga kanina pang madaling araw eh napa punta ako sa 7 11. bago pumasok. nawala kase yung sunglasses ko and wala nako choice, kelangan ko bilin yung jollogs na sunglasses sa 7 11 para masuot ko at wag ako mapagkamalan nag drudrugs.  ganda ng porma ko! naka all black and nka redish sunglasses. pwedeng pwede na sa quiapo.  sisimulan ko na ang aking 1st entry for the month of august:  The 1st winter breeze struck me right in the midst of the spring season. It was april I think when me and joy (the girl I met in the office few months ago) had been super close to the maxx that led us to cross beyond the boundaries of friendship. Ang masama non, kung gaano ako kabilis dumiskarte, ganon din kabilis nag end up yung feelings nya. Well it was few weeks before my birthday. Ngayon me bago nang sumusundo sa kanya and I don’t give a damn. It’s just that sometimes I used to get pissed off by some officemates who thinks na “busted” ako wherein the first place I am not. I never courted her because at that time I don’t even need to court her anymore. Pero syempre, I need to get my feet on the ground and start keeping quiet than bragging about things that happened between us for her good sake. I don’t need to bother myself with their speculations because I’m already happy about what I am right now. “He” knew it =)  Yeah sad story but happy ending still. Not because we ended up lovers because we never did, it’s because she’s a very God-fearing lady and because of that I learned so many things in life, which I am quite applying up to now.  Ok na din yon. I learned my lesson it’s almost like second nature for us to want something that we don’t have, sometimes we get too focus on getting that something and we tend to ignore those things that are lying around in the open. The scary part is getting what we thought we always wanted and in the end realizing that it is not what we really want after all. I don’t want to waste my time for a person unworthy of my love. It’s a sad thing that we’re having problems finding the right person because we’re too busy making the wrong person right for us.  Cge mamya nalang ulit. Mukhang ginaganahan nako mag blog ulit ah’..
