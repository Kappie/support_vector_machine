I would say that everyone under the sun are Feckless wonders but that is harsh for the truly intelligent amongst us. I am convinced that there is a jean out there for stupidity and aragent. I think it's call DUMB-FUCK chromosome. One day we will evolve enough to leave this chromosome in the shitty end of the Jean-pool, but till then we all suffer.  Who are these people? Well they the type that can not accepted when there wrong and in the wrong to boot. They instead try to pawn off there short coming on other... And generally the best thing about these people is they try to blame the poor fuck that try to make sense of their fuck up!   Life is hard.... But I guess that what make it worth wile.
