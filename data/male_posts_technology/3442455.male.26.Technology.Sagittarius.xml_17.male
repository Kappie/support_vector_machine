I've never faced up to the details of her death. I knew they were out there but I never wanted to know what happened until recently. I have so many fond memories and stories about the time I spent with her.  I will share those at some point.  For now let me just state that I still love Dana and think about her and her family often.  Rest in Peace Dana, I miss you very much.   urlLink http://starbulletin.com/1999/06/08/ireland/index.html
