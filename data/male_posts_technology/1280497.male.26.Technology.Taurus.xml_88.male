In the category of "Things I Can't Justify Paying For, But Which I Gladly Pay For" is the  urlLink Rhapsody music service . Rhapsody provides thousands of albums for my listening pleasure, all for 9.95 a month. It's not a great price, but I do rationalize (notice I didn't use the term "justify") by the fact that if I were to purchase the albums that I listen to, I would spend thousands of dollars. This only costs 10 dollars a month.  The obvious retort to that would be, "Well, you wouldn't really buy those CD's, would you? It's not really a savings if you never would have bought it." That statement is true: I would not buy all the CD's I listen to through the Rhapsody service. But I wouldn't ever get the chance to listen to so much good music, either. This fact sort of brings it all full-circle. If I don't subscribe because it saves money, and I don't intend on buying the CD's, then why bother? Because I get to have that much music at my disposal, whenever I am at a computer (which ends up being 60+ hours a week--plenty of time to get my money's worth.) Not only that, but when I'm not at the computer, Julie can log into the service and listen to ABBA here at home.  ---------------------------  Stanley slept from about six until maybe nine o'clock tonight while we sat in the back yard on a blanket. I got some good pictures of his feet and head, which perhaps I'll be able to put on the site at some point. The batteries died during the photo shoot, so I'll have to recharge them before anything happens with the camera.  ---------------------------  I've been practicing the piano, and having an easy time with certain music, and tougher times with other music. Specifically, I was having a really hard time today making my left hand play a note with the middle finger while my right hand was playing a note with the pinky. It was something about the notes before that combination that was giving me fits, and I'm not sure why.  The highlight during practice today was when I was playing a song, "kaleidoscope", that is in my beginning jazz book. There's a chord progression that sounds, appropriately, pretty jazzy, and a couple times I managed to actually play the chords closely together, causing me to sound as though I could play the piano. It was the piano equivalent of hitting a great golf shot, in that it likely has the same effect of motivating me to continue participating in the game/hobby, even though I'm obviously not any good yet...  --------------------------------  It's a long post because I told myself I would write something today.  --------------------------------   My goal of a week without drinking any soda is complete. It was pretty easy, really, and I felt great. I'm not sure if I'm going to continue the habit (or lack thereof), but it was good for a week. Perhaps my next goal ought to be a post a day on this old blog? Maybe that would give an incentive to me to end this post sooner, since I won't worry that this is the last one until July or August. Okay, okay, stop twisting my arm, I'll post tomorrow, too! What--you were twisting my arm so that I'd stop the post? Oh, got it. My mistake. I'll get right on it.
