That created a "fix one thing, break two more" loop that lasted for quite a while.  But finally it seems to be fixed, I managed to keep everything and I got a template that I more or less like.    I wanted one that had the sidebar stuff on the left with the journal entries on the right but it looked messed up in IE every time, no matter what I did.  It always looked OK in Netscape though.  But I'm all about consistency across platforms, so I had to scrap that idea.  It looks OK -- for now.  I've also enabled comments, so feel free.
