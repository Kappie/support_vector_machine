I was on-call this week and am working the Memorial Day Monday as I write this.  The Mavs are a dismal 0-1 four weeks into the season.  Three rainouts and a bye week have been very depressing.  On a good note, I watched the Big 12 baseball final (Texas v. Baylor) on TV Sunday and I am stoked to start playing.  College baseball on TV just gets the baseball vibes going.  I think it is the "ping!" and the not so professional look of the games.  My brothers graduated from St. Albert this week.  Matt and Colin both won awards during the ceremony.  Congrats to them.  With the winning of another Viking award, it is possible the Dempsey's may lead the country in Viking awards.  Someone look that up.  Yesterday was Miss Kelly's 17th birthday.  Happy birthday Kelly!  We received our keys to the new apartment and the rooms have been divvied up and my room has Wayne's coating.  White Wayne's Coating to be exact.  It looks like a room straight out of The Sims.  We will be moving our stuff over the next week.  Ann will be in town in less than a month.  She will be visiting for the big  urlLink Kinne-Skyllingstad wedding .  It should be fun.
