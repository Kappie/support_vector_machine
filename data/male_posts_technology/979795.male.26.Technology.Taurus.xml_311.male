Apparently some people have their suspicions of who the culprit really was. There wasn't anything said outright but a lot of indirect talknig behind the back has been going on for awhile. RSM explained the seriousness of the situation and the procedures of how he would handle the matter.  One particular guy had a lot to argue back. I think he feels really indignant about the whole deal. He feels very strongly that he is annocent and that he should be allowed to go for his evening class. Of course lah, I think a confinement is a small issue which we can / should handle ourselves within our unit. No point making the whole mess blow up to even the SAF Counselling hotline or watever. Sigh, NSF these days are having so good life in camp that a little bit of regimental punishment makes them feel like a huge injustice has been brought to bear upon them. I have no idea whether he is innocent/guilty because of his response. But what surprised me was another storeman standing out to take responsibility for the offence. He gave ambiguous facts about his motive and events which led to him playing such a prank. But I don't think he was the real culprit. I think he was just saving everyone the trouble of a confinement and having the matter closed. A brave lad if I do say so myself. But RSM has no choice but to take into consideration about what he had said. Tonight he has released everyone and he will come to a decision tomorrow instead about hsi next course of action.  After we were dismissed for a few minutes before we reconvened, I did a bit of explaining to this storeman. If the real culprit gets caught and it turns out that he had lied about being the real culprit, he might be charged for lying in the SAF. (This can happen if RSM finds that he doesn't like being lied to, or if the RSM decides to make an example of him to show that anyone who tries to 'help' others by taking the rap for an offence, that this may be one of the outcome.) Especially pointless since this guy has plans to further his studies after his NS. It would be bad if he gets some kind of blemish on his record over this matter, especially when he's not the culprit.  After our 2nd meeting, he asked to speak to RSM privately. I have no idea what it's all about or what's the outcome of the matter. But I think there'll be some decision tomorrow morning.
