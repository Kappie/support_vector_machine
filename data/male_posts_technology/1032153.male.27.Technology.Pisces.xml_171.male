Anyhow we had one to celebrate my 24th birthday. The food was great, and the company was great. The company was better than the food, which in no way should detract from the merit of the food, which was sublime. We played a bit of Mafia. Andrew introduced us to the suicide bomber, and we also intorduced a bomb disposal expert. The suicide bomber (any of the Mafia can be this, but only once per game) can at any time (day or night) let off. In so doing he kills the persons on his right and left... and of course himself (that being where the suicide comes in. However if a bomb disposal expert is sitting next to him the bomb is defused, and no one dies. It sure did add to the excitement.   After Mafia, we chatted about politics and Christians and stuff like that. It was pretty interesting. It was nice to be able to talk at a deeper level with people. Not just to talk about things that don't really matter. But to start to scratch the surface and see the challenges of living in a world which is against us.   I do fear for this country.
