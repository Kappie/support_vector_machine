So, wanting a Dell, he tears out the insides, hacksawing away, (his comment: "I have never seen a more finely made case") then installs a microATX board with an athlon 2200+.  then he puts in a green neon light.  I have absolutely no idea what on earth this person was thinking. He's hiding what he did from his parents, because he thinks they might be mad. Yeah.   Yeah.
