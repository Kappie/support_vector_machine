So I wrote to them today - I'd had enough. And I thought I'd post it here for the fun of it.   It's worth noting for the record that these are my personal opinions based on my own experiences and all that jazz.  2 June 2004  Dear Sir  Reference 6040  Termination of Contract –  Tel No. xxxxx xxxxxx  Further to my lengthy telephone conversation with your Customer Disinterest Desk yesterday evening – a call which I fervently hope will be my last.  As discussed, please accept this letter as confirmation of my wish to terminate my contract with Vodafone, with one month’s notice prior to the anniversary of my contract.  In the eleven months I have been with Vodafone, I have passed through bemusement, disappointment, disbelief and rage at the abysmal degree of so-called ‘service’ I have received, and am finally at the point where I am left doubting my own sanity.  In all the time I have been with you, not once – not once – have I been charged correctly for the service I have used. I have had to call innumerable times in desperate and increasingly vain efforts to get somebody to resolve my issues. Average call times have been 40 minutes, normally including drawn-out verbal exchanges with script-wielding, broken-record morons who simply cannot comprehend the meaning of the phrase ‘customer service’, much less actually implement it.  I am finally left with the unshakeable belief that there is not a single member of staff at Vodafone competent to run a whelk stall, much less administer a mobile phone company.  The final straw for me came this month, when I received my May invoice. Leaving aside the fact that the bill was ten days late – I should, by rights, receive my invoice 14 days prior to the direct debit leaving my account, but as usual was left with just 3 days – I was stunned to note that Vodafone were STILL charging me £15.31 for a text message bundle that I had specifically, REPEATEDLY requested be removed from my package, for the simple fact that I was no longer using the phone.  I rang Customer Disservice, and (as often happens) first spent ten minutes holding for an operator, being assured my call was indeed important – only to be thrown out of the queue and cut off for no apparent reason.  My second attempt was more successful, in that I actually spoke to a member of the human race, one Mxxxx Vxxxxxx. He single-handedly managed to prove every one of the opinions I have built up over the last eleven months, in that he was disinterested, monosyllabic and unable to deviate from his prescribed script in any way, shape or form. I can only suppose that CPW either hire staff with minimal EEG function, or that lobotomies are mandatory as part of the employment contract. I ended up having to hang up on him and call back – again.  Call three led me – after a lengthy debate over whether there were any managers in the office at 6pm – to one Cxxxxxx Txxxx. Speaking to someone vaguely more senior than the protozoa infesting your call centres is, in itself, a feat on a par with the scaling of Everest. I have come to believe, in fact, that your ‘managers’ are purely mythical creatures, akin to Bigfoot, The Yeti or an honest Labour MP. This is  based on the number of completely fictitious callbacks I am supposed to have had in the last eleven months.  I was impressed with Ms Txxxx initially because it only took her some 15 minutes to comprehend that she had an unhappy customer in her headset. This is an improvement of approximately 100% on every other call centre ‘employee’ I have encountered. It then only took a further 25 minutes of debate and hold time for her to (finally) agree the following proposal;  1.	I will pay the purely fictitious invoice for £33.48 that is masquerading as my bill for May 2004. 2.	This will leave Vodafone in debt to me to the tune of £15.31. This will be applied as a credit on my June invoice, against my line rental – effectively ensuring a £Zero bill. 3.	The June invoice is my FINAL invoice. Therefore, service to 07xxx xxxxxx will be terminated in accordance with this letter.  So yet again, in order to get back money Vodafone/CPW have taken without my agreement or consent, I have had to spend MY time and money on calls, and fight my way through staff who seem to have lost most of their higher brain function.  This is not the first occasion I have had to jump through hoops to get action from CPW. I enclose a copy of my letter from earlier this year, when the only recourse left to me was actually to email the office of Charles Dunstone in order to get a resolution after some seven weeks of abject incompetence.  This is unacceptable.  Therefore, I am left absolutely certain that you will fail to acknowledge or receive this letter, despite the numerous methods I have used to send it. I am certain that I will receive a July invoice from yourselves, and that my complaints will be met with a broken record along the lines of ‘you’ve rolled your Contract over now, you have to keep it till July 2005’.  In order to avoid this, I would like somebody competent (unlikely though it is that one will be available) at Carphone Warehouse to take responsibility for terminating my contract and confirming  that this has been carried out. This confirmation is to be in writing within seven days of receipt of this letter.  As discussed with Cxxxxxx last night, I enclose an invoice for my time at my professional rate, plus an additional consideration for the cost of spending 40 minutes on the phone with your ‘staff’. This invoice is also to be settled within seven days of receipt of this letter. If CPW wish to waste my time, they can reimburse me for it.   Please note that I have not submitted an invoice for the years of professional counseling that will no doubt result from the trauma of repeatedly trying to get your call centre staff to understand the most basic concepts. This has been an experience roughly akin to endlessly smashing my head into a brick wall, but infinitely less pleasurable. I remain utterly amazed that they manage to talk and breathe at the same time.  By now, I am sure that you’ve stopped reading – after all, what’s one unhappy customer, you’ve thousands more to torment – but I live in hope that someone in Mr Dunstone’s office will read and understand the depths which CPW’s service has plumbed – and sack every single one of you. You could all be replaced with talking sock puppets and I think your customers would notice a radical improvement.  I am now with a competent provider, and am reveling in the pleasure of dealing with people who listen, understand and actually do as they promise. After 11 months with a company that appears to be staffed by heavily sedated chimpanzees, you can be assured it is a breath of fresh air.  I can only hope that, for the sake of all CPW customers, some freak electrical storm knocks out the phones – and, ideally, the vast majority of your Customer ‘Couldn’t Care Less’ and ‘Accounts’ staff at your call centres. Believe me, it would be merciful in the long run.  Yours faithfully     Ah, I feel better for putting that out.   If the company deign to respond (come on, what are the odds) then I'll post their responses here too.
