Though not to make the whole trip completely easy, our travel agent did manage to stuff up by not telling our hotel we were arriving a day late - the result, our room was sold and we were left standing in the foyer wondering where we were going to stay. However, Flightcentre did pull through rather magnificently and got us a very nice room at a better hotel :)  Kai's already gone through the details so I'll just list some my highlights:  - first night fantastic meal around the corner - we didn't speak a word of French and the waiter knew zero English, but we managed to have a fantastic meal.  - the beautiful walk from the Arch de Triumph  - having coffee at the amazing cafe on top of the Pompidu Centre and the amazing views of Paris  - dinner at le Train Bleu - in particular the Crepes Suzzette  - the chocolate shop on the island next to Notre Dame  - wandering the back-streets of Paris  - the vanilla slice I had on the last day  And the Next Trip? well... it is Zurich - again - but this time I'm going with Kai :)
