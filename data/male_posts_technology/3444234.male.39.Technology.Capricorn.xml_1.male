I remember my friend Mario showing me Mosiac in the early 90's at work (I've worked at IBM since 1986)and wondering if this World Wide Web thing would take off. We'd been using email and instant messaging on the mainframe through the 80's but the world at large hadn't experienced it yet. And now it's come to this. I could never have predicted blogging technology back then.  Well I got married at easter, see  urlLink Jo and Alan's Wedding  for some pictures. It worked out really well, I had proposed to Jo back in January. We met at  urlLink Strathvea  in 1996; a group of us have been going there for Easter every year since the early 90's. We thought it would be right to get married there, but of course many friends and family wouldn't be there, so we're holding the reception in July to celebrate with all those people. Best of both worlds really. The wedding was great, couldn't have been a more perfect day for us really - and we did catch everyone by surprise, which was the main aim!
