The weather is supposed to be hot and humid now, with temperature reaching around 45 degree celcius (We don't care about Fahrenheit in this part of the world). People here call this period as   Agninakshatram   - meaning Fire start. During this period, the temperature will reach its peak. Last year the maximum was 45. This year, it's supposed to cross that.  But this rain came as a surprise. Outside it's cool. It's good time to sleep.
