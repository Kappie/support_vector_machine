There was a whole group of blind kids trying to get into my building and of all choices... they decide to come in, of all things,  through the revolving door!  They were getting stuck! They were trying to go in two at a time... one of the helpers had to yell at one of them to get out of the door because he was on the other side! LOL. Nothing brightens my day up more than, yup, you guessed it...  makin' fun o' blind kids ! I will meet the rest of you who also like to make fun of the blind... in hell. hehehehe
