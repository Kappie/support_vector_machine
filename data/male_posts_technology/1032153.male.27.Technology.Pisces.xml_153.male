After that I am looking at a house around 1. At 2:30, I'm helping out at the cafe fundraiser, which runs until 5:30 I believe. After that will be tidy up and set up for youth group. Youth group will start at 7, and will run until about 10. Sigh. I'm going to take a weekend away very soon. Just for me and God. I want to spend a whole weekend by myself, with my Bible, and silence to contemplate. I don't know if 'want' is the right word. 'Need' is probably more appropriate.
