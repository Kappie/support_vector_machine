 A turkey sandwich for lunch.  I already almost forgot to take my vitamins. 

 I ate the whole sandwich at once, which I wan't going to do today, but I guess I was hungry, or old habbits die hard. 

 I had a little bit of a hard time lying down to bed last night, but I was so tired after reading my book that I fell asleep with the light on.  I slept solidly and didn't wake up to turn off the light until probably 8:00 am!
