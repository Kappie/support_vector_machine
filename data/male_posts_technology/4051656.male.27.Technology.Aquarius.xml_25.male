Sprint Corp. will launch a television service for its wireless phones Tuesday that gives users a higher-quality picture than previous efforts.  The service, available on a new Sprint PCS Vision phone, will stream video at 15 frames a second. Sprint's existing television service, MobiTV, streams at a choppy 1 or 2 frames a second.   Now when that idiot in front of you in traffic goes to call his wife on the cell phone mid-lanechange, he can get distracted by the latest  Seinfeld  episode.
