Tomorrow: going to my friend, Trent's wedding. That's crazy. I don't really like weddings all that much, too long and too boring. This one has been a long time coming, and I'm happy for him. I've gotta find something to wear tomorrow to wear to it. Pants, Shirt, Shoes, Socks (!). whole outfit. gunna suck.  urlLink Stein Mart  has saved me before, and it will save me again.  All righty. It's bed time.  night!
