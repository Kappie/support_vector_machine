Ok ok so she came into my room to check my PC but she stayed there to talk to me instead so thats something rite !  But my room was a total mess , I had like used cotton buds and 3 glasses on my computer table so a bit paiseh but I think my charisma kinda overshadowed all that. Anyway she will be coming tommorow and I am gonna tell her I am not interested cos I am pretty happy with my cable modem. Hmm but feel so guilty leh .....Haha if it was a guy I probably would have told him to get lost at the door...I am such a buaya.
