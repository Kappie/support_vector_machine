Is what you say, think, and do in your every day life pleasing to God? That is one thing that should ring true in our minds and hearts each and every day. We should be living a life that is pleasing to God. Think about it like this: If you were walking around at school/work and Jesus was next to you, would He be pleased with you? If you would do things differently when He's there, I want to remind you of something: He is always there. If you are a Christian, He is with you always. And the only way to learn what is pleasing to God is getting to know Him and spending time with Him daily. I would challenge you to get into the word every day so that you can know what is pleasing to the Lord and will be able to start living it out. Don't put it off any longer, start today.  God Really Touched my heart with that bible study and thought that whoever is reading this might benefit from it.
