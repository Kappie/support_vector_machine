Suddenly, from upstairs his newly wed wife starting yelling downstairs aboutwhat's going on some stupid reality show. She shouts for about 2 minutes, the whole time Harvester is busy dicking around with his stereo receiver. Now, I was listening to what she was saying, and if he wanted to even partially pretend that he was listening to what she was saying, he would have responded with a "wow" or "that's gross" but what does H.O.S. respond with?   "OK"   Just made me giggle. Married for a month and already with the dismissive responses. I think they put some kind of depressant in wedding cake.
