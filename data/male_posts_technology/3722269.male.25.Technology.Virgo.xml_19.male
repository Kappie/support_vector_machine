I can imagine the blinding effects of that speed already :D woohoo!  John and Barb have been good to me, John as a mechanic has always dropped everything to help us with niggly little problems, I guess this is my way of giving something back... or Paying it forward, depending on how you look at it. If you havent seen the movie 'Pay it Forward' - you should, it's really worthwhile. I walked to town to do todays banking, and walked home, such a gorgeous day in Rotorua - sun shining and barely a cloud in the sky - the wind with just a hint of crisp winterness doing its best to make my badly-in-need-of-a-haircut mop just look worse :D I feel great. Today has been an awesome day. Ka kite ano.
