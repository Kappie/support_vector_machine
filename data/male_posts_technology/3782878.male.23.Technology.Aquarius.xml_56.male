The day following the raids on dulak, I met up with Kretais and Konath, they were going to go to Dulak again. I agreed as I knew the place well by now, but they said they had some shopping to attend to and meet back up with them later tonight. I made my way to south ro, for I had heard that there was an ancient cyclops that sometimes roams through that area, and that he has a ring that I could use.  When I made it out to South Ro, there was already a necromancer outside slaying younger undead. He asked me if I saw any Giants to let him know I told him sure, and he asked whether or not I was looking for anything in paticular, I told him I was looking for the ancient cyclops, and he said he was as well. I told him that since he was here longer he will get the prize. He wished me luck in attaining the cyclops as well, and I did the same, but by then Kretais had finished his shopping and decided that we should do a Dungeon adventure.   I met them at the Butcherblock Wayfarers camp. And learned we had a couple more on the way. We picked up a shadowknight whom I have forgotten the name, Rmdir, the 2nd Iksar I've ever really trusted, with an interesting style about him. And Jkaisi, a Vah Shir Beastlord.   We made our preparations, I blessed my weapon with the power of rodcet nife, and we went into the Mistmoore Dungeons looking for Gargoyle Claws. About halfway through the fighting the casters were low on mana, and so Konath tried plying his mana-sticks, a trick I've seen Konath do a couple of times. Rmdir was shocked that a warrior would be carrying sticks of mana in his pack, and began to question what they were made of. Never being one to let a trick fall short, as brell does like jokes from time to time, I told him they were made of crushed up manastones. Rmdir's eyes got even wider, and Konath then nearly struck me dead with his next sentence "two words... litter box" I laughed so heartily that I think Brell could hear us.  We continued on and easily dispatched the dungeon, getting all of our items that we needed. We began our hunt for the leader of the dungeon, but then it was our time to leave the dungeon before it locked us in, and we did not find the leader of the dungeon's minions.  When we returned to camp, 43 platinum was ours to be had from the gear the undead possessed. Our group left, and I waved farewell to Rmdir hoping to rejoin him again someday. I joined up with Akcron, a Paladin named Jas, Jkaisi again, and a Druid I believe. we entered another dungeon of Mistmoores, aimed at slaughtering 53 of the fiendish undead. Jas was in charge of baiting them to us, while I was the one who would pull the enemies off of her, and onto myself to swing at.   We completed that dungeon quickly and nearly destroyed the entirety of the dungeon dwellers, but once again, it became time to leave before the gates of the dungeon swung shut and locked us in for the evening.  After these battles I discovered that Kretais and Ellektra had placed themselves inside Karnor's Castle once again, and so I went to join them, Akcron thought we were hunting giants, but nay, we were to hunt more drolvarg's. Poor akcron has grown a phobia of Karnor's, and said that if she so much as faints that she will leave. I promised her that she would not fall not even once. and this promise was sealed with another cleric giving our group Temperence. I thanked that cleric, and we set off to kill many things.   Eventually a necromancer arrived in the entrance of Karnor's and began killing himself a path to the middle of the front battlements. I shrugged and hoped that he would not make it harder for me to find quarry. Suddenly a Drolvarg Guardian made his way to post in front of the entrance bridge. I ran forward to attack, and in the distance, I saw the skeleton of that necromancer bearing his way towards us. I had engaged the enemy, and he stole our quarry! I was irate, if I were a berserker I would have been in a rage by then. but being a paladin has taught me how to soothe myself. I told the necromancer not to steal our Quarry from us and he said he apologized for he had set his skeleton against it at the same time we assualted it, and he apparently has no control over this beast, else he could have easily told it to come back to him.  After that incident, Akcron and I decided to make way to the plane of knowledge to make camp. Kretais helped us get out, before returning to the new additions to his group, a warrior named Axes, and a bard whose name escapes me. It was a long night, but very productive.   If ever shall we meet may it be as brothers, and not as enemies. Ziggur Rathebringer
