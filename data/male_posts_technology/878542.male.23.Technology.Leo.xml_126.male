Since I posted the original list, I've done some more searching and found more data plus some examples of the alternatives quoted from the  book.  As you mentioned, some individuals are lactose intolerant, just as some are allergic to peanuts, some are allergic to tomatoes and apparently some people are allergic to soy. But this list is not one of those strict diets that must be followed like a religion. You will get the benefits of eating these foods even if you manage to squeeze some rubbish in as well.  ;)   · Beans – Also try: green beans, sugar snap peas, green peas, chickpeas What they've got: low-fat protein, fiber, B vitamins, iron, folate, potassium, magnesium  · Blueberries – Also try: cranberries, raspberries, strawberries, cherries, currants, purple grapes What they've got: fiber, folate, vitamins C and E, potassium, magnesium, iron, riboflavin, niacin, phytoestrogen, few calories.  · Broccoli – Also try: Brussels sprouts, cabbage (red and green), cauliflower, bok choy, kale What it's got: folate, fiber, calcium, vitamins C and K, beta-carotene  · Oats – Also try: wheat germ, brown rice, barley, wheat, buckwheat, rye, millet, quinoa What they've got: high fiber, few calories, protein, magnesium, potassium, zinc, copper, selenium, thiamine  · Oranges – Also try: lemons, grapefruit, kumquats, tangerines, limes What they've got: vitamin C, fiber, folate, potassium, pectin  · Pumpkin – Also try: carrots, butternut squash, sweet potatoes, orange bell peppers What it's got: alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, high fiber, few calories, vitamins C and E, potassium, magnesium  · Wild Salmon - Also try: Alaskan halibut, canned albacore tuna, sardine, herring, trout, sea bass, clams What it's got: omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins B and D, selenium, potassium, protein  · Soy – Also try: tofu, soymilk, soy nuts, edamame, miso What it's got: omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, potassium, folate, magnesium, selenium  · Spinach – Also try: other dark leafy greens, kale, collards, Swiss chard, bok choy, romaine lettuce, mustard and turnip greens or orange bell peppers. What it's got: beta-carotene, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins C and E, thiamine, iron, calcium, magnesium, zinc  · Tea – Green or black: What it's got: flavonoids, fluoride, no calories  · Tomatoes – Lycopene, the red pigment in tomatoes, is also found in pink grapefruit, watermelon, persimmons and some types of papaya.

But simply eating right won't guarantee good health and longevity, he says. You have to exercise, too. According to the book's "lifestyle pyramid," the linchpin of good health includes 30 to 60 minutes a day of aerobic exercise and weight training two to three times a week.   BillK
