On one hand I had a nice break, spent some really good time with Orla, had two great parties (The poker night was particularly good) and got time to catch up with some of the movies.  On the flip side it was actually a bit of a lonely season this year.. I realised at the end of the holidays that over the whole 2-3 weeks I hadn't managed to see any of my close friends that I don't actually live with\live with their boy-friends. Strange eh..  Oh well, maybe the new year will be better for me.. I'm going to be insanely busy for the next 2 months so that has to be a vaguely good thing really, doesn't it?
