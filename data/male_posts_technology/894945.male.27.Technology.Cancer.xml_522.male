Well, been to a fair few comedy shows.. including a large party booking to Jasper Carrot and Phil Cool. Phil Cool was great but Jasper seems to be churning out the same old material. I have been watching re-runs of his shows on Bravo and he used some of the same gags at the Opera House. Has he not written any new material in the last ten years? Anyway it was still a good night.. I also really enjoyed Postiv+'s comedy night at the Royal Hotel, which was actually funnier than Carrot and Cool.   If you're bored, go and Google for "weapons of mass destruction" and then hit "I'm feeling lucky" insead of the normal search submit button.
