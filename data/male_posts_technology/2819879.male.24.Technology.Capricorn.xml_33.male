He excels in many things that echos his name, for example, play street fighter as Ken and study at Chem.  This picture is taken last winter in Osaka ... something train.  When we went there together.  He is going to be a successful pharmacist.  Going to tackle the big exam in a couple days.  Wish him all the BEST!!  BY THE WAY, He thinks that his eye looks like Jay Chou (the Pop-Music King) in this picture.
