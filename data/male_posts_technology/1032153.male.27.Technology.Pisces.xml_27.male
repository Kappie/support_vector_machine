Was good to catch up and encourage each other about respective ministries. I happened to mention how often all I ever get is criticism of the way thing are done in my particular ministry, and nobody ever  comes to encourage. Pete said that it's the nature of leadership to get mainly criticism, and that we just need to get used to it. He told me a story where a young guy once asked an elder "Am I doing it ok?", and the elder said "We'll let you know when you aren't". It's kind of a funny story, but a sad attitude behind it. The only time you hear from people is when things aren't ok. Well from our conversation, I'm going to try to be more encouraging to people in leadership, because I know how much it can mean to get some positive feedback.  Encouragement  is so important, but so often ignored.

I will let you know when I have some firm results. This could take some months.    Desire to Flee  Lately I have had the desire to flee all obligations, and responsibilities, and go hiking for months on end in the wilderness. I'm sick of things. I want to get away from all the busyness of the city, with the pulls of materialism and worldliness, I am wearied by the constant struggle of day to day life in a heathen country, I want to escape, but I know I must stay and fight and uphold God's standard in my own spheres so people may see Christ. Isolationism is not the answer, although sometimes it is all too tempting.   Procrastination Revisited ...... Finally..... Seriously.  I'm still a procrastinator, and I still don't like it. Example: I've been meaning to clear my desk this afternoon, but I have found many other important things to do. Ask me what those important things are and I can't tell you. A lot of nothing it seems. I don't want to be one, so I'll keep trying to not be one. In fact I'm going to clear my desk now. Later.
