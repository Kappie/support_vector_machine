The feel good factor has generated such a lot of discussion even before the elections are underway. The growth of a country is to be applauded but the politicisation of the growth is an area that has to be avoided.  One party says it is instrumental for the country to achieve great heights. But did the party do it on its own. No, it just ramped up the prevailing growth. For that cause it is to be congratulated. The other party says that the government is a failure and that they would have brought greater laurels to the country.   I feel that the development of a nation should not be handed over to a bunch of political parties who change idealogies and partners faster than a formula 1 driver changes gears. Instead, the plans foir the nation's growth have to be decided upon and the government must be able to execute that plan, regardless of thier party manifesto. Such a  growth is a true growth of a nation.  So what do you think? Should the plans for the growth of the nation (say our five year plans) be constant with each government working towards achieving it or should each government bring out thier own five year plans?  P.S. This was to be posted yesterday morning. Due to some problems with Blogger. It is being posted aday late.  Manny, congrats. I'll call you tonight without fail.
