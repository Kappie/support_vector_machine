I recognize myself and think of who I want to be and who I want to help. I am re-arranging myself to be financially more stable.   All this thinking is fun, but I think I should start reading again. I've started walking home from my boss' house everynight, so that is good exercise. (30+ blocks or so)  I want to get in better shape, but I think I need to find someone to inspire me to get out a little more often, and maybe take up jogging with me. We'll see.  Anyway, I'm sleepy, catch you later- T
