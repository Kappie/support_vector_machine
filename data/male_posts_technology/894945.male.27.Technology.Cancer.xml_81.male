Unfortunately, i don't have any of it on this PC. But i will put it up saturday when i get to my PC. Why am i not at my pc i hear you ask? I have decided to be another adam. I am sitting here at in internet cafe in amsterdam. Music in the air, sliff in one hand drink in the other, and a pc infront of me, and tons of stunning girls walking around!
