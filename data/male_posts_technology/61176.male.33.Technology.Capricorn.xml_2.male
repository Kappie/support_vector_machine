I wanted to put an end to Al Gore's political career more importantly.  I've been to the produce section of the grocery store, I've seen a few banannas in my time.  Now I have always considered myself a very libral republican or a right-wing democrat, your choice really.  I tend to vote for the best candidate for the job, if I can't determine who that is I vote republican.  I figure things can't get much worse if the republican get's the job.  So that brings us to this election.  Going into this shebang, I will say I didn't think much of the democratic sendups.  Seems the only platform they were running on was, "We're not Bush."  of the runner-ups I thought the one guy who possibly could have swayed my vote from voting for GWB again was Wes Clark.  Possibly Howard Dean, but we all know he fell off the wagon.  I have no idea how John Kerry floated to the top, when he was treading water with the likes of Al Sharpton.  So now here we have a guy who changes his position on the issues more often than he changes his underwear.  Let's hope that he does that at least once a day.  In this day and age we need a president that is strong. We need a president that has the balls to do what needs to be done. We need a president that can lead.  John Kerry is not the guy.  Hell if they put Ronald Reagans name on the ballot I'd gladly vote for him, eventhough he's dead!!!  But, alas, I will vote for Bush again, because, well "He's not Kerry."  I just wish there was a viable third party candidate, where's Ross Perot when you need him?
