 So yeah, all you need to do is design to the "proprietary" Flash Player that Macromedia controls. Rich user interface without all the problems of DHTML, sounds very tempting.  urlLink Web standards advocates  would say you should design to a standard that all browsers support and promoted by a standards body such as the W3C. Could the Flash Player become the Microsoft of client side technologies? Should developers just forget standards, and develop to the "de facto standard", all controlled by one company?
