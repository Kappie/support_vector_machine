I have absolutely no drama and you know what, I have no idea who anyone is down here other than people I work with.  Right now I am staying in a hotel and I will sure be writing so much more then before now that I can get on the internet.  I hope everyone is doing better then I am.  I had my car broken into today.. Nothing was taken but my back windshield was broken.  Now, I am going to have to pay for that with the little money I have right now.   That is alright though, I can make it through this.  I drove down here to get away from it no matter what....  so guess what, I am doing it... I am doing it yea me yea me....   Work isn't too bad down here... there is this guy that thinks he knows everything and is going to try to tell me how to do my job and I and getting a little tee'd right now.  Eventually I know I am going to get pissed off at him but for right now, I am just getting a little teed off...  so tell me about everything that is going on with you gues.  I am doing alright.  I hope everything is going alright for you all..  take care:)
