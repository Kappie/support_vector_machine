Back then, it seems my devotion to most anything that involved a referee was quite bottomless, but now, I don't even care enough to watch the Super Bowl. Also, I don't know what the record of my so-called favorite NFL team, the N.Y. Jets, was this year. I'm a sorry excuse for a thirteen year old, that's for sure. Sure, I'm nearly twice that old now, but gosh, I should still have the fire, shouldn't I?
