And Max: your like online all the bloody time so just fucking blog. Am I in a good mood? NO I AM FUCKING WELL NOT. Its fucking freezing and I have been at school until 5 mins ago waiting for Paul who is STILL in drama and yes fine reherse but i have been there since fucking 3.35!!!!!! And now I am incredibly pissed off because I spent the last like half hour waiting as on actually waiting. Doing NOTHING. I had no homework left to do or anything and its just like ahhh. Why I am always waiting for other people?? This isn't directed at anyone, I just don't get why I am the one always waiting for people, waiting for everyone else Ack. And I haven't seen Paul today hardly. Lunch he was doing some prefect thing and then now hes still in drama so argh. So I am not impressed and I just want to see him but apparently not. So wopee. So tomorrow I think I may just sleep all of fucking lunch. Sorry for my language but I'm pissed off at many many things.  Have a good evening.
