BUT, it WOULD have be a good temporary job. We all have to start somewhere, right? Could possibly get another job withint two months and be sorted. So, now I´m in the royal bootcamp of campness and boringness with all the lads (aka. neds) who think shooting with guns are a GOOD thing and that the king is ALSO a GOOD thing. Right.  Perhaps I´m overreacting. There´s quite a few chaps here that are nice and decenet and cool. However, this place has in fact stripped me of freedom, although they try to help you. Still, I don´t like it. Have got verbal confirmation that I will be transferred, but don´t know when. Probably still have to roll around in mud. Martin, if you ever read this, I know you´re laughing.  Hope everyone else is good. I´m not. Miss my girlfriend terribly terribly much. Norway has got nothing more for me except my best friends and immediate family. And nice and health food. And bootiful scenery. And perhaps good houses. And IBM is here. But, N.S. sucks.  bye from the soldier. Don´t mind the selling mistakes, I´m writing on an apple machine with a super crap key board. Noone´s heard about proper setup of computer equipment to avoid damage to your wrists and back.
