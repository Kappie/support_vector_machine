What a shock to listen to all that.  You've heard plenty about Nazi camps, but you don't hear too much about the Russian GULAG that  predates  the German camps, that well exceeded the casualties of the German camps, and obviously, that was better hidden from the world.  Even Solzhenitzen's works didn't do the trick, and if you see a special on the History channel about concentration camps, their almost always going to be German.  Part of that, I think, is that when the Allied forces broke the German regime during WWII, the cameras were right behind them.  Cameras have never been able to capture that much detail from the GULAG.  I'm not a historian, and so my perspective may be skewed in one direction or another, but there's something to be said for this less-noticed-but-more-atrocious part of world history.  It takes conscious effort to continually remember that the work camps are a part of our not-so-distant past, and that there is plenty of room for depravity in the world.  It's scary to remember that the participants were normal people, caught up in a system that tyrants created.  There is no guarantee that this type of thing couldn't happen again.  According to Professor Solovyova, this is the type of prison that exists now primarily in Russia, partly because of the expense required to maintain a regular prison.  It's crazy to think that there are still people freezing in the mines of Kolyma, reportedly the worst of all the work camps, where Shalamov spent his internment, and based on which he wrote his  Kolyma Stories .  I'm new to all this, but there's so much to think about, and so much to learn for how to avoid these types of atrocities in the future.
