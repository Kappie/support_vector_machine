Instead, it only saves the last compiled binary to its output folder. However, the old version (in the  GAC ) keeps being referenced by the  design-time  package as well as any project loaded.      This bug is not easily workarounded. For instance, by simply closing and reopening the  IDE  does not work! In order to force the  IDE  to use the latest compiled version, one has to update it in the  GAC  (even from within the  IDE ). For convenience, I have created a  DOS batch  file that does this (using  Microsoft 's   urlLink GacUtil   tool):      Removes the old version from the  GAC .    Puts it again into the  GAC .    Lists all contents in the  GAC  to ensure it's indeed placed in there.     Here is the batch file:      gacutil.exe /u atsSPI3000rp80 > x.txt    gacutil.exe /i atsSPI3000rp80.dll >> x.txt    gacutil.exe -lr > x.out    find "atsSPI" x.out >> x.txt           For even more convenience, I have added this  DOS batch  to the  IDE 's   Tool   menu, so all I've got to do after every package recompile is fire the batch from the menu. After that, I can recompile all dependant projects (  urlLink hosts   and   urlLink plugins  ).    I think  Delphi  should do that automatically every time a runtime package gets recompiled (if it's already in the  GAC ).
