Steven and Evelyn is the couple. We reach the bride's place with horning and exhaust sound that awaken almost the entire neighbourhood. Brothers gathered and up we go. Money was not really an issue when asking for keys to enter the bride's place but the second round all the brothers had to do push up and YES I have to do as well oh DAMN IT hahaha! It has been at least 3 or 4 years since i last do a push up during basketball training.   All of us had to go down and do ten oh boy with my weight it is really very tedious for me but finally still able to do it and worst of all, it has been make into the wedding video clip but it was fun. Due to my size, the final stage have to bang the way into the bride's room. The groom had to say something that really touch the bride's heart and It goes like I promise you I will love you, cannot bully you, must care for you, understand you. When you are sad, I will make you happy. When you are down, I will be there always to share with you. When you get bully, I will help you. When you not feeling well, I will take care of you. And end with I love you!   So proceed to groom's place to let the groom's parent to see the newly wed wife and off to their house of the newly wed couple for tea serving ceremony. Follow shortly by church wedding which was even more touching. BUT really a lot of things to read and got to raise and sit again and again. Then was the eating session at the newly wedded couple place and I went to my buddy's house at punggol for a bath and KNOCKOUT for almost four hours. My v12 6.5 litre engine turn out to be a a V8 engine while sleeping (noise of engine reflect on my snore!)  It was the wedding dinner and I become the MC again for Steven and Evelyn. It was fantastic wedding dinner as well because we have fun time teasing the couple but playing games.   After so much, I can't help but to feel fortunate for the both of them. Today is the day, both of them no longer is two different person but as one. They have to consult each other when come to the possibility of affecting each other directly because they are one. Evelyn has a superb night gown which is sexy! But poor drinker Steven have a really tough time! Afterall it is over! A newly wedded couple. Can't help feeling happy for them as I see how both initially say impossible for each other turns out to be together. I have to say love can really change a person. For Evelyn case, she become so much more understanding and caring person, no longer the extravagant her. And of course Steven converted into a Christian just for the Love which I think is really not an easy task.   All the best to this couple! And now I got to get some rest before my lessons going to start early in the morning!
