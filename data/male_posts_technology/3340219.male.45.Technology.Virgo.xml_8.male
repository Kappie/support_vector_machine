Workplace is an integrated office suite aimed at corporations. Its supposed attraction is that it's server-based, freeing individual users from having to install large applications on their laptop or desktop computers. This has been tried before--replacing traditionally client-side applications with programs served up from a central location--mostly with uninspiring results. But from all reports, Workplace is a compelling product.  IBM has a few of things going for them here, which might make it interesting:   Many of Microsoft's corporate customers are feeling a bit cheated because they paid for upgrades that they aren't getting. With no significant upgrades to Office recently, and Longhorn out on a 2-year delivery target, they could decide that moving to Workplace is the better choice.  On the security front, one can imagine that Workplace won't fall prey (at least not in the immediate future) to the plethora of email worms and viruses that plague Office, Windows, and Outlook.  Server-based application deployment can extend the useful life of older machines by a couple of years, making it possible for companies to save money on hardware upgrades.  IBM is selling to businesses here--something they've proven they can do. If they were targeting individual users, I'd say "no way" without hesitation. There's no consumer product so good that IBM's indifferent marketing can't kill it.  So what do you think? Can Workplace supplant Office on a large number of desktops? If so, does that give IBM an "in" to start replacing Windows with Linux on the corporate desktop?
