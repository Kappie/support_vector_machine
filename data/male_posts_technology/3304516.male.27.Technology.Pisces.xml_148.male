It's right beside the rideau canal and within walking distance of my work. And the bonus is we've moved in just before Canada day (July 1st for all you non-Canadians) so we can just walk to the festivities and not worry about parking or how we're gonna get home after drinking too much. For those of you not lucky enough to be able to join us on the hill, you can still watch either on T.V. or via  urlLink the live hill-cam from parliament hill .
