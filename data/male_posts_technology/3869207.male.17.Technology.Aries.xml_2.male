About 15,000 bikers cross Iowa from west to east) passed through my hometown Eagle Grove.  I know the city council co-chairman pretty well, and him and myself greeted Ragbrai'ers as they rode into town.  The catch was that we were 20 feet up in the air, in a huge nest, dressed like bald eagles.  (you can stop laughing now)  So anyway, I got my picture taken today hundreds of times (no joke), and even once by a Desmoines Register photographer who came up into the nest to get a picture.  We had an air horn hooked up in the nest, so every once in a while we'd blow the horn to get peoples attention.  The whole shebang warranted responses from the bikers such as "WHAT THE F*%???"  "That away Hawkeyes!!"  "DUDE there's an eagle up in the tree,  KAAAKAAA KAAA KAAA" "Hahaha way to go!" "Work that thang, eagle boy!!"(I did the funky chicken for the bikers from time to time) .  Early in the morning (we started at like 6:00) there was one lady just moseying along, and we waited until she was even on the road with our tree before we sounded the air horn.  She replied with a nice and loud "GOD D$%%IT!!" which make us laugh.  Anyway, it was fun, and having my picture taken that many times might have been flattering had I not been wearing an enormous purple eagle costume...  So after that was over, I headed over to Clarion to work at the video store there because they were short of help.  I was running a little late, but I really wanted to some dinner before I went to work, so I stopped at hardee's.  It just so happened that I picked the same time to eat as a large family of Hispanics, who ordered over $40 in fast food (that's a freaking large amount of food), and took half an hour ordering it >:(   But, its all good, and I'm back home now.  That's all I got for today, so peace out till next time!
