I still can't believe it has been a year, and that he is no longer here.  Sometimes I think it was just yesterday and sometimes it feels like an eternity ago.     But on another note, today John Kerry and John Edwards come to town and I have tickets to go see them.  I am excited to see them and I hope to take pictures and be able to post them soon.  I may write more after I have had some time to digest the day.
