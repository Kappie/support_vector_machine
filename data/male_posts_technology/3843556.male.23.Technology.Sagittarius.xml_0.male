So now the little devil that is within wakes up. He wants a tatse of everything that would bring about pleasure.       We at Montfort were no angels. We were the typical teenage boys. Among the many things that shook our curiosity was the beauty of women(let me keep this as clean as possible). We boys at Montfort did not miss out on a single chance to experience this GOD given gift. Heyy, comon it wasn't us who said opportunities don't come knocking at your door. We jus follow what our forefathers have asked us to do. Yes, so do the events that follow(comon what do boys of the 12-17 know..)    It was a February afternoon in 1998. Considering the fact that I was in my 12th grade..hmmm.. we were all seated in class supposedly studying. The school is extremely generous when they give a whole 3 months to study...errr did I say  study??(studyin' is not among the top priorities for Montfortians). A good afternoon's lunch combined with a sultry afternoon is better than a Jill Kelly or Brianna Banks singing you a lullaby. Yes, it was a perfect afternoon until someone decided to break the party. An angry voice roared, "All those who have obscene books  magazines turn them in". It was frenchie as always tryin' to throw his weight around us. Not a hair moved. We had this blank loooks on our faces. Damnnn, we were good yo(lol)..I knew we should've auditioned for one of those award winning films..hmmm nevermind.    The whole school was in chaos and here we were acting like we didn't know a thing. A major scam was unearthed which I called the "Porno Scam". It all started with this ultimate nut-job in 7th grade complaining to his warden that his friend(Rohan) had a copy of "Fantasy" because of a small tiffle between them. From time immemorial, we have safely passed on those sacred books down to our successors. Now there was this traitor who had broken the circle of trust. Poor Rohan was put through ultimate pain but the porn boy...ooops i mean poor boy didn't part with the information that lead to our secret for decades. All good things come to an end and so he did succumb and told them the whole truth. He had got the books from his team mates(9th grade) during a basketball tournament. The investigation team began their rounds of raids and interrogations. The 8th  9th grade dorms were sealed and searched.   Now what I can't stop laughing at was the so called search team. The team involved a few a few male staff and Brothers(my school as run by Christian missionaries).. 6 of them on a whole. Credit needs to be given to the school for they had chosen the right people for the job for all 6 of them were the ultimate "accused" f*#%#@ It would be difficult to judge who would compete better with Peter North. The kids in 8th grade had beaten the 9th graders by a fairly large margin taking into account the number and variety of the sacred books they possessed. Sacred books would include playboy, debonair, fantasy,local  books, erotic story book...(there was always plenty to choose from). The guys in 10th got lucky as they weren't in school.
