The suns out, the birds are singing and away in the distance you can hear the faint sound of sneezing and wheezing of someone else discovering that they've got hayfever.  As for me, I'm dosed up higher than a hippie at an open air fair and it's just great.  No itchy eyes, no sneezes and no sore throat.  I'm in a temporary state of bliss which will hopefully last for the next thirty minutes before another attack.  I'm struggling a little on sleep, but at least the reason this time is becasue I was out late.  I managed to actually have five consecutive hours sleep, it was truly wonderful.  Where to start on the last couple of days.  Over the weekend, I managed to do a fair bit of riding, starting with going to didcot and back [10km each way] and then sunday was to oxford and back [about the same] so I'm getting use of the bike and getting out in the fresh pollen saturated air.  I love it in England that when the weather does finally become ogod, then EVERYONE comes out and is in a good mood.  Usually this just means moving from inside the bar to the beer garden outside but it still counts as movement of some description.  I also managed to have a swing at golf for the first time which was ace.  One of my friends, Ross, has a driving range just near his house in Drayton [south of oxford].  He asked if I was interested in a swing.  Now golf was never quite my style.  I associate it with old people, toffs and people who enjoy wearing plaid.  As it was though, it was great fun.  Hitting a little ball can be incredibly theraputic.  I wasn't quite prepared for the jarring though.  It's funny but if you hit the little 200gram ball incorrectly it's almost akin to taking a big metal bar and hitting a wall with it.  After hitting 90 balls my hands were shaking.  I needed a beer and a barbq.  Lo and behold, Ross was kind enough to host one that evening.  Fantastic.  I had my first beers for a full week.  Ever since Dany was here, I've been detoxing and felt surprisingly good about it.  But there's something about having long rides, a bit of golf and a barbq.  It's almost criminal NOT to have a beer.  So kudos to you Ross and Nia, the burgers were just fantastic.  I left their place at about 9:30 as riding for a couple of miles on a road with no lights in the dark is even less fun than it sounds.  I got home and got a phone call from Zsophie who is a nanny friend of Kristen's.  She asked if I wanted to come out clubbing.  What the hell, why not.    It's a saturday night.  I ain't got no job, ain't got no girl.  AND I AIN@T GOT SHIT TO DO!!  Sorry. That was "Friday" [quote from movie, maybe a bit poor]  So I went and met up with Zsophie and a couple of other random friends of hers that I didn't know.  We went to aplace in oxford called the Park End.  I'd heard bad things but I was not prepared for quite how bad it is.  I'm still not a fan of paying money just to get in the place.  They make enough cash just for drinks, but we paid our five pound entry, got the standard lecherous looks from the bouncers and wandered in.  The music was shite.  Come on.  I'm definately up for some cheese but chesney Hawk's "I am the one and only" is on the wrong line of fun cheese.  Still the 30+ year old crowd were loving it.  I could have hit the dj, he was speaking over at least 1/3 - 1/2 the songs.  It started with "Happy Birthday Bob" kind of stuff and descended into "Can we please have some more girls kissing each other on the dance floor  .. .. .. .. .. that's the stuff!" .  Yeah Nice. By this stage, I'm just grooving away and putting protective arms around some of the girls from the drunk knobjockeys who think they're one step away from John Travolta, that step being less hair and more girth.  It was at the point that the DJ asked the guys who were on the pull that night to please put their hands up.  I and the other guy in our group [who didn't understand english but could sing along to everything] were the only guys to keep our hands down.  Same went for the girls.  There were a couple of hen's nights out as well.  Let me say, these women were rougher than a bucket of dogs arseh*les.  I was starting to enjoy my night less and less.  It was at the point where the DJ then said that the girls on the dance floor had lost some sort of game and the boys won, so could they please take their underwear off!!  I've never heard anything like that before.  I didn't think I was that conservative, but apparently I am.  And you know what?  The girls actually did!!  Some of them just hoicked off their g-string there and then on the dance floor and started twirling it around their fingers on the dance floor!!    I took my leave.  Everyone stayed on but I was thoroughly cheesed out.    Oh did I mention the floor was sticky and the air was full of smoke?  I'm sure you worked that one out.  Never Ever again.  Sunday was more riding and an open air carnvial in Oxford.  yes it was full of hippies and yes they weer as high as a kite.  Still, the atmosphere was good.  The rest of the evening was just spent chilling out and taking it easy as I was still knackered from the night before, the lack of sleep and the riding.    It WAS a good weekend.  I'll just chalk Saturday up to Experience I think, nothing else.
