It's 11am and I've done 30 m,inutes revision on teh Cold War, it's suprising how much I can remember, having already revised it thoroughly twise (for yr 10 exmas and mocks) so I don't actually have veyr much to worry about it! On to Germany next I thinks! Anyway, weather is beautiful again, but I am hiding in my room all day today because my aunt is coming (which is always a complicated procedure). She always phones up and invites her and her 2 boys (both under 5) round, they make a fowl mess, she talks absolute rubbish, mum doesn't like her, and they never leave (plus they always arrive at least an hour early, and frequently phone up at 8,30 when we're all still aslepp). Fun. Mum has told her today that I'm revising all day (I really don't feel like seeing them), therefore I'm staying in my room all day, I don't think I'll even venture down for lunch! Much safer to stay up here when she's around. So, back to history I guess, thought I'd just pop in here for a bit while I give my eyes a break! Acutlaly, beeter go and get some drink supplies if I'm hibernating all day. Later peeeeeps.
