Just chillin."  And she goes like:  "So... We're roomies..."  And I'm all:  "Yup."  It was ON, Dogg! She's all givin' me the eye an' shit! But... I'm chill: I bust it with:  "So...

And I'm like:  "Whaaaaat?"  She's all:  " I saw you."  Dude. I'm all:  "Pshhh. Whatever."  Then... Check it: She's all:  "I've been checkin' you out, too."  A Playa's gotta play.
