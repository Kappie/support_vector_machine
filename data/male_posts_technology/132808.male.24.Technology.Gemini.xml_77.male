Well, I do, I just need to get back to looking at amateur porn and listening to BSB.  I went on a Backstreet downloading binge today, grabbing like 25 songs.  Whatever happened to the late-90s era of bubblegum pop?  I miss happy songs.  Songs that just made you smile, like Chico El Debarge's "Rhythm of the Night".  Whatever happened to the days when you had to  imagine  a slutty Britney Spears hidden under that schoolgirl's uniform, instead of being slapped in the face with the one pulling lezbo with like a 50 year-old?  Or the days when the words "Justin Timberlake" didn't immediately trigger horrible visions of Janet's sagging, lopsided, nipple-jewel encrusted boob?  Or the days when the words "Janet Jackson" didn't immediately trigger horrible visions of her sagging, lopsided, nipple-jewel encrusted boob?  Frankly, I was happy to picture Janet naked, before I found out her titties could double as Mizuno volleyball kneepads.  Wow, late April's a little early for the Khari bashing, dontcha think?  I don't know about you, but I put Khari behind only Matty as the best Bomber quarterback in my lifetime.  You give anyone, Dickenson, Ray, Cavillo that O-Line and those receivers outside of Stegall and see if they can throw for 4000 yards and 30 tds.  Kamau Peterson was a sweet pickup, but I think the Toronto trade will be clutch.  Cory Annett gives us a centre, and Randy Bowles is a better blocking back than Mike Sellers.  Remember, the last time we traded Toronto for an offensive lineman, we got some guy named Dave Mudge.  Okay, I'm out, but I will be back tomorrow: look for an all-new review at Movie-Vault, and some changes to this place.  Nothing major, just whatever, I'm getting bored.
