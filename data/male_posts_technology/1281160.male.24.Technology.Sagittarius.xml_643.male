Sriprasath called me up and conveyed his wishes, from him only I came to know about kicha's ill health... but I thought he would have reached blr by this time... Jax, any idea when kicha will be back.. howz he feeling now... Jax, do add sriprasath to our blog members.. and let him / me know once its done...  Actually, Oct 18 - 19 I was slightly not feeling well.. something iritated me.. might be diwali fever... by Oct 20, really I got Fever, I tried 6 Paraceatamol.. and half  filled stomach...gud, it saved nine....  I have booked tickets to (oct 22 -> ngl) and fro (oct 27 -> blr), but a shocking news, That I have to stay and go next day... coz of some delivery etc... somehow I convinced the PM (project manager) and made alternatives for my position... had a nice trip in Volvo (Imported from Japan) really a fantastic trip in A/C bus with 150 Rs/- more from actual fare.. just 12 hrs journey (798 Km in Indian Roads)..  really enjoyed well with Boyz film (I slept coz I have already watched).  Yeah, coz of the tension on the day of my journey at office, I couldnt find time to read blogs too. we had floor decoration for Diwali, our Floor stood second.. will post snaps soon...  Our chidambaram tour snaps are ready  is in courier section.. will post them as soon as it reach me...  Congrats vijay for ur step towards a new challenging envt (Career, Climate, Culture, Food  Language: Mumbai PCS). Coming to ur question, I have the answer, but I am not sure to what extent the same will convince you... Gud man, u purchased a week b4, I purchased a day b4 that too only a shirt for formality... Yeah I watched most of the debate,  "Just we have come to know that these are yet another day which acts as a family get together, but in childhood these days are time to relish away from study, no pressure from teachers / parents the whole day, moreover new dresses only during festivals / functions... but now.. we can get dress rt. now also if needed.. those days need is not the criteria but function is the criteria, nowdays viceversa"  Kavi, since strugling with gr8 responsibility and placing little effort I couldnt find time to post, although I read often.. moreover there is no matter to be posted.  Manny yet to read your links.. will come to both discussion (Marriage  Religion later).... enna da.. pillion seat free ah??? irukooo??? hmmm irukatuumm...  Valli, Sindhu, how about ur diwali celebs...  Rini, how was urs...  During my stay at native, talked to Ganesh, Rajesh, Rohini, Sindhu, JK, Shoba...  all conveyed their wishes to all...  Cheers
