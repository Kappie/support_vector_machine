That's ok, I feel like you only really need to have 2 or 3 really fired up students and then the trip starts to build momentum itself.  The last major one I organized, for a whole grade level, we sent out 60 postcards and only 6 parents showed up.  Anybody else out there have tips for running parents meetings?  Would love to hear them.
