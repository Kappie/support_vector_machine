Fantasy   Impact  (Antoine)   Antoine should be huge. He and Al Harrington are all the Hawks have going for them... Which may or may not be better than last season... When Walker was with Paul Pierce in Boston he put up about 20, 8, and 5 for about 4 seasons straight. I expect more of the same from him in Atlanta. "Put it up, Antoine! It'll go in eventually!" will certainly be what he thinks the crowd is chanting.    Fantasy   Impact   ( Jason Terry)   The fantasy outlook is not so promising for Jason Terry. As I mentioned, he's going to the overloaded Mavericks. They have been clearning some space by getting rid of Fortson and Walker, but they still have players who are going to get more time with the rock than Terry. As the starting point guard (according to ESPN), Terry should be able to keep decent assist and rebound numbers. But with Dirk, Stackhouse, and Finley ahead of him in terms of options, his points are almost surely going down.
