Why is it that the ‘yob culture society’ in which we live just wants to go out and get wasted and stoned or whatever slang they have for it nowadays! I understand that ‘Sex sells’ and its enticements etc but really do we always have to show programmes that appeal to the lowest common values in our land? No wonder Europeans think us Brits are yobs  louts. What has become of our culture and our standards? I remember when made in Britain stood for quality, now I understand it appears to mean crap!  Lamentably I see this kind of thing every day on the streets with stupid lads wearing Burberry baseball caps  tracksuits and other fashion victims driving tastelessly overdone little cars that have had more money spent on than they are worth. And to the lads who ran out in front of my car last night and thought it was great fun because I had to screech to a halt (thank god for ABS!) all I can say is next time I won’t re-act as fast, 16 going on dead if you see what I mean.  Back on the subject, having been to Prague this year to get engaged to my lovely partner Beth, I can say it is a fantastic city with lots of culture and great things to see and do. What a friendly place and very clean! It could teach the so-called City of Culture to be, Liverpool, a thing or two. (Yes I’m from Liverpool and the only thing it has done so far for local people is drive the cost of houses up, ‘cause Londoners are snapping up the houses in the hope of quick profits).  Call me a snob by all means, I don’t care anymore.
