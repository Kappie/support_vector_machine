I have never the less designed a new site and put it out:  urlLink linuxboxonline.net  Only the design is there. Haven't put up any other pages yet. They will come, well over half the work is done now. Only have to create the individual pages. It's summer so among work, chores and random stuff, the time to do robotics and maintain sites is getting smaller and smaller. The latest stuff now has been painting the house. Not done in a day. A week, maybe. Anyway, the design is there. Haven't even had a chance to test a server config yet. If the rain continues, I might get a chance to test tonight. We'll see. Test results will be made available at my site. I've found yet another tutorial available. This one shows how to setup a WEB-Hotel with a few domains. That might help me. Written in Norwegian, but I might find the time to translate it, If the author allows me.
