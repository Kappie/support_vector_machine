 By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore -
 Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
 It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore -
 Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."

 Obviously, there is a fine line between ignorance and beligerance.  I mean, come on!  The dude just lost his girl.  I don't mean misplaced-lost, either.  And you're going to taunt him like that?  But how can you get mad at a bird?  The situation, yeah, sure, maybe.  But the bird?  No.
 
 So when your laptop crashes and your digital camera deletes your vacation pictures, you can't exactly get mad.  You can't even get even.  You have to suck it up and move on with your life.  Afterall, what's more important?  Honestly, people.

 Hippie:  "What, sh*t?" 
 Forrest:  "Sometimes."
