And i made up my mind that certain habits needed to be removed or certain habits needed to be cultivated to culture .   So i drove to Bukit Kiara this morning , put on my Discman and have decided to do 5 full rounds this morning. and i did,..during the 3rd round,..i can feel my body feeling much better with all the sweats and of course being able to breath fresh air in Pj is a miracle. As i was walking , i have time to meditate on several things ..Godly Things mind you...The verse The spirit is willing but the flesh is not...and i just thought ,..good verse in encouraging people to take up sports ..i mean sports allows u to push your body to the limits or sometimes beyond it . It trains the mind to be stronger than the flesh...and if you take the time to jog or doing sports except for swimming, u can actually sing in the spirit as you along,,speak in tongues,..pray or just meditate on Project Romans's memory verse ..you are actually training both your mind and your spirit to push your flesh to do the things that it don't wants to do. Get it so far.?  With the spirit and minds being stronger...therefore things like quiet time...spending time with God in solitude and silence would have no more hitches..as your mind and spirit will instruct the body to do so. And u can enjoy the fresh air and build up your body....Exercise gives u more endorphin ...a right hormone to make u happy naturally...  I , therefore would like to make a short term commitment to go exercise and really implements all of this...and well cultivate it long enough for it to become a habit...so if anyone wanted to do this with me...feel free to contact me...transport would be no problem. So no excuses for me not do Project Romans as well.  All these revelation is not new...as i only find out during exericse...it gives u so much time to ponder and think .  There is also gonna be 7 creeds to my life for this year that i will obey and hold unto ..which is listed under the seven nevers...which i haven't had time yet to publish it ...maybe by tomorrow.  Yeah for Pure JOy people, there 's gonna be house visitation to Winnie and Jeevan's house ..so meet up in Emillia's place at 8  For Simply United ppl, there's gonna be a mini concert Make Your Mark this friday...I will send u guys soon an email about it.  That's all for now...ohh..there's a backup coming soon... so gtg now  Fellow JesusFreak Joshua Tan
