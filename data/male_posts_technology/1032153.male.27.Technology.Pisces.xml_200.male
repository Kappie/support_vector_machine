Cooking Well one of the benefits of living away from home, is experimenting with cooking. I have now fully developed my own recipe for butter chicken curry. None of this cheating by using packets. Raa! I will at some stage post the recipe so you may tantilise your tastebuds.   Sermons I am preaching another two sermons on the 19th and 26th of September. I may have a look at Romans 9, because recently I have been reading it, and used it at a youth study on Saturday. When I read it, I can't see how anyone can argue that God is not sovereign in salvation. It actually seems to me that those who would argue about this generally don't do so from Scripture. They tend to use humanistic arguments of 'fairness'. It doesn't feel right that God would not let us choose him, and still hold us accoutable. As humans we tend to think that responsibility and freedom to choose are inextricably linked, and thus in various criminal cases, we see people pleading not guilty because of insanity. I believe the whole issue is misunderstood because of a false view on two things; God and man. When we view God as 'smaller' than he is, and man 'bigger' than he is, we founder on this sovereignty issue. But when we see God for who He really is, we begin to understand who we are, and then we will have no problems with God being sovereign in the area of salvation (as indeed he is in all areas.). Once upon a time, when I tried to rationalise the fairness of it, I had a problem with God choosing to save some people, and indeed with him letting sin into the world. (I believe God could have 'not let' sin into the world if he had wanted.) But now, I have become comfortable with 'big God', and realise that while it may seem unfair on the human level, God is the sovereign creator. He made everything, and it is his right to do as he chooses. And everything he does, he does for good - his glory. Praise God.
