I don't have the ambition to do a point by point analysis, so I'll just pick out some of the more salient points to argue with.  GoogleWatch thinks that something is wrong with hiring people who have a security clearance ( urlLink Google as Big Brother  item 5). Let's say that the Air Force wants to convert their repair manuals to HTML, that they want to be able to search them, and that instead of using taxpayer dollers to develop their own search algorithms they decide to contract out to Google. The Google tech installing this system will have access to classified data, and therefore will need a security clearance. I fail to see anything sinister in this.   GoogleWatch thinks that the Google cache is illegal ( urlLink Google as Big Brother  item 7).  In fact, this is a matter of opinion that has yet to be tested in the courts. See  urlLink Google cache raises copyright concerns  for more information.  Personally I  urlLink copyleft  anything I put on the web, so this isn't an issue for me.  :-)  GoogleWatch would have you beleive that Google is saving the web server logs for every search ever done on their systems ( urlLink Google as Big Brother  item 9).  This ends up being the most sensible of their claims.   This is going to be a lot of data to manipulate.  Let's see just how much. Google reports 55 billion searches per year ( urlLink Google: 2003 Year-End Zeitgeist ). Assume a search generates 1 server log line. Assume each line is about 30 bytes in size. 55*10^9 (Searches/Year) * 30 (Bytes/Search) = 1.65*10^12 (Bytes/Year). That's 1.5 terrabytes per year.  Is this so much data that Google would need to build custom systems to handle it? No, it is not. There are filesystems that can hold this much ( urlLink NTFS  can hold up to 256 terrabytes). There are databases that can hold this much ( urlLink Oracle 10g  holds up to 8 exabytes).  So if they were of a mind, they could just buy a system to do this.  How much would an off the shelf system to do this cost? Oracle 10g retails at $40k per CPU. A modest server that has a 2TB RAID volume goes for around $6k (I used the  urlLink Penguin Computing   urlLink Relion 430  for reference, adding only a 2TB RAID0 to the base configuration). So, for google to process one year's worth of search data would require a minimum cash outlay of $86k for hardware. Running such a system would require at least one DBA. The annual salary for a DBA is about $52k (from  urlLink payscale.com ).  Total cash outlay: $138k.   According to  urlLink Google's SEC Filing , their net income is in the millions. With that level of income, another hundred thousand here or there gets lost in the noise. They could definitely spare the extra cash for a side project like this.    So, it is definitely possible that Google saves this data and does some analysis on it. But what would be the benefit to google? If it were ever discovered, customers would abandon google in droves. The market for selling this data would be very small (governments only). The risk in selling the data, even if they do analyze it, would seem to vastly outweigh the benefit.   Let's allow the wild assumptions to fly a bit farther, assume google does store the data, does mine it, does sell it to the government. How is this any different than the phone company recording who you called and when? Do we vilify the phone company for keeping records that the government could subpoena? Why should we treat Google differently? The "Big Business" argument doesn't fly, as Google is definitely smaller than ATT.  Then, after GoogleWatch spends all this time complaining about privacy concerns, they turn around and tell you that Google's IPO will fail because they are not invasive enough ( urlLink Ten Reasons to Avoid Google's IPO  item 8).  I'll stop now. But it annoys me when the extreme tinfoil hats (like Google Watch) make other tinfoil hats (like me) look bad. Google isn't trying to take over the world, they're just trying to make a profit.
