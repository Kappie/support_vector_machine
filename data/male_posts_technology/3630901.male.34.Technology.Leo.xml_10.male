It took us about 4 1/2 hours to get there, mostly because we were sitting in traffic in New York, around the GW bridge.  Then it took us 4 hours to drive back, this time sitting in traffic around New Jersey.  Normally it should take about 3 hours each way.  I took Wednesday off instead of working a half-day as I'd originally planned.  It ended up that Mike took the whole week off, so we could have left earlier in the morning instead of at closer to 2.  He had also left me a message last Saturday to get directions to the hotel, but I never got the message.  His computer was down and he didn't have a number for the hotel, so we couldn't get directions.  So we drove back to my house to use my computer.  He drove, I navigated.  When we walked, I navigated.  He was sick but sometimes felt okay -- at least okay enough to eat steak and eggs on Thursday morning and okay enough to drink when we went to a club after the show.  Here's a rundown of our activities:  Arrive in Philadelphia, check into the hotel.  Walk to the show, stop for a quick bite at a sushi bar.  Get into the show -- my body was immediately immersed in and pounded by the bass by the band currently on-stage, Tweaker.  Mike looked at t-shirts but decided not to get a shirt right away - the lines were too short.  We walked in and took a spot near the stairs.  I saw people sitting on a radiator, and joined them.  The radiator was uncomfortable, but better than standing.  After Tweaker, they piped solo stuff from Cevin Key, with videos of nature on the screen.  Skinny Puppy eventually came on, the first four songs were from their new album, which I didn't really know or like.  Then they moved into songs from older albums, which the crowd loved, and I loved.  I already forget the playlist but it was very cool to hear them in concert.  Mike then stood in long lines for a t-shirt.  meanwhile I talked to some vegans at a booth to find out more about the vegan lifestyle.  then we walked across the street to Shampoo for an after hours show.  It was extremely crowded and loud and it's not like you could have a conversation, but there was great eye candy, watching all the goth girls.  After one drink, I was exhausted, and we took a cab back to the hotel.  after an ambien, I was asleep within 10 minutes   The next day, I woke early and journaled a little on scraps of paper.  Then I got bored and went for a walk.  When I got back, Mike said he was feeling better.  We walked to breakfast, where he got steak and eggs.  I never heard of anyone eating steak for breakfast (I guess I've lived a sheltered life).  I got a raspberry-banana smoothie and french toast with banana compote -- it was great.  Then I waited outside while mike went to the bathroom.  then we walked toward historical philadelphia.  About halfway there, Mike said let's turn back, he was feeling sick.  So we turned back, went back to the hotel, he went to the bathroom again.  Then we got the car and started driving out of the city.  I said, hey let's just stop at 526 S 5th Ave for the industrial music store.  I got a thing with remembering number I don't know way.  We got there a little before 12, and they weren't open yet.  So we went to a progressive, independent bookstore.  I looked for a book on domestic terrorism, but didn't find anything I liked.  then I found books on veganism, and bought one recommended by the girl running the store.  Mike bought some progressive magazines.  At Digital Ferret, I bought a CD with previously un-released 16 volt stuff, an Industrial Nation mag, the new Chem Lab, a DVD of Skinny Puppy videos, and a cd with that mitsubishi-commercial song, 'days go by'.    Then Mike was feeling better, so we walked to see the liberty bell.  once there, another trip to the bathroom for mike while I watched kids play soccer on the field outside.  Then we saw the liberty bell.  Pretty cool.  there was a whole exhibit outside, but we didn't spend much time there, because we were concerned about the parking meter running out of time, and we wanted to get on the road relatively soon.  Then we went to City Tavern (Est 1773) for lunch.  Great lunch, nice atmosphere.  Shouldn't have ordered dessert while mike was in the bathroom again.  On the road.  Plotted an alternate route to the GW bridge via 287.  Stuck in traffic in NJ.  That was basically it.  I would like to go back to visit again maybe for a weekend or something.
