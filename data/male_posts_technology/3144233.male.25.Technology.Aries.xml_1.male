We set off for our final thirty mile section feeling suitably dreadful but after covering the first ten miles and a short break it got a little more bearable. It was a long hack with a lot of night walking some of which was on some busy A road.  By the time we saw the signs saying robin hoods bay wasn't too far away we were all feeling a fairly exquisite sense of pain in our feet and knees so it was into zombie mode for the last few miles.   We made quite good time considering our collective states of unwell-being getting in at around six thirty.  It was a shame we couldn't finish as we started, with Jim, but at least it's done. Hope your knee's better soon mate!  We would like to thank everyone who sponsored us and everyone who sent us emails along the way. The encouragement was good for morale.   No doubt we'll see you all soon, until then, take it easy - Ed, Joel, Leo and Ben.
