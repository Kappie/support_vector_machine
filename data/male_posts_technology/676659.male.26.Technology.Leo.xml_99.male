Once logged on, click on the link Random Ramblings on the right panel of the window. 3. When you're in, you'll see the window being separated into two.. the upper part is a blank white space and the lower part is filled with blogs already posted.. these two parts are separated by a black thick line..  In order for you to post, just type into the blank white space.. when you're done, click the POST button on the upper right of the window.. it's right below the SIGN OUT button.. :)  What it'll do, it will refresh the whole window and show the blank white space again.. but now, your post has been added on the lower part of it.. it'll be placed on top of everybody esle's post.. but this hasn't been published yet! in order to publish it, click on the PUBLISH button on the far right side of the thick black separator..  You'll know when it's okay coz' a message will be shown on that thick black line.. it's "Your publish request was sent at 3/17/2003 1:08:25 AM." but of course, the time will vary.. the date and time mentioned here is just an example..  if you have any more questions, just post it on the chatterbox or email keren! hehe..  urlLink info@digitalsiopao.com
