Kate lived with a magical perspective on life; all things held wonder for her.  She knew no limitations, but always strove passionately for whatever she was seeking.  Her enthusiasm was contagious.  She had a way of making friends with people from all walks of life, in any circumstance.  She had no regard for the norm, but broke it without seeming to even notice, intent on her passion.  She was a lover, always running madly after art of all varieties: music, painting, writing, acting.  At the age of six, she lost her Latvian mother whom she totally adored, and who represented a life journey to Kate.  She would often dream about her mother guiding her, and when she followed it would end with a big reunion of music-- they would play violin together on the grave where her mother was buried.  Kate was always struggling to get control over herself, to follow what she perceived was her mother's voice, and dedicate herself to her art.  Kate had myriad plans, but usually returned to the idea of moving in with her aunt, far from all the distractions that kept her down, and trying to paint seriously.  We spent endless hours in coffee shops and crappy all night restaurants discussing our dreams, our struggles and hopes, what the future would hold, and what the past meant.  Once we put on an improv play for an audience of waitresses at Perkins.  We shot a lot of pool.  She taught me what little guitar I know.  We wrote poems together, read aloud to each other (sometimes at the same time with different books).  We occasionally drove out into the country at night and took random turns until we were good and lost, then got out walked about, looked at the stars, or just sat and listened to bullfrogs.  We went to concerts together (which included sneaking backstage and meeting the band).  I went to a few too many pot parties with her, but I always had a good time despite my anti-drug stance.  I was a straight-laced kid hanging out with the "bad crowd," but that's where I found the most real community.  They were a refreshingly humble group compared to most high-school groups.  Every Friday before school, at about 6AM, we'd get together at Perkins or Denny's for breakfast.  There was usually more than ten of us there; it was really good times.  I miss that camaraderie. Unfortunately, I've kept in contact with none of them, but I'll be reuniting again Saturday morning.  I'm a little nervous but looking forward to it.
