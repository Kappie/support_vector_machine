BIRD FLU... the beehive of diseases now plaguing the world.. i don't know whether the dragon will blow the fire on me and extinguish the life i take for granted. nevertheless i look forward to the trip of the land behind the iron curtain.. i have a list of things i think of buying from there: 1. DV cable for my digicam - will it work with the firewire port that my laptop proudly possesses 2. A cool backpack - don't they make all that stuff in china? 3. A cool pair of shades - don't all the chinese looking guys in the action movies seem to be wearing them? the preparation for the trip was the chat on yahoo with someone in china room.. the golden piece of advice i got from there was - "Keep some cash on hand".. and that scared me.. 'cause when i board my flight today i will have no foriegn currency in hand.. a stark departure to the TC i would carry in my earlier trips while being in satyam.. another piece of advice was to carry some 200 of chinese currency per day for expenditure except the hotel and captain, that is what i intend to carry... 1400 of chinese currency for 7 days :)  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.
