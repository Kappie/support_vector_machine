And by the way, this trip wasn't on a weekend either -- it was bang in the middle of a week, with work left waiting to be attended to later on.  The need for the get-away was that bad.  Its not been much of a get-away so far though.  I've been pretty much on the phone all evening with Ricky and all morning too!  Its close to noon now and I am sitting in this quaint Sify Iway internet parlour, chatting on Yahoo with Ricky and updating my blog.  I have my laptop with me and would've loved to log on from my room at the resort and surfed the net but they don't have broadband connection and they charge Rs 5 for 180 seconds of dialup time!!  That makes it Rs 200 per hour and as expensive as it would be at the Taj.  Not that this place is any less classier --- I didn't realise that this resort belonged to the Ashok group untill I actually checked in and looked at their logo on the Menu Card in the room.  I did notice their name on the Indiamart site when I checked for beach resorts at Pondy but just like most net users do, I picked the top 2 hits -- the Kailash Beach Resort and the St James Beach Resort.  I found the St James Resort to be a lot less expensive at Rs 1000 per night for single occupancy (Yes, single occupancy because I went alone!!! -- more about this later) and Kailash was twice as expensive at Rs 2100 per night.  I am usually not that finnicky about the price but on this trip, I decided to watch my spending because this trip was meant to be dedicated for sulking and I didn't think sulking required as much spending (yes, i meant "sulking" with an "l'.....so, stop thinking dirty now!).  The drive to Pondy was different from the one to Chennai in a lot of ways.  Although I was doing another 250 miles all by myself, the similarity ended there.  Folks, by the way, 250 miles on Indian roads is a lot of driving, given the condition of the roads -- although the condition of the roads on both these trips was simply brilliant.  I was initially thinking about taking the same Old Madras Road and kept thinking that there would be a deviation for Pondy, pretty much like the deviation for Tirupati somewhere along the way.  On the last day at work just before leaving, I wrote a mail to the Yahoo Group, comprising of other residents in my apartment building and asked them if anyone had done a recent trip to Pondy and if they had any suggestions for me.  One guy wrote back saying that they stayed at the Karnataka Guest House or some such thing...talked about places to see at Pondy, such as the Auroville and finally while signing off, like almost as if it was an after-thought, mentioned that Hosur Road was a pleasure to drive on!!  Hosur Road??!!??  I knew Hosur Road led to Chennai too and therefore to Pondy as well, but I had this impression that Hosur Road was the route people "used" to take but not anymore.  I put that thought away during the day and thankfully, in the evening, Chandru called me.  I was telling him about my trip and asked him which way to take.  Chandru has done his share of road trips in the past and I figured that he might know.  He suggested that I take the Hosur Road too, and that pretty much sealed the case for me.  Talking about dissimilarities between this trip and the Chennai trip, the first one started bang in the morning.  I didn't start as early as 5AM for this drive but instead started at 7.38AM (dont' get flabbergasted with my memory....I am referring to my notes as I reel out the next few pieces of statistics).  My new servant maid came in the morning and I gave away all the left over food to her --- signs of me becoming more domesticated ;-)  Whoever is going to be my future girlfriend or wife should be pleased to read this.  And hey Ricky, don't start getting panicky....I am not suggesting that I would look elsewhere but given whatever you said last night, I guess we are a few more lifetimes apart from each other right now.  Anyways, having dealt with the maid, I quickly packed up and started out.  I hadn't withdrawn money yet and given that it was already nearing 8 in the morning, I knew I had to have breakfast before I set out.  I went to the Shanthi Sagar close to home and picked up a truck load of money from the nearby Citibank ATM.  I picked up a 2 ltr bottle of water and a measly looking biscuit packet and got back to my car.  When I switched on the ignition and glanced at the clock, it showed 8.15AM.  By the way, I don't wear a watch and if I need to know the time, I need to either look at the my cellphone or the clock mounted on the dashboard of my car.  Why don't I wear a watch?  hhmm....thats a tough one.  I guess I stopped wearing initially because I didn't have a good watch but later on, I got so used to it that when I did get a good watch, I didn't like the feel of something strapped around my wrist all day.  Much later on, about 11 months back actually, Ricky bought me a watch --- it was a blue sports watch, don't remember the brand and I think it cost around $25, and I was kicked to wear it.  Everytime I looked at the time, it would remind me of her and given that she was going to be 15,000 miles away, that was the best thing I could do -- stare at the watch and get reminded of her.  Anyways, starting as late as 8.15 was a terrible thing to do.
