But why 107 years ???? I don't know, it is funny in fact. It's Up  Down actually. Yesterday I had spend my day to think to our discussion about our feeling, I was very stressed. And after the job, all was OK, she was happy, and me relieve. But question run in my head. "How we could live this new situation???". I went to bed at 1:00 pm, and she went just after, we made love as it is the first time, we was happy, so strange to feel happy after a so special discussion the day before. This morning, I thinking to this (I think in English since a begin this blog :s) and she was angry (don't ask me why, I don't know) She said that I must say what I want, because she haven't 107 year, and if we are boring by our life, perhaps it's time to separate (I had a problem with this verb, not sure is the good). She said that she can't bear to think that she doesn't love me like before, it's a too great frustration. Today, she goes to his doctor for her rare disease, it's a very good doctor, it's a friend of us now (she invited us this week-end to a Barbecue), and I think she will discuss about disease and about our private life. I think my wife ask to this doctor what she must do. I don't know what I must do myself, If she decide for us, it should be finished in two days. I will see this evening, I think if we have a chance, it's now, not when all will be finished.
