Think I probably should be using the lowercase Gmail as that seems to be the most popular, although if you look at the Gmail logo, the M in mail is capitalized. This is a stupid little detail, or is it ... I like to be consistent. In the title of this blog I didn't use the capital M, but pretty much since that time I've used it.  So it will be Gmail from now on unless somebody comes along in the comments section and convinces me that it should indeed be as the "GMail" logo suggests.
