I apologize profusely and the best I can do at this point is to make up lame excuses for my laziness.  So without further delay, here are my excuses (in no particular order):      Coming down from the high of Cancun has just got me too depressed to do anything that takes even an iota of energy     I will be moving to Winona this weekend so I have been busy *cough* packing     I don't have the pictures of the trip developed yet and I wanted to wait until I had them before posting     etc., etc.     So there you have it.  Lots of fairly legitimate reasons for you to pick apart.  Well, I must go now, but I will leave you with this...  I promise I will post the details on Cancun next week.  Adios amigos.
