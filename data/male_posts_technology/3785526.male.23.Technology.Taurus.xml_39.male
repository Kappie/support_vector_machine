It can't be done sitting in India. The Indian part of the equation is to help these innovative US companies bring their products to the market quicker, cheaper and better, which increases the innovative cycle there. It is a complementarity we need to enhance.  - Nandan Nilekani, CEO, Infosys, quoted in The New York Times, March 7, 2004.  Is there any one still working for Infosys?? Urge them to switch the company, you will continue to remain slaves.  Is there any one who has Infosys shares? Sell them, don't invest on the company which has leaders like these..  I had hopes with Infosys that one day they will lead India and Indian youngsters by example.. But if this is the kind of example they want to show. I would like that company to *die*..  How the hell this "bugger" can make the statements like this?  May be Nandan Nilekani or Narayana Murthy can be slave, Not all of the Indians.  Article  urlLink here     urlLink
