What they drive is a complex function of a) what best expresses their personality as it is (or as they wish it was) and b) what they can afford. I drive a Ford Falcon Forte which is, without doubt, the finest automobile I've ever owned. Once it finally goes to the great scrap yard in the sky this is what I'd like as a replacement.  Ford Falcon XR6. It has a 4.0L DOHC VCT I6 motor developing 182kW at 5,000rpm and 380Nm at 3,250rpm. Best of all, it looks like dynamite.  Link:  www.ford.com.au
