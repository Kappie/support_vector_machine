He notices a police officer walking back and forth between the lines of cars so he rolls down his window and asks: "Officer, what's the hold up?"  The officer replies: "It's a Man United fan - he's so depressed about losing the premiership to Arsenal, being knocked out of Europe and the prospect of winning f**k all after gobbing off all season, he's threatening to douse himself in petrol and set himself on fire.  He says his family hates him, his mates are all laughing at him and he has never had a job, so I'm walking around taking a collection for him."  "Oh really?" says the chap "How much have you collected so far?".  "Only about 1/2 a litre, " replied the policeman, "But a lot of people are still siphoning ."
