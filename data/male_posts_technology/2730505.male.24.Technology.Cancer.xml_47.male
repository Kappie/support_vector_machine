I don't know if it was the weather or whatever but there were a lot of cuteis, hotties and whores last night but it was just blah.  I think I drank too much too fast so I had to go home before I got in "trouble" driving.  We tried to get John laid but it just wasn't working.  Actually we couldn't even get started because there was no cooperation from John.  See the act was that I was a foreign exchange student that lived with his family in Vienna, Austria.  The only snag was that he couldn't pull off the German accent.  Oh well, there's always another day.  Wow it is windy as fuck today.  Good thing there's no wind chill factor.  Supposedly it will be snowing late Sunday night/early Monday morning here.  I hope that it's not going to be enough that it will accumulate.  I have never actually driven my damn car in the snow so I'm kinda anxious to see how it drives.  Yeah, new look here.  I think it will change later.  We'll see.  I miss you sweetie.  Thanks for calling last night, I really appreciated that.
