The plan was to have 4 different trips from GCC, between middle-high school, all of them are looking into the future, to set up a progression for summer missions, and trying to be strategic. Up until today, I really only had 3 out of the 4 staffed and ready.  But this morning, two people, who have worked closely before, both said they were interested in leading this trip and both were really interested in working with each other.  Hmm.  Very cool.  So I meet with them on Wed evening to lay it all out.  Pray for ML and J.  They are a great team, and I trust them as mission trip leaders.
