Works like the stock market!   The HSX (above) is actually one of the coolest sites I've featured here at The Kevin McCurrach Blog! It's also really good for telling you what kinds of movies are going to come out...If you're wondering why I'm explaining this, here I go. The Kevin McCurrach Blog now has actual legal terms agreeing that any link featured here has it's own review, and it has to contain no profanity and such.  I'll post the KMB Policy soon.  I have to go now, toodle-loo!
