So now I must work the mad hours and pay it down. Goal: remove credit cards from my life, be able to go where I want, when I want.  So how are you today? I am a bit sleepy, but woke up at 7am almost on the dot. Of course I woke up because I was horny as all hell, but what can you do? Good dreams though.  Here I am again, blogging, writing my diary for the world to see. Peter and I, and whoever else at the house that wants to, are going to the new restaurant/bar 1.5 blocks from the house tonight. So that should be fun.  Well, off to play some video games... err... TEST some video games... yeah, honestly I can't complain, Peace out- Tim
