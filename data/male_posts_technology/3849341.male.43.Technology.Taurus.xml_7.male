This type of faith is not easy to come by, and "is costly to keep. " The Gaze of Soul" will begin to drive you to abandon (self)ish pursuits for the mere opportunity to view "The infinitely Beautiful God" in ways you had not previously. This is were I may get side track for a bit (I apologize in advance for the ramble you are about to experience). We, the church, have gotten so far off track we have lost sight of who we should be gazing at. We have gotten into teaching the doctrines of men, self-help, or three easy steps to a better life sermons. This way of feeding the sheep is easy, anyone can do it (and I do mean anyone). Instead of imparting manna from heaven, we give the sheep our home made recipes. These home made(self made) recipes can contain various ingredients to make it smell, and taste good. Yes, it may taste good going down, but it has no nutritional value leaving us empty, shallow, hungry, and void of the life we so desperately need. Who's to blame for this mess?? Hmmmmm. Well, each of us will stand accountable before this "infinitely Beautiful God" one day. We each will have to give account of how far we missed the a mark. But, there are some that will be held to a higher account, these are the shepherds, the Pastors. Ooops, now were treading on thin ice here, going step on a few toes for sure(I told you that this was going to be a ramble). One thing, I think about quite often is how Christ interacted with the people he came in contact with. More specifically, who were the people Jesus actually showed anger towards? Now, I'm not talking about Jesus rebuking, instructing the disciples when they messed up, that was Christ showing the love of a concerned father correcting his children. I'm talking about the spiritual leaders (pharasees) of the day. Jesus openly showed his anger towards the religious leaders of the day. Why?( look past the surface there may be a lesson in here somewhere).They were Hippocrites!!! Yes that is true, they were Hippocrites, teaching one thing and doing another. But, I believe there is still a deeper reason why Christ was angry at the religious leaders of the day. Still thinking?? Well, the leaders were suppose to be teaching and pointing the way to "The Father". They had cease to point the way to "The Father", and now just gather people unto themselves. I truly believe that Christ burned with anger because the religious leaders had so blocked the people's (sheep's) view of God, that people could no longer find there way to "The Father". Jesus burned with jealously over his children that were being kept from him. My point of this whole ramble is to say, that I believe for the most part shepherds today no longer point the way to the father, and are more worried about drawing men unto themselves. Shepherds should primarily focus on the #1 and #2 of it. What is the #1 and the #2 of it? #1 is to teach continuously without reservation on "The Knowledge of Who God is". God is infinate so there should be no lack of material, but you do have to go mining for it, dig deep for it. What is #2? One point first! #2 can only be taught effectively after #1 has began to take root. You can not teach #2 first. #2 is how God truly views them, not how they view themselves, or how the world views them. #1 and the #2 are crutial to "The Gaze of Soul". If your sight is impaired, having trouble Gazing on God, then focus (Gaze) on the #1 and #2 of it, give it a try, it can't hurt, at least I hope it can't:)
