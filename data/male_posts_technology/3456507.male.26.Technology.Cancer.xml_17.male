After your application has been running for a short time, a thread in the thread pool may become corrupted.   When this problem occurs, you may experience one or more of the following problems:  CPU usage suddenly increases to 80 percent, and one thread in the application becomes deadlocked. Another thread continues to create manual events. A wait thread fires repeatedly on an AutoResetEvent event that has a Win32 native manual event under it because the wait thread is trying to process the completion.  A supported software update is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems that are experiencing this specific problem. This software update may receive additional testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, we recommend that you wait for the next Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 service pack that contains this software update.  To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the software update.
