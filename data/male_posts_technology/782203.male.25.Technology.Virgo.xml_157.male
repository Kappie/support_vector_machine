I really hope that Melinda Kaur wins it, and if not her then Eileen or that Eurasian chick Holly. Anyone else and I am going to petition the organisers to send me instead.  Crap Melinda screwed up the interview question......think it might cost her. Ok none of my 3 picks made it to the final 5...Just curious what other pple think cos maybe I got unusual tastes in women or something....Comment and tell me k?
