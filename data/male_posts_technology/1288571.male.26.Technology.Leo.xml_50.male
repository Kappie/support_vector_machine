Ok, let me lead in by saying this: If you ever plan on going somewhere, check the weather forecast and find that your destination is currently experiencing 100% humidity, DON'T GO!!  Holy shit Niagara Falls was hotter than hell!  The "felt like" temperature was 38 degrees celcius, and with so much humidity, it felt like a sauna. Not only that, but your sweat wouldn't evaporate.. it'd just cling to you forever if you didn't wipe it away.  Anyways..disregarding the heat, Melissa and I had a lot of fun. I snapped 76 pictures and got about 30mins of video I believe. If you go to see the Falls, you need to visit  urlLink Clifton Hill  at some point. That short stretch of road crams in a little of everything! Check out the link to see what I'm talking about.  The way home was nuts. At one point it started raining so hard that people were pulling over. Clouds were low too..it looked like a tornado was about to form. Got all this on video of course. I'm going to see what I can do about compressing this enough to put it up on the site because its worth seeing!  Related note: I think I'm going to change the "stuff" section into a photography section and post pics I've taken with my digital camera.  Till next time..
