Actually the biggest motivator for all of it is trying to find stuff you know you have... somewhere.  Like for the last week I've been wearing tank tops if I go anywhere outside, not only because it's warm outside, but because I have NO IDEA WHERE ALL MY BRAS HAVE GONE.  I actually unpacked a bunch of clothes cause I have to work tomorrow and, well, as much as I've embraced the hippie within, I don't think I can get away bra-less in summer in an office.  For that matter, I dunno if I want to.  I'm covering for a receptionist at a placement agency where they place a lot of factory workers with many social disabilities.  And Friday is payday.  Guess where they'll be?  Maybe I'll just be able to send them off without any sort of problems if I wear a skirt tomorrow. :)  I've spent the last three days coating the hardwood floor in the other unit with polyurethane (takes 24 hours to dry between coats).  Anyway, inevitably, the stuff ends up on me.  Mostly my legs, cause I'm working on hands and kneees, but I got a couple of nice spots on my hands too.  Now, imagine this.  The Minwax polyurethane is largely a clearcoat, but it's got a slightly brownish tinge to it.  Now try to imagine clearcoating your skin with a polymer that'll dry hard ;).  And it doesn't wash off.  It's like superglue.  You have to wait for your skin to wear off, cause if you pick at it it takes your whole dermal layer with it.  It's really frigging hot in here.  I have this nice finished attic, but guess where all the heat in the house goes, naturally :)  Kids, they're not kidding.  Heat DOES rise.  See, you can learn all sorts of useless information at school :)  Anyway, last comic standing is on!  I'm outtie :)
