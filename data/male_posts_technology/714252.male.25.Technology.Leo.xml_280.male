I know only too well that it's hard to see that when you are actually in the middle of the hard stuff but it's actually true.  When you get down to it how bad can anything really be? I've spoken about something similar before but what the hell lets say it again..  If you look back on your life I'm sure you have all had a time when you just couldn't see how life would ever be the same or ok again. (especially when you're younger ;P) So what happened?? You picked yourself up and kept going, you did whatever it took to make it all work and eventually it did, one day you realised you were actually laughing again and it wasn't just the laugh of someone who is trying to fit in with everyone around you but you really were having fun again.  That's a big example but it works even better for the little things if you can remember that in 5 years time you won't even remember feeling stressed at all.  There's been lots going on for me but it's all sorting itself out slowly but surely thanks to a lot of work and a lot of help from the people that matter..  Thanks..
