Had sushi today, saw a cute ger and she knows im looking at her, but that wasn't my concern.. I watched Windstruck, "Ye Man Shi Jie" and it become my concern..   For a moment, i thought i had forgotten how to shed my tears from touching love story. But watching her cry over her beloved's death, cause my tears to roll out of my eyes without hesitation. I felt her heart, not the actress's real heart.. but the role she plays, i felt her emotions. I thought i know how it felt for a moment.. As i'm typing, my heart is also tearing.   It really kept me wondering, why didn't i have anyone to love me like that?  Or why didn't i love someone like that? Is it that i wont cherish the girl if i meet one or i don't deserve her? Can God be more merciful this time round and bless me with somebody like that? Somebody who will risk her life to save mine, likewise i will duck a bullet for her? Someone who will swear spinister hood if i ever died.. someone who will love me regardless what will happen to me? Someone who love me with her own life like how i will love her with my life..  Reality check... NO.. I seriously doubt such girl exist. Mandy refuse to accept me and i know if i persue her further, it will be pointless. One day, if she recover from her grief, somebody might comes along and take her away just like that. It happened twice on me.. and all they ever said was, "Sorry, i didn't expect something like this to happen." Well, neither do i.. *alas*  Think for a while, i have no looks, no $$ and currently jobless.. who would fall for me? It pains.. but.. *heavy sigh* My heart is broken, hap. And i don't have plans to mend it. It should be broken, otherwise i will keep thinking about somebody who i may love..   No one can replace you, because there wont be a 2nd you out there.. No one is better than you, because you cannot compare people with people. First, there is no basis of comparison because there is no agreeable standards to compare. 2nd, comparisons are subjective thus, it will not be reliable. 3rd, i will never agree..  Hopefully, my future blog wont be filled with relationships..  DJ
