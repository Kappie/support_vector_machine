I am liking it because I can use all the tricks I learned from CSS and from my other template easily here because there's not much here to start with. Hence the Minima moniker. I've already created an image I'm using as the background for my  <blockquote>  tags, and I added a dotted border to the left side of the post table. I also added some links, but I did not save my old template, so now I am implementing changes from memory, doh! I like it so far.
