Some are good for finding someone new.  I'm confused as to who I am right now, or what music I need. I know that I'm a good person that will continually try to do the right thing. If that's not a desirable attribute, then I guess I won't be desirable. Everything in me wants to help others succeed. But even as I write that, I know it's not true. I know that I don't want people that talk down to me to succeed faster than me. I know that there are people that drive me nuts and whom I probably dislike enough to not want them working where I work.  I'm always analyzing peoples skills and where they might fit best (at work anyway) I categorize my friends. I hide my feelings, in order to self protect, as almost everyone I know will leave sooner or later.  I think I talk better in person or on the phone than I do in email, but I don't know if that's true. I know I can charm, but I don't know how I do it. Someone once told me to stop manipulating them, but I didn't know how or if I was actually doing it. I don't have a conscience malisciousness, but maybe there is something darker inside?  I want to trust new friends, but I also don't want to get burned. It's a fine line. Trust is a good thing.  I'm running in 8.5 hours, I'm going to bed. Peace- T
