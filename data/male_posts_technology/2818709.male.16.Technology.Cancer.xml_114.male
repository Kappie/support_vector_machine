She didnt think it was anything big, but my grandpa took her to the hospital, and it's serious. She lost 20 lbs in the past month, she's throwing up all the time, and grandma made it sound really serious. She sugar-coated it, i could tell, but i'm smarter than that. I could tell what she was trying to tell me. They're going up there on thursday,friday or saturday, and i want to go too. I told my dad, and he got angry. He said: "She hasnt been there for you. School is more important than this."  Shut the fuck up, dad. Seriously. You're a fucking asshole. My mom could be dying. I dont think that one of mr. coe's lectures is going to be that damn important. It'd be nice to see her one more time before she croaks, if she is going to.   I'm sorry for using humor, but I cant help it. It's integrated into my very being. I cant help it, at all. I guess it's a self-defense mechanism or something.   [...]
