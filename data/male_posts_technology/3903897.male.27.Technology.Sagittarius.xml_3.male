I don't know how, but with coupons and discounts, we made outta there w/ 2 dinners, 2 salad bars, and 2 megaritas for about $23 before tipping.  Remind me to eat at Ruby Tuesday with Jenifer and/or Stephanie more often -- especially when they're working... lol.   those discounts pay off!  :-)    Later, we went to the Swamp and met up with Aaron, Robert, and some guy named Goat.  They were mesmerized by a golf video game.   Jenifer and I waited for an open pool table and considered playing darts, but we tested our luck at shuffleboard instead.   I've discovered I have no control at the game at all.  I either toss the dang weight too hard so it slides off the table or I only manage to move it a little farther than half-way to the scoring zone.  I think the secret is the sand on the table -- always pour some near the scoring end to slow the weights down more b/c when you play, the sand is brushed away over time.  Just when the pool tables finally freed up, the guys left, so jen and I finished our game and headed out.  The score isn't important...   okay, i lied... it is, but I lost -- that's why it isn't important.  lol.   Jen kicked my butt somethin' like 17 to 1 ! haha!  As for today, I got a phone call from some sort of IT staffing company that I had been referred to by Melissa.  I tell ya, that girl's more determined to find me a job than i am -- how sad!  lol.  I was already planning on visiting ManPower or Olsen for some temp or contract work if I didn't hear anything back from the places I'd applied in the next week or so.   So, I'll call them back tomorrow and see what the deal is and if they have a position available.   The message they left on my answering machine was for a 3 to 5 week contract job.  They made no mention of it becoming permanent or an hourly wage, so if Melissa hadn't recommended calling them, I probably wouldn't.  The company is alien to me, so I have lots of questions.  At least I know what I'm getting into if I go work for ManPower since I've dealt with them before and know people that work there.  It's got offices in Florence.  This company, TekSystems (subsidiary of Allegis Group), called me from somewhere in the 864 area code -- most likey Greenville/Spartanburg.  Eh, I guess since it specializes in IT staffing I should go for it.   It couldn't hurt to see what they want and possibly give it a try, I suppose.  I'm still hopeful that I'll get a decent job in town and won't have to go hunting in Columbia, Charlotte, Greenville, Charleston, or Atlanta.   hmm...  I wonder if there's an opening for me somewhere as a corporate tyrant.   I'd love to make millions while playing golf and making simple yes and no decisions with the knowledge that if things go under, I have a nice golden parachute to whisk me away to safety.   Where do I apply?   :->
