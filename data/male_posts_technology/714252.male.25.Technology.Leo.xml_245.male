I have good things work wise going on that if they all come together things will be sitting pretty for a few more months..  On the flip side I have some bad things that I need to sort out too.. Not bad, just confusing.. I need to get a car to deal with a lot of things work wise but I am damned if I can figure out the best way to sort it all out..   Anywho..
