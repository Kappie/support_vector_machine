There aren't many people that would come attack me or go on a killing spree in my neighborhood. At least I don't think so.  Anyway, this world is pretty messed up. I mean, I live in a world of car accidents and dentistry, when half way around the world, they're beheading people to try and get other murderers out of prison. How is it that you think kidnapping people will get your leaders to be released? I mean, I guess terrorist is a good name. You think that using the terror of what you'll do will cause people to do what you want? Or are you even trying to get people to convert to your religion? Or is it merely a reason to kill?  I realize that I don't understand you. Sometimes I wish I could talk to you and make you understand love.  Peace, from a man in turmoil- T
