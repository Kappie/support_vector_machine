My grandma called me and told me that she was on another phone with my mom, who was on another phone with the police. I had my sister (the younger one) lock herself in her room since I didn't know really what was going on, or how serious it was, and went downstairs to the room my mom was currently in. She was visibly shaken and I could tell my dad had really scared her. We waited a few minutes for the police to arrive and my dad, naturally came down and accosted the door of the room we were in for a bit before going up to the front door and answering it. Once we heard the front door open, my mom was fine with going up, so we did and then I went back up to my room for a bit while the police talked to my parents alone and kinda calmed the situation down. Later, my dad wanted to talk to me about why he had walked out on my presentation yesterday, but only succeded in making me all the more angry with him. He can be such a jerk when he wants to be... And we're all going to have to spend the next week with him up in Canada... joy...  Anyway, situation's passed, standby for more outbreaks of rage...
