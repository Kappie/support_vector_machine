Right now she is pretty pissy, and I really don't know what to think anymore, sometimes I'm sure that she likes, me and other times I'm absolutely possitive that she hates my guts, but anyway I have an idea that will either work wonderfully, or fail miserably.     I'm going to tell her... to her face... exactly how I feel about her and see how things go from there.  It's going to be interesting in either case, so I feel really antsy about this.  I think this is the only way to get it over with at least.  I want her to get outta my head, cause right now she's all I can think about, every single moment of every day she just floats into my head and every day I have to see her, but she won't talk to me, and if you knew her, you'd know that you can't be the one to initiate a conversation.  God, I will never understand girls... ever.
