Luckily, their insurance paid everything, including a rental car!  I got to drive around a 2004 Dodge Ram 4x4!  It was nice, made me miss my truck.  I am glad to be driving my Intrepid once again though.  As for other things, I've recently taken a step back and taken the time to observe life as it passes by and things are looking great.  Work still sucks and I barely have money to live on but other than that I have been in a good mood lately and so far nothing bad has happened in awhile.  It's also nice to be able to enjoy the beauty that is nature in the wonderful state of Arizona.  We've been getting rain lately and it's been great.  I just love seeing storm clouds during a sunset, nothing more relaxing than that.  Except maybe spending it with a beautiful young lady who thinks the same thing! :-)  Oh well, Blog at ya'll later...
