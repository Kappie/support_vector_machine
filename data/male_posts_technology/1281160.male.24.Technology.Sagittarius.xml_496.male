When a single quote is being used in a post like "Rini's blog", the script generates an error, which is what you can see in your browser.  Moral of the Story:   Never, ever use a single quote in the title of your post.    As for Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750), I like his  motets  very much. Bach also wrote some of most beautiful pieces of music for a wide range of instruments. Most of his work were religious in nature, but his compositions were all easy to learn. Bach came from a musical family.  Rini, what compositions of Bach have you bought?
