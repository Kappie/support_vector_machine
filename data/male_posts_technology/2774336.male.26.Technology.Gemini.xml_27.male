 I'm begining to eat luch while watching Star Trek (the original series) on Sci-Fi.  I had a half an apple so far, and I'll eat more over the next hour or so. 

 Tucker (my little dog) and I went for a long walk this morning because I was feeling so well.  We went all the way to the nearest mail box which is probably a mile away.  It feels good to get some exercise and not feel ill durring or after.  I do feel wiped out though, from just that walk. I may be sore tomorrow, and I still hope to train tonight.
