But I'm not going to go so far as to say that if I wasn't in school, I wouldn't have any problem writing every day.  I would have a problem, but it would simply come in the form of laziness and complacency.  Ah, the realities of life--when I'm busy, I look at my hobbies like children look at candy, knowing that there isn't enough time to do them and dreaming of the day I'll be free to spend all my time the way I think I want to spend it.  And then the day hits, and the hobbies fade in their allure.  I had a professor in my freshman writing class who said that she dreamt for years about having the chance to go to a cabin and just write.  One year, she actually got the chance, and went up to the mountains to enjoy the quiet, the nature, and her writing.  You might have guessed that she was unable to write at all.  I think that happens to more of us than I want to admit.  I want to believe that there are authors, painters, airplane enthusiasts, and amateur geologists stuck in day-to-day office jobs, and that the majority of the population has a batman costume (of sorts) in their closet, waiting for the day when the bat symbol will be shone in the sky in the form of their leaving the job and moving on to the real part of life.  But that's not what happens, is it?  We get out of our work days and we go home, sit on the couch, and think about what we saw at work that day.  The job becomes the evil tyrant we spend pretending that we hate, but deep inside, we cling to it because we don't really know if there's anything more than that.  Is there?  Thirsty People.  I guess this is the moment when you get to read the post that explains what this blog is all about.  To be overtly ceremonious, I hereby declare this to be a blog about being inspired by things, about hating and loving and having passion for life in all its forms.  It is not about false enthusiasm, made up gestures and facial expressions to prove to someone else that we're alive--it's about the real stuff, the stuff that makes us stay up on a school night or a work night writing or talking or just thinking, and the stuff that will make us look back on life and say, "I did what was in my heart to do, and I can live with imperfection."  Yeah, my professor wasn't wrong for wanting to have that cabin where she could sit and write, but she was wrong for not writing like crazy in the meantime.  I know I'll look back on the days I spent in school, with a thousand ideas running in every direction, and I'll not be able to remember what it is that was stopping me from living a little bit more passionately, a little more fully.  Is it that I'm busy?  I doubt it--I find the time to watch a t.v. show every once in a while.  Is it my environment?  Nope.  Life's just right there, waiting to be grabbed, writing-moment-by-writing-moment, thought-by-thought, school-night-by-school-night.
