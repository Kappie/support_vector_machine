Way too many things to look at at the same time. JAVA, Coldfusion, PHP, Perl, WML, Oracle, mySql and SQL Server, webmin, PMI. No, I am not listing all the possible web tools. These are all that I am working on at the moment and it is driving me nuts. My JAVA certification exams look a distant dream now. I am getting back to my usual self.I wonder if I exist to her. It feels like I have already become a part of her distant past. It may only have been a few days but she does give me that feeling. I begin wonder if people actually mean the things they say.
