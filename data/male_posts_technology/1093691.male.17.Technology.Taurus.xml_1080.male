I think the introduction of this ne wmodern technology has completely changed the way we live. Its faster to do things etc... Unfortunatly people are becoming more lazy with dirving to work instead of walking, phoning a friend instead of going around to see them etc.. But on the other hand with this technology being available shouldn't it be up to that person to decide if they use it, or if they don't? I think most of London certainly are getting lazier. Very much so.
