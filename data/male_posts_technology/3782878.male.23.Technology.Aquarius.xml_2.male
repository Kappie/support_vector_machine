A shaman of Cazic-Thule and pupil of the Mystic Kretais. Inducted into the guild Call of Honour by the noble Feral Lord Deltree, who has always been a great ally of the House of Ironscale.  Second hatched is the ferocious Shasthis. Never one to be content with one path he has studied the ways of shaman and of monks. Finally with the guidance of Deltree and his brother Shactolas he decided to follow the path of the Beastlords and raise is very own Scaled Wolf named Scooter.  The youngest of the line hatched late and greatly consern to Shactolas, Shasthis and their mother for they feared these two broodlings would not make it. But Cazic-Thule inspired fear in these young ones that drove them from there shells and so were hatched Shaclas and Shaszaak.  Shaclas, third hatched and only female in the brood, never acquired and interest in the physical combet her brothers enjoyed and thus began to study the art of necromancy under the supervision of a 47th season Iksar named Rmdir.  The youngest Ironscale, Shaszaak, always had a nack for getting in to trouble. So he was sent to train with the Iksar monks in order to hone his energy and recklessness.
