I started my day with a walk in Diamond Heights wherein I saw that most suburban of fixtures - the playground/stripmall.  If you can't get frozen yogurt and takeout chinese immediately after swinging, what's the point?   The point is catfish and mashed potatoes at the Lucky Penny.  Not to mention a trek into the foggy Presidio for some serious bowling.
