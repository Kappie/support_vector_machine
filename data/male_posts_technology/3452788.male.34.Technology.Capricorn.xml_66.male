Dan plays percussion now after trying the trumpet last year.  The main reason for his switch was that the instrument was too heavy.  Good thing Beethoven never said the same thing.  Anne and I were picking out kids in his group who reminded us of people from our band days in high school.  We met in high school band, I played tuba, trombone, baritone, and she was in the flags/banners.  I was a band geek (it's no longer politically correct to say band fag, although that's what we were called) since 5th grade myself, starting on trumpet and switching to low brass when I got braces (ouch).  My mom also payed trumpet for 4 years in high school in the 50's.  Nikki has musical talent, but she is not really interested in lessons yet.  She has pitch memory and can pick out and memorize almost any sone, including key changes, and hit them right on.  I am very impressed.  She probably will learn piano and do choir, but you never know what kids will choose.  The harpsichord is a silly musical instrument.  I can get very similar sounds with a series of rubber bands and pie plates.  Baroque music irritates me, for the most part.  If I were stranded with a musician in winter, I would want them to play string instruments.  Not for the music, though.  I can start a fire using the violin for kindling, keep myself warm with the cello, and cook the musician over the coals of the string bass.
