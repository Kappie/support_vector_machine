You can see the entire letter  urlLink here :   I would like to take a moment to address some of the outright lies and inaccuracies in her letter.   Quote : “The Mayor wants to raise our taxes indefinitely this fall for road improvements.”   FACT : This is just not true. The Mayor can not raise tax rates, only the Council can raise or lower the tax rate per the City Charter and as a member of Council, I can assure you there has been no discussion of raising tax rates to pay for local roads.   Quote : “According to Michigan law, it is illegal to change zoning via a consent judgment.”   FACT : If anything in the consent judgment was against the law, why would a Circuit Court Judge approve the consent judgment? The consent judgment between the City and REI was approved by the Circuit Court and upheld in the court of Appeals.    Quote : “There are currently three separate legal actions against REI's and the City's re-development plans for this property. This should ring a bell that something is terribly wrong here.”   FACT : The lawsuits have been won by the City and REI and were brought by a severely bitter rival of REI’s and homeowners that did not want the development to be approved. In fact, the court is now looking at granting REI compensation from Grand Sakwa (REI’s rival) and the homeowners for bringing forward frivolous lawsuits.   Quote : “…the unprecedented amount of proposed waste removal is a threat to the environment and the safety of the residents.”   FACT : The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) support the removal of this waste due to the leachate and methane buildup and has indicated that the clean up should present no threat to residents.   Quote : “The same environmental firm represents the City and REI. This is a conflict of interest.”   FACT : The city requires the developer to use our environmental consultant so there will be no ability for a developer to hire a firm solely to refute the City’s findings. This is common practice in most municipalities.   Quote : “There have been other studies and conflicting reports from the MDEQ.”   FACT : Earlier studies we conducted utilizing only five soil borings across the landfill. These early studies indicated only a small amount of environmental problems. Since the original five borings, there have been more than 20 additional soil borings and a much more thorough study has been performed. The MDEQ has never published a conflicting report. They have always supported our findings and continue to support our efforts to clean up this site.   Quote : “… why have the city and the MDEQ let this go for over twenty years? … Why does recreational activity continue on this property today?”   FACT : The landfill has been a problem for a long time. The City and the MDEQ have been attempting to get the previous owners to clean the landfill but have been unsuccessful. The MDEQ is currently looking at the legal ability of the MDEQ to stop the recreational activity on this site due to the fact that there is raw garbage coming through the landfill cap in some areas. The City is fortunate that a developer is willing to clean up the problem with the landfill.   Quote : “I have not seen any documentation that confirms the presence of leachate in the Clinton River or methane gas in basements or utilities from this landfill.”   FACT : That is the reason we are doing this. If we wait until there is already contamination in the Clinton River and Methane in the basement of homes, it’s too late. Current data shows the leachate and methane moving towards the Clinton River and the adjacent homes. Are we supposed to wait to do anything about it until another home explodes?   Quote : “This issue does not involve a "privileged few' but our entire community and those around us.”   FACT : As the Council representative from a different District, I can tell you that cleaning up the landfill and protecting the Clinton River is a much greater concern to the residents I represent than the NIMBY attitude of those living in the half million dollar homes across the street from the landfill.   Quote : “The Council and the Mayor are setting the tone and developing an environment that is an excellent example of what recall was designed to do.”   FACT : It is and shall remain my opinion that if the residents of my district want to recall me for doing everything I can to help clean up a leaking contaminated landfill than so be it. The first attempt by this group failed. Will they try again? Who knows.  The recall process was designed to remove from office individuals in strict dereliction of duty. It was never intended to be used as a tool to threaten elected officials to sway to the wants of a few and that is what Ms. Hilbert wants. A few Quail Ridge and Rookery Woods Homeowners think that by threatening to recall the Mayor and the City Council we will stop doing what we believe is right for the entire City and bow to the homeowner’s demands.  Understand this: I will not freely allow these few individuals to undermine efforts at cleaning up this landfill and protecting the environment for all Rochester Hills Residents.   If you have additional questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me or any member of the Council. We will be happy to discuss this issue with you.
