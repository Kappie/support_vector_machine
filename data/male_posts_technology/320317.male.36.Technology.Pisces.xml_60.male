It also in some ways highlights some of the challenges awaiting the Tablet PC, a portable PC with a touch screen coming in the second half of 2002 from Compaq Computer and others."   I have never used this product, but if all you could do was use the pen on your desktop then I am not surprised it failed. You need to pick it up, set it on your lap, sit on your couch, and move around wirelessly to use a pen-based system sucessfully. I don't think this moinitor is wireless, but I am not sure. Also missing is Microsoft's "special version of XP" for a Tablet PC due out within the year. I am looking forward to the Tablet PC and pen computing.
