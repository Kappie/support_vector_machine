About me, I say that spirituality is just be yourself, listen to your inner voice and do whatever you wish but yes, do take care of the people around you, do think once about them, think of your family, its values and its respect .. and Believe in Karma..  If u read Bhagvad-Gita, it explains clearly ,   urlLink   yatra yogesvarah krsno  yatra partho dhanur-dharah  tatra srir vijayo bhutir  dhruva nitir matir mama    lots of wars and crimes happening in the world..yeah..its a matter of disappointment but don't lose your faith in God. when i talk about God, i am not talking about Lord Krishna or Allah or Jesus Christ, I am just talking about that angel who is sitting up there and watching us .. i am talking about that supreme personality of Godhead who takes care of the things which are not under human control.. I know many of you guys don't beleive in the existence of God... so i am not advocating His existence or non-existence..I am advocating spirituality by means of "Casting pearls without expecting even a single pork-chop in return."
