A few of my notes to whet your appetite.  - Jairus turns around Jesus is nowhere to be found Jesus is talking to this woman And Jairus is left waiting Meanwhile, someone came out and said, Dead is your daughter v.49 too late - we missed our window of opportunity, now leave Jesus alone When they got there, the funeral had started - a full fledged funeral Jesus says stop wailing, she is asleep, they are convinced she is dead They laughed at Jesus, knowing that she was dead  - Delays and interruptions are part of God's plan from the woman's perspective - Jesus is 12 years late from Jairus' perspective - Jesus is 12 minutes late from Jesus perspective - he is not late at all The delays we see are part of the plan  - in our culture, who waits? we have a sophisticated ranking system for waiting people who have the most clout don't wait God's choicest people are asked to wait Because of how God transforms us when we wait Because of what God does around us when we wait
