I get there and they're all a 40 oz and some change of the Magnum ahead of me.  This is code for: They were shit canned.  Evidently while on a mission to get me a 40 while i'm en route, Lars took a spill into a puddle of mud.  His clothes are filthy, his ego damaged, and his wrist hurt, he still accomplishes the mission of 40 attainment.  The night goes on with more drinking, and dicking around.  Now, one thing you have to know about Lars....the more he drinks, the more he insists on practicing his Te Kwon Do.  This doods all over the shit.  Drunken master sitting there with a 40 in hand, eyes half open and doing his ninja moves.  God bless ya Lars!
