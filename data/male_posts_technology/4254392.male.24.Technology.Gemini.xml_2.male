You can even EASILY create tree-view based web sites in it. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and I am HOOKED on the Business edition. It is way too cool not to share with you.  You can do so much with this that if you even give it one minute of your time you'll be as hooked as I am. There is no way you should go on and do anything else in life with your computer until you get this program and start using it. It comes in a lot of different versions - TreePad LITE which is FREEWARE - Limited functionality - like no word processing features or pictures as far as I know ...just plain text. TreePad, TreePad Plus, TreePad Business, TreePad Enterprise..all of which I believe have word processing abilities.  To stop everything now - AND you've heard enough ...go to  urlLink http://www.treepad.com/  to download your copy and get started on the best adventure you'll probably ever have with a PC.    I am  not  kidding.   I have been a PC geek and guru for as long as I can remember and have been in to a diverse assortment of activities from games to programming, from documents to troubleshooting...and OS installations, etc. etc...and the list will continue to go on. I have not found a program THIS useful anywhere the entire time! Come on, when a program finally comes out that should have been the FIRST program to come out - you know it has to be good. FOR REAL YO - Check it out ...this program should have been made a LONG LONG time ago...it is simple and yet can be very detailed. You know what, I think I will finish and let you do the talking once you have tried it yourself.  I recommend the Business Edition of TreePad. It supports encryption and password protection.  This along with many other programs that aren't nearly as useful(as far as fun and geeky goes I guess..) I would recommend to anyone....     urlLink SlimBrowser    urlLink AdAware    urlLink SpyBot Search  Destroy    urlLink SpywareBlaster    urlLink SpywareGuard    urlLink Norton Antivirus   ...A few more I'll list later..   Now I know there are possibly better antivirus programs out and they probably have better support than Symantec..however, they have been trusted and the software I feel is more trustworthy than anything out there...just get it - and get it working...and keep it updated.  Now all you need is to keep Windows Updated and you'll be on your way to having a good PC time.  Be blessed.
