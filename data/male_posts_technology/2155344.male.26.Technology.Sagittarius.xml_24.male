Notable links -   urlLink Tiger preview  - Tons of new features, keeps the heat on Longhorn.   urlLink New Apple Displays  - Unfortunately, no price cuts. The 30" display is HUGE. It needs two DVI connections.   urlLink XCode 2.0   urlLink New iChat  - Chat with multiple users  Guess an iMac G5 is still in the works :)
