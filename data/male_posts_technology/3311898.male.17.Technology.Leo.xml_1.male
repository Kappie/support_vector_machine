I've seen some scary stuff in my life, but nothing really shook me like this.  It really opened my eyes to how horrible the Iraqi situation truly is.  Not that I never realized that we were in a bad way until now, but this really made be think about what we are still doing over there.      This whoke situation makes you wonder about a few things.  For one, why are we still trying to be nice.  We were nice enough to get Saddam out of power.  I feel that was a move for the better.  But now, after what they just did, why don't we film ourselves executing all their POWs in our camps.  Forget the political aspect of this war for now, because they clearly have.  If they have NO regard whatsoever for American life, why should we have any regard for the lives of their POW's?  If they wanna play, we should play right back.  If this was  truly  a war on terror, should be focused on eliminating the terrorists.  Clearly, by the looks of this video, we STILL haven't even done that.      Another thing that makes me wonder about this is why are the Iraqi people aren't getting upset about this!  I find it very hard to believe that the entire population of Iraq supports the actions of the Al-Qaeda terrorist group, so why don't they CARE about this stuff?  You would think that the majority of the Iraqi people would be apologizing about this!  Sure there are still some radicals over there who agree with what the terrorists are doing, but I just can't imagine the entire country supports this.     Even if they don't exactly support this action, why do they take it as common place?  Its almost as if the attitude of the Iraqi people (and some of us Americans too) is like "Well, its been happening for so long over there, its no big deal, that's just the way things are over there."  It makes you wonder how long it will take until this kind of stuff will become commonplace everywhere.  I wonder if in 100 years or so, people will get killed in the streets on a walk home over here and people will be like, "Well that's how it is over in America.."     I just really hope that we find the sick bastards what did this, and saw their heads off!  If we just let this slide and never find or descry Al-Qaeda,  I'll  run for president!
