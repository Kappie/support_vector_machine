I am a registered member at  urlLink Top Coder  and have participated in their competitions since they were founded in 2001.  In fact, I helped with the beta testing for what is now called the Algorithm Competition.  Currently, I am working on components for their Development Competition, which started a little more recently.  Last week, I spend a lot of time working on the  urlLink Javadoc Verification component .  This week I'm starting on the  urlLink SQL Parser component .  It sure takes a large amount of time, but I'm certainly learning a lot about Java and other programming technologies.  Hopefully I'll even win some of the prize money.  If you are interested in joining TopCoder, just visit the site and click on the Register link in the upper right-hand corner.  When you reach the fields about Referals, select "member referral" and enter "Code-Guru" (that's me!) as the member's handle.  It's a great coding experience and also a way to earn some extra cash.  I'm also trying to work on my  urlLink  Staff Scheduler  project.  Apparently there is some growing interest in this software.  I've recieved several posts on the public forum inquiring about the status of the project.  Now I need to make more time for this project as well as continue with the TopCoder component projects.  It looks to be a busy week, and then I start the REU position with MRCI next week.  I'll have more details about that as I learn what's going on.  So stay tuned!
