Ayitha Ezhuthu is another Manirathnam classic... But for those who expect to see another love, another duet, another dance with a scenic beckground, another fight, another suspense and another happy ending.. this is not the kind  of movie to bet ur money on...  Manirathnam spends ample time with the flashbacks, which is the only way he can stress on the ingenuity of the characters he wants to portay... The screenplay is awesome.. There is not much choreography.. but given the positioning of the songs in the film it is not logical to spoil the flow by inserting unnecessary choreography... You cannot expect creativity in "yakkai thiri" nor can you expect special effects in "Jana gana mana"... the songs must be seen in the context of the film and a scenic choreography would have made no sense... No wonder that all songs put together comprise not even 30 minutes...  The way the characters are handled is very unique only to the Mani style of films.. from the unpredictability of Inba (Madhavan) to the endearing expressiveness of Esha Deol the actors fit their roles very aptly... The most impressive part of the film to me was the screenplay... though a shade in the style of alaipayuthey, Mani weaves his magic once more and does not disappoint... The songs are already a hit so there's no repeating that... Rahman shows he is still in form...  Watch the movie if u want to see something beyond the ordinary.. For the rest of the lot this isn't your piece of cake.. so just wait until the next movie with a lot of "masala" stuff comes your way...
