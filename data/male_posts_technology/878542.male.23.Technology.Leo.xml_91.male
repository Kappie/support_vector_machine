I would encourage folk to look elsewhere.  I've also had reports that AT's data service is not as fast as advertised, showing little advantage over the frontrunner of mobile data, Sprint Vision.   It's good to know someone else feels my pain.   happy thanksgiving, enjoy your obesity-risk activities.  For those who celebrate christmas, prepare your shopping lists.
