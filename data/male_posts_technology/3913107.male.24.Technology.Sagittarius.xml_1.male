And how horrible can it get when youget a company which you dont want ~ I was in this is-situation . Basiiically (Mr.VS),I guess my theory of "where does imagination arise" has proved it self. We can imagine only when we are not the one who we are. Say for example - If we are in office and some thing really bad happens.I dont think there is any need to define "bad".Ohhk .. so in these situations we can think of stuf . Or arther when we are in a state which i was todat morning.  Actually the root cause of my analysis was this wild imagination : "Say if there is a bio-tech research centre (anywhere)... and they fuck up. A ameoba starts developing at a rate of metabolism say 10000000000000000 times multiplication per sec... Now .. now... it has taken over bombay ... after this second it has taken over this stae... so when it has taken over ,basssicccally (Mr.VS) taken over this whole planet... "...  The consequences of this state redefine the meaning of "infinity". Enough ..........
