Evididently he has taken up smoking...he started with NEWPORTS...now that is thugish right there.  Everyone started school yesterday...so things will hopefully turn into some sort of pattern and I can start to get more sleep.  I really don't have a ton to say, but knew I couldn't moan about Kristin not updating her blog if I didn't first...so Kristin...UPDATE YOUR BLOG!!!  Wow, I am really using the caps lock a lot today...heh?   Fantasy Sports update...right no w the Ivanhoe Riverbats (that is me) need to make up seven games on Jim to get into the playoffs.  I am currently three up on him with four days to go...one good game from Adam Dunn and the Riverbats are playoff bound.  Football starts soon...that will be fun.  WEhave 9 people which is great... and no girls which is better.  The fireworks for Labor Day weekend are coming up.  I am trrying to talk Ann into going....hopefully my family is coming up.  If so I am going to go to the Kentucky side and watch...  Okay I am out of things to talk about...until then...
