Sorry Trav, we'll have to meet some other time. Hope your 21 is all that you could ever want:) Especially if all you want is to legally buy alky:) Cause then you got your dream:)  also, I was thinking about something to write on blogger the other day, but then I forget what it was. Maybe I'll remember it.   There was something about masturbation, but I didn't know if it were appropriate to talk about that here;) Actually I just figured no one would want to talk about it.  So, as we move on... The question of the day is, "who is mzJaxon?" if you can tell me the answer, I'll write "her" back. If no one can, she'll just have to keep emailing me with no replies:(
