Whatever it is, I'm starting to feel that itch -- that desire to go some place new.  Did you know that my stint at the  urlLink University  tied for the longest I've ever lived in one town.  And you can't even really count that considering I moved every year (yes, even  urlLink Lambeth  counts as a move since I couldn't leave my stuff there over the summer).  Wow...nostalgia just set in.  The image of moving my stuff from ole Courtenay to Sugarmeyer's apartment while I was at beach week my first year just rushed back to me.  
 
 Anyway, I can see two potential targets squaring up to compete for my presence.  First, there's the Northern Virginia area.  Serviced by the metropolitan city of  urlLink Washington DC , Virginia certainly has its draw.  It also has the unfair advantage of housing my fiance at the moment.  On the other hand there's  urlLink Raleigh, North Carolina .  Raleigh has its own potential, especially in the real estate department.  It's very important to me to own my home in near future, so Raleigh has some draw for me.
 
 As you can probably guess, Northern Virginia is dominating the competition right now.  Tune in later to see how the competition is going.
