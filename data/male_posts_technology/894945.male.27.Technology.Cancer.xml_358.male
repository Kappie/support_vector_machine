I feel at this juncture I should reiterate the function of the Toaster Files to all our readers.  We are a group of friends first and foremost. We tell each other everything. Girls, don't even start moaning about this because we KNOW for sure, that generally, the minute you have slept/snogged/groped/whatever with a guy you've already txt'd it to about 40 of your mates with location, time, girth, etc.. and any other details that you think may be of interest.  This is not a bad thing.  Women do this, and women are (generally) good. A world without women would be a very sorry place indeed.  So you have to accept that (while we don't mention names, to respect people's identity) we have every right to post our thoughts and experiences on this site. That includes the places we go, the drinks we have, even if we get lucky or not. We may even illustrate our point with diagrams and line graphs if required.  If you don't like this, don't read our site and do not stick your tongues down our throats. :)  I have more pictures to post of last Friday night, but I haven't used up my disposable completely so i'm going to hang on till Thursday. Being the social butterflies we are, we have managed to secure some tickets to the launch of Liquid and Chicago Rock cafe, woo-hoo!
