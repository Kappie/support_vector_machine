Thanks, but I'm not even sitting in your section of the restaurant! Just for the hell of it, one of these days I might even lead one of these guys on. Hmmm, I must be feeling evil today. Oh, and I think of Misty everytime it happens, and I'm like, "shit, did I catch gay-magnetism or something from her?" Which is an admittedly funny, but ultimately pretty fucked up legacy for your ex to leave you.  But, ya know, the pancakes were pretty tasty.  The steak omlette, not so great.
