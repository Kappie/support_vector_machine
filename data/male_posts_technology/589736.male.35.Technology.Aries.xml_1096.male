Keep in mind that we still have not fully secured Baghdad last I knew.  But, assuming that we were standing right in front of the museum as looting was going on, how should we have stopped hundreds of people from looting/stealing/destroying these artifacts?  Shoot them?  Beat them with the butts of rifles?  The US Army and Marines are not into crowd control.  They are not permitted to operate in a police capacity in the US (posse comitatus).  They don't carry a lot of tear gas, especially when in a war zone.  Their primary job is to identify the enemy, not looter, and shoot him.  Johnnathan - No.  And, did we even have advanced notice of the destruction anyway?
