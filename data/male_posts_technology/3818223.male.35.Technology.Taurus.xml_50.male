This is a great story about the first crime family, the Borgia's. Set in the 15th century, it chronicles the lives of thepope and his children as they wage holy war to expand the power of the church.The only drawback for me was that I didn't find corruption in the Vatican to be particularly shocking. In fact, I was surprised by the Borgia'scapacity for mercy.  - 4.5 out of 5 stars.
