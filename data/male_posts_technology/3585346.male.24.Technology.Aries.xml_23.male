Got a tough time figuring out the coding as it been years since I meddle with HTML OR SHTML OR XML OR whatever you want to call it.  Purpose of this BLOG first I goona get my project done up but I am not motivated therefore I create this messy stuff I have here to get myself motivated.  Tired day of work! Plus brooding over money and brooding over how sucky my school guide book can get! It is farking piece of useless a4 size double sided printed or photo-stated cut and paste nonsense. I pay so much for it and they gonna give me nonsensical guide book.  I rather they give me thick reference book and pick example to explain then I have nothing much to refer to when I need!  Just finished ironing my clothes as usual, have a makan session at SIMPANG bedok(WHICH I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO EAT!) with my buddy. A nice, petite, crazy and silly female buddy. Cheese BOOM is unusually OILY but is nice after tasting the cheese inside. And before I get hungry again I better end this post and get some badly needed rest.  My buddy gonna get to see this messy shit today. Bud Please bear with me! Hang in there while i do it up nicer
