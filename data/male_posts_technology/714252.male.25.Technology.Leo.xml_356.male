Sorry..  You could try these places though:  urlLink Some Thai Rocks  God has a sense of humour, check out this picture of a coco de mer coconut.. They all look like that naturally:  urlLink Coco de Ass more like..   This picture is from Australia  urlLink     This Rock:  urlLink    is in Arches National Park, Utah.  That's it for now, might go searching again later :)
