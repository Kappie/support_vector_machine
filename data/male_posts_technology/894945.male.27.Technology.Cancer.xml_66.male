Okay, there might have been a smidge of a reason.  The first time I was dancing with this girl and she was grinding around me, she went to put her hand on my shoulder like a Ricky Martin video and slide down me.  Unfortunately, she lost her grip and fell flat backwards onto her arse in the middle of a packed dance floor. I burst into hysterics and she fucked off, crying.    Last weekend I told a girl that was apparently getting engaged that she was acting like a bit of a slapper, and she also burst into tears and called me a bastard before squealing off like one of the possums I blew away in New Zealand. Silly fraggles, get some emotional self-control before you head out into the wilds of St Helier!  Anyway, off to find somone else to persecute with Custard and Baity (if he comes out, probably staying in shagging and moaning about money). Goodnight America, wherever you are.
