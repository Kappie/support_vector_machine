We took christmas candy in a ziplock baggy, got our 2 matinee tickets, and then spent $9.50 on pop and popcorn.  The theatre was surprisingly empty.  It got to maybe half-full if that by the time the movie started.  We sat through the previews for Spider-Man 2, and Harry Potter 3 (both look like they are going to be really good).  #1 son had to get up and use the bathroom 1x during the movie. I was able to make it the whole way through w/o an interruption.  Just as a side note, it started to snow as we left. We had a quarter inch of snow when we left. When we got outside and back to the car, we had 2inches or so.  The roads were slick, but not too bad a driving experience.    The movie.  What can I say?  I did like it but did get bored several times.  There were a few things that again, were blatantly ADDED to the book.  Just like in The Two Towers when Frodo and Sam are taken by Faramir to Osgilliath, the oliphants in ROTK just didn't exist. It was dissapointing, but still an interesting scene.  There were parts of the movie that were spot-on, and others, that were totally ass-backwards. Some reason, I thought Aragorn would of looked alot more kingly at the end ceremony, but he looked like Stridder cleaned up. In the book he LOOKS like the King who has come back.  I guess I cant be completely happy with what they did, who could if they have read the books.   But as a movie, if you never ever read the real thing, it'll be a great series.  Even if you've read the books, they are still an awesome series...their just not the same though..if you know what I mean.  If your a Steven King fan, you'll know what I mean lol  It'll be interesting to see how it goes if they can manage to get the rights to do The Hobbit.  Since they did LOTR, The Hobbit should be spectacular!
