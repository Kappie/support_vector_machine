Anyone remembering what  that means.  Just plain links alone is not useful to anyone. Irecieve any new  posts through email. And all I can see is just a couple of links.It is not  usable. I guess everyone knows enough HTML to add a 'title' attribute to any  hyperlink you post.   If you can give a small note on the link, it is fine. But if you feel that  it might spoil the surprise, atleast give a  hyperlink  title to the hyperlink so that people can know  what they are clicking.  That is if it is not too much trouble for you.
