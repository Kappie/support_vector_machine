Here's what I have so far:  (10:22:34) PEBKAC!: PICTURE. NOW. (10:26:33) PEBKAC!: We're out of morning food. (10:27:19) PEBKAC!: SO INSTEAD I'M DRINKING KOOL-AID (10:29:30) PEBKAC!: Kelz...0rz?  Don't ask about the picture. It's secret/joke/thing/. just to let you know.  WiGLE "just a little bit" ^^The only person who should get that is Rosalie.  Off to wait for Kelly of the Gavins and more food. Ah-HEE-hee.
