When I look away to see what it is that is moving - it takes me a while to figure out what I'm looking at / to get the picture in focus. Maybe I should get my eye's tested.  Or it could be the fact that the moving objects are tall leggy blondes and it takes a few seconds to get the whole picture. ;P  Maybe I'm just a people watching fanatic.  Or maybe I didn't want the person sitting across from me to think I was "staring" - but I guess that wouldn't have been an entirely bad thing - hmmmmmmm - something to think about.
