The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), written in 1948, assumed that human rights are universal. They apply to everyone equally. They are not a means to right past wrongs but to prevent future ones.   If some Maori have been treated unjustly by the state in the past - and they have - those injustices must be put right. The Waitangi Tribunal was established to achieve that. But we still have a problem. Human rights theory has become about the protection of groups, particularly if a group is believed to have suffered past injustices. The Prime Minister adopts this position in an article on the Treaty in The Press (19 February).   The traditional view, and certainly Dr Brash's view, is that the law is about protecting individuals. For hundreds of years that has been the basis of common law. The Prime Minister confuses individual equality before the law with group identification. Dr Brash, following his understanding of law, claims that people in need are more justly treated as individuals than members of a group.   Underlying the debate between the leaders is a huge philosophic and legal problem. Groups are political constructs. Group identities might seem real enough, but they are shadowy formulations and deeply at odds with our cultural imperative to treat individuals as individuals, regardless of their ethnic background. The fixation with "group identity" is, in fact, an attempt to create a different kind of society - one where dignity resides in group identity rather than in our understanding of common humanity as envisaged in the UDHR.    Brash's 'Lucky' Break  I was thinking (strange I know) that Don Brash was mad to go to Waitangi. And then I heard the news about mud being chucked on him, and I had hope. Here is a politician who has a brain, and might just have a chance against Helen. Excellent work brother. And no I do not think his speech is divisive. It is naive to call it so. To treat people equally has never been divisive.    Maori Affairs  From  urlLink here    "Back off, back off," a policeman told the protesters. "Tell your people to back off."   The eyeball contact continued as protesters harangued police, telling them to "f... off, this is our land".   As the confrontation continued attention was diverted to a lone protester who had climbed 40m to the top of a tree where he lashed a Maori sovereignty flag.   He drew cheers of support from the protesters as he waved at them from the tree top.....................  He left the flag tied to the top branch and when the protesters were told it was flying far higher than the New Zealand flags on the pole, there was resounding cheer from the protesters.      And that my friends is why there will never be peace in New Zealand. The more you give the worse it will get. What they want is something I will never give. This is my country and I ain't leaving. I belong here; it is  my  home.  One fellow rung up talkback the other day and said that there was nothing good brought about by colonization.... nothing. Presumably he forgot about the telephone.   Colonialism  It's not all bad. Schools might have brainwashed us to think so, but it's not that black and white. More on this later... maybe.   Brainwashing In Schools  You know, recently I have become aware of how brainwashed some of my aquaintances have become. Not all mind, but some, especially the ones who have gone only to state schools. I think my dad is responsible for the way I think. In saying this I mean that I believe the reason I have a Christian worldview is because dad taught me. But it wasn't mainly through a sit down and write down what I say method of teaching. It was through conversation and discussion around the table or in his office. It's great to have a thinker for a father. He really 'sees' behind the obvious into the underlying.  Peter Boyd also has a role to play for helping me fight the university brainwashing. Indeed I never wrote one essay to please my markers in my time at uni. I always wrote from a Christian perspective. Fight against the world! Everything is a spiritual battle. Every movie, every article, every speech is part of it. It is either for or against God. Everyone has a message, and it's either for or against God. Who are you going to serve? It may be the devil or it may be the Lord but you're gunna have to serve somebody. Thanks Bob.   Touch   urlLink Dan  Jono (I'm not linking him because he doesn't blog anymore) Dwaine, James, Mark, Matthew, Boss, George Cain and myself played touch at hillpark today. I felt faint after about two minutes on because the sun. But in the end it turned out to be a cracker game. Try of the day had to be Dan's run away (after sneakily running through the defence) try. The game for me and James was topped of by a sour chill (recommend these for a hot day) (thanks Tip Top I'll have a raise), and cold coke. Mmmm. And that my friends is what Waitangi day should be about.
