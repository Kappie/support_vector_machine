       
      I must apologize.  I incorrectly stated that the "brilliant guy" was leaving pertinent information showing in the barcode.  I was informed that it's only a library card number.    I made a poor choice in an example.  However, I did find another  urlLink example .  My point was not intended to focus on the specific examples, but rather the incredulous act of uploading a picture of an official ID.  In the future, I promise to be more careful of my example choices.
