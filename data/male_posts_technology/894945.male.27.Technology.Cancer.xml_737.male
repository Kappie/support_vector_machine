Here's a short, sharp list of what I've been up to recently:  Watched the worst movie I have ever seen - (and I've seen some real stinkers)  urlLink Cabin Fever  is pitched as a tense, psychological horror but is in fact complete drivel. For instance, one of them is infected with this flesh-eating disease and drives to a petrol station to get help. There's a small blonde lad sitting on a chair, who screams 'PANCAKES!' and then performs some slow-motion Kung Fu before biting the diseased man on the hand. No explanation, nothing.  Went to a concert at St James' church, watched the rather groovy kiwi band  urlLink Wai  do their thing. A interesting mix of raggae, drum  bass and Maori vocals. Shame the CD is completely different and makes me want to rip my ears off.  Got the  urlLink car serviced . It needs a new clutch and a set of cogs to make the roof work again. Total cost, around Â£500. Bastards.  Decided to go on a road trip with the Mallets to  urlLink Santa Pod  at the end of August for some V8 muscle car action.  Went to the JEP's West Show today up at St Peters. Patted a cow, prodded a huge rabbit, watched dancing diggers, ate chicken satay and watched the GF find out how disgusted lavender (yes, lavender) flavoured jelly is.
