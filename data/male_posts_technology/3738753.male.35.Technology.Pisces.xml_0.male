It is a great diversion from the mental torture that laments me.  "Blogging boom gives Iranian women a voice."  I saw it on the way in here.  Interesting.  Could we now see blogs such as "Today I didn't cover my arms and some jackass threw a rock at me.  I picked it up and threw it back."  The world of blogging will never be the same.  Maybe we will have terrorist bloggers next.  We could see posts such as "I want to blow myself up in a public place and go to heaven where I will have many virgins.  I only have one chance to do it right.  Must be well though out."  Now what I am thinking right now is, are virgins that hard to come by?  Well, I suppose in this country they are.  But from where they come from, I am sure there are many because they aren't allowed outside their homes.  Besides, virgins are over rated.  You really want someone with experience.  Do you want a person who has never built a house before building yours?    Today I learned about the patron saint of marriage (unhappy) Gengulf.  St. Gengulf was a Burgundian knight whose wife cheated on him.  Instead of killing her, which was his right in those days, he just moved to another part of the castle.  Then the crazy bitch sent her lover to hack him to death while he slept.  It's a good thing that nowdays, the unfaithful wife just sends her lawyer to take all your shit instead of killing you.  I think you can learn a lot about marriage when you aren't married.  I have been separated for a little over 2 weeks and am learning that to be married you have to be able to communicate (duh!)  I know I am not the best at vocalizing things.  I do try though.  Since I am a writer, it would suit me better to carry around queue cards to hold up when I need to express myself.  When I got upset, I could hold up the one that said "Can you shut your pie hole for a minute so that we may have a two-way conversation instead of you telling me what an ass hole I am?"  I guess if I did that, I wouldn't be very environmentally friendly though.  I would kill too many trees to fund my expressiveness.  It would be best if I just learned to effectively communicate without using four letter words like stop, help and DAMN!  It's amazing what things you miss when you are no longer with the person you love.  In all seriousness, I have missed a lot of those things even while married.  It's all a giant memory now.  I don't see things as snapshots or images like they show in the movies.  Everything is just blended together, like a montage of film displayed on the same blank white wall.  She told me last night that she will never be the wife I want, a wife that is there all the time.  I always thought a wife was there to support you and be by your side when things were tough.  Someone who would be there during bad times as well as good.  Maybe I read the manual wrong.  I missed the chapter where it explained that marriage is only available when convenient.  I also missed the "disclaimer chapter" where it outlines when it is appropriate to be with your spouse.  I must revisit that sometime.  Evidently, there is a lot of fine print that can save one a lot of anguish.  Maybe she got the revised edition.  The one where it is acceptable to go out drinking and not tell your husband where you went with provisions to allow one to stay out until almost 3 in the morning under these circumstances.  In this scenario, I am also to blame for this "mis-communication" as I am then lacking of trust and "confining" her.  Now let's see, if I saw someone coming at me with a gun pointed at my head, shall I trust that he is probably not going to try to kill me?  In addition, this provision also allows for multiple incidences to not be questioned.
