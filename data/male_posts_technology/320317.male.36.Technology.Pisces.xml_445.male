 Uhh ... maybe someone should tell Real about a product with the same service for free that has been around awhile. It's called a  radio . OK ... I understand people listening to their favorite baseball teams while at work, or at home on their computer, but if I am going mobile I think I'll just bring along my cheapo radio or listen to it in my car. I guarantee you'll get better battery life and bigger bandwidth.
