It is a very well done show.  Tonight Dawson's is on so that should be great.  I think the World Series is on tonight too.  Not much else going on, but I know I have to update my blog because Kristin will jump on my case if I don't.  Evidently bad weather is coming ito the area in like 30 minuites...whatever!  I t looks great outside (man here I am talking about the weather again!)...  Well I am going to be home alone tonight for awhile, so my page will probably have something new on it...until then...
