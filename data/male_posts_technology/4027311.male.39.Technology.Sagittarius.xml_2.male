A little about me you can't get from my profile (because I'm too damn lazy to fill in all those text fields):    I am a single dad. It's the best job I've ever had (although sometimes I don't think I'm going to be getting a promotion anytime soon). My kids are the best.    I am a technology junkie in semi-luddite clothing. I run a small computer company (OK, it's miniscule, as in one-man show). I have way too many computers running way too many OS's. Handhelds, too (yeah, they run different OS's, too). DSL, wireless network, yada yada yada. However, I don't have cable TV. Or satellite TV. Don't get me wrong; it's not because I think those companies are evil (I   know   they are). I just don't have the cake to pay for TV I don't have the time to watch anyway. I don't have high-def  anything . My TVs are  old . (One of them I bought new in 1986!)  I play blues guitar. What? You didn't know that Connecticut is the breedin' ground for famous bluesmen? Actually, I didn't either. But here I am, playing guitars all the time. Electric and acoustic. There's like 6 or so sitting around the house. Way back when, my ex-wife used to ask me why I had five guitars. I answered, "Because I can't afford six." My current squeeze is a '52 Tele reissue thru a '71 Super Reverb. No stomp pedals necessary for killer tone.  I have a love affair with motorcycles, but I can't afford the addiction. My current ride is a 1971 Honda CB750, my favorite two-tone color: black and chrome. Runs great (usually), looks not so great. I guess that's what New England winters are for: overhauling bikes. If there are any antique bike riders (antique bikes, not riders), let me know.  Friends of Bill: Contact me anytime. We're trudging the road to happy destiny together.
