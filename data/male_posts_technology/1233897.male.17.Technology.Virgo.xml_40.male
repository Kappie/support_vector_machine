Today is payday (yay!), I'm ordering more computer parts (enough to finally start using the thing!) and also hopefully getting something for Sarah before she gets back from Hawaii.  I really haven't been up to too much... the sad thing about having a job is that when everyone else has no problem just doing things at random times, I kinda have to wait and hope they plan something for a weekend, which they do usually but not always.   Last Friday night (well, more Sunday morning) I went to Andrew's with Armaan until around 5:30am. That was pretty fun as I've never really hung out with Andrew much, nor been to his house. I think he thinks I'm an idiot but whatever, he wouldn't be entirely off in thinking that. Actually, I don't think he thinks that, I just think he's hard to red so I assume he's somehow hostile. After hanging out at Andrew's, we went to Danie's for the xfiles Marathon we had planned. We took a walk and did watch a couple of episodes, but most of the time was pretty hang-outish (which is always really fun... more fun than just watching DVD's if you ask me). I think it's kinda cool that Armaan's friends let me hang out with them so much, because I don't really have many friends of my own (I say Armaan's friend's but I guess somewhere they became mine too, as we do things without Armaan sometimes too). I was so tired by the time I got home, but I slept well later in the evening.   Sarah's still in Hawaii, she left on Sunday and is getting back on Wednesday next week. She's going to call me on Saturday if possible, so I'm trying not to plan anything for Saturday. It's hard not to, I may end up turning down a party that Mandy is planning, which would be sad, but I'd rather hear from Sarah.   Today, July 20, marks umm.... some odd days until School starts (I  believe  it starts on the 8th of September). Thank Goodness I get payed on such a regular basis, as I will really be pushing it with finishing that computer... oh, and I'll be even closer to the line of brokeness as I most likely need to buy a new desk to house it. Ah well, that's the way things work out.   Well, it's almost my Max stop, so I'm gonna finish this up. I don't really know what else to write about anyway..... we'll see if anything worth talking about happend at all this week. Armaan is planing a party for Thursday, and planning on seeing the Bourne movie... whatever the new one is. I won't be able to see the movie, but I hope I'm able to go to the party.
