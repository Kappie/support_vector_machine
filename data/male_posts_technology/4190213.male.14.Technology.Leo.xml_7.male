Mr tony(our coach) said i need more practise in my flying.. i think im just totally lousy but i think im gonna train hard so that i can pass my assistant instructor's course. then, while flying halfway, sebastian fell down.. ouch he so sad like that, then mr tony asked me to take him to the general office to take a plaster. then later, guess what happened, his plane broke into peices, dunow what realli happened but i think yong kang accidently flew too hard then his plane broke.. now is that unlucky or what? then later we use jingxun's plane, we did a light landing also the whole tail of the plane broke.. he was really scared leh, poor guy. i think its becuz of the friday the 13th the ghostly power or something lol. anywayz, guess what, from now on, the taf club members from 110% the weight no need go for taf and more!! that means mee!! weeeee.. haha but i must control my diet and do lotsa excersice i dun wanna go back to taf as a 120% group member. im gonna sign off now..
