"We will not sit (with arms folded) to wait for what others will do to us. Some military commanders in Iran are convinced that preventive operations which the Americans talk about are not their monopoly," Shamkhani said when asked about the possibility of a US or Israeli strike against Iran's nuclear facilities. [...] the Iranian press reported a commander of the elite Revolutionary Guards as saying Iran will strike the Israeli reactor at Dimona if Israel attacks the Islamic republic's nuclear facilities.  Sounds reasonable to me. The US pre-emptively attacked Iraq for posessing nukes (which they didn't,) so now Iran is going to pre-emptively attack Israel for threatening them with nukes (which they  do  have.)  Watch America get all pissy about it when it happens too. Bush will say that Iran had no authority to attack, and that it was illegal, and use that premise to invade Iran. Completely ignoring that Iran is merely following our lead.  I hope I'm wrong, but I bet I'm not.
