It's been a busy day, full of meetings with people who don't know up from down, forward from backward.  These are people who want me to deliver version 2.0 features for version 1.5 and 1.5 features for 2.0.  People who want me to cross the i's and dot the t's.  People who want me to walk on water and eat my cake too.  I think it's time to pass the buck.
 
 I dropped by yonder security office on the way back from my daily exercise routine in hopes of replacing my lost ID badge.  Alas, I am now sitting at my computer, still without a badge.  The security folk are fighting off a serious bout of crashing camera drivers.  These aren't the drivers who take you to Winn Dixie to pick up a pound and a half of ham.  These are the drivers that tell your computer how to take pictures of my mug, and if you don't tell your computer exactly how to do something, well...you can imagine the problems.  So I'm still badgeless, and if they don't correct this problem in the next 15 minutes, I'm going to go crazy...Crazy?  I was crazy once...
