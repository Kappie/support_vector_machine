   All connection string and enumeration info are collected from other internet sites, books, helpfiles, Microsoft msdn etc. A lot of info is sent in by developers from all arround the world (thank you!).    
   Any suggestions, feedback, critics, connectionstrings, thoughts or whatever is highly appreciated.
