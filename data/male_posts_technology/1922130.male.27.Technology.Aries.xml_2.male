Uggghhh.  I went to the Wake/ECU football game Saturday.  Did a little tailgating and what not.  Wake whooped up on ECU, the weather was great (it was an evening game), and I predicted a fake field goal attempt that ECU ran in for a TD....good times.    (Note to self, pump your contacts for free tickets to the other home games later this season.  After all, it's not really a good tailgate unless you freeze your kiester off.)  Ali joined Netflix last week, so we had some movies to watch this weekend:  Sum of All Fears  -  Another Clancy installment, Jack Ryan saves the world as the US is duped into believing that the Russians have started a nuclear war with the U.S.  One thumb up for the nuclear explosion in Baltimore.   One thumb down because B. Af. sucks as Jack Ryan and Morgan Freeman plays the same role he plays in every movie.    The Count of Monte Cristo  - Guy Pearce (no releation) and James Caviezel star in a stellar rendition of a classic story.  I was thorougly impressed...Pearce is a good bad guy, James Caviezel's usually annoying dryness worked out for him in his role as the count.   One hottie and sufficient comic relief:  two thumbs up.  Spy Game  - The damn disc was cracked and wouldn't play in my DVD player.  I'm not sure this Netflix thing is gonna work out.    No review  I've got a camping trip planned with Josh and Bubba this coming weekend.  Should be a hoot.    Fantasy football this week:  both of my games are still up in the air going into MNF.  More tomorrow....
