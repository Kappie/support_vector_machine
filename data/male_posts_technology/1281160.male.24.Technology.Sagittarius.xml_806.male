The reason is... that article is written about a societal taboo...!!! something which has a negative halo attached to its head... and I'm not sure how many would really see the other side of things. I do wonder why some things are considered to be such "bad" to even talk about, while they are nothing but a component of life...  In the recent times, things have changed a bit.. but such things are still looked upon with "disgust" and "fear" ...
