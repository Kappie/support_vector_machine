It was in Bar Buddha in clydebank and like most work nights out I preceeded to get pished :)  It was a good lively group of folk, made better by my old friend Billy being there who I haven't seen in ages :) after a while I decied to go out into Glasgow to see what was happening, it's T in the Park weekend so I was expecting it to be quiet. Luckly my mate karen was out so we headed off to that old faithful the  urlLink catty .   The usually good time was had by all, I met this nice girl called Caroline, had more beer and danced away the night. So a good night was in progress till I found out the night bus that usally gets me home was cancelled and karen had disapeared!   So it was a nice walk home to the vale (10-15 miles, not sure but too long!) or see who I could find to crash at. Unfortuatly I couldn't get a hold of anyone but thanks to a cool adventuring night me and Opal had a while back I knew of a wee maintence cupboard in glasgow you can doss in.  Mind you waking up at 5.30am freezing and hungover in the city centre is not a cool thing, hence my cold and very sore head.
