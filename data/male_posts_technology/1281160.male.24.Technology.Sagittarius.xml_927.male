Instead of spending 10 rupees on a coke or pepsi we could opt for a tender coconut or some fresh juices that is not only good for our health but also adds value to our urge to make up an eco friendly living...  Just think a moment I have made up a resolution and have said a no to soft drinks and in particular coke and pepsi. Bye for now. "A change starts from within"
