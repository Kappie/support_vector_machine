It was, in fact, an application where we should have had more content. The “tray navigation” was a deep applet that allowed one click navigation. The “product and solutions pickers” were an attempt to allow you to drill down a couple of levels into the site without leaving the home page and without experiencing annoying page refreshes along the way. Neither worked as well as they were intended."

 Even Macromedia has to admit that an all Flash site isn't such a good idea. At least they are learning from their mistakes and responding to them.
