It seemed that the owner of the magazine, John Elway (former Denver Broncos quarterback), is a frequent reader of the Autumn Leezy Blog, and he did not appreciate my slanderous comments.  I was sued for libel and instructed by the judge not to post on the blog until the case was resolved.  Well, I won the case but I'm sorry to say that the legal battle caused the company to go bankrupt, and Collier's magazine is no more.  The company's stock went from the most expensive on the market to completely worthless in a matter of minutes.  John Elway is now penniless and hopelessly in debt.  Nobody has seen him for days, and it is believed he is now living as a hermit somewhere in the rocky mountains.  So it's official.  After the longest running publication in magazine history, from its first issue in August 19, 3214 B.C. to June 14, 2004, Collier's magazine is no longer in print.  Hence, it shall not be mentioned again.  According to Collier's magazine, 97.3% of American are VERY happy to hear this.  2.6% said, "Long live Saddam" and .1% said, "A woman should not tell a man what to do."
