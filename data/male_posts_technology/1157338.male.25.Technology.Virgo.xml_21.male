Lots of bugs to stomp and such, and while I wish the initial release was cleaner, I'm pretty proud at my ability to keep up with the onslaught. We have a really great community of players, and their infinite patience is something I apprecaite.  I really think we filled a void with Devil Whiskey, as that new bard's tale game - once the hope of many - turns out to be a clone of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, but with a smarmy bard full of 2-bit humor.  Thus Devil Whiskey is really the only outlet for those who want to play the old style CRPGs, but with a new story, better music and graphics.  It's not selling quite as well as I had hoped, but it is selling none-the-less, and I have a sticky feeling that there are a LOT of peopel waiting for a few patches to come out before they'll buy it.  We're also working up some content expansions over the next few weeks, give them some neato stuff to play through, more interesting levels in my book, as they're all self-contained, and arent' being used to further plot - so they can all have nifty interesting stories, riddles, etc.  I'm still continuing to work at SST, and I enjoy it more all the time. Getting into some really fun problems to solve now, a bit more challening. Also, now that I have several apps out there, I'm getting busier with the rest of the business, fixing problems for them, expanding feature-sets and all that.  Good stuff, feel a lot more useful there now.  Finally, the big cool new news - I'm about to buy a home.  My cousin Shawn has a contract to sell a house for someone, and it's a pretty smooth deal.  They need to dump the mortgage ASAP, so it provides us a good oppurtunity to buy it underneath the appraisal value.  We'll end up bagging about 10% equity on the deal, which is great in my mind.  Only thing standing in our way is the lack of a strong account balance for the past few months. Mom and Dad sent me the rest of the cash they were paying me for my back-log of grad-school expenses, and that's plenty to have in the bank for the mortgage company, but it's simply a matter of how long it's been there, they want to see it there for teh last few months. Which it hasnt' been.  I've been tossing out a lot of cash on paying down debt, and Shanna's really only just started working a steady job again, which is the majority of our extra cash, so for about the last month or so, between her earnings, and the game royalties, our financial situation improved ten-fold.  Now getting the house and dealing with the rental lease is my main worry, and will hopefully all be settled soon.
