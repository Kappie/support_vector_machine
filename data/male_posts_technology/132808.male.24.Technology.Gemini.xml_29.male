As for what you need to do, what you need to do it's get your ass on here all the time and give us the lowdown on whats goin on in your world.  For example:  "Today was the second day I went to the gym.  I jogged for a half-hour.  My warm-up all the time is to shoot jump shots for 20 minutes, then stretch for 10.  Because I don't want what happened last time, where I got bigger and stronger, but I didn't shoot a basketball for six months, and when I finally did, my shots were so off I may as well just thrown the ball at the rim without aiming, Grade Nine-Wes style.  My chest is still sore from the workout on Monday.  I'm thinking about taking a tai chi class while I'm there.  But that's pretty gay.  Then again, there might be ladies in that class.  Then again, I'm not interested in ladies right now.  Hmmm, interesting dilemna.   Maybe I just want to do tai chi..."  See, like that.  And you need to get on that link that Shane put up and make us a punk song with the punk-o-matic.  That's a crazy tool.  It's super fun, even when you're as untalented musically as I am.  Oh, and I'm reviewing Walking Tall and The Punisher.  Anyone who wants to take an afternoon to go see those, give me a shout, either here or on le telephone.  I may be a reviewer now, but I'm still not watching a movie by myself.
