     
      I finally got around to ordering an airport card for my iBook last week, from the Apple store online, but have been playing cat-and-mouse with the delivery people for the last week or so. Anyway, the upshot is that, in a situation that can only be described as cruel irony, I have to stay home tomorrow morning to take delivery of a device intended to give me more mobility. Perhaps this is payback for my PDA comments last week...
