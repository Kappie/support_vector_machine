Then I worked my back pretty hard the day before thinking it would help and it just made it worse.  It's all good now.    I also picked up the rent from my tenant.  I have a section 8 rental property in the city of Pittsburgh.  It's very cool to be a section 8 landlord if your tenant is fully subsidized; that is, if they don't make enough money to pay the rent so that the housing authority pays ALL of it. But, my tenant got a job and now has to pay part of the rent and is frequently late since she started having to do this - really late. So, I asked her to pick a date  she gets paid on the first Friday of each month so that is what she picked.  I told her that if she doesn't pay the rent on time there will be a $50 late charge and I will make hersign an agreement that will allow me to put a lien on her car is there is a problem collecting rent. She paid on time this month, and I think she'll continue to - I would.  I also got some work done - a lot actually, somehow.  Made changes to the software I'm developing and released them to the customer pretty quickly.  And then...  Cake. Kate IM'd me this morning telling me about how Cake was playing at Point State Park for $1.  Nice. I love Cake.  So I made some calls and most of my close friends had plans.  I ended up getting my friends Chris Bokelberg and Scott Nagle to join me and I went down earlier than them to catch a good lawn seat with my blanket.  It was a nice night.  I parked in a garage near the west side of the city on 4th street - it's always $5 there no matter what. I carried my blanket down to the point and saw my good friend, Judy Herilla, there with one of her friends. Very cool.  So, I sat next to them and bought some beer.  We chilled out while we watched the opening band, Good Brother Earl, perform.  That was interesting because one of the band members, Paul Fitzsimmons, was a fraternity brother of mine while I was at the University of Pittsburgh.  We don't hang out anymore, but I see him from time to time.  After Cake played a few songs, Chris and Scott showed up. I really enjoyed the concert and even got a picture with Vince Di Fiore - the man on the trumpet. And he is  the man  on the trumpet, the band would really be incomplete without him.
