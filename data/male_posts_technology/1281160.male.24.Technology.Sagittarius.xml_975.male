I don't know about the poets who earn millions  with their poetry.. But most of the true creators that i know were never after money and as a rule mostly they're indifferent towards "millions"..they seem to know the true function of money in human life and even if they care to take hold of money it has always been disowned by them in an act of generosity as against the planned spending of a Philanthropist towards feeding poor...! It' rare that a Poet who is sensitive to Life will ever try to become a dry Philanthropist..     In the same lines, what does the religionist/spiritualist do apart from his material manifestation of his inward vision... what steps does he take to help lesser fortunate ones also enjoy such a spectacle... shouldn't they enjoy too..??    In manifesting his inward vision, a true religionist/spiritualist gives Himself entirely(what else we can expect ) to the Highest which is the goal of  humanity and he knows that the Problem of  hunger and strife cannot be solved by Philanthrophy until humanity changes itself radically..and works in colloboration with the Divine Will in uplifting humanity from it's present animal moulds to the next levels..and his way of working is itself a  living art and to appreciate any true art requires discipline and training..and this natural discipline can be accessed by all who're in touch with Indian spiritual tradition...   And... just a curious question... What is the purpose of God...??    That depends what's understood by God..? One has to go thru' different conceptions and notions of God before one can truly know what it is..   - Srini
