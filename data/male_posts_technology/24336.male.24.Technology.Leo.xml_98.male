Hop into my editor, make sure that two of the three data cells in that row have their widths set, and now IE has no trouble keeping the black part the same size. Netscape, on the other hand, decided it still likes to resize it.  There goes my browser consistancy!   Anyone have a  urlLink suggestion ?
