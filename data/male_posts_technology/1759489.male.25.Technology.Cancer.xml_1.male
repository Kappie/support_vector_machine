It was really the best weather we've had all year and despite the vicious hail storms and having to work, I managed to spend most of the weekend outside. Friday night I went to the infamous  "Red Mile"   (aka. 17th Ave.) for drinks. Last time I was there with 100,000 Flames fans and a few floozies. Even though there were a lot of people celebrating the Stampede, it wasn't quite the same experience. We ended up at Ming with some friends sweating and drinking.        One of my friends in town from England with her boyfriend and they're on a Bubble-Tea marathon, drinking over 20 in a week and a half. Apparently the Bubble-Tea in London is not easy to find and not very good tasting. In Taiwan (where it originated) and Hong Kong   Bubble-Tea   vendors are everywhere like Starbucks in Vancouver.  I think they just might be more refrshing than beer too.      Saturday night my girlfriend and I hosted a BBQ at Edworthy Park. The BBQ's there are wood-burning, which proved to be quite uncomfortable in the evening heat. On top of that, we forgot to bring wood and so I had to carry a large bag of pine across the length of the park.    This year I vowed not to attend the Stampede because attending it every year for the past 25 years has made me want to hurl. Sunday, the last day of the Stampede, we visited some friends on the outskirts of the grounds who were staging a rather small protest of the Rodeo. It was the Rodeo finals that day and the protestors dropped a massive banner on a hill overlooking the grandstands. Most of the people walking by were true Calgary hicks and hurled unrecognizable profanities at the protesters.   Later that day my girlfriend and I went to the Glenmore Reservoir and rented a Canoe. We both ended up with sunburn. And then it was time for more Bubble-Tea! We ended up sitting on Cresent Hill eating candy overlooking the city until 3am. I ended up taking a few good shots that day of a very green city.      I'm going to Toronto next week for 6 days.  Pretty excited about it.
