Obviously a supermarket offers a wide choice of items, especially in the wake of  Tesco style megastores which also hold limited DIY/Electrical  items.          So the topic for this week is how to approach  getting into and out of a supermarket that could, quite literally, be crawling  with the living undead, also, what do you take? What do you leave?  The choice is vast, but space is also probably at a premium.          Different tactics will no doubt be needed if  dealing with an out of town rather than centrally based stores.          For those not a member of 'When Zombies Attack'  drop me a mail and I'll drop you an invite. Remember, preparation for the  inevitable will keep you alive.          best wishes          Jody
