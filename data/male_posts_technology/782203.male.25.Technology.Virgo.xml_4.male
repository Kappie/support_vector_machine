The movie was excellent, and it was really refreshing to see Tom Hanks take on a role of someone who is so bent on revenge that he doesnt care who he kills to get it, there was one scene where i was pretty sure he wouldnt kill the guy so i was kinda surprised when he did. However , i still prefer his previous feature American Beauty which i watched a few days ago, it was really funny and also every character in the movie was really engrossing to watch with their own little quirks.
