The article doesn't say when it'd due but apparently there is a clue on the cover of the  urlLink Da Vinci code  which gives some information about the new book.  He also said he left out what he felt would be the most controversial plot device - not for fear of it's controversy but because he felt it was flimsy. So what was so controversial? He was going to have Jesus surviving the crucifuxion. Which reminds me of something I've been trying to find out for ages.  I remember reading a sci-fi book as a fairly young child (9-10) where a Jewish scientist goes back in time, discovers Jesus is a retard and takes his place. He then goes through lots of the things mentioned in the Bible and ultimately gets crucified. Does anyone know what this book is and who wrote it?   via  urlLink boingboing
