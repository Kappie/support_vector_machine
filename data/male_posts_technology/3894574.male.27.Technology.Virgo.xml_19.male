Immediately after I loaded all my supplies and tools into a unit I was working on today, the skies went very dark. Moments later... cats and dogs. At this point here are my choices. 1. stretch out the work I have to do in there and stay inside all day. 2. Pray for a few moments of clear sky at just the right time so I can remove all my stuff and get the trash thrown out. Or C. sack it up and embrace my ringing wet destiny.
