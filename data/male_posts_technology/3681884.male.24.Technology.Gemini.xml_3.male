Now, I usually roll my eyes and tune out when this man opens his mouth, but I was real bored so I continued to watch even after he appeared on screen.  For this reason, I decided long ago that I wouldn't go see his new documentary, Fahrenheit 9/11.  The concept alone sounded vulgar.  Somewhere in the interview, they showed a clip from the film that was actually a clip from a news interview of Bush on vacation making an ass of himself.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I totally agree with the invasion of Iraq.  But Bush really annoys me, and Moore stated in the interview that although he's a film maker first, the film is a personal attack on Bush and his policies.  That has made me rethink seeing his film.  Seeing this film may end up really annoying me, but the man has peaked my curiosity.
