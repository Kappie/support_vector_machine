Although no such action has occurred,  urlLink this article  reports on a group offering their services just in case an action occurs.  What action?  Well, seems some Pennsylvania pastors are concerned that if they preach against homosexuality it will be tagged as hate speech which is an actionable offense.  Has this happened?  No.  Is it likely to happen?  No.  If it did happen, would it get far given the extents to which the Supreme Court went just so it wouldn't have to decide if it was okay to coerce children to say "under God"?  Of course not.  But better to bemoan yet another "attack by the liberals" on their freedoms.    Hey, preacher, never mind what the law says for a moment.  Ask your self the now-cliche question: What would Jesus do?  And before you answer that, first remember what he said about homosexuals.  In case you don't recall, let me refresh your memory.  According to the Gospel of Matthew, he said nothing about homosexuals.  According to the Gospel of Mark, he said nothing about homosexuals.  According to the Gospel of Luke, he said nothing about homosexuals.  And according to the Gospel of John, he said nothing about homosexuals.  Nothing, nothing, nothing and nothing.  This is the man who ate with sinners, scolded the Pharisees, and told the rich man the odds didn't look good for him to get into heaven.  And yet not a single word about the nancyboys?  Hmm, I wonder if there's a lesson to be learned there?  The question hinted at  urlLink in the article  is not whether or not the Bible might be considered "hate literature".  Of course it won't.  But there are passages which could be highjacked to support some pretty ugly things.  It's happened before (i.e. slavery, oppression of women) and it is happening now with regard to homosexuality.    I'll just have to pray for those poor, misguided Pennsylvanian ministers.
