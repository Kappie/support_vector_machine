First, the iPod was formatted using the newer Mac filing system which is all well and good when listening to music or syncing to a Mac, but I happen to be an all-pc guy (hope to change that soon) and so does Andrew H. It seemed that the only thing to do was to reformat the iPod with a FAT32 filing system and reload the OS. I was reluctant to do that because I wanted to upload some of Brady's music onto my computer as well, and reformatting it obviously erases all the data, so that wouldn't work. I started experimenting with random pc-based apps that allow communication with Mac formatted media. Finding little to no success in this, I was about to give up until I found Xplay, the app that made iPods for pc uses possible when the only format you could encode an iPod in was Mac. I installed that, but unfortunately, there was a data transfer problem in which the entire computer would lockup and eventually bluescreen. I retried this approach twice, but decided to discard since I was getting nowhere fast. I downloaded iPod OS 2.1 and used the installed to reformat the iPod. This took substantially less time that I had expected and I figured I was home free from this point on. Not so. My firewire port was evidently messed up, more often than not, it would only allow a small portion of a song to transfer before giving me some type of error message. I eventually gave up on that and decided to switch to usb, but that had its own complications: first, the high-speed (usb 2.0) controller wasn’t loaded, so the connection was heinously slow. Second, the usb port does not power the iPod, but the firewire does, so I had to concoct an elaborate set of steps in order to reconnect the iPod whenever I wanted to transfer something: plug in the firewire, take five minutes (because the comp. kept freezing during this time) to disable it, and then plug in the usb and hope that everything worked. If not, I would have to restart the iPod and sometimes manually power down the entire computer and restart it.
