There'll be a no. of reservists and some active personnel participating. I've only just realised I'm going to have to miss the training at Siglap then. Argh!! That is unless someone gives me a lift down immediately after the run. Drat!  Anyway, we did a full run-down (900m) twice, followed by 100m sprints thrice and a final run-down again. After each sprint, the losing team (we were divided into A and B) will need to do 10 push-ups. All 3 times, my team (B) kanna pumped ... haha. For the last time, Team A joined in as well. This training run showed me that the reservist officers have a great deal of endurance in them despite their age. For the first 2 run downs and sprints, I was able to keep in front one of the older reservist. But the final sprint and run-down, he was in front of me and I was all but depleted both physically and mentally. It was a truly great session that morning.  I think besides feeling tired, everyone left that morning feeling really good.
