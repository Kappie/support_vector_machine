But they are going to be pretty rudimentary at first. Wait until the next-gen devices out in early 2004 and capable of handling video streaming and other multimedia apps."

 I can't wait for the Tablet PC and Mira. There has been a lot of hype surrounding the Tablet PC, but everything I have seen and heard, it looks promising.
