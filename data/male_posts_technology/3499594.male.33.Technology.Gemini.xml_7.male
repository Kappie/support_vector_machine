For the morning, we got up and I managed to clean the bathrooms, vacuum/shampoo the carpets, and clean the floor. Put a tent up in the back yard, mowed the backyard (it was too wet but had to be done) but left the front untouched. I was trying to get everything ready to grill. We then went to T-ball prior to noon. The kids did well, in fact all of them. I played dugout dad. Amazing the hour went by quick when you keep the batting line in order and continue to tell 14 kids whose next up.   When we started back I noticed the black clouds coming our way and commented it might rain.   Headed home and started to grill. As I get started it started to splatter here and there with rain. Crap, got to move the grill and my stuff from the back to the garage. I get everything moved in and my father-in-law came up to help get the cooking started, and the rain starts coming in pretty good.   We cook regardless but during the cooking the rain becomes a storm and the streets look like a river. I had to literally move the grill and tables in a little because the wind was blowing so hard as to hit us with the rain. My family calls to cancel because they said it’s pissing and pouring and flooding outside where they are (parents are separated and two different locations). My brother ended up a no call/no show. My wife’s mom and aunt made it in, rain and all.   So we still had a good feast, bratwurst, polish and Italian sausage, 7 layer salad, spaghetti salad, hamburgers, hotdogs, corn on the cob and vegetables that was marinated in Italian dressing all night. I stuffed myself.   The rain finally stopped and Noah parked the ark. I find out today (Sunday) we had 3.5 to 4 inches in that 2 hour downpour.   The kids hadn’t been able to spend the night with their Nana and Papa so we let them go.  I asked my wife what she wanted to do tonight (it’s nearly 7 now) since we hadn't expected a night alone. 'I don't know, rest and relax.' was the answer. So I ran to the movie place to rent a couple of movies. We watched '50 first dates', with Drew Barrymore and Adam Sander, and then I watched 'Spartan', with Val Kilmer. Both ended up better than I thought they would be.   After that, we pretty much crashed. Real exciting, huh? But it was nice to be able to relax and simply watch a movie together.
