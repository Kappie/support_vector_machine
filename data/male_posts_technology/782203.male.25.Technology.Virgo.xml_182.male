Me: No I'm just going out. Dad: You going to work is it ? Me :Noooo. I'm just GOING OUT.  Sigh its kinda sad when you go out so rarely that when you DO go out, your parents immediately assume you are going to visit your sis or going to work.  God I really need a life.   Damm Man U lost; I switched off the TV after Owen scored the 2nd goal making it 2-0 in the 87th(?) minute. Can't believe we lost to such a crappy team like Liverpool. Damm Veron flopped once again arrgggh I'm so pissed rite now.
