From Saying 2000 Was Stolen    This news from Capitol Hill, the House has voted to bar any federal official from requesting that the United Nations formally observe the November presidential elections. During the discussion on the vote, the Republican-led House took the unusual move of striking a word from the Congressional Record after Democratic Congress member Corrine Brown said Republicans stole the 2000 election. Brown said to Republicans "I come from Florida, where you and others participated in what I call the United States coup d'etat. We need to make sure it doesn't happen again. Over and over again after the election - when you stole the election - you came back here and said, 'Get over it.' No, we're not going to get over it. And we want verification from the world." After Brown's comment, the presiding officer of the House ruled that Brown's words violated a House rule that members should not accuse other members of committing a crime. The House then voted along party lines to strike the word "stole" from the Congressional Record.
