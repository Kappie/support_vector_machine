Jackie, in case you wanted to know, the topics that go together are: Self and Family + Environment Health + Education Youth Culture + Future Plans Anyway, for the rest of the morning Tom, Doe, Alex and I sat on the grass and had a laugh at Mr Weston who seemed quite embarrased that we all knew about the poster- nice one Nicki! Alex then walked home, and we went to my house via the chip shop, and had chip butties! I can't believe that Tom and Doe hasve never had chip butties! They weren't the best I've ever had cos really you need thicker bread, more butter and hotter chips, lol! But next time, we have to have fish finger sandwiches, they are just the best!! Bananas are ucky in sandwiche tho! Anyway I've got to do some revision tonight seeings as I've been out all day, lol! See y'all later guys (hope your art is going ok Nicki!!)
