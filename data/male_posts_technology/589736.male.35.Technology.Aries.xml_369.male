All in favor of having the blogs post in sequential order from top to bottom (instead of bottom to top) so that it's easier to read, say "Aye!" (make sure you post it on the blog as well instead of just saying it...).  All opposed; well, just keep your opinion to yourself...  Kidding!  If you like the bottom to top order the way it is now, say "Nay".  I for one vote to change it.  So AYE!
