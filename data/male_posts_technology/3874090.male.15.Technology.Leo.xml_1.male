    
       Blogged for the very first time.  Yes indeed this is my very first blog.  Two short notes on my blog: 1. If I criticise ya DEAL WITH IT. 2. Enjoy my blog, learn from it or whatever. It just a place for me to vent my frustrations online. At the end of each blog I will do this:  This will be my favourite album/song at time of writing>>> Trax:  This will be the last movie I watched>>> Movie: This will be the last piece of food I ate>>> Munch: This will be wher I place any links to websites or news articles I found interesting.  Peace Out Readers, l8rs! Luke
