Considering that the car was produced in 1992, trying to find information about it online is interesting.  Most of the sites that have info are either all-encompasing sites that cover a certain aspect of all cars (safety info, for example), or they are some enthusiast site just for that car or type of car (thus a third generation Camaro).  I finally found that my base V6 engine only requires regular unleaded fuel.  I know the Chevy used to have a 4-cyl Camaro and that would obviously take regular so I figured it was possible that the V6 was mapped for midgrade (89 octane).  Nope, just 87 octane.
