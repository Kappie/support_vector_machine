From their website:   MISSION STATEMENT  Operation Truth will educate the American public about the truth of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan from the perspective of the soldiers who have experienced them first-hand. We will provide returning veterans with national, regional, and local podiums from which they will expose the preventable hardships that they endured as a result of failures at the top levels of leadership. We intend to publicize how poorly-planned policies and approaches have manifested themselves as problems on the front lines and back at home. We will act domestically to protect our troops and to aid them in their fight to protect us.  Operation Truth's battle does not end when all of the warriors come home. Our relevance will continue indefinitely, addressing the ripple-effects of this war on the Servicemembers and their families for decades.  I think this is a great idea, and I hope they find some willing participants. More than just finding willing participants however, I hope they find participants from across the entire spectrum of ranks. I find that one group of soldiers will have a completely different view of how a particular battle went compared to how their superiors viewed it. Also, I hope that this will be an eye opener to all those flag waving morons who would scream SUH-PORT ARE TROOPS at the top of their lungs if you let them, not remembering that it was their  monkey  boy who put them into peril in the first place.
