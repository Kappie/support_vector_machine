If you can't afford them, steal them.  Drumroll, please... *Ahem* In no particular order, here are my top 3 favorite CD's (at the moment)...   Brand New, "Your Favorite Weapon"  blink-182, "blink-182"  Sparta, "Porcelain"   Now don't get me wrong, I like all the CD's I have, but those three are definite standouts.  Which brings me to something else I've wanted to blog about... This year (as in school year, or whatever), I want to go to a lot of concerts.  I definitely want to go to a Brand New concert sometime, and Relient K if they go to the whereabouts of Seattle.  Blink might be a little too crazy, but maybe them too.  I just realized that I like concerts and I haven't been to as many as I'd like.  Hmm, right now I'm gonna go to the Showbox's website and comment on what I see... hold on...  Ok, absolutely nothing in the year 2004 interests me at the Showbox.  Hmm... what other venues are there?  Crap if I know... see, if i went to as many concerts as I should be going to, I would know these kinda things.  I'll research some more sometime.  Right now I'm gonna play poker over at good ol' pogo.com.  Your mission: buy my favorite CD's and comment on my blog.  Adieu.
