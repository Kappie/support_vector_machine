If you develop a web site of any practical size using MS tech, you're likely to want to use SQL Server...until you start pricing it - $4999 per cpu for the cheapest retail verison.  And the 'free' MSDE just isn't an acceptible solution for my uses because I am likely to have enough traffic to activate the 'governer'. Plus it's useless without management tools.  I mean, to me, the price of SQL Server is just so hard to digest when free software like PostGres can be made to work with a little effort ( it literally took me 1 day to set up a Linux box and get Postgres working with my .Net based web site).  Don't get me wrong...I think MS SQL Server is great, I love it. And I know the SQL team has to eat.  But so do I.  Would Microsoft every consider releasing an uncrippled version of SQL Server for a monthly usage fee or something more digestible than coughing up $5k / cpu?  IMHO, I think MySQL is the reason MS changed the licensing terms of the MSDE to be 'more attractive'. The pressure of competing with free stuff has to be on the minds of the SQL team...if not them, the people who set the prices.  It is my hope that some day MS realizes that when a developer is reading  urlLink this document  of the approriate uses of MSDE, it's easy to just throw your hands up and say, "screw it, I'm using PostGres, or MySQL".  Do you hear us Microsoft? We WANT to use SQL Server for our pet projects and upstarts...but you're overcharging us and the crippled MSDE just doesn't cut it. OK, for me at least anyway...When I get rich, I won't care :)
