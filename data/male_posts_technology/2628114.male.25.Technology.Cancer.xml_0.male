The place was packed so I limited myself to the stairclimbers rather than wait in line for another machine.  I did a hard 20 minute climb totaling 133 floors (according to that machine).  I then did a slower 5 minute climb to cool down some.  I finished by doing a 15 minute session at 75% difficulty on the speedwork setting.  I always laugh at the warnings you will find on workout machines.  My favorite is probably "Stop immediately if you feel pain."  If this were true, the machine would never be used and people would never workout.  My quads and calves were burning by the end and my shirt was soaked so I know it was a great workout.  My legs, and especially knee, felt great.  I am unbelievably anxious to get back out running.  My knee feels like it could be ready.  I would have tried a quick 5 minute run on a treadmill tonight, but the machines were full with a line of people waiting.  We'll see what tomorrow holds.
