    
        I have some questions.    Could God use me to change someone's life?  To bring someone to Himself?  Could He use me to teach someone something they didn't know before?    Could God use me to write a computer program?  To cut the grass?  Clip my fingernails?  Could He use me to write a science fiction novel?  How about to read one?    Thank you.
