I can imagine the shapes they are going to make, but never get to see them realized.  It always interests me to see how they seem to meet a wall and stop moving where the air pressure and currents change due to the shape of the balcony.  That's where the shapes begin to get interesting, and I toy with it with every puff, trying to invent something new.  The smoke flows in a dirty grey with a tinge of yellow, a color that just screams UNHEALTHY, with little cobwebs trailing off from the boundaries.  The motion sensor light goes out and that poisonous little cloud shape seems much less malignant in the dark.  The deck itself always evinces the thought of brown in my head when I think of it.  The brown leatherette cover over the barbeque, glistening in the rain, the brown deck door and the brown railings.  The brown flower pot with a tinge of green and more brown inside of it, and the brown shingles on the rooflet below my bedroom window.  Even the siding on the apartment is brown, although it's a greying wood brown, and the gutters are brown too.  The gutters are actually the exact same color as the barbeque cover, and even glisten the same way in the humidity.  The only things that aren't brown are the aforementioned plants and the greyish, dirty white flooring (soft in places, and probably not very safe as the brown wood underneath it slowly rots away).  The air smells fresh from the recent rain, and the city is fairly quiet tonite.  I can hear Solitation rustling about in the distance, but I know it isn't me she's coming to visit tonite; she's just letting me know she's there.  The neighbourhood is mostly asleep, having had a good weekend and now getting ready to go back to the grind tomorrow.  I breathe out slowly, the smoke evacuating from my lungs to create more shapes on the air currents.  A slight breeze starts our little wind chime to singing it's melancholy little tune, and I pause to listen.  I breathe the fresh air in, leaving the cigarette in the resting position.  As I breathe out I can see just the slightest tinge of steam forming, but it's no where near as interesting or as  organic as the cigarette smoke.  I step out into the range of the motion sensor light to activate it again, take another puff of my deathstick, and try to form some new shapes.
