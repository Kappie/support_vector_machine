Freedom is necessary in every relationship... I dun wanna tie you down, but when does it becomes a restriction and when does it become negligence... I really wanna know...  Compatibility is an issue which appears over time... some people get together to find a substitute... some people get together cos others tell them that they should... some others get together because of lust... there are others which get together because they feel comfortable with each other... others, may be a combination of some of the cases above...  Do not ever think that you are not compatible with someone as everyone should stand an equal chance... since you are here now, you dun even need to think of whether you are compatible with me cos I dun wanna lose you...  Something that just appeared in my mind... Even if I have to face you every single second of my life, I will never get sick of looking at you cos you are my dear...  Objective: Treat you so good until you cannot be without me...
