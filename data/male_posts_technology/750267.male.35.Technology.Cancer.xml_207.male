I had been there a couple of times as a guest of my sister-in-law, and I was always intrigued by the size of the place. I never really had a chance to walk around and browse though. Now that I have signed up, I plan to explore the place more thoroughly.  So far, the biggest deals we have found have been on cheese. Yes, I did just say cheese. For instance, my current favourite chesse,  urlLink Mini Babybel , is at least half the price at Costco than it is at Loblaws. Mmm...  Also, my wife found a huge  urlLink wheel of Brie  which was also half the price of the big grocer's. Part of the savings might be the fact that you have to buy more in order to get the savings.
