Yesterday I had project presentation.I am the PL of my team ,so I did the presentation.It went on well.From tomm I have my oracle course.Though kishore place is 2 buildings apart..we used to see each other once in a week.             Hope I will not blog often for the next one month. Swetha is in bangalore.She came here on monday.If possible bangalore'ans can arrange a meet in this week or next week.But I am not sure about myself since I might go home this week.            I haven't met ranjini yet ...'coz I cudn't get an appointment from her to meet her since she is so busyyyy.. Valli  Sindhu ,glad to read your msg's here ...  Cheers... Kavi
