We got some black cats and stuff, and it is legal to do stupid stuff when you live outside of the city.  For the fourth of July my family is going to have a BBQ in North Ritchland Hills so if any of my old friends want to see me, try to find me. Then we are taking Harrison and Brando home with us. So we can stay up all night and talk in the garage.  And just to rant for a few seconds.  I was always told to start the trends, do not follow them.  And I do just that, I made a weblog the first day of November last year and it seems a lot of people I used to know in FtWorth have a xanga or a blog, and simply they are making the service look horrible. Most of them dont use proper grammer and are still talking in shorthand in which they learned from AIM.  Just remember, I was the first.
