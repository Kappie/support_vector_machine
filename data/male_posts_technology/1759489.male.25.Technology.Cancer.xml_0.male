       
         I started my new workout regime today.  This regime seems more legitimate than my previous ones, which for the past two weeks has been no regime at all.  The method I am using is one I stumbled across on the 'net called HST, or more specifically  urlLink HyperTrophy Strength Training .  It is based on scientific research, and after reading about it I felt blinded -- by science.    Today was the day I figure out my maximum loads for each exercise.  Having not been to the gym for two weeks I felt nearly dead after working out.  I'm sure tomorrow when I wake I will be unable to move a thing.  I have lost 8 pounds in the past two months, mostly due to my diet.  Now I am ready to build up some muscle.  Sitting at my computer working all day is incentive enough to get up and do something physical.  We'll see if I can last the summer on this.
