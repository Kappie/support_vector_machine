Then again, I probably would have had to read a lot and THINK and write papers.    I think about doing all that now, and I think, Ug.  I hate writing papers.  Introduction, 3 main points, discussion, conclusion.  And that's the basic paper.  Then there's the more advanced papers that just go on and on.  Supporting evidence.  What is it called with the footnotes ... I'll probably remember the word in another post ... where you reference works in your bibliography ... APA style.  Ah, I forget.  Too much LSD when I was younger I guess.    Now that was a good drug.  Hallucinations, staying awake all night, just visualizing cool things.  Fucking up my brain I guess.  But not addictive.  I remember going for walks in the neighborhood with friends while tripping.  So cool how the senses were so fucked up, or highly attuned, I never could be sure which.  I remember how different pockets of air smelled differently and had distinctly different temperatures.  Oh, and did I mention the hallucinations.  I was so fucking shy back then, so introverted.  I think I was probably trying to cope with all the changes going on in my life.  Between my parents divorce, their re-marriages, moving around the country, trying to make new friends.  I never was too good at that.  But no, no heroin -- I'd never try anythng addictive.  I liked oral drugs.  LSD on the tiny squares of paper.  Mushrooms once or twice.  Why can't I remember how many times?  Friends tried to get me to do marijuana first, but I had no interest in the smoke.  Oral is so much easier.  I guess LSD is bit more powerful, though.  The last trip I had though was bad ...  real bad ... where I was alone and depressed and feeling suicidal.  That was back in college when I tripped with a guy I hardly knew.  I thought were going to vegetate in his apartment all night ... instead, 30 minutes into our trip, he said, "let's go to a party!"  Just what I wanted -- to be around a bunch of strangers -- I probably would have felt even more alone there.  Or maybe my life would have changed dramatically in some distinct way.  Instead I walked back to my apartment.  Three other college people were walking across the library parking lot and made fun of me for being by myself.  Maybe they saw my dilated eyes.  Needless to say it didn't help my self esteem.  I went back to my aparment and sat in the dark listening to depeche mode's violator album.  Ah those were the days.  Back when I was still writing poetry.  Now I haven't written anything in nearly 5 years.  How can I still call myself a poet?  Will I ever hear the muse talking to me again?  Well that post went in a different direction than I expected.
