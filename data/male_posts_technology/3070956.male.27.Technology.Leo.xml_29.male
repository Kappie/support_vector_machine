Today has been long enough as it is and so I'm exhausted... I got up early to clean up from the part we had last night, and then me, Rob and Jon Cho went to eat lunch in the strip district.  We went to Rolands and I had a lobster roll... it was pretty good.  They were so hung over hahaha.  sigh     I could go right to sleep... but I'm considering watching a movie and I do need to find that certificate... but I also have to be up really early tomorrow. ick.   Then I went to Sandcastle and bought a season pass... now I can go all I want.  I have to get this body tan for Trinidad, you know. It's gonna be hot, hot, hot. Chris and Scott have passes, and I met Heidi there and she got one too.. so I figure I'll have enough company to justify it.  EEsh... I'm so tired and lazy.  I'm going to calm down on the drinking front this week.  I'm gonna focus on work and working out.  I'm convinced that I can gain a lot of muscle quickly in the mext 2 months or so.  I am already seeing a diference with the working out that I've been doing already - that in itself is motivating.  I'm about to be away again for a while and I need to find a place to work out in NJ....hrmmm...  Ok. Goodnight.    -Ryan Riehle
