There was a brief period of glorious sunshine at about 4pm this afternoon, but since about 5pm it's been simply horrible! Dioesn't crap weather just make you feel awful? I really hope it doesn't do this next Friday, cos a) we're gonna get our outfits soaked, and b) my hair'll get ruined!! But hey! I've got the camera sorted now, mum says I can borrow hers cos it's easy to load and stuff, and she's got me a couple of spare films for lots of snapping away! They're gonna be my last memories of Warlingham, so they'd better be good ones, he he! I am so excited about next week, I can't wait! eveyrone I know has to write in my book, plus put their phone numbers and addresses and stuff! And I'm gonna get some of my faveourite teachers to write in there too, ha ha! So nothing too rude in their guys! And of course camera is coming in every day, to be put to good use! THink I should have a couple of good piccies from today at lunch, all of us girlies!  Anyway, tomorrow I am going to work, again! Then I will probably try a bit of revision in the evening. Sunday I;'m revising and then I've got a rehersal for a concert that I'm playing in next Sunday. Does anyone want to come? I know you probably all don't, but just in case you want to find out what I work my guts out for all the time, you can come along to All Saint's Church in Sanderstead at 3pm, Sunday 11th May to watch me play 1st in a sextet that I'm playing. But none of you lot will proably wanna come, but hey. LAst ever chance to see JoJo in a concert, ha ha! Other than that, not much, sounds sad but I'm really lookng forward to getting back on Tuesday so I can see eveyrbody and jump up and down with excitement and stuff! Lastly, are we gonna have a group photo at the ball? Or shall we just go in 2s or 3s? I don't think that we'll get eveyrone from our gruop in, so maybe it would be best to decide to go in 5s or summink? I dunno, I'll talk to donna see what she wants to do! Talk to y'all later guys
