And I thought to myself, that I have certainly come a long way since the day when a gal I fancied told me I was invading her space. Then the friend told me that maybe I should make my presence felt to other women instead and make them feel better as well, cos she was feeling a lot more better so she felt I didn't need to be around her anymore. Sigh she's so selfless, gotta love her.
