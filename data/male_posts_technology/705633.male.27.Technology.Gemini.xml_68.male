Recently, as I am sure many of you readers have too, I asked myself about the possibility of a third world war. Given the current climate of political conditions, and the uprising of many terrorist organisations, it seems there it is only a matter of when, not if, this catastrophic event would occur. To give myself piece of mind, I decided to browse the net to find information on what could safeguard me during this time of unrest. To my relief I discovered the US military forces, ever present and always ready to pick up the torch of freedom if some Nation or Organisation decide to take it from us. But should rest easy? America may have the largest armed forces in the world, but as this article shows, it also has the dumbest!  This is the transcript of the ACTUAL radio conversation of a US naval ship with Canadian authorities off the coast of Newfoundland in October 1995. Radio conversation released by the Chief of Naval Operations 10-10-95.  Canadians: Please divert your course 15 degrees the South to avoid a collision.  Americans: Recommend you divert your course 15 degrees the North to avoid a collision.  Canadians: Negative. You will have to divert your course 15 degrees to the South to avoid a collision.  Americans: This is the Captain of a US Navy ship. I say again, divert YOUR course.  Canadians: No. I say again, you divert YOUR course.  Americans: THIS IS THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER USS LINCOLN, THE SECOND LARGEST SHIP IN THE UNITED STATES' ATLANTIC FLEET. WE ARE ACCOMPANIED BY THREE DESTROYERS, THREE CRUISERS AND NUMEROUS SUPPORT VESSELS. I DEMAND THAT YOU CHANGE YOUR COURSE 15 DEGREES NORTH, I SAY AGAIN, THAT'S ONE FIVE DEGREES NORTH, OR COUNTER- MEASURES WILL BE UNDERTAKEN TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THIS SHIP.  Canadians: This is a lighthouse... Your call!  Now peeps, here is the question, just how fucking stupid do you have to be, to command the second biggest ship in the American fleet! And more to the point, with modern sonar and radar, not to mention EYES, how much of a FUCKING MORON do you have to be not to spot a fucking lighthouse!!!!!  Anyway, speaking of another bunch of dumb US wankers, Microsoft. (Did you like the transition there? I thought that was smooth :-)  Microsoft has recently come under fire for there terrible operating systems. Weather you are using 95, 98, 2000, NT, XP or even good old 3.1, the windows OS has been failing users in every area. Multiple crashes, blue screens and the inability to download porn easily have made many people switch their OS to something more stable. Just a few hours before this post the Microsoft Press Office unveiled their new, and possibly best, OS to date. They have claimed that it will revolutionise the modern PC.  Now you may be sceptical of this, given their track record who could blame you. But I have lucky enough to review this latest offering for the Microsoft Corporation, and can safely say without a doubt, that it is the best, most bug-free, and most stable version of Windows there is. And more than likely ever will be. But don't just take my world for it, check out the new  urlLink WindowsRG!!!
