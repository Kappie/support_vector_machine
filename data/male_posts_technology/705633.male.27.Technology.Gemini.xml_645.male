We ordered a load of gear from  urlLink http://www.capoeira-shop.com  and it rocks. We look like little Luke Skywalkers now, running around in all white. John also ordered a pair in rasta colours. That combined with his ever-increasing afro will mean he'll be spending the summer looking like huggy bear.  The only part that's not so great about Capoeira is pulling giant chunks of skin off your feet when you have blisters. Good job I ordered some foot balm stuff too. We are all coming on well though, it's going to be a great summer on the beach.  I'm off to New Zealand again shortly, meeting up with the chick, chilling out, loading up on cheap clothes and blowing away possums on a hunting tour. I don't really like hunting as a rule, but I think it's OK with possums for the following reasons:  1) Possums are a scourge in New Zealand. They destroy forests and crops and bankrupt farmers. 2) People make stuff out of Possums. The last time I went, the Maori guy sold the fur for gloves and scarves and made granulated pet food out of the Possum. 3) They are fucking ugly. They look like some kind of aborted rat-beaver cross breed.  So it's not much different from fishing really, except using a high-powered sniper rifle instead of a thermos and a rod.    A Possum, yesterday.  Last weekend myself and Baity went to the premiere of a short film that his friend, Andy Evans had made. It's called "Dream Time" and was about a boy that is stuck in a dream and has to make it back to his bed before he can wake up. It was shown at the Aero Club to appreciative crowd. I was really impressed with it, I'll see if we can get rights to host it here for all to see.   I will shortly be moving Toaster Files off Blogger and onto a alternate site, in preparation for another summer of drunken-hijinx.
