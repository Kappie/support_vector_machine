I’ve been there a month but I’m starting to look for another job. I am on a really big kick of escaping right now. I’ll tell you why in a little bit.  I graduated from DePauw University in May. College was not something I excelled at. I have an attention problem with academia. (I can't lie. I can't pay attention to much of anything) I did okay in my computer classes but they weren’t hard anyway. I always got so excited for my other classes but several weeks into them I got bored and then depressed. I hated feeling trapped by deadlines and artificial stress. Would the world have ended if I didn’t get my paper in by 5PM? I doubt it.  College gave me a lot of things: some friends, some acquaintances, an ex-wife. That’s what this is all about. I got married on August 2nd 2003. That’s right, one year ago today, it isn’t ironic, it just all crashed down on me yesterday.  I guess I shouldn’t call her an ex-wife; she’s really just an estranged wife. My lawyer seems to be a little slow in getting me out of this marriage. I want to have her erased from my mind Eternal Sunshine style. Teri is my Clementine.  Not all of this can come out today. I must be slow and diligent until everything is out. This is for therapy.
