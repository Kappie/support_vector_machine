Aaron, the guy I climb with, got a suitable tongue lashing from the staff, and made damn sure that I had no slack in the rope for the rest of the workout. Hahaha, he was pretty stressed about it, but I can understand that, I mean, your negligence almost seriously injured someone. You can tell I'm not too mad about it, I just never get that angry about anything really. It's not worth it. Like I said, I let it go, and we kept climbing.  I am so excited to go climbing for 3 days at E-rock the weekend after next. I found out that we'll be renting a hotel room instead of camping out. Which is good, because it's way too hot outside for camping right now.  I've got a birthday coming up on the first of September. Just thought you might be interested in knowing. Hopefully, I'll live to see it.  I'm getting kind of sick of Modest Mouse now that I've listened to tracks #3, 4, 13 over and over and over. I even heard #3 played as bumper music on a talk radio show.   After all they shared could he simply say, "no". After all they shared he turned away from her to go. She said she wouldn't cry. That was really just a lie.   That was just the vocals playing right now on the stream I'm listening to. Now you can listen along too! Damn, aren't you enjoying my stream of conciousness writing this morning?  Let's see, anything else? Oh, I'm getting a love seat, a coffee table, and a kitchen table without chairs tonight from a girl I climb with. The couch is really comfortable, but the upholstery is pretty fugly. I'll be going to WAL*MART for a couch cover for sure.  I was at Coffee Station the other night, and there was this fairly attractive girl strandling the trunk by the stairs. Let's just say that I wouldn't have minded being the trunk, ok? So, I walked over and started talking to her. Then she smiled at me, oops, braces. What is it with me, and picking out the young? Anyway, I finished the conversation up, and walked away. I just needed to confess that, and lacking my best friend, this deserted street corner will have to do. Thanks.    Oh, I just added a link to an Atom feed on the sidebar to your right.
