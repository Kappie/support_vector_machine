After moving out of my parent's house, they retired to a sleepy little hamlet (that's the poetic way of saying "recession affected hell-hole") in Upstate New York. It's about 260 miles North (by) North West (forgive the Hitchcock reference, I find this entry a little depressing to write and need to amuse myself anyway I can); my father loved to fish and a couple years before they retired he discovered the virtues of salmon fishing. So off they went. I have to admit the first couple years were nice, I obviously love my parents but never really felt connected to them. I know my parents love all their kids but their method of expressing their love was always lost on me. Now, before you think I am a whining baby complaining of "not being loved"; keep reading, because that's not what I am saying. I come from a middle class family with two working parents. They worked their asses off to support their family and make sure we were always dressed, warm and fed. I totally understand how when they would come home from work they just didn't want to deal with their brood of five. Hey, I have one cat and I love him to death but some days I just don't want to deal with him. And he's just a cat - he doesn't deliberately misbehave, fuck up, over eat, whore around, use drugs, get drunk, get in trouble with the law, etc etc etc.  The first few years after they moved away it was pretty cool. I felt the burden of my parents lifted....sure there would be the obligatory "when are you coming to visit" queries but I could deflect them pretty well and get by with visiting maybe once during the summer, Thanksgiving, and maybe Easter. Even during these regularly infrequent visiting years I was still seeing my parents more often then my siblings. Actually one of my brothers passed away in '88 so obviously he is off the hook.  Around Feb/Mar of 2002 we found out my Dad had cancer of the colon and his prognosis was six months. From that point on I was visiting every other weekend. Every other weekend. Aside from the horror and hell of seeing your parent deteriorate on a regular basis, aside from the constant stress of knowing every other week you had to drive 520 miles round trip, aside from feeling you had to keep up a chipper demeanor in front of your parents, aside from having your job eliminated and and go through an interdepartmental transfer not knowing if it was going to be permanent or just pro-longing the inevitable layoff; despite having worked for the same company for 15 years..... The last six weeks my dad was in the hospital, drugged out on pain killers...not even recognizing me, calling me by my brother's name. (I am letting that go, despite the fact I was the one who made the bi-weekly pilgrimage). He passed away on a Friday as I was driving up on a regular bi weekly visit, not quite making six months. When he went I initially thought "well great, now maybe I can get back to a normal life". I think I am still waiting. The next couple of days after my dad's death I was dutiful son/chauffeur driving my mom to the funeral parlor, florists, hospital, whatever errands needed to be run. For a couple months after his death I continued the bi-weekly visits to make sure she was ok and to help in whatever way I could around the house. Typically my last visit of the year is Thanksgiving as I steadfastly refuse to drive that far Upstate New York in the snowy season. Luckily (for me) I get away with it. I start up the visiting season at Easter (I hope you don't find it too ironic that I open and close visiting seasons on holidays that traditionally involve big meals - the truth is my mom isn't a very good cook - though I do prefer her turkey and stuffing to mine).  This year I haven't visited as much....I have been too involved with myself and my working out. I am still the only surviving child who visits regularly and frankly it's so fucking unfair. I call regularly on Sundays and when I told her last weekend that I would be coming up on Friday and leaving on Saturday (not unusual for me to only spend one night) she suddenly sounded 30 years older than her 72 years and replied "you aren't staying through Sunday?" I bit my lip and simply reminded her that I usually only stay over one night but was just going to make my visit a day earlier....which seemed to either appease her or just shut her up. Either way, a "win".  I love my mom, but the truth is she is a Fox News channel watching right wing racist. Politically we agree on nothing. I hear epithets constantly about the blacks (I have heard the word "nigger" more times than I care to) , welfare, the Democrats (which I am one), and her favorite since '92 - "that goddamn Clinton". I guess it isn't enough for her that he is no longer our President. Sadly she loves Bush and loathes anyone who would dare contradict him.  I, on the other (left) hand; favor liberalism and democracy, Michael Moore, Hillary Clinton, John Edwards (Kerry doesn't do much for me) and have a passionate dislike for the man who currently resides at 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue (I dare not utter his name). You know who I mean, the one who lives there, not because he was elected but because his brother refused to enforce the Constitution which states all votes should be counted. But I digress....  My visit this weekend was filled with anti McGreevey-isms (she actually used the term "that homo"....doesn't she remember the time 18 years ago when my dad found gay porn in my bedroom???? Again, I digress, that's another blog entry entirely); I try to remind her that McGreevey is really none of her business, as she lives in New York. Driving home I could only hope that she will go quickly, when she does go....  I don't think I could bear having to go through losing another parent as slowly as my dad. I know that sounds horrible....but maybe when it's her time she can just go peacefully in her sleep. I will weep when she goes, but I know some of the tears will be from the freedom of responsibility, which will only bring guilt and then.....more tears.  You can't help but love your parents; they sacrificed for you and there is a feeling of appreciation and respect that comes along with that. But you don't have to be friends with your parents; I mean, it'd be nice.....but it's not a requirement. But you do have to accept them and their faults, as they, in turn..accept yours.
