I'm not the gallant knight i've dreamed of becoming by this point in my life. No big white stallion, no immaculate armor, no impenetrable will. Nothing about my life runs the course of a fairy tale...its actually quite tainted with loss  regret. My life reads more like the flawed star of a comic book rather than the exploits of a man who's lived in reality all this time... I've never consistently lived fortunately...fortunate to be alive, hanging by a string. The apparent plague of a man whose life dangles by a string of invisible design.  The key to confusion is proportion to where two do not agree in one. How can they grow unless they be as one?  One lord, one faith, one baptism.  One hope...but turned back upon a ray to him whose eyes are cast, I cannot be Michael J or J.R. Reid....Daphne Maxwell or Vernon...I'm not the rogue spear of justice nor the controlled fury of Hitler.  I AM Ron J., the prince of justice...the verbose, electric, intelligent, spirited, fiery voice of triumph thru adversity. A blessed survivor of years of psychlogical chaos  more than anything on earth...I KNOW WHO I AM! I know who and I know why! I know what exists and what does not. I'm aware of where I lack and where I flourish. Tho my mindset  my life story differ like night from day, and fully realizing that my methods can be complicated to understand, I am NOT hard to figure out! My life is, even in its present state, proof of my virtue, a testament to things I can not prove, a voice to an existence that had no birth! My attitude is...  1. Loyal 2. Compatible 3. Open 4. Forgiving 5. Residual 6. Enduring 7. Determined 8. Harmless or  9. Harmful 10. Not my biggest problem  I'm not the next man or the next woman. I have no children  therefore have no context to either raise children nor tolerate childish inquisition. I am the accomplished result of a man who has failed, and got back up. I don't have to give excuses for myself, when one knows...I don't listen like other people listen, comprehend like others may, see the world in the same light that perhaps complacent also-rans have their vision, but I love just the same. I show my affection in the like-same manner. I'm just as capable of loving, showing love  being loved as anyone in existence.  I'm complicatedly uncomplicated verbosely simply humble  ...but PISSED  I know whose side i'm on, and each  every friend i've ever had knew whose side I was on. Men may accuse me, some may scorn, some may not appreciate what I put out but all know whose side i'm on. Even my associates get the same form of compassion. Shoot, even my  enemies  get the same face. You may question my attention span or my conversation, or lack of, but never question my dedication or my heart. Once I have made you my friend, you are a friend for life. Your place in my heart is forever solidified. And when I make the decision to give you this heart...understand that the core of this phantom heartbeat, that has endured for centuries  speaks in many tongues, that knows no fear but takes precaution, that lives lively and has been since the beginning of understanding, the essential duties, honor  virtue of love  life are in your hands...  Don't lose it...don't let it go...
