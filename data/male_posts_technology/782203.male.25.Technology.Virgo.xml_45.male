But still went to Hafeez's house to scan my transcripts and stuff to send to Faith's colleague  but when i got back one of the floppies i saved into couldnt work. Isn't it amazing how technology has ignored the floppy. CD-ROM, CPUs and almost everything else is faster and better but not the floppy. i mean I'm sure there is a way to increase the durability/speed/size of the floppy right its been the same since i first started using the PC which was like in December 98.  Anyway i left a message on Hafeez's mobile to email me the pics on the spoiled copy, hope he sends it to me as soon as possible. Got a shock of my life when Audrey called me on my handphone yesterday, I thought something bad happened cos we never talked on the phone before. Well thankfully i was wrong ...lol i think shes like the chirppiest person i ever met, she's like so hyper and sounds so cheerful ! She was telling me how excited she was about me coming to join her at work and how great it's gonna be with me there! Sigh talk abt pressure; i dun know .....hope I don't disappoint her too much.    I wish I could sleep. But I can't lay on my back. Because there's a knife For everyday i knew you   The Speed of Pain  by Marilyn Manson
