So after I realized that it was not going well, when it got to the point where they ask if I had any questions for them... I said "Yeah, do I have to shave my head to work here?"  They just kinda looked at each other for a min. and started to laugh.  It was pretty funny.  Probably one of those times you had to be there.  Later on I went and hung out with the girls for a while at the Goose.  Once we went upstairs I started to get one of my headaches.  I just can't take those flashing lights for to long.  So I left.
