I'm kinda bored at the moment, there is nothing to do anymore unless you have bucket loads of cash to randomly spend, and even if you have bucket loads of cash you still can't go out cause your mates havent got any money! You just can't win these days.  Well i have a very weird dream last night and it involved Ben Webb, i won't go into too much detail, but he was in jail in the peodofile unit and i was in a seperate bit but aslo in jail! Unfortuantly i woke up so i can't remember much more than that. All i know is that it was quite weird. I don't even know why we were in jail! grrrr. Well later on today i am going into Croydon with Darren to get a Father's day present for my Father and hopefully i am going to get Jo's present also, But i might just not bother getting Jo anything. ( I hate her) Nah i'm jokin, it all depends on whether i can find what i am looking for! Today looks like it is gonna be good, hopefully i can top up my tan so that when i go on holiday i will already be tanned and people will think i have be there for ages already! Lol. Well thats all i can think to write about at this time so i will sign off! GOODBYE
