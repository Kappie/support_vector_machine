Its not only the theme of the novel but also the truth of LIFE  Aap log jo kahani padenge humse hi gamgeen (Grief-striken) honge. To bhi kabhi agar   Devdas jaise badnaseeb, Asayanmi (one who has no control over himself ) aur Papi   se parichaye ho, to uske liye prarthna (Pray) kijiyega. prarthna kijiyega ki aur chahe jo bhi ho, uske jaisi   maut (Death)   kisi ki na ho. Marne ka koi gum nahin, lekin koi   sneh-sparsh   (touch of love) us samay uske lalaat (forehead) tak pahuche-ek bhi karuna-vigalit (grief striken), snehmey (lovely) mukhra(face) dekhte hue es jivan ka ant(End) ho.   Marte vaqt jisse veh kisi ki aakh mein aansoon ki ek boond dekh ker mur sake.(So that at the time of his death he can see at least a drop of Tear in the eye of someone Pear  )   Here is the   English Translation   of the paragraph  All those who shall read this story shall be grief striken like us. Even than if you ever get introduced to anybody as   unlucky and sinner as Devdaas  , than please Pray that   no matter what happens, his life should not end and he should not recieve death like Devdaas  . There is no grief about dying, but there should be "touch of love" over his forehead, there should be a   lovely face dipped in sorrow in front of his eyes when He dies  . So that at the time of his death, he can see at a   drop of tear in the eye of someone Pear  .                [This Last line is the only truth for which a human Lives]     [This is what for which he fights his whole life   "to have someone who shall Cry, when He Die"  ]
