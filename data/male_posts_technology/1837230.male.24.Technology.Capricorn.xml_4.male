While this is still a first generation market, there are some interesting products. The first of which caught my eye was the philips streamium range and the mxi-6000 in particular, which showed a lot of promise as a streaming device as well as home theatre system. It wasnt release yet, so my choices were limited to :  Prismiq Slim Devices Pinnacle Showcenter Icube NMP-4000 Gateway Connected DVD Hauppage Media MVP  Bought the Prismiq, because for allt he reviews i read, it was the way to go. Plays every imaginable format, and has a browser and chat built in as well as a wireless keyboard. Returned the prismiq, its too bleeding edge for me right now. Had issues connecting with the host computer, and the interface is horrible, though the slim devices hack for prismiq makes it a lot more desireable, this product has a LOT of potential.  Bought the Play@TV icube box, and thats what im sticking with. The interface is much cleaner, although I already have a laundry list of things that id like to see in it ( search by title is my biggest one) . Connection issues were a breeze, though i didnt test the wireless, since im using wired over powerline.       Here are some things id like to see in it :  1) Music Keeps Playing when screen changed 2) Queuing mechanism for music 3) Search by title  THere are some more that i cant think of right now. Overall its a great product.... so as i listen to my mp3 collection through my HT system in the other room, id advise you to look into this great market. Theres a lot of potential.
