I wish there isn't any..... but there was a email that make me so angry that tears actually flow down.   It's from the director, telling everyone what happened that day and she also attached the report. My name was in it. I'm labelled as 1 of the person who cause the problem that day.   I blew up. That's it. I'm not going to hold back. Actually intended to write to my boss wif regards to this matter yesterday, but decided to drop the issue. So i took out the email i wrote last nitefrm the trash bin and add more words before sending to my boss. My name need to be cleared. They can't simply put the blame on me when they can't find the real cause. if they can't find the curprit, just say so in the report. they don have the rights to anyhow shift the blame on me. I will not sit down doing nothing, i will fight to clear my name.   The whole issue is affecting me too much. decided not to attend my cousin's wedding dinner today. the director email has added more headache to my already tired brain. i need to break away...... bring me to utopia..... to where everything is so perfect.....
