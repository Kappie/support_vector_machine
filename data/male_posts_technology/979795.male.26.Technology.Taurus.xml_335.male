But 1 directory seems to be corrupted and I can no longer retrieve the pictures and originals. ARGHHGH!!! Worse! One of these photos actually includes a photo of my Sensei!!! ARGH!@#!@#!@# ..... I'm so pissed.  Think I better start backing up my data onto CD. Especially those GBs of Aikido clips I so painstakingly downloaded and catalogued. If even those are gone, I think someone had better just take a bokken and chop my neck off. Don't matter that it's blunt, all the more painful it'll be then.
