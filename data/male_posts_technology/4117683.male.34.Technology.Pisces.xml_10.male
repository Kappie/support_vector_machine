I was pissed.. So I found a little diner called Uncle Willie. It was ok.  Nothing exciting, well while I was waiting for the bus, I met this guy who I guess was tring to hit on me. As usual I told him that I have experienced it, and it was not my cup of tea.... But I also have no problem with their lifesyle, and I see what the attraction of it. NO WOMEN! However on the other had.. most men are dicks, and not just own them!   Ok, Next topic!      Well need less to say I ended up getting home about 8pm, and I left the house this morning at 9:10! After I got home I changed, and just sat and did nothing! I did get to see the Star Trek:TNG Epsoide; Best of Both Worlds. It was the one when Picard was a Borg. I have never seen both parts.. and thanx for  urlLink Spike Tv  I was! Thank you Spike!      Well I am tired... Nite ya'll!      Toodles!
