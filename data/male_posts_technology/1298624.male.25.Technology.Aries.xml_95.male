It is true, like Youri said that we should have fun, and be happy with life, instead of wasting our entire lives trying to search for the meaning of it. But, you have to know, that many great events in history were carried out by a single man who went above and beyond the rest, who was able to look past the seemingly "invisible barrier" that was blocking the rest of the world.   If no one ever intends to find our purpose, why we are here, why we evolved, then we will never have the answers.  I am not saying that is necesarilly a bad thing.   I guess, after all, ignorance is bliss.
