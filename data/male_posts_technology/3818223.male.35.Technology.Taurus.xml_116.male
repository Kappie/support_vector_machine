I'll hang out in some real estate office, and when an agent takes a client to a house I'll race ahead of them, cut off the power, hide in the attic and moan "get out" when they enter. Maybe I'll rattle some chains as well. Or I could just hide in the closet and, when they open the door, jump out and hose them down with my flamethrower.  Hee, hee.  The classic gags are the best.  Flame, out
