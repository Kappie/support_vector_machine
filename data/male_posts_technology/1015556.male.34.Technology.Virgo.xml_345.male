I was almost planning out our own trip... so to get that document was a big relief. Here are some of the ministry activities we are going to do: - Prayer walk  Hand out invitations  Fliers,  New Testaments in Brooklyn - Kids Program With Muslim Children - ESL  Class  Fellowship with West African Muslims in Brooklyn - Store to store  Coffee Shop Ministry with Arabs in Astoria, Queens - ESL  Class  Sports w/Afghan/Pakistani Muslims in Flushing, Queens Wow.  I can't quite believe it.... this is going to be some very very cool stuff. The kids are very very excited and one of their biggest hopes is that they will have meaningful conversations.  I'm interested in seeing God do something that is on the verge of miraculous.
