Whilst I am not going to go into descriptions of the troubles they had, basically because I have the upmost respect for them (well most of them). However, I will reveal that all the girlfriends that I have had, all have parents that are divorced! What the hell is that all about???????  Whilst I don't have a problem with this fact, it does seem like a rather big coincidence doesn't it?  I really wish I would just meet some nice girl that i can identify with, that just seems to click with me! Whilst I don't feel lonely being single, I do miss having someone there to share stuff with. Anyway, just saying that I feel that Toaster has a point.  Baity signing off.....
