Beginning approximately five years after the events of the first Knights of the Old Republic, The Sith Lords takes players on an entirely new journey as they assume the role of what is believed to be the last Jedi in the galaxy. The game features a cast of memorable returning characters and sinister new villains. Using more than 30 new Force powers, players can turn weak-minded enemies against one another in combat with  'Force confusion'  or see through doors and view character alignment with  'Force sight.'  Assigned to protect the Old Republic and the Jedi Order from the terrifying Dark Lords of the Sith, players must explore and battle through seven diverse worlds while being challenged whether to choose the light side of the Force or surrender to the lure of the dark side.    Yes,  KOTOR II:  Sith Lords .  KOTOR, you know, Knights of the Old Republic.  Right, that one.  Probably the 2003 GAME OF THE YEAR for a lot of XBOX players.  SHIIIIIIIT!!!!  I gotta finish up the first on.  Holy fuck, I can't do this.  I gotta finish the first one and play it again a second time around as light side.  OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG  I am "flustered" about this.  Dare I say even a little bit "excited".  Who who am I kidding, I'm fucking  GEEKED  about this title.  Too bad it's not going to be till fucking Feb 2005 but till then, I have time to polish HALO 2 skillz and Half Life 2 Skillz and Doom 3 skillz and Call of Duty: Finest Hour skillz.  All of them coming out for XBOX later this year.  after all of those there's KOTOR II and Jade Empire SHIIIIIIIIT!!!    How about a few shots anyone...of screen (they're probably going to be too big but whatever)
