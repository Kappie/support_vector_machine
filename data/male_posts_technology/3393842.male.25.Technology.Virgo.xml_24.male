Associations. Look at it this way: Everything is a "concept." Any one concept is associated with any number of other concepts. The "association" itself is a concept. -------------------------------------------------------- example: "music" is a concept. It is associated with concepts such as "enjoyment", "pastime", etc. These are in turn associated to "people" etc. There is no "root concept", they are all intertwined.  -Alex    And there's this..    A thought isn't a data structure. Its an event. Its a message. The message might packetise some kind of data but in effect it generates an event when the message is received.    Interesting :->
