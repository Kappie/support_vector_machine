I think negativity is a disease that afflicts most of mankind. Its worse than one of those lethal viruses you could encounter while you take a stroll across the amazonian jungle or say hi to a few pygmies south of Zanzibar.  To me it was the joy of satire and irony that has lent me a critical eye to everything that i stop to admire. Thus the irony is something the others enjoy and negativity is my job.    Coming to the more pressing task of positivity ,I take it too personally,I Visualize. Visualisations , are my bane.Though leading gurus , people of higher learning and achievement than me profess that it is necessary to see in the minds eye instances of victory and experience the feeling before shouldering a task , I have developed this folly of taking the minds eye to different heights.Its without much warning that these images envelope you.  As I tried to close my eyes , I could see the Bowler running in , I had advanced a few steps down the pitch and the Bat moved in a perfect arc, straight backlift and perfect follow through , depositing the first ball of the innings atop something very tall. I couldnt exactly see what. After more such audacious shots I suddenly walk out nonchalantly to be spotted by a club player who has injured himself. Suddenly i am playing club matches and the Indian team is short of an opener. I havent lost my wicket since my match with Gururajdev bhavan;s Vidyalya under-14 match. There hardly seems to be an option for the selectors and I am narrating stories to the press about how I wasnt surprised.  As Gillespie runs in from Vulture street end I run down the pitch at him , swishing my bat like a Samurai in his last battle , soon the toast of the country , it would always be modest interviews for me.  Nopee i turn over, stop all that now , your too old to run and its an underarm tennis ball match with the kids from the next apartment , I tell myself.Shit no run up I tell myself. Turn over and go back to sleep.  Maybe such visualisations are extreme , but if i dont exude such extreme positivity , i fall prey to a darker depressing negativity. You guys have a cure..?
