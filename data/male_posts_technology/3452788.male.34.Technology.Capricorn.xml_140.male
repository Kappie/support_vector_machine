I like the first one best, with multiple voices and a detached-observer feel. The second is much darker, with first-person suicidal hints, but IMHO not as well written.   Beyond the Lines Driving through the mountains, through the night the cold, grey, constant asphalt hums beneath the wheels No chatter, no slush, no gravel, no squeals  A monotonous road, like a monotonous life, is hard to enjoy no adventure, no challenge to keep you awake. I could fall asleep, or more likely make a mistake  The lines, stretching on, mark a simple boundary between morbid excitement and the continual grey (although the risks are fatal, they say)  Beyond the lines, the desperate risk everything dark, heavy dreams, straining at flight (and plummeting darkness, eternal night)  A brief rush in the moment, weightless and free something different from monotonous grey (blindly discarding all you have today)  A momentary freedom from all the constraints careless disregard for physical laws (but in the end, the plan has its flaws)  In a moment, a final decision is made to escape from a mind-numbing, lackluster life (the body is identified; someone contact his wife)  Caught in a moment between life and death the soul leaves your body, not to return (he failed to negotiate the sharp turn)  Your final gift to your family is a lifetime of heartache and pain. (he slid off the road in the rain)  Locked in a casket of steel and chrome, Your body falls to the river below To the hereafter, your soul must go   One Last Drive I'm driving the final miles on a journey with no end i'm exiting this highway just around the next bend  the grey asphalt stretches ahead a boring, monotonous life flat, endless, a stable roadbed (i wonder how they'll tell my wife)  You've got to stay on this road you must keep moving along fold your wings, keep them stowed there's no flying here, they say it is wrong  The painted lines enforce the rules that define the constraints we share no stopping or turning or pausing to rest don't cross the line, don't you dare  If you stray outside these lines leaving the road, right or left you leave all that you are behind a white boundary between life and death  But i'm here on a mission to see what's beside the road, the interesting part beautiful landscape and scenery the mountains and trees touch my heart  The watchful creatures that line the road are the souls who escaped before a fox, an owl, a possum, a toad hear the destiny in the tires' roar  I'm crossing the line, breaking the rule I can't drive this road any more I'm sure you think that I'm the fool until you find out what's in store.  The road is perched impossibly high upon the canyon wall death for the foolish or unlucky or those who maybe wish to fall  Leaving the pavement much too fast scenery changes to a sullen grey blur I though this beauty would forever last But it's temporary, I'm pretty sure.  I'm falling faster than I thought one can't escape Newton's law. I miscalculated, and now I'm caught. it seems my plan had a fatal flaw.  I always wondered what it felt like to fly now I know, and now I can die.
