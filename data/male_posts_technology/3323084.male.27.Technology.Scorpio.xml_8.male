Also, Gmail is put into the bulk mail folder when sent to Yahoo accounts.  So you might want to check that bulk mail folder before you delete what's inside.  I don't know about all this, I sent my mother a Gmail invite to her Hotmail account and she got it I know.  Being use to 2Megs of space with Hotmail or having to pay $19.95 for 20Megs of space which sadly she had paid, she was with out saying very happy to get the Gmail invite.  As far as Hotmail purposely doing away with Gmail e-mails I don't know, but it sure wouldn't surprise me.  That's just the kind of underhanded thing I would expect from Microsoft.  Until next time...
