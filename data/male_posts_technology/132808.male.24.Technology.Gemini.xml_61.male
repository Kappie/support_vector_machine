Now I HAVE to buy the Journey's Greatest Hits DVD as well, because that has Steve Perry singing.  And as good as Augeri is, and he's friggin amazing (Hell, he convinced me that no two people who had the same first name could possibly sound so similiar), I need to hear some of that Steve Perry action.  Steve Perry    Steve Augeri
