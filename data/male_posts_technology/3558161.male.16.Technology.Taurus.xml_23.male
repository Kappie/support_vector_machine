These fickle, fuddled words confuse me   Like 'Will it rain today?'   Waste the hours with talking, talking   These twisted games we're playing    --------------------     Look at us spinning out in   The madness of a roller coaster   You know you went off like a devil   In a church in the middle of a crowded room   All we can do, my love   Is hope we don't take this ship down      The Space Between   Where you're smiling high   Is where you'll find me if I get to go   The Space Between   The bullets in our firefight   Is where I'll be hiding, waiting for you   The rain that falls   Splash in your heart   Ran like sadness down the window into your room   The Space Between   Our wicked lies   Is where we hope to keep safe from pain      Take my hand    'Cause we're walking out of here
