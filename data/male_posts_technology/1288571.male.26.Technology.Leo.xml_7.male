And on top of that, the extra buttons really pay off. You may read about other jerkoff's having problems with the mouseware software, but I've installed and have had zero problems. You want my guess on their situation? Its not the mouse..their problem exists between their chair and their keyboard.  Excellent mouse. I just can't get over how good it is. I used to use the  urlLink Microsoft Intellimouse Optical  and while that was exceptional, the MX700 is even better.  Me likey leaky!!
