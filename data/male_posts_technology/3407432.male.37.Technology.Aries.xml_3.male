Safe Mode gets as far as mup.sys then reboots, as does networking and command prompt.  To make matters worse, it's a machine that came with XP installed, so the only CD that comes with it isn't a Windows XP CD, it's a "recovery" CD, which wipes the HD and makes everything all shiny and new.  Got my data backed up, so that's OK but it'll take hours to re-install everything.  I can make some boot floppies, but it doesn't even have a floppy drive!  It never a good time for this sort of thing to happen, but this really is the absolute worst time.  Why don't Microsoft put in a console mode which doesn't have to load a pretty much fully working version of XP before it can start, huh?
