" urlLink We can do what we like with the spectrum, whatever that is, " said Solly. "We are not bound by Western concepts."   We don't often see such  crystalline thuggish disregard for reason and logic.     I only wish to point out that Mugabe did not come to power by promising to direct terror against whites, nor did he promise to plunge Zimbabwe into bankruptcy.  urlLink  He promised the entire gamut of progressive claptrap!
