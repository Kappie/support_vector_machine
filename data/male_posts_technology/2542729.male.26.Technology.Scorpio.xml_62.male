I find it strange that lately, a sea of females w/ ATL ties have contacted me thru yahoo, asking me random things but much of the same. Never before has this observation really irked me as suspicious until a few days ago after I wrote my last entry. A number of people contacted me, apparently from different walks of life but all tied somehow to the ATL, all (most) pursuing business-related ventures, all black women whose ages range from early 20's to 40. All single. All have read my blog or have shown interest in particular aspects of my life. To say that I suspect something would be like saying air is essential and we should all breathe it.  I even ended up blocking one chick whose profile looked like it was thrown together in a matter of seconds. Her conversation was very centralized and all too familiar. Far too familiar. So I took the time to nicely converse with whomeva wanted to talk until/ unless I determine that the individual in question has a secret agenda or until I found something better to do with my time. Like I said in my  urlLink editorial  everything that happens over the internet is suspect. A brother like myself is madd suspicious, that's just how it is. If I don't know you, you are a suspect. The spy organization you may represent? I know not...but I have the tools to find out, so don't push me...  SIGH.... In other news, i've been working on getting my new linux OS SUsE 9.1 amped up. Everything basically works, even the functionality of the THREE network cards I have on my system right now. But guess how many actually  work  w/ SUsE? NONE!!! Guess how many works on windows? ONE!!!!! ONE FREAKING CARD!!! And its a cheapo...well...actually free. Its a pull from a compaq but it works over this Linksys card I bought from Walmart today. I don't fault the cards @ all, its my cable connection. It only properly transmits through certain cards/ devices. Won't even work on my laptop, and it has 3COM architecture. I've heard that 3COM has a 950c card that works great w/ linux but the whole thing, this linksys card prolly works great too, but its just the broadband connection.  Blah blah blah blah blah...if anything, I should have bought a new cable modem. not that it would probably solve my problems but at least i'd be paying less for internet in the long run.
