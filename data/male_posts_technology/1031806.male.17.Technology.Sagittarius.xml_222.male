And this wall is so much stronger, Than everything that I've seen before.   In your eyes, I see flowers and trees.  In your eyes, I see beautiful things I can't believe.  Cause in your eyes I see the love that shine on me.  In your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes.  I see the blue skies bring some rain I feel the blood rush in my veins I never want to see you cry. Recently you said good night, Did not believe it for a while But you really meant goodbye.  In your eyes I see the sun shine.  It's so bright that I can't see.  And this wall is so much stronger,  Than everything that I've seen before.   Well, have a Merry Christmas and such! I’m off to hear my mom’s concert and then to my grandma’s house to have a little family get-together.
