Took them the old hand me down grill with a ruined burner tube that has been occupying space on our patio for months.  Also watched UNC barely beat NC State in Raleigh and Duke hold off FSU in Tallahassee.   2/28/04 - Went shopping at the Salvage Discount Store near our house.  This place is a truly bizarre collection of random crap.  We love it.   Also called Ron, Matt, Bubba, and Josh that night.  Ali and I watched "Chocolat" that night.  I fell asleep about halfway through but enjoyed the parts I saw.   2/27/ 04 - Free day off!!!  We had about 5 inches of snow overnight Thursday so Wake and UNCG were closed due to inclement weather.  Ali and I watched "Tears of the Sun" that morning.  Then we went out and made a giant snowman in our back yards.  Our snowman had a few dog turds embedded in him but he didn't seem to mind.  I'll have pictures soon. We took Rachel and Robert  (neighbors) out for dinner at Ronni's.  Made mental note to get medium wings next time instead of hot.    Went to see "The Passion of the Christ" after dinner. Very accurate portrayal of what I'd been taught growing up in chruch.  Unneccesarily gory in my opinion and not making the most of great plot potential.    2/26/04 - Watched "Dreamcatcher" with Alison.  Great book.  Scary movie.    2/25/04 - Went the the Wake/FSU game to see Wake come from way behind to beat FSU in overtime.  Wake didn't deserve to win but they pulled it out somehow.   2/21/04 -  Went to see Peter May and the Rough Band at Rubber Soul with Ali.  They were an ok blues band.  I don't think we'll see them again.    That's all I can remember.
