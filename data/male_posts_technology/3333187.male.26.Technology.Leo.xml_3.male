Black tip and Vickie, what great story... But! These little Hounds From Hell are looking down the business end of a Hissy fit if they don't SHUT THE FECK UP!!!!!  I'd take D's option and as She so lovingly put it "Did little holes for them to fall into".. One problem with that when their down there They will probably be even louder....   They even manage to keep it up for an hour and a half.. An hour and a half!! I mean I wouldn't even talk to my mother for and Hour and a Half and defiantly not at Two O'clock in the morning..  OH NEVER ENDING TORMENT THI NAME IS FOXXXXX!!!
