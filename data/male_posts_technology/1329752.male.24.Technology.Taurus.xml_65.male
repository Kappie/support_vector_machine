(napasubo ako ah) the three of us went at kfc. buti nalang i still got 380 pesos left in my wallet. i was counting  how much would be the bill in my head while mayan was ordering the food with me. (thank God sumakto.)   it costs me 305.00 =)  mayan was silent. lagi naman siya tahimik everytime we had a gmmick, meet or something. she'll just speak to me when she has to say something important, otherwise she'll never talk with me at all.  minsan ok naman siya. she even called last week here at the office and chatted with me.  pero pag magkasama kami minsan lang magsalita. maybe its an after effect when i almost courted her last january.  she hates it when i'm shouting. pauwi na kami when i said: "lika na lika na.. bagal bagal. tsk."  "bat sinisigawan moko?!?" sabi niya. "d kita sinisigawan, langya di kana nasanay sakin eh..." sabi ko.  thats all for now. need to click the button and start working.   by the way, congratulations. for me you will always be the best. i bet you pretty know who you are.
