Come to think of it both halves of the species can be really fupped up. Everyone seems to forget that it is the little things that make the big differences, it doesn't take much to make a person happy (unless you are Bubbles that is)  All anyone really wants these days is to feel that their partner cares about them and that they matter to them. And the same the other way around. It's like dancing, a woman wants to be taken to the dance floor and made to feel like the most important woman in the world. Guys it has to be said are "generally" a lot easier to please.. Give us the occasional kiss (Ok, maybe a bit more often, I can be a bit demanding when it comes to the kissy kissy) Beer and a movie at home every now and again and some of the nice loving. But when it comes down to it both sides of the fence are like that.  I guess my point is that you have to put something into a relationship to get something out of it..
