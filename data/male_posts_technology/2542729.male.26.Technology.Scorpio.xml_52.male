I dreamt that everything I had left to accomplish was forever left in limbo. I saw the world from the heavens with a deluxe skybox view...feeling empty for all that I could do no longer. Elated that i'd made it but sad that there was nothing else for me. Nothing but eternity. I remember asking God to please give me another chance...there was so much left to do. I have to help my nephews learn about life, love  everything in between. I have to teach them not to make my same mistakes. I have to help God's people here on earth be stronger powers for good in society. Its imperative that I do a good Christian mission before i'm gone! I have to live out my true destiny here, and having escaped death's grasp so many times, it couldn't end that way! No Shakespeare tonight, just fear! So I prayed about it, then I woke up.  Now here I sit. After a monstrous thunderstorm that knocked out power for a time and kept me from literally leaving the yard to go anywhere much less to Calhoun Falls, here I sit. Thankful, but fearful. Cautious to keep my head to the sky where my help permeates.  I don't know where my life is leading. I don't exactly know my purpose. I have prayed for myself, please I ask that you guys pray for me also, as I will for you. When my head gets settled back down  my heart stops racing tonight the world will hopefully then hear of the week past.
