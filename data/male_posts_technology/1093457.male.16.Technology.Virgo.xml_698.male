All the larger stuff like wardrobes (what we were buying) has to be got for you via fork-lift-truck in the warehouse. 45 minutes we had to wait. 45 MINUTES! We left our trolleys, nothing had been paid for yet so we weren't worried, got in the car and went to Sainsburys. Got some food and a paper, went back, had a look at the art and pictures (I bought a picture of a rubber duck!) and then went back to the warehouse, read the paper for a few minutes and then finaly the stuff was given out. Not going back there for a while, at least a month.
