So, I was supposed to be with my homie  urlLink Jwump Daddy Cain  up in Yosemite skull fucking Half Dome...well....due to a few changes in plan, it ain't on......Instead, I have to keep it real by leaving work early, playing 18 holes of golf.....I know...I have upper level management written all over me!
