By William?Saletan   Bush and others are playing the game of "If it's the right thing to do now, it will always be the right thing to do." It's politics, obviously, but it definitely has me disagree with people who say Bush's strongest suit is his ability to choose something and stick with it. At least, I can't agree until it's recognized that this trait is a liability as much as it is an asset.
