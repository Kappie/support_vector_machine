In fact, in one town in Texas, if the clerk at the local Quickie Mart gets a nervous, you go to jail.     urlLink From AP @ Yahoo News:    Dan Chappell, known to listeners of radio station KHFI as "Lunchbox," walked around the store narrating events on air using a phone before buying a pack of gum and leaving. He was arrested a short distance from the store, police said.  Chappell, 22, was charged with making a terrorist threat and faces up to a year in jail and up to a $4,000 fine.  Although no verbal threats were made, store clerk Atif Akhlaque said he thought he was going to be robbed and pressed the silent alarm.   Granted the stunt was stupid, but this country used to have a quaint idea called the Bill of Rights.  Under it, you couldn't be arrested because you looked scary and someone THOUGHT you MIGHT rob them.   Stop and Question , OK but  Arrest and Detain ??  The guy actually bought something before he left.  He shouldn't have even been charged with loitering.  He was a Customer not a Terrorist.    Would this same behavior have been tolerated if the clerk's actions were based on elements of the customer's physical appearance instead of his clothing?  Do you want to live in a country where you can be jailed because your appearance makes some people uncomfortable?
