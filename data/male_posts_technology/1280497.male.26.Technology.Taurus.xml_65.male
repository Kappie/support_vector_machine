I'm kidding, don't send me your one-page responses, but here's what I must overcome in the next few days:  Lesson 5: Trace the changes evident in Greek sculpture from the Archaic through the Hellenistic periods and discuss the possible cultural reasons for the changes.   Lesson 6: Describe the evolution of the concept of “areté” from Homer to Socrates.   Lesson 7: Explain how Aeneas displays the trait of “pietas” admired by the Romans.   Lesson 8: Compare the Epicurean and Stoic approaches to social and political involvement and give the philosophical basis for each position.   Lesson 9: Essay Topic: Explain how the following works reflect Roman cultural values: a.	the bust of Cicero  b.	the Pantheon  c.	Augusta of Prima Porta    Lesson 10: Explain Paul's importance in the spread of Christianity   Lesson 11: Describe how Christian artists and architects employed symbolism in their respective artforms to embody important Christian doctrines.   Lesson 12: Explain how the Confessions illustrate Augustine's view of both world and individual history.   Lesson 13: Explain how The Song of Roland illustrates the “areté” of the Christian warrior.   Lesson 14: Explain the relationship between monasticism and the development of the art of the illuminated manuscript.   Lesson 16: Explain how a Gothic cathedral like Chartres was meant to turn a Christian pilgrim's simple visit into an educational and spiritual experience.   Lesson 17: Explain how Aristotelian philosophy influences the structure of both Inferno and Purgatorio in Dante's Divine Comedy   Lesson 18: Describe how Petrarch's sonnets can be considered “proto-Renaissance.”   Lesson 19: Compare the ideas of Pico della Mirandola and Machiavelli on the subjects of human freedom and fortune   Lesson 20: Explain how Brunelleschi's work in perspective and architectural design reflects the ideals of Renaissance humanism.  And that's just the first class. There are two more, albeit less demanding, courses waiting in the wings--all to be finished by the 13th! But I will graduate, so help me.
