I fail to see how charges were even considered, let alone laid in this case.  Professional athletes in all sports know that they are risking their bodies, and careers every time they play a game.  One of the reasons that they make so much money is to offset the risk they put on themselves for our entertainment.  Hockey is an especially physical sport and players do resort to fisticuffs on occasion.  Fighting in hockey is as old as hockey being played on ice.  The reason fighting is important in hockey is to protect players from little cowards taking liberties on other players.  The game is so fast, and the boards are quite hard.  When the game is played with no respect for the players, there are serious injuries.  Knowing that your face will be rearranged if you do something stupid is what keeps a little bit of sanity in a very crazy sport.  The issue of fighting and lack of respect is the first cause of Bertuzzi's punch.  A few weeks before the incident, Steve Moore lined up Marcus Naslund's head with his shoulder and laid a very strong hit.  There has been much discussion on the fairness of that hit, but I am not going to touch that right now.  The moment a player on the opposing team hits your captain in the head, it is your duty to make sure he pays for it.  Nobody on the ice did anything to Steve Moore even after Naslund was taken to the hospital.  After the game, came the second cause of Bertuzzi's punch: the media.  Every reporter in the dressing room, and every BC newspaper the next day was asking about revenge.  "Is Moore going to pay for that?", "Is it going to be like  urlLink SlapShot  next game?" and on and on.  That got all of the fans into a bloodthirsty mob waiting to see Moore pay.  The NHL had a chance to prevent the Bertuzzi incident by sending the league a message.  All they had to do was suspend Moore for 5 games for a headshot, and everyone would have been happy.  By not suspending Moore, the league effectively told the Canucks to sort it out themselves.  If the NHL does not want to see this kind of violence, they have to stop punishing the fighters and start punishing the cheap-shot artists.  Between the lack of instant revenge on Moore, media and fan pressure, and the NHL saying "sort it out yourself" there was the making of a very interesting evening the next time they played.  The Colorado Avalanche were dominating the Canucks during the game, who were obviously distracted by the thought of payback on Moore.  The only person that Steve Moore would face off with was the tiny Matt Cooke.  Moore stood up to Cooke quite well, but seeing as Cooke is far from a fighter and smaller than Moore, it was to be expected.  Near the end of the game, it was starting to get rough on the ice.  Bertuzzi grabbed on to Moore's jersey and challenged him, but Moore was trying to ignore Bert.  This is where Todd made his big mistake, he through a devastating punch to Moore's head from behind.  Moore had a concussion and a couple of cracked vertebrae in his neck.  Todd Bertuzzi is 245 pounds and he packs a mean punch.  Moore knew that, and that is why he wouldn't stand up to Todd.  All Todd had to do was grab Moore's arm and spin him around first to punch him straight in the face.  Had the punch been face-to-face, it would have to be ruled acceptable in hockey terms.  I feel for Todd's position because the intensity of the situation would cause anyone to stop thinking clearly.  I will point out that if Todd had punched Moore in the face instead of the side of the head, Moore would be eating through a straw for a year.  With that in mind, maybe Moore should be thankful that he was punched from behind.  You can guarantee that Moore will forever think twice before trying to knock a star player out for the season.  I fully support Todd Bertuzzi and look forward to his return to the Canucks.
