I was reluctant to leave Virginia's side for even a moment, but she insisted that I honor Jude's memory. I couldn't bear to think of Jude being gone, hell, I still can't bear to think it. Whoever did this awful thing...whoever decided it was their right or duty or whatever to take away a life such as his...what is this world coming to? A bright light has been extinguished and yet, there are so many that don't even realize.  Marty's memorial service was quite peaceful. I had held onto hope that Marty would miraculously show up somewhere alive. It would be just his style to scare us to death and then show up laughing at us all. Instead, Melody was heartbroken to tell me the news after his memorial service that his body had been found.   That girl is really something, and how she can be a reporter is beyond me. All the reporters that I've known until now have been certifiable jerks; they claim they have to be to get the inside scoop. Melody though seems to be different; her vigor and charm, I'm sure, helps her to get whatever scoop she might be interested in.
