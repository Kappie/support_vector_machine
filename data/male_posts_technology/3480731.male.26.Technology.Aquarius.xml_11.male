Due to that, I've come to a decision: no more full reviews. I'm going to just do notes and thoughts from the wrestling shows and try to do more non-wrestling related posts. So, no time like the present. I recently saw The Village. It was good and if you like M Night's work, you'll be happy, but there is one problem; if you're good at figuring out his movies, you'll have this one pegged by the midpoint. This still doesn't detract from the movie, but it kills the "shock" at the end. Still, I recommend it to anyone who cares for suspense movies. Excellent date movie.  On the other end of the world, I got Mega Man - Anniversary Collection for the GameCube. What can I say? Mega Man 1-8 and the two Japanese Arcade games as unlockables. This was a trip back for me. Mega Man 1 is still hard as hell and Mega Man 3 is still a masterpiece that Capcom should be proud of. The best part? Mega Man 7 and 8 that I never got to play (7 was hard to find and 8 was for the PlayStation, which I never had). Good times.  I order Madden 2005 for the X-Box yesterday. I'm taking a risk here; never tried a Madden game before, but I have ready SO MANY good things about the series. I have played NFL Fever 2003 and liked it, so Madden should be good for me.  Check back later this week for my SummerSlam predictions.
