The title of the book, tentatively: "Why I didn't buy the 5000 dollar leather couch".  I never understood it completely, but an old friend of mine from Shell bought a $5k leather couch - and then didn't understand why she could never travel or do other things.  I once said that I thought I could be happy with a small shack in Hawaii close to the beach that just had some beach chairs and a cooler that doubles as a coffee table.  Well that's exactly what I have, a few other things, but not much, and I gotta tell you, I can't complain too much.  So a 5000 dollar leather couch?  Probably not in my life time, I'll take a beach over that any day of the week.
