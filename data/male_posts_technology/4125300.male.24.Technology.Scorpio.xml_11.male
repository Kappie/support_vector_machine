Oh yea coffee, and Norah Jones too...  Saturday was the big crescendo of the giant party that was to be our Miami trip. We drove to South Beach in pouring rain, and I think our spirits began to depress. A second day of rain on this trip? Ick. Things did seem to clear up a little bit after we got to S. Beach. Still looked too threatening to hit the beach. Went shopping instead. Bought a new watch, a pretty good looking shirt, and a couple of trinkets for CW. Spent far too much money, but ya can't take it with you I suppose. Went to a used CD store afterwards. Bought 5 or 6 cds, including Norah Jones, GD, the 8th Mile soundtrack, and some assorted electronica cds. A good mix, I think.  South Beach dining is not all that -- or at least we didn't know where to go. I got lasagna, which tasted like chef boyardee. KA picked up some seafood pasta, which had the same nasty sauce. Most expensive shitty food I've ever eaten. Service was pretty terrible too. They were supposed to give us bread -- to dip into olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Of course they didn't, or at least until half way through our meal. Oh yea, and tip of course was included on the bill. What a sham. We resolved to eat at a chain restaurant for dinner.  Returned to our rooms, took a nap, then started to get ready for the festivities. We went to a club called the crobar. Very nice, rather expensive club. Thankfully had free passes to get in. First d.j. was terrible. I can't believe a club this nice would have such a horrible resident dj! Madonna remixes? Seriously go the fuck home! Second d.j. was significantly better which imho put him in the mediocre category. His beat was hypnotic, but note the singular case. He had only one beat. Literally. Granted that gets a bit monotonous. I wasn't going to let it get in the way of having a great night. Danced like I was on E for many hours. Drank tons, and used red bull to moderate the negative effects. Left around 4, and headed back to the hotel. Waded a bit in the Atlantic, and had a really deep conversation with AD. AD is a great guy, I'm glad I met him. We defn could become good friends.  I think we share a very common history, especially in terms of exes. I hope CW and I can hang out with AD and his girlfriend.  Sunday was gorgeous.  Hot, sunny, and humid.  Perfect baking weather.  Went for a long walk on the beach, and tried to get a tan.  Florida sun is nice and powerful.  AD and KA got bored fairly quickly though, so we left after an hour or so.  I kind of wish we would have baked a little bit longer.  Bummer going to Miami and not getting much of a tan.   Had lunch at a Japanese/Chinese buffet.  Very tasty, and ate about 3 meals worth of food.  Green Tea ice cream for desert.  Pretty reasonable ($30 for three of us).  Headed back to AD's place to pack, then headed to the airport.   Flight on TED was uneventful, besides the fact that we  somehow  got economy plus tickets.  Very comfortable.   Talked with KA the entire ride, discussing life and such.  KA is a few years older then me, but still manages to live at home with his parents.  I think this has some deleterious effects on his personality and lifestyle.  I told him so on the flight back, and at times I don't think he responded well.  Granted, I was  very  blunt.  Its hard for me to be...diplomatic.  Regardless, I eventually tempered my opinionated attitude with a more apologetic and friendly one, and this seemed to calm him down.  KA is a damn good guy, and he is one of my closer friends.   I need to remember not to criticize him too much.  I think I have a tendency to criticize people too much.  Acknowledging it is the first step to dealing with it right?  Anyway, I don't think any permanent harm was done -- he im'ed me this morning.  I know he had a great time in Miami too.  Was damn near ecstatic to spend time with CW.  Felt like I hadn't seen her for months.  Think I'm going to be leaving work soon.   Maybe  more later.
