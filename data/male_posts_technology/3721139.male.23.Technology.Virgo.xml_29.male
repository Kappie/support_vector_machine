Therefore, things like the 200,000-person protest in Hong Kong last week turned into 'a troublesome traffic jam' or 'a few people getting together to celebrate the anniversary of reunification with China' in Beijing.  Consequently, analysts have to read everything coming out of the country with a grain of salt.  What's not written is as important as what is written, and it's their job to figure out what really happened from what was written.  Now, I only bring this up to contrast myself with these paragons of understanding of the written word, because I'm a complete boob at the fine art of reading between the lines.  So if anyone can point me to Sun Tzu's The Art of Not Getting Oneself Into Hot Water (Again), for the love, please tell.
