Yesterday went by without a hitch and I even have more stuff to do today. I brought in my music this morning, so I'm listening to a little D right now:)  Also, I got to eat at Pete's Pizza last night which was fun, good company.  and another thing, do you think you could get cravings or be addicted to drugs you've never had? just a contemplation...
