It was a young French guy from my gym that is always rollerblading all over the place that gave me the inspiration and initiative to get my blades and start practicing my quick turns, accelerating, and stopping techniques which is not as easy as you may think it is(got quite a few bruises in trial and error). Anyways I consider myself a pretty good rollerblader now and I plan on waking up tomorrow morning to go get a quick workout in, pack a lunch, strap on my blades, and possibly gather a friend or two to make a trip around the whole Stanley park seawall which is about a 7 mile trip.     Lately I have been extremely busy because of math 11 in summer school because I work out 2 hours in the morning then have to do 3 hours of homework in the morning, take a 30 minute bus to my school and get there by 12:15pm and work in that class till 3:30pm since 1 day there is equivalent to 1 week of normal school which means I get a shitload of homework per day, THEN! Go to work at 4pm constantly having to deal with rejection until 9:45pm then I get home and have about 30 minute of freetime and then I rinse and repeat the day. Sounds like I'm having a fun summer huh? ontop of that I gotta take up my weekends freetime up with my job at the PNE doing customer service courses and working preview days showing a bunch of old retired women a million dollar home and saying the same speech over and over again. It really is actually quite a fun job but it does get repetitive but atleast I get to communicate with people because people skills are very important.     **Well its late so I'm gunna relax and make myself a midnight snack consisting of perogies and "Ren and Stimpy" gummy's**
