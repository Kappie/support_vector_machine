Although I do not grow any crops for sale on an annual basis, it is considered a farm becuse it has barns (2), and saleable crops such as hardwood and hay.  I lease out about 20 acres of pasture to a friend who has 19 head of beef cattle (mainly herfords) for  summer grazing.  The article describes how by using a little out of the box thinking, we can work more productively using current in the box technology.  TIFTON, Georgia (AP) -- Farms of the not-too-distant future could be managed through wireless computer networks that allow farmers to sit in their pickups with a laptop and drive tractors, monitor soil moisture and even feed the hogs remotely.  http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/biztech/06/18/wireless.farming.ap/index.html
