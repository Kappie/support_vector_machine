This blog won't be here forever, because essentially Life Unnamed is where I will be posting.  So here we go.  With the design of things, I've realized I am thinking too much like an application designer, and not like a web designer.  I want things to be too complicated when they shouldn't be, content management should be easy.  However, the application side of things, for instance the administration part, can be complicated, filled with DHTML and curvey images.  I've just recently realized this.  Also, Reviuss was a little bigger than I wanted.  I suppose I didn't really want an entire community for a development team.  Sure, I like my development team (only ONE person ever helps though, so Thank You Carlos for always being there for me, don't think that because Reviuss has changed that the concept has changed, we're still a dev. team :) )  But a community and a dev team site together--no.  Doesn't work.  And all of the time from the dev team would be being put into Reviuss and Epoch.  I want to design rich applications, using new tools like XML.  I don't want to mindlessly drone over the details of usability and then write what has been written over and over again, just a few scripts snatching articles from a database.  So, from now on, the development team (when I have my time) will be working on this.  If I want to make a community, then I should make a damned COMMUNITY, not a place to post articles.  I don't know, and I'm not getting into it right now since it's taken me over 24 hours of non-stop thought to figure out what I have so far.  I swear I'm a neurotic nutcase.  So, in a sense this is still Epoch.  I am still making a site for me to post day-to-day gruff, articles, and keep it all in tact.  Of course, I will work on this little by little not to burn myself out.  I'll be going for my look here, I'll be going for a stylesheet template here, my pretty, simple, XML.  My nice features.  And I'll make the admin part as pretty and Javascripty as I want!  Like Blogger, I like Blogger's DHTML.  Life Unnamed, well that is basically the name of the site.  Anyone remember Subject to Ruin?  I write a lot of articles, you've seen them probably, and I know many at my school love them, they want them in a book.  So I've decided to organize them and put them into collections, Life Unnamed is that collection, along with every day blog stuff, and probably eventually other things.  But while I make this, this...this is my home.
