Well, no it doesn't - but it  should . Broiling desert, not enough water, snakes, right-wing Republicans.  Here's a couple more:      urlLink Slashdot  is an electronic implant that has a leopardskin print! Well, yeah, of course.      LiveJournal is a hearing aid that's made of glass!     Politics should not be forgotten in this election season. Here's a little something for both sides in the American elections:     George Bush is a shirt button that hovers three feet from the ground, keeps your breath fresh for up to twenty-four hours and cuts through stone as if it were butter.      John Kerry is a candle! It detects background radiation! And this weblog:      Villagers With Pitchforks is a belt buckle that improves blood clotting and bleeps when you whistle for it.  Just what I've always needed.
