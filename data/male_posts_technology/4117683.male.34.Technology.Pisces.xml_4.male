So a  BIG   disappointment this morning, and then after I came back from the methadone clinic there was an note from the same girl in the front.. So I called, and it was about my med eval follow up that was for the 31st to check how I am doing on these new ANTI-PSYCHOTIC!!! Well Guess what THAT WAS CANCELED ALSO!!! Then moved to ANOTHER WEEK! So I guess my mental health can wait!       Well day one with mother back.. Wasn't that bad.. Thank god that they were gone most of the day!      Well I need to sleep.      lates!
