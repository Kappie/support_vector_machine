Some important facts:  The first plane had already hit when Bush arrived at the school  The visit was publicly announced 3 days prior to 9/11  There is an airport 4 miles from Booker Elementry  The president did not alter his pre-arranged route back to Air Force One.  There's much more in the articles. All this tells me that Bush and the Secret Service were well aware that the president wasn't in any danger, even though our nation was supposedly "under attack."
