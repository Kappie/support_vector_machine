However the following is an article which, as the author points out at the start, can only really be truly understood by computer people with a love of space stuff.   urlLink To Boldly Go ...   I agree with everything said here, and I too have always been astonished at the fact that the original lunar project worked on that level of technology. Although perhapse the author is now regretting quoting Flash memory as something to be used in space missions as it is now looking likely that this is what caused the problems on the Spirit rover!!
