I definitely think it's a good thing that my XBOX isn't in my room considering how late I fucking play!  Damn it!  I was about to get off line last night at 12:30 when one of my buddies, BMW JAY popped in.  See I was hosting and I hate to host because people always want to keep playing into the damn wee hours of the night.  I wasn't doing too bad, but when I first started I did.  I think I have to do some terrorist hunts or something before playing for real.  Today, my aunt is coming in from the Motherland.  She's arriving at 3 and should be at my parents house by 4.  I don't get off work till 6 so I get home just in time for dinner!!!  Hell yeah!  I don't think I will be going to North Beach tonight.  That place is starting to get lame.  Once in a while it's cool but sincerely I am getting burnt out by the bar scene.  Besides, the drink special tonight is for beer and as we all know, I have gout and beer is my number one enemy.  How can something that taste so good be so bad.  *sigh*  Well, I will be on XBOX Live ASAP after the dinner at my parents house.  That should be around 8:30-9:00 PM if anyone cares.  It's a good thing that that's when my roommates go to North Beach.  Yeah...three hours, maybe even four hours of straight gaming.  playing with  urlLink JMV 624 ,  urlLink BMW JAY ,  urlLink WARMOOSE77 ,  urlLink FOUR RUNNER ,  urlLink THEPRODUCT23 ,  urlLink BLADE1000 ,  urlLink BIGGERGUNZ ,  urlLink INBREDBOBAFETT ,  urlLink DORNY ,  urlLink CAMBO86 ,  urlLink DONKEYPUNCHINYA , DEREK  urlLink     this should be fun as heck!
