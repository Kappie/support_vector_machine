Kevin   In the “Grapevine” segment on Special Report with Brit Hume, Jim Angle explained:       “9-11 Commission Co-Chairman Lee Hamilton, a Democrat, said today there is no disagreement between the commission and the administration over links between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein. But most news organizations last night said the commission’s conclusion, that there was no quote, ‘collaborative relationship’ between the two was evidence the administration deliberately misled the public. CBS Evening News said the commission quote, ‘directly contradicted one of President Bush’s justifications for going to war against Iraq.’ ABC said the report quote, ‘unequivocally’ disputed the Bush administration’s claims of an al-Qaeda-Iraq link. NBC reported that the commission is ‘sharply at odds with what leading members of the administration continue to claim.’       “A front page headline in today’s New York Times reads quote, ‘Panel Finds No Qaeda-Iraq Tie.’ And the Washington Post says quote, ‘al-Qaeda-Hussein Link is Dismissed.’ But commission members said today there were links, just not a working relationship and no evidence of any Iraqi involvement in September 11th.”   The Republican Chairman and Democratic Vice Chairman of the 9-11 Commission on Thursday rejected the media’s widespread reporting that the commission’s report issued the day before had directly contradicted Bush administration statements about connections between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. Yet on Thursday night ABC’s Peter Jennings declared that there “continues to be a discrepancy between the commission’s findings and the President’s on whether al-Qaeda has a link to Saddam Hussein,” and CBS anchor Dan Rather repeated how “the commission yesterday said it had found no credible evidence of a quote, 'collaborative relationship’ between al-Qaeda and Iraq.” NBC’s Tom Brokaw reiterated the same no “collaborative relationship” finding. But, Brokaw intoned, “despite that conclusion, President Bush insisted there was a relationship between the two.” NBC buried what should have been its lead. At the very end of his report, David Gregory informed viewers of how “Lee Hamilton said today that he does not see much different between administration statements and the commission’s report.” CNN barely mentioned Hamilton while the New York Times and Washington Post ignored him.
