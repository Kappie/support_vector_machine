Four husbands were sitting at the waiting room in a hospital waiting for their wives to give birth.   Soon, a nurse came out from the delivery room and told the first daddy: "Congratulations, you've got twins!". "Oh!..... maybe it's just a coincidence" said the daddy, "as I'm working at the Petronas Twin Towers".   Then another nurse came out of the room and told the second daddy: "Congratulations, you've got triplets!" "Wooow!, this is a coincidence too" said the second daddy. "I am working for 3M Corporation".   A while later, another nurse appeared and told the third daddy: "Congratulations! your wife got quadruplets" "Thanks God. Perhaps this is also a coincidence". "I work at Four Seasons  Hotel!".   Meanwhile, the fourth daddy-to-be was becoming very worried. All the 3 daddies asked him: "Why do you look so worried?".    He answered, "I work at Seven-Eleven!"    (P.S. Special thanks to Kavitha for the joke)
