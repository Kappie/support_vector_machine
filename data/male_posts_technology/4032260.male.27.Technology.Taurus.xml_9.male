We must be very careful about creating divisions in the body of Christ. One of the more popular divisions today is with individual churchs i.e. "my church is better than your church." We must guard against strife [def: contention for superiority], with other Christians. Have you ever tried to be a "better Christian" than someone else? I think that's strife. Why is your goal to be better than them? Your eyes should be on Christ... and if they are on Christ then your desire should be to build up the other person even more.  I think I'll end here... there's more I want to say about the 2nd half of the passage... but I slept in a little bit today... so I'll pick it up tomorrow. But the point of today is:  Are you jealous of someone because of something they have that you want? Are you tired of Mr. or Miss perfect always getting all the praise for everything they do? Are you not going to hang out those 'backslidden' Christians because they go to the wrong church?  Grow up. Life is not about you (or me for that matter... a fact I'm still trying to learn). These people are people that Jesus loves. Jesus died for them. If He has taken the time to love them... why can't you?
