       
      On July 9, the NY Times ran the following headline regarding the vote on the Federal Marriage Amendment.    THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE MARRIAGE ISSUE;  "Conservatives Press Ahead on Anti-Gay Issue."    Fair and Balanced??? Can you imagine them running a headline like this on say the partial birth abortion ban...   "LiberalsPress Ahead on blocking anti Baby Killing law"
