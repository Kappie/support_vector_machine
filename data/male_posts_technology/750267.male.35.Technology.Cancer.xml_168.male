'By the time the other captain could get control of the ship, it was too late.' According to McMahon, the crash was related to 'health problems and medication' -- reportedly for a blood pressure problem."  If this holds true, that the cause of the ferry accident was that the captain collapsed because of a medical condition, then the New York ferry system has to take some of the blame in not preventing this.  One way it could have been prevented would be to have two "captains" at the helm, so that if one gets ill suddenly, the other can take over in an instant. Another would be to monitor the health of the captains on a frequent basis (say, a full-physical monthly), and remove any that show signs of poor health such as high blood pressure.
