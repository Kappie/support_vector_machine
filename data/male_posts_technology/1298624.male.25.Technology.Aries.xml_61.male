It's from an old SNES videogame that was horribly (and I mean axe butchering horribly) translated by our fellow Japanese. I believe the whole thing went:  In A.D. 2101  War was beginning   Captain: What happen?  Operator: Somebody set up us the bomb.  Operator: We get signal.  Captain: What!  Operator: Main screen turn on.  Captain: It's You!!  Cats: How are you gentlemen!!  Cats:  All your base are belong to us.   Cats: You are on the way to destruction.  Captain: What you say!!  Cats: You have no chance to survive make your time.  Cats: Ha Ha Ha Ha â€¦.  Captain: Take off every "zig."  Captain: You know what you doing.  Captain: Move "zig".  Captain: For great justice.   *sigh* You can see the whole .gif animation at  urlLink The Register .  Suffice it to say, it is interesting how this simple misappropriation of the english language has permeated most residents of the internet. People who know about "All your base..." don't even know it came from a horrendously translated videogame! It's an amazing thing to see people react to something as inane as this.   In other news, my significant other has gone ga-ga over the birthday gift of TiVo. She is a self-admitted TV junkie, so she can definitely appreciate the godly powers that are bestowed upon her once TiVo was finally connected. I have to admit though, setting up TiVo was NOT the "easy setup" that the manual said it would be.  To all those thinking of using a wireless network (specifically the Linksys WUSB11 adapter) on any TiVo system (40, 60, and 80 hour units), you MUST upgrade the firmware before TiVo can recognize the USB wireless adapter! I spent most of yesterday trying to figure out why the unit wouldn't recognize the USB adapter. It took two hours and some research on the internet to find out that after the initial setup (which requires two phone calls), you need to force an update to TiVo's service and download the 4.0.1b firmware. This specific software updates the TiVo unit to accept USB connections and recognize the Linksys adapter.   After much worrying though, TiVo finally works well and flawlessly I might add. Liz-Ann is going crazy over it (which was the intended effect). I'm glad she loves it.  Who me? No, I don't watch TV seriously enough to warrant purchasing a unit for myself. Although I have had my eye on a specific 20 inch LCD from Dell for awhile now.
