After Alan and his son left Karissa and I went on a bike ride to the fountians in the lakes to see the ducks and the fountian.  After bothered the ducks we went to the park for a little bit.  I did not want to keep her out to long in the sun as she is not aclimated to Texas sun anymore.  Mommy called a couple of times today and everytime she called I tried to call her back and got nothing but a fax machine or modem and could not even leave a message.  When I finally did get through   SFW   was not home.   SFW   called about the time I was getting ready to leave for work and Karissa did not want to talk to her :)    I cannot tell you how good that made me feel.
