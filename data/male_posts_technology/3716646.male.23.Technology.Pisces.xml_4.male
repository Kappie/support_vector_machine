Mike's attempt to get Fahrenheit 9/11 a PG-13 rating despite apparent graphic violence goes down in, well, flames.  Are there any teens who care about things other than school pecking order, sex, or drugs?  Not while I was one, damnit!  Any teen who can't get into an R-movie should go see it with their parents anyway.  Families coming together to destroy freedom and such!
