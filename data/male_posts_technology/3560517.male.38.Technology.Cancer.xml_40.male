They don't even have the decency to respect the dead and then cheer when this idiot says he wished Bush had died.  I say "screw the Eurotrash scum" !  Let them defend themselves for once...oh yeah, they can't.  If it wasn't for us, they would all be speaking German right now.  Kevin  :-)  'Bush should have died, not Reagan': Morrissey MANCHESTER music legend Morrissey sparked controversy when he announced Ronald Reagan's death live on stage during a concert - and then declared he wished it was George Bush who had died instead.  Thousands of fans at Dublin Castle, in Ireland, cheered when the ex-Smiths frontman made the announcement that the former American president, who had battled with Alzheimer's Disease, had passed away.  And an even bigger cheer followed when Morrissey - who is no stranger to controversy - then said he wished it had been the current President, George W Bush, who had died.  Fan Tony Murray said: "He commented about the death of Ronald Reagan and when he wished that it was George W instead the crowd went wild."  A spokesman for Morrissey's record label, Sanctuary Records, said: "We do not have a recording of the gig, but as far as we can tell, Morrissey was just alerting the audience to the fact that Ronald Reagan had died.  "He then simply followed that up with his comment about George Bush, which was his own opinion. He is no stranger to controversy."
