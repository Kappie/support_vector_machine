This  urlLink disturbing article  in yesterday's Red Guard indicates that two officers who patrolled the Whittacker district and had a habit of shaking down prostitutes.  May have colluded!    Golly! do you think so?  I would like to think that it really is possible that nobody else on the force knew about these two bad apples.   So let's get out the thumbscrews and make sure!!!!     Oh wait. This isn't the  urlLink  Eugene Weakly .  I must be shaking off a virus.    Has an independant inquiry been scheduled?  I certainly hope so.
