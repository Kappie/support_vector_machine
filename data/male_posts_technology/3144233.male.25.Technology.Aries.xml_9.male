After a very difficult and slightly dangerous 15 miles we made it to the very nice hostel from which we are making this update.  Since several of our group had wet feet we have had to set up here for the night to avoid blisters which would course some serious problems later in the trek.   Ed, Jim, Joel, Leo and Ben.
