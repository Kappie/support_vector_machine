If you've ever watched "American Casino" on the Discovery Channel, then you've been there too.      Anyway, we were downing some $2 Blue Moon beer when I noticed that the tomato can Mike Tyson was fighting was paying 6 to 1 odds.  So, I put in $100.  Also, I called my friends Sean and Rich to front them $100 each.  Today, I get to pull $1800 in profits out of that place! We each take $600.  Big dinner tonight!   :)      I have to help paint the guest bedroom today.  Chores.  Responsibilities.  I really don't like any of them.  But, it'll do.      It's 107 degrees out right now and the sun is behind clouds!  So much for the bike ride today...
