I found a lovely headline on Google News about a Clinton advisor being investigated for remove papers from the National Archive.     Now I being an old fashioned gent I thought it was kind of harsh to probe a guy just becausehe tooks some documents, but then I found out that NARA (National Archives and Records Administration) actually warns people that they will probe your ass if you are caught stealing from them. So I can't feel to bad since he had been notified of the repercussions of his actions. The followingis a screen-shot from NARA'swebsite, pay close attention to the second paragraph.     So to anyone out there thinking of fucking around with NARA better think twice, these fuckers do not mess around when comes to protecting Amercian history.
