Ketika penjahat-penjahat menyerang aku untuk memakan dagingku, yakni semua lawanku dan musuhku, mereka sendirilah yang tergelincir dan jatuh.  Sekalipun tentara berkemah mengepung aku, tidak takut hatiku; sekalipun timbul peperangan melawan aku, dalam hal itupun aku tetap percaya.  Satu hal telah kuminta kepada TUHAN, itulah yang kuingini: diam di rumah TUHAN seumur hidupku, menyaksikan kemurahan TUHAN dan menikmati bait-Nya.  Sebab Ia melindungi aku dalam pondok-Nya pada waktu bahaya; Ia menyembunyikan aku dalam persembunyian di kemah-Nya, Ia mengangkat aku ke atas gunung batu.  Maka sekarang tegaklah kepalaku, mengatasi musuhku sekeliling aku; dalam kemah-Nya aku mau mempersembahkan korban dengan sorak-sorai; aku mau menyanyi dan bermazmur bagi TUHAN.    urlLink      Yesterday, I had dinner with my cell celebrating Melissa Wong's birthday and in the end she was grilled over her life..sharing stuff that she won't even share to anyone else except her parents. and boy it is not easy to answer those question.  So when I put myself in her shoes, I myself have not been myself in the past few years. True many ppl saw me as a extrovert and a joker ...or childish guys who just seems never stop talking. But truly deep down I am not who I am ...This might be a bombshell for many of you.  For those who have served God with me throughout the years in Nilai knows who I am exactly because we have shared our lives openly, rebuking each other in love and transparency.  Mel's attitude to be open to her cell mates have struck a chord in me that I should too shared out my life ...to my cell members and readers of the blog.   I am actually very quiet guy with a need for peace and serene and would not mind doing things alone. I started out in school being the most quiet geeky guy you can think of , that pour himself over books of many types ranging from technical to fiction to non fiction.But i don't seems to develop that same passion for textbooks. In my entire school life, I have 2 friends..who one time or another have betrayed me or abandoned me. Books have been my companion throughout my entire life. I was also many times sidelined when it comes to team games and I would not mind being able to read another book. I was not a christian then but desired to become one.  I had that desire to make new friends but usually ppl often sidelined me because i babble in technical jargons...and topics is always books...which is not cool in school. In order to gain acceptance , I excelled myself in swimming representing the school in swimming competition but never won more than twice. I determined to read books of every topics and everything under the library in the hope that when i meet people, i will be able to talk to people and be intellectual about it. Sadly throughout my childhood leading to high school,...no friends..People often remebered me as quiet, confused and bookworm who never excelled in schools...obtaining a second grade in SPM.  So when i reached college, I decided to talk more and socialize..because we converse in English it was more easy. But i was still a bookworm but i excelled in my studies in IT because I have prepared myself well in those stuff even from secondary school. Then I accepted Christ one time and that is when God changed me little by little...allowing me to speak to ppl with confidence and with that joy of the Lord.  Because i was a loner, When i begin to speak with confidence ...I was so excited about having friends for the first time...I have not stop talking ever since....even until now.  But because I have not really enjoyed my childhood and my secondary school years...I have decided to wipe this part of memories from my mind ...and until now.I have not been able to retrieve it at all.  The reason of why I am so talkative is this..I am so thanksful God have blessed me with friends that I could not help it...But when I am back alone..I will be very quiet with my books.  I also used to have a murderous temper where it would flare to such a magnitude that several times I have been nearly send to Physiactric hospital. My temper would flare at times that I will hurt people physically and would not remember it at all...when i calmed down. I am glad God liberated me when I accepted the Lord and really it is His Will that I am here hanging out with u guys ,,with that peace that surpasses understanding no longer provoked ..unperturbed by anything else.  So there you have it ...my real me.
