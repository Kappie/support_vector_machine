Well, if you ask that of an average Christian, the pat answer would be reciting the opening passage of Hebrews the eleventh chapter like a soothing mantra (Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen) for the soul. What concerns me with these pat answers is the lack of depth they reveal relying on a set definition not a living relationship. This type of faith could be akin to a lucky charm that's purpose is to make us feel warm and safe concerning our future. For many believers, their proof of faith is a hazy, almost cloudy, once made profession(Magic words similar to saying hocus pocus during a magic trick) which they wear like a lucky, charm or cling to as a get out of jail free card. This type of faith doesn't seem to have enough "Magic" even to suffice a lone believer, let alone affecting a lost world without "Faith". Another type of faith I have notice is a faith prone to flaunting its power(Magic) like a trophy. In this type of faith, YOU put in YOUR hours, strive hard enough, YOU will attain YOUR trophy, YOUR FAITH. This faith is much more powerful, but seems to be centered on SELF. This type of faith makes the believer the center and the key not only to their faith, but maybe even their own universe(calling things into existence as if they were not). Again, although this faith exudes more power, it does little to reflect accurately the Glory(The beauty of God) to a lost world who is distant from God. In addition, I'm afraid this faith will also leave the individual lacking in true depth in their faith, and spiritually bankrupt. The last type of faith I have come across is one, to use A.W. Tozer's terminology, "The gaze of Soul".. Regretfully this faith is the rarest form to find, and most difficult to obtain. Simply put, faith is our gaze, our view of God. This faith will be weak or strong depending on what diffuses, alters, or hinders ones' view of God. These hindrances, which alter ones reality of God, are plainly put, the sin in our lives. To have a faith that is real, vital, and life changing one must only "fix" ones eyes on the beautiful Son. But the costly part here in lies, as we gaze on the beautiful God, he will reveal the lenses, shades (Sins) which hinder our view of him. This is were we have a choice to grow and strengthen our gaze, or turn back and have our sight (Faith) become dull and void of life. I must confess that I have made both choices in my life, both to strengthen my gaze, and unfortunately turning from God with my gaze becoming dull. The gaze of the soul is a costly thing, best left for only the desperate who have become hollow in their soul, who have determine that faith without a clear view of God is settling for shell of the ultimate beauty which can be found in God.
