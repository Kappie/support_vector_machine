I have been putting most of my posting power towards cincymusic.com (I suggest checking this page out).    I am keeping Kristin and her family in my prayers.  Her grandmother passed away today.  That is a tough situation.  It is not easy to lose someone close to you...  On a lighter note the Bengals won today.  They are 3-2.  I am kicking butt in fantasy football.  The MLB Playoffs are going well...and are getting more and more interesting (I am rooting against the Yankees).   I got a hair cut this weekend.  My what used to be blonde hair is now being over powered by the brown hair and it looks like I have a bad frost job...but that is okay.  I saw Zoolander with Ann and Elizabeth this weekend. That is one weird movie.  It had some good moments, but it had some "what were they smoking when they wrote this" moments too.  Justi's hair is getting long.  Too long.  Okay, well I am on Ann's computer and Elizabeth wants to use it to check her email...so until then...
