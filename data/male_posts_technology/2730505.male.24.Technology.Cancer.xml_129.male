Even though I thought I was wronged by you not giving enough effort, I realize that I do love you and if I do love you I have to let you go if that's what's going to make you happy.  It was fun while it lasted and I would have liked it to last even longer but in reality, you have so many things going for you that I am not going to be an integral part of your life.  I understand now that things aren't going to work.  That's okay with me.  I leave it with giving my all into this relationship and I feel damn good about that.  If you're not going to take it then someone else will.  I guess we never fully understood each other but at the same time you can't really fully understand someone just by talking to them on the phone.  We tried it out.  It didn't work out and I can live with that.  I know that no one here wronged anyone on purpose.  We were just on different points in our lives now that for a while there, our lines were together and intertwined.  It has come to a point where out lives must diverge.  There were a lot of good times huh?  From the first time we tried to watch Memento to our last date at PF Changs in East Lansing.  It was fun.  There were good times as well as bad times.  I could say that my favorite would be you visiting me here in Chicago and when you met my whole family.  That weekend was the best weekend for that and the worst weekend as well (we both know why).  You were caught off guard by how my family was so welcoming of you and all the compliments that you were on Cloud 9.  We came back to my place and tried to watch the movie adaptation of The Unbearable Lightness of Being.  That was the night that you actually told me without speaking "I LOVE YOU" with your eyes.  I won't forget that.  There were other times too!  Like Mitsuwa, that was a surprise and a half for you.  You got soooo giddy over the stupidest things!!!  Like the bath soap and dish washer soap and a rice cooker.  It was so cute.  I also liked out trip to the Art Institute of Chicago.  That was definitely cool.  The next girl I want to be in a serious relationship with should be appreciative of art as well.  What about when we went to St. Joseph's and I got wasted and said FUCK really loud at the Mexican restaurant and they promptly cleared out the tables surround our table.  Sorry about that by the way :)  Another ritual that we had was Sunday nights.  You would be studying and I would be cooking dinner and watching TV.  I thought it was nice.  We were just hanging out and it felt like we were a real couple.  A real couple that lived close and doing normal things.  For those few hours I would forget that I lived in Chicago and just be at peace with everything.  I remember one of the first times that you were here too, it was cold outside and I took you to a frozen Lake Michigan for a very romantic view of the City.  I held you there and everything in the world seemed right.  I also remember one scary thiing when you called me and you got in an accident.  I was scared shitless.  I didn't want you to get hurt, actually that was the second time that you tried to push me away.  I also remember the first time I was up in East Lansing, Saturday morning when I was kicked out of your apartment, that hurt.  I remember talking to you for endless hours of the night.  I remember laughing a lot and not really a lot of bad things.  It was a short lived relationship that really made an impact on me.  I fell in love with you.  I really did.  For the whole package, the good the bad and everthing in between.  I love you Meghan and I still want this to work but it's unfair for me if you don't want it anymore.  Thanks for being honest and straightforward to me with a lot of things.  I always appreciated that.  I didn't like it sometimes but I still appreciated it.  There are other things that I can talk about here but it would take a day and a half to write them all down.    I think you're great and someone will make you happier.  I think I'm pretty good too and someone will be happy with me.  I'm not saying I'm over you or anything like that.  It's going to take a while obviously, but things end without any effort.  Since you quit this, there's no sense for me to keep watering our plant.  The decision to end this is your decision and I hope that you can live with that.  I know that I can live with the fact that I gave it my all.  I loved you with everything that I had.  I had a great time with you so far this year and it is definitely unfortunate that things had to end.  I thought we had something really special here that would last.  You've made up your mind that things won't work out.  Like you said, it's best that we just separate now.  I know you will be okay.  Things will get better sweetie.  After this week, you should be happy hanging out at your work with your new found friends, reconnecting again with your friends in Jackson and getting things ready for Japan.  Just hang in there.  This week will be over soon and life will deal you a much needed break.  I on the other hand, will try and pick up the peices of myself.  I'm sure someone else wants these feelings.  Good bye Meghan.  I love you.  Good luck with the rest of your life.  Keep at it and you can get your dreams baby.  Remember I won't always be in love with you but you will have a very special place in my heart and mind.  You have helped me appreciate a lot of different things that Ihave learned from you.  I love that.  I came out of this relationship having grown a little.  Having learned a lot and have been in your life.  I love you and I can't stress that enough.  I would like to hear from you from time to time and I think I can just do that through your web page.  Don't worry I won't comment or anything wierd like that.  I  love you baby.  I really wish things were different and you can still change that as could I.  I'm not shutting the door and burning bridges here.  I'm just leaving your life to make it not as stressful as it has been.  I'm still going to be across the bridge living my life.  I love you baby but it's time that I go.  Thanks for everything, I hope that I made you a better person after this.  I hope that I have shown you things that you appreciated.  I'm still here if you need me, in the mean time I have to try and move forward and keep on this journey that is my life.  Thanks again for everything and I love you!  Take care.  your loving ex-boyfriend Gonzalo C. Marte III
