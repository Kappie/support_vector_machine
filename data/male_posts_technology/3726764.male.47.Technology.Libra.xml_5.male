What's going through my mind today? Well, it's been a not-quite normal Sunday so far. It was raining when I got up at 6 this morning. Strike 1. Went for coffee and there was someone else sitting in my usual booth. Strike 2. Not a good way to start my Sunday. Then there were 3 fat, ugly women who were loud and obnoxious. Not the kind of people or noise I want to put up with anytime of the day, let alone my Sunday morning. Strike 3. Went and got groceries and picked up some potting soil, next door at ShopoKo. Maybe I'll just stay indoors today. Read most my morning email and here I am doing a friggin blog post. I wonder how long I'll keep it up. I better get this blog address off to Louie or she'll be writing, wondering what's going on and why I don't write. Maybe I'll post again later today. Maybe not.
