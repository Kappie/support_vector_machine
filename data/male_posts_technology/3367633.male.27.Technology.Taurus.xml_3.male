I spent the weekend with my parents and they got me a few star trek novels(presumably at a garage sale or auction, as that's what my parents do). Now don't get me wrong I like the books and such but my parents are really out of touch. I would have much rather had a gift certificate to a store or some thing so I could buy some thing I needed. Its not that I don't appreciate the thought or the stuff but just in this time of my life its little things like laundry soap that make my life easier(god how sad is that).
