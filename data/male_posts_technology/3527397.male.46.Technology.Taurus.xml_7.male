God are they gearing up to hate the fat.  You hate me because I am a "nice" guy and that deserves your scorn.  You hate me because I do not have wealth.  You hate me because I tried to be happy.  You hate me because I wont share your hate.  I will always be hated and their is nothing I can do about it.
