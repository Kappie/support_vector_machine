Mir - I answered the first question in my previous post.  In an ideal world, I would answer affirmatively to the second question.  This is not an ideal world, and proactive goodwill is not inherent to our species, so some socially-agreed upon governmental action is necessary to ensure temporary aid is provided for those who cannot help themselves.  I suggest "governmental action" because my initial assumption, that proactive goodwill is not inherent to our species, precludes the private sector doing anything unless profit is possible or even guaranteed.
