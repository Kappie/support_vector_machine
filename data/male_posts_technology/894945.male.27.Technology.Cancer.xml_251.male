Different people deal with tragedy like this in different ways (il use this sniper situation as an example) some people will try to forget about such things as soon as they can, others will sit and mourn and some will make cartoons like this one, maybe they believe it helps people see the reality of the situation. Everyone has there own way of dealing with such things. That said I don’t think anyone has he right to say “that is wrong” or “no one finds that funny”. I realise I may have offended people by posting that picture and I apologise to them, but I don’t apologise for actually posting it (if that make sense) although next time I post something that my offend people il put it in a link making clear not all people will find it funny…   In regards to your comment about my lifestyle even if you didn’t mean any offence by it im still offended, just because I prefer to spend a lot of my time on the internet or rather not going out all the time and talking to “real” people does not mean I don’t know about the world and it certainly doesn’t give anyone the right to post such a thing a in a very public place like here, tho il say no more about it.   Well sorry again to anyone who was offended by that, it was in no way meant to do so, but it did give us something to talk/read about, thats why we are here after all.
