Ended up wasting some minutes  travel time like that but it worked out. If I was a tourist tho, i'd have been seriously SOL cause SC backwoods r nothing to mess with. lol, you liable to mess around n have some indians jump out on you n rain your vehicle with arrows n crap. As soon as I got to Anderson then hooked up on I 85, the rest was a piece of cake. I wasn't even drowsy on the drive there either...had all my rap albums on near full blast to thank for that. Usually I get sleepy during long journeys, but my adrenaline was pumping and I was ready for the events ahead. A brotha couldn't get to ATL fast enough. A few hours later, I did however. Despite a traffic jam  some white kid jumping out of the back of an SUV doing jumping jacks...naked...all the transitions went well. The reservations at the Holiday Inn went smoothly. I thought they overcharged my card tho. Man at the front desk asked for my card again, which, theoretically, defeated the purpose of me using it online. Room looked nice...equipped with a king sized bed with good springs. Enough cable channels to keep me occupied, a wonderful looking restaurant in the lobby. Bathroom was stacked pretty well...even took a picture of it. Be nice if it had a spa lol. man that would have opened up some interesting possibilities :-) It was a weekend of optimism...the fulfillment of dreams that have bubbled in my mind for going on two months. It was time for the truth to be told.   urlLink My Baby's blog  tells essentially every key detail of how that weekend turned out. Ladybird was so thoroughly able to capture the look n feel of the events as they progressed that it seemed like she was taking notes from rolling video. I used to have a memory like that... I guess they all died from thinking too much. As you can tell, it wasn't my best work...that weekend. Not much went the way I expected it to, and apparently, I was the main one responsible for that. Speechless....I have never truly been speechless!! ME??? Not THIS homeboy!!! Maybe it wasn't always intelligent, eloquent or thought out, but I always expressed what was going on inside. Speechless tho, that's what I was. Fully unable to find words to express how I felt inside...only partially able to explain my reasoning. It was something I could see...something I could feel...yet found myself unable to express.  I wanted her to know how special she was in my life, to show her what the meaning of true love is. I wanted to make love to every aspect of her being...still want to, and still planning on it. And I wanted to go some places, maybe ride around downtown Atlanta, see some sites, take some pictures, just enjoy each others' company. But there was always somewhere hidden in the back of my mind, this resilient moral compass that spoke at sundry times. It reminded me of how  why I made that promise I made that night, that I would not grace her gates without a ring involved. It reminded me of how I felt at the very thought of looking into her eyes  seeing forever, which resolved in my heart then  there that I wanted to wait for my woman. That's my baby...my personal playtoy...but more importantly, my best friend  everything that has meaning in my life.  My willpower, as she found out, is legendary. How I was able to be in the position I was in  not slither my anxious rod inside her dripping wet cavern of ecstasy is beyond my knowledge. Her body is just..............................................................................................wow! But to a point, it should never have gotten that far. If it was my desire to save her precious gift, I should have never led her to believe that she would lose it...twice. Heaven knows I want to be inside of her, to feel her heat contract around my throbbing manpole. So many times i've dreamed of watching her luscious breasts jump up  down as she straddles me, leaking juices all over my crotch area. In my mind, i've spilled my release on every part of her body...especially down her crack, so I could watch my juice roll down her kitty lips then drip onto the sheets. We talked about sex a lot since the promise. Even came to a point where we left it at a place of open possibility if the occasion ever presented itself. But a promise means everything to me, even if it was created by the person in question who desires to rescind on it. So that's why I would have been content to let her get hers  me not even whip it out. If I ended up tasting her sweetness as my tongue was dying to do, that promise was all but ended.  I keep searching all life  reality to see if I did the right thing, to validate if my abstaining from full copulation had any merit. In all reality............perhaps this is emotions talking....but I don't think I did. To get that far  not finish what was started...that should be a federal offense, punishable by the slicing of the penis/ clit respectively! If I was truly concerned about the consequences, they would have paled in comparison to the significance of the moment. Two young lovebirds, actively expressing their love for each other...one for the first time...  *sigh*  I thought I had been in love before...but then I met Mellanie...and my whole world changed.  Late Sunday morning, I left the city of Atlanta, amid a rainstorm and a sea of unfulfilled wishes....but I still had my babys' heart, and she still had mine. And she always will.
