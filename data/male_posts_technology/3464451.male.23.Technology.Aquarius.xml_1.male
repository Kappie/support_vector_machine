Coincidence?? hmmmm....  playing in the right might do that to me....   work has been fairly slow and this is the first sunday I have had off in like FOREVER....  my work is having a sell on dvd's today, so I thought I might go out there and get some...  sick and all...   movies, are movies though...... well take care, maybe I will get better soon to post more, but right now, going to go back and lay in bed....  is there one movie you could watch over and over again and not get tired of it....  ;)
