I was raised on spell checker (some of you older folks may not be able to apprecaite this one, but hey, you're old and set in your ways). 2.  I am trying to articulate so much, so quickly, that I simply don't notice that level of deatil......strange for a Virgo...huh?  In the event that you notice a grammer or spelling error, please hold your fucken breath until you hit the floor.  Thank you for your support.
