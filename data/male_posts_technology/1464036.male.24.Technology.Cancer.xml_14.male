N. of San Antonio) to visit with Christie's grandmother, grandfather and aunt.  Hope to get to spend some more time with Andy (high school friend and a groomsman in my wedding next month).  We got to talk for a while last night.  Thouroughly enjoyed it, got to catch up with him.  Hope all is well with everyone.  ILY
