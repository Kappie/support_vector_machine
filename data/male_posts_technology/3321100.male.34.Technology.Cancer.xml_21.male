I know it was normally for kid, but I'm a great kid :$ There is in Harry Potter story a thing that Dumbledore used (and Rogue too in the number 5), who's called "Pensine" I don't know if the world is the same in English. It's a recipient where you can put all your thought. In fact I had the same thing, it's..... My blog !!!! Yes, I put all my thought here, and I could read it later. Funny no ???  If you want to read an interview of J.K. Rowling, read it here, it's in English and in French, and it's a great French  Website about HP Story    Interview de J.K. Rowling du 4 mars 2004
