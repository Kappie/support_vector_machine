War is still an ugly, tiring, destructive thing that hurts people, sometimes permenantly.  I think that second marketplace that was hit (the one that killed 50+ Iraqi civilians) was planted by Iraqi security forces -- the timing was too convenient, and they didn't do anything to restrict reports from reporting on it -- even better -- they  encouraged  reporters to go there and see for themselves.  We're in for the long-haul, kids. So sit back and stay tuned.   Finally, it still stirs something very primal in me to see 65 tons of depleted uranium and hardened steel churning across a desert at 55 miles an hour.... Does anyone else want to agree with me if I said I missed my calling as a tank commander?  P.S. Don't be misled by that 1.3 million number for our armed forces -- a solid majority are not involved in actual combat.... The Army is going to be so committed to Iraq that if something else happens (North Korea, anyone?), we're going to be in deep kimchee....
