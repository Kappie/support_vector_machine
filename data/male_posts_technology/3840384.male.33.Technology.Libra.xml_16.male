I have some friends, who I would otherwise consider very intelligent, that claim there are two types of people:  A) [Ignorant] Republican Bush-lovers (well, for them the bracketed part is implied)  B) People who liked  Fahrenheit 9/11   Now I really must fuck up their little categorization scheme, since I do not fall into either category.   FOR THE RECORD I cannot stand Bush, and if there is anything that pisses me off more than the stuff Bush does, it is the fact that Kerry is the best candidate that the democrats could find to run against the guy. /FOR THE RECORD  But Michael Moore's "documentary" seems aimed at hammering in the point without admitting any of the counterpoint. Now anyone who has spent time in a court of law (or at least watched some  Law  Order  over the last decade) knows that anytime you do not admit your opposition's points   in order to dismiss them   that you have weaknened your case because now the opposition has something to talk sbout. In this case, there are all the gaping problems in the movie that Senor Moore chose to not talk about. Now, everyone in my friends' Category 'A' will have something to use an excuse to defocus the very real questions that he brought up in his "documentary" film.  Now these friends of mine claim that if this had been done, the movie would not be as useful. But I refuse to believe that Michael Moore would not be able to be just as incendiary had he taken the time to make an actual  documentary  rather than a propoganda piece like he did. Since his supposed goal was to truly have some influence in the election, he could have spent a little more time and treated the American public a bit more intelligently, and had a greater effect.  In my opinion the biggest problem we have today is that there simply  is  no one who would be good for the job (at least not anyone who is in the running).  Ok, end political rant.
