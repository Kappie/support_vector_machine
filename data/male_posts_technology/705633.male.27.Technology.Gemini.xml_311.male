I can't believe this has happened to me.  I hate the things and never wanted one in the first place but I left mine at home today and I feel a bit lost without it.  Just in case you haven't worked out what I'm talking about it's Mobile Phones.  I could never understand how people could text each other so much.  Surly you can make a quick 2 min phone call and let the other person know what you want to say rather then typing into your phone for 30 secs.  But now I find myself doing it.  I even had an argument with a girl last night over my phone.  It was pathetic and all sorts of misunderstandings were made.  Then I ran out of credit so I assume the girl just thinks I have stopped talking to her.  How are you supposed to change someone’s mind about you by typing into a phone?  I wish people were that easy to explain but we are quiet complicated creatures. I really don't understand some women.  They want to be treated like Princesses but want to treat you like a Castle servant.  I had a great weekend with Andy over.  I even gave her a lift to the Harbour on Sunday Morning so I could see more of her.  Although I think she was only present in body and not mind.  I have spent the last couple of days tidying my flat up as it looked like a clothes sorting house for Oxfam.  I won’t be embarrassed to take anyone back there now.
