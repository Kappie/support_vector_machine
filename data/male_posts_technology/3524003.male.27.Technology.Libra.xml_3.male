It took 1 full day to settle the problem.. but little do I know that it is the beginning of a horrible week for me...will get to that later. After my work, got to go back to my old work place and fetch my dear from work. And we headed down to Great World for dinner,as well as 'MOD' the X-box, cos my BRO will be returning the next day. And my dear was so kind enough to pay for it 1st!! *Muaks* *muaks* to you. We also had company, one of our good friend to join us for dinner. My dear paid for dinner too!! DOUBLE *muaks* *muaks*. After all that is said and done, we all went home and had a rest...so much for this day...
