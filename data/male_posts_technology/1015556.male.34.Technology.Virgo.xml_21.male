Session 5. 1.  finish the studies about The Story of His Glory 2.  email the list of 5-7 questions to two or three missionaries you or your family support.  also send me the list and I get to send them out to two or three that  I support. 3.  Do these studies based on Paul and his missionary journets.  (If you are reading this blog, somehow, and are interested in these studies, email me and I will send them to you.  However, they are based on material covered in Perspectives.) K leaves for college in 10 days or so, so I think the final step would be to put together a survey to see what he found the most helpful. That would be kind of fun.  In other developments, met a guy named Dan the other night from a local church, who came and did a presentation about God's Mission to the college age worship night at GCC.  Very cool.  And then they showed the  video for Urbana 03.  I think the majority of my dteam guys are interested, very very cool.  I think Dan and I might dialogue about mobilization, which would be great.
