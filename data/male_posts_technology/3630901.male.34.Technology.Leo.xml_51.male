Actually, when I've taken the MBTI in the past, my scales are usually in between INTP and INFP.  It's scary how either of these personality types fit me so accurately.  I say scary because MBTI only has 16 personality types, and it's always nice to believe that we're so much more unique individuals than that!   There are good links on these two pages describing more about the personality types and their meanings in different facets of life.  Reading about my strengths and weaknesses in relationships, for example is both re-affirming and eye-opening (somewhat contradictory, nonetheless true).  My  urlLink Bloginality  is  urlLink INTP !!!  Or maybe  My  urlLink Bloginality  is  urlLink INFP !!!
