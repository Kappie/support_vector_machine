     
      Mycgiserver.com, which provides free entry-level J2EE hosting to over 26,000 members, has avoided the need to shutdown. Javalobby.org will support the struggling service, which joins its growing Java developer advocacy network. Horst Reiterer will continue to run Mycgiserver.com, and all are invited to particpate in helping expand its offerings.
