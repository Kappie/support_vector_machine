Fresh turned twanky one (21).  Craig's travels took him to Monteville, NJ hometown of Doug E. Fresh to do some drinkity drinkity.  The five kegs were fun, but the ice block shots were Craig's favorite.  Too bad our other "brother" took a nasty fall down the stairs cracking his head open a bit.  Things turned out OK though, all he needed was a little assistance from the local hospital and 10 *staples* in the head :-)  The two from the den of sin and weirdness are up to their usual, sleeping with some shady bitches in the 'ville.  Boring Saturday night at Autumn, but the night is young, so Craig hopes for the best.    Beat it, Craig
