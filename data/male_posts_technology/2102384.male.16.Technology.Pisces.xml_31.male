I started an archive of them yesterday.  I used this opportunity to test out the use of very simple HTML and multiple style sheets.  I used javascript to change the style sheet and save/load the user's last style sheet in their cookies.  I experimented with floating DIVs, creating content before and after commands and many other cool CSS tricks.  The archive is licensed under a very non-restricting Creative Commons license (as expected) and I'll change the archive if you contact me about it.  Oh.... and I also made an RSS feed for it from scratch.   urlLink Unofficial Dark Tips Archive
