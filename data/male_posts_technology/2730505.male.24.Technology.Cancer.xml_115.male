It's not really anyone's fault you know, it's just how the world goes.  It's crazy to think so but really stop and think about it for a second.  Think about your earliest success.  It was great, it provided growth and happiness but sometime after that there's a disappointment that evens things out.  Life is like a line filled with peaks and valleys.  There are points in your life where things are great.  Your happy and things couldn't go wrong.  There are also points in life where things don't go your way and everything goes wrong.  Yeah, shitty as it may seem, these little and big disappointments really are shitty.  There's no way around it but to deal with it.  Sometimes you can blame others for thier choices but sometimes you can't.  Things appear and change the course of your line.  I guess the real growth is how one deals with these changes personally.  I guess it's just a little dip here.  I really don't know why I had to write this down, maybe it's for my own self therapy.  Who knows?  I look forward to a better week.  I'm sorry you can' help things right now.  I wish there was something I can do to help you out but I can't think of anything.  I'm sorry.
