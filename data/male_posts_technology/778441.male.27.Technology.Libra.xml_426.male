Ratnam's line was, "Don't pre-judge the film". But I wonder where this  pre -judgement comes into the picture at all! Its been few weeks since Yuva was released and the question of  pre -judging it does not come into the picture at all! If the people haven't liked the movie and the BO collections don't show encouraging signs, there is precious little that the media can do about it!
