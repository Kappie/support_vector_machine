Linux on Low End systems had suggestions for trying different kinds of window managers. some discussion on linux on assembly. There were lots of chat like discussions educating users,but I guess they would be more informative only when read more patiently. kgpg was of help and I sent a mail to the author.  hope to check more and even contribute some.
