Of those, 45 have been killed since President George Bush declared the war in Iraq over on 1 May. Earlier this week, the Associated Press said its inquiries had established that at least 3,240 Iraqi civilians were killed in one month, between 20 March and 20 April.   One-quarter of all U.S. military deaths have occurred after the end of the war. Wow. I haven't been paying close enough attention to the newspapers obviously.
