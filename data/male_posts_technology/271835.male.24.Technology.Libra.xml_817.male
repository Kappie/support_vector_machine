One of these was the Fantasy Football site which was a bit disappointing as I was looking forward to the start of a new season.  It turns out that it will be closing at the end of the coming season which means we have a free, decent, online, automatically scored,   urlLink Fantasy Football  game at our disposal. With prizes.  So should we set up a league for the New Links regulars? Leave comments below if you want in - if I get enough positive responses I'll make sure we have a league up and running for the start of the competition on August 28th.
