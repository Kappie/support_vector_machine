Just a quick recap of what had transpired since my last update :  1) PC Fair was on last week and i bought me an early birthday present which was a Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra; a 30GB of pure music powerhouse. Yeah, been aiming this for a long time now and finally i got it. I just love this cool gagdet and man, it really rocks ! Hahaha .... 2) I watched Spider-Man 2 for the 4th time on Sunday. Was this movie worth to watch 4 times ? Not really but i had to fulfill some promises made to people .... So, this time around it was a promise made to Ms Sharon Y. That's it, no more bug movies for the next 6 months .... Except maybe for Alien Vs Predator which will be out end of Aug :D. 3) Boss wasn't around the whole of this week as he was on annual leave, hehehe .... Peace  Harmony all week long which ended with a "fertilizing" session ....  To be continued ....  Savvy ;)
