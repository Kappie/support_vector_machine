The Net MD player just isn't cutting it and Hi-MD doesn't seem to be the right solution either. I don't use my MD as a recording device and the iPod definitely beats carrying ATRAC discs. Besides, I already have an iTunes library.  Gizmodo shows you  urlLink how the ipod might look . In other updates, the home network is still down. That is the only explanation I have for the lack of new posts from me. Of course, all the time at work is taken up by getting used to C# and .NET so it has been busy. Ranju should have gotten engaged today, congrats to him (I'm pretty sure he doesn't even know this site exists). Waiting for him before I check out Spiderman 2! App is going to be away in Las Vegas for the next 2 days, FYI.
