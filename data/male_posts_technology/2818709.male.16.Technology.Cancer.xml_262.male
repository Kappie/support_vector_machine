People can say "it takes less time to get ready", and "it helps the non-rich kids be able to be popular because of their clothes". You know what? I don't believe that at all.  "It takes less time to get ready" No. Completely wrong. On Fridays, it takes me about 10 minutes to get ready. On Monday-Wednesday, it takes me about 15 minutes to get ready, and on Thursdays it takes me about 20 minutes to get ready. Why? Because I have to FIND the uniform. I don't have the $$ to go out and buy clothes for every day of the week. So, I have to wash them every other night. I usually end up laying it around somewhere, because I have homework to do, and I can't be bothered with clothes. On Thursdays, It takes me 20 minutes for basically the same reason, but I also have to make sure it looks decent.  "It helps the non-rich kids be able to be popular despite their financial situation". That may have been true in the 90's and 80's, but not now. You know what the "fashion" is now??!?? Grunge. Punk. You can get most of those clothes by going to a thrift store.  Now, it may just be me, but I think that the ASTEC uniform looks horrible. Grey, black, tan, and red. We all look like a bunch of losers. Idiots. I would NOT mind if ASTEC had a suit-like uniform. Guys wear suits, girls wear dresses. They look fine. They look spiffy. Our uniform makes us all look like Goths. That's another thing that makes me mad. When certain people tell other certain people that they should not wear gothic clothing. They make those people wear all black/grey the rest of the week, why not on Fridays? Our entire lives, we have been encouraged to be unique, and individual, but then, the dress code/uniform was invented. We all look the same. We all have to wear patches. You know who else made someone else wear patches? The Nazis. The Nazis made the Jews wear patches. I've heard the "it makes us be able to spot you in a crowd" excuse, too. That makes no sense. ASTEC is a small school. Everyone knows everyone. Everyone has at least SEEN everyone else. Make us all wear hats. ASTEC hats. Or, bright pink hats. You could spot someone wearing a bright pink hat in a crowd. Perhaps even easier than the grey/black uniform. Heaven forbid we go somewhere at night wearing the grey-black. Everyone would disappear!!! Another thing, have any of the uniform committee members been made to wear these atrocities?!??! We live in Oklahoma. It gets to around 100 degrees in the summer. 100 degrees + all black/grey outfit + humidity = DEATH FOR ASTEC STUDENTS. Why don't you just make our uniform all white? Oh. Wait. There was another group of people that had all white uniforms.  Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, I rest my case. Uniforms are Silly, Pointless, Impractical, Boring, Ugly, Hot, A Hassle, A Bother, A Hindrance, and a general problem.   Viva la resistance!!!  Long, no?...yeah. Long. And hard. mm...long and hard...
