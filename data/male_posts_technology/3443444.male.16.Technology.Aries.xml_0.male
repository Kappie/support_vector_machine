The way I lose at poker, goes like this. At the start, I win a couple of good sized pots, so I'm usually in chip lead for quite a while, until some lucky bastard gets the luckiest crap ever to fuck me out of $5 or so, and this happens a couple of times. Sure, I win a couple hands between those big hands, but it never equals the amount when I lose with my three of a kind, to the person who has the only 2 cards that could of possibly beat me. Its shit like that that makes me hate poker.  And after the horrible defeat today, I realized that there hasn't been a time in my life where I have actually been, really happy, theres always been something to ruin my life. Wether it be my brother fighting with my Mom like 8 years ago, or last October where I was depressed for a reason some of you probably know, or wether I've just been lonely, and have been alone for 16 years....  And school's almost out, hooray for that, but it also sucks, because I'm probably gonna get screwed out of an internship with HP because of my age, so I'll be sitting at home, staring at the wall all summer, with nothing to do, nowhere to go, and nothing to learn. and beacuse I spend most of the day in the lab, I'm failing 2 of my other 3 classes...so, yeah....  That's all I have to say about that.
