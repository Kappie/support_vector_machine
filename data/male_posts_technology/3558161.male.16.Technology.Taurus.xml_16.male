This blanket is so heavy No strength can lift it It's all closing in And I know what you think That this is where I give up But you will soon find out That I'm just getting started And if there's one thing that can get me Out of this place It's not anyone But me. I don't  need  anyone. And I don't  need  anything. And I'll  NEVER  stop fighting.  And the person that has betrayed me the most, that has changed the most, that hates "not being able to kick someone's ass", if you want to start with me, I'll knock your teeth down your  fucking  throat. I promise.  To the rest of you, that matter to me the very most: You will never know how much you affect me, in a positive way. CC, ME, AO, ES.
