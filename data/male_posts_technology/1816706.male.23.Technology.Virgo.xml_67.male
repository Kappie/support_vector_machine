Slits were put into certain spots to let the cap stretch a little bit and it didn't rip the box or anything, impressive.   Secondly, me and Andy have been drinking a fair amount of Natural Light (Natty), and we decided that we are going to stack it against the wall, so we have a wall of Natty going on... like I said... impressive.
