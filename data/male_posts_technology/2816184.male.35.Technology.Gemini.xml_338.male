Okay Tom - how about this.... there really is no way that you are leaving here with Zara, and if my guess is correct you have a choice - you can rationally put the gun down and start talking OR it will be taken from you. I give you 10 seconds to make your choice... (If he does not put the gun down I will spend 1 more point of Essence on Harmony the sluggish kind)
