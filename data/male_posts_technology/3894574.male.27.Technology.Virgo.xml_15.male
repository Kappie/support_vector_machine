Anyways, we went out to Red Lobster for our Anniversary tonight and our bill with a 33% tip came to $16. Then we went through the drive through at DQ cause she had been craving a Mocha Moo Latte, and I tried the Brownie Batter Blizzard. It was da BOMB! I'm not very much of a choc-o-holic but it was very delicious.
