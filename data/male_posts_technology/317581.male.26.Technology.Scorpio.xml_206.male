In other news... I'm still employed for about a week. I am trying to find something to do that is remotely computer/software testing related, but there aren't a whole lot of jobs out there right now.  It's nice to get off work after only 8 hours though. wow. Who knew what the world looked like when there was still a little sunlight out?
