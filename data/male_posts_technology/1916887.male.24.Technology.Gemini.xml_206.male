Due to the success of the penetration test (in a relatively very short time) I decided to share this experience with you."  This is a great walk through of the Chain of Events that lead a guy armed only with a domain name to gain admin control over a companie's mail server and network.  Great read.  {note: If anyone has any more "hack stories" like this, please send me an email (systemgod@gmail.com).  I love reading this type of thing.}
