Suck, suck, suckity suck. Uber suck to the N'th degree.Yesterday was the first day in ,what could very well be an entire  decade , where I sat down to watch around 3 hours worth of prime-time TV, and being that I could not find the remote to switch channels, I was forced to sit through the ads. Hordes of them. All inane, all repeating themselves every 10 minutes. I endured it all in order to catch Scrubs and The Education of Max Bickford, but just  barely . Normally, ads never bothered me 'coz I don't normally watch TV, but recently my sattelite tv channel has been showing some pretty decent stuff. Unfortunately it means I am now regularly subjected to the horror that is TV advertising.  Thank the Lawd I can switch channels during ad breaks. Although I have no doubt that TV channels will someday 'lock' channels during ad-breaks to force us to watch the lousy things. I lost the link, but there was some nutcase tv-exec interviewed on CNN or something a few months back, who was suggesting that switching channels during an ad-break was akin to theft. Yes, I know, how absolutely fuckin  bizarre . I tell ya, society is going straight to a neon-lit hell.
