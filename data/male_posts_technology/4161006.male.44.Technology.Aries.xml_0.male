It sounds pretty good. It's another deep, insightful poem. I remember when I was in the hospital after one of my surgeries. I had an internal infection and they didn't know if I was going to live. I wanted to see the sky, so the nurse wheeled my bed to the hall where there was a big window. I was giving up on life. I was dying. My wife was too fucked up on oxycontin and zanax to come see me. I was in the hospital for over a month and she only brought my daughter Tasha to visit me twice. The hall was glowing from the sunshine, and I thought maybe this is the angel's hall and they were coming to take me. I remember being wheeled to the window, and thinking if a crow comes to me, my time is up. I didn't see any crow.  I hiked the back trails at Core Creek Park to play my guitar and sing. It's peaceful back here. My local getaway. I saw several crow, and it reminded me of when I almost died in the hospital, looking for crow in the angel's hall. It's a beautiful day with cumulus clouds puffing up in the sky. A butterfly came to visit me. Was it a sign? The butterfly visited me and the crow flew away.  I can sense that my love is out there somewhere, and her spirit has found me. Watching, waiting, everywhere. I'll know her when we meet. I'm finding reasons to live. My life will be a good life. It's coming together now, but it still falls apart.  They say if a crow visits you, it's a sign of death. The crow didn't visit me today. Another reason to live. I'm up, I'm down, I'm up, I'm down.  It's all coming together now...  and it's falling apart again...    Falling Apart Again    Can you see the angel's hall Can you here the gypsy call Can you see clouds in the sky Can you here the reasons why  This is where I want to go To sing a song, to watch the crow I can sense you're always there Watching, waiting, everywhere  (Chorus) It's all coming together now And it's falling apart again It's changing like the weather now And it's falling apart again   I have seen the angel's hall I can hear the gypsy call I can see clouds in the sky Giving me the reasons why  This is where I'll always go Singing songs and watching crow And I know you're always there Watching, waiting, everywhere  (Chorus)  -
