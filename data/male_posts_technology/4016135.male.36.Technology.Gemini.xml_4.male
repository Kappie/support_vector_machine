Whether by instant messaging, messageboards, newsgroups, or heck, even online dating services, you meet all kinds of folks. For the most part people are nice and come across as half way intelligent. Then, there are the people out there who really should not be allowed anywhere near a computer. These are the people who, when you encounter them, you just have to say to yourself, "what the?".   Case in point, the ongoing message board thread here:  urlLink linky   Gone Gold is one of my favorite websites, mostly because of the messageboards. What sets the Gone Gold messageboards apart from the rest of the chaff available on the internet is that the members are generally a very informed, opinionated, but mature and civil group of people. Unlike your typical messageboard frequented by foul mouthed, juvenile little punks, acting like an ass-monkey is really looked down upon at Gone Gold. So of course, whenever one of the unwashed masses makes an appearance on Gone Gold to act like a goombah, the natives will jump all over him like hyenas to a carcass.   Here is the guy's initial post that sent the Gone Gold regulars into a frenzy:   Yall can call me U.2.K.  Here is my computer specs and short profile.  Intel Graphics Card/800x60016 or 24bit/8 Video Ram/Gateway/96Megs of ram  Real Name: Shawn Vegas/Male/22/Untouchable(yes believe it) I have 587 pc games, got xbox, n64, psx1,dreamcast, getting married dec 25th of this year, no kids, 8 baby kittens, 3 cars, business man, plan on changing the world reaaaaaaaaal soon, 12 tattoos, my fav band is: Smashing pumpkins and Dave Matthews and Stage.  Peace "W"   Let's dissect the this juicy target of opportunity, shall we?   Yall can call me U.2.K.  - Anyone who appoints themselves an acronym deserves to be drawn and quartered. Oh, and I'm still trying to find "Yall" in the dictionary. Maybe I should try the official ghetto/redneck dictionary.   Intel Graphics Card/800x60016 or 24bit/8 Video Ram/Gateway/96Megs of ram  - Dude, those are computer specs I would not be sharing with the world. With that kind of "power" you should be able to run Myst with no problem.   Real Name: Shawn Vegas/Male/22/Untouchable(yes believe it) I have 587 pc games, got xbox, n64, psx1,dreamcast, getting married dec 25th of this year, no kids, 8 baby kittens, 3 cars, business man, plan on changing the world reaaaaaaaaal soon, 12 tattoos, my fav band is: Smashing pumpkins and Dave Matthews and Stage.  - Oh lord, where do I start? Shawn is UNTOUCHABLE. Cue up "Can't Touch This" by MC Hammer. Yeah BOYYYYYYYYY!!!  I won't even ask about the kind of woman who is going to marry this guy, and if they decide to breed, yikes.  He's a businessman who plans on changing the world "reaaaaaaaaal soon". On another gaming messageboard, this guy posted a crazy plan about developing hundreds of Sega Dreamcast games by hiring a ton of people to do the work. Never mind that a) the Dreamcast is an obsolete game console that Sega abandoned almost four years ago, and b) all but the most hardcore gamers have either buried in the attic, sold or given away, or tossed in the local landfill their beloved Dreamcast. Now, if that's not changing the world, I don't know what is.  So, back to the messageboard thread in question, by posting this little introduction, our man Shawn opened himself to the most meciless barrage of abuse ever seen on Gone Gold. I mean, if you're going to leave yourself open as the butt of everyone's jokes, might as well leave an opening wide enough to fly a 747 through, right? Now, I know some people may see this and think that people are being mean ,or that I (gasp) am being mean. Hey, if you're going to show up out of nowhere, stand at the top of the hill and yell "Whassup Homies!!" in a place where this is clearly not the usual type of correspondence, well, you get what you pay for. The best part is that unlike a troll who will just post something and then disappear forever, the guy comes back several times to provide even more juicy targets for people to throw bombs at.  Anyhow, read the entire message thread for some hilarious posts. Poor Shawn never knew what hit him.
