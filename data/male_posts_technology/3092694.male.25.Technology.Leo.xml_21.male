If a database were a animal I imagine it would be a  Lamprey Eel.  The Lamprey Eel, for those of you unfamiliar with it:    "When attacking, the lamprey fastens onto its prey and rasps out a hole with its rough tongue."   - http://www.seagrant.wisc.edu/greatlakesfish/sealamprey.html   After which the eel sucks the guts and the very soul from it's prey.  That's kind of what the database does to me.  (sigh) I am a graphic designer, however my initial job description, and indeed my business cards read "Programmer."  (Fucking Hell!) So, some of these tedious programming duties still fall to me and my reluctant knack for techsavy.  But sweet reprieve! The Overlord, C.E.O., and all around master of large Chocolate Lab hounds has indicated that she would like us to leave early today if we so desire. I desire it so, and in 20 minutes or less I shall be speeding across the cityscape (sounds better than urban sprawlscape) on my shiny blue bicycle.  Happy day!
