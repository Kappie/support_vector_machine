We can convey feelings, dodge questions, inspire confidence by saying a few words... words that don't convey any meaning at all.      What is really amazing that this would not be possible without our own self dilusions and petty assumptions we make.       Sometimes it is nice to "chew the fat", but it amazes how some people can chew it all day.  Of course you know, when you chew the fat, you get a fat head.   It is amazing the amount of useless, unimportant, trival, and other synonyms amount of stuff one can recall and recite and amuse any standard wall with.  There is no room left for cognitive process, it would be a dangerous place if a lot more people had something to think about and were motivated by their thoughts.    Hmmm... I would be scared if I ever was motivated to act upon my thoughts ;)   How about you?
