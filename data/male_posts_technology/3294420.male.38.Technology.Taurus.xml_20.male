She ate her whole bottle in about 5 minutes then she sucked on her pacifier for about 30 minutes.  I wish that I could have captured it with a picture.  She crossed her little arms and held her pacifier in her mouth herself.  The physical therapist stopped by to see her.  Maya was smiling and making sheep noises (these are the coos of premies) the whole time that her arms and legs were being moved around.  I hated to put her back in the isolette as she was still wide awake when I left.  They have increased her bottle feedings to every two out of three.  It had been every other feeding previously.  Getting closer to her homecoming every day.  Love,  Gina.
