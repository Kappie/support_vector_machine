The same bartender, Victor, worked all the nights except the night I brought my camera, so I had to settle for a daylight picture without Victor.  Jamey discovered a very strong drink, Mojito, which was pretty much straight rum with a little lime juice and some sugar.  My drink of choice was lime daiquiris.  We also tried rainbow shots, lemon drop shots, and a shot called a BMW.  Good stuff.
