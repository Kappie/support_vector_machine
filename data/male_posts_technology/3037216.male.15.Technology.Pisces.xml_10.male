Eminem: "So the FCC won't let me be/well let me be me/so let me see/tried to shut me down on MTV/ but it'd be so EMPTY without me!!"  It's funny, I wonder how many of these FCC people go home, stub their foot in the door really hard and say "Gosh Darn! That SMARTS!"  well I have some words for the FCC: calm the farg down!  All of those FCC corksuckers can go farg them selves in the icehole! BYE BYE!  BTW:   urlLink Click here for a coupon for one free item of your choice at eBay!
