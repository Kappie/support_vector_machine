We are all happy enough though and had some of the best sights so far as we passed on through the Lake District. Some of the terrain can be quite a challenge as streams and paths seem to merge in this climate and climbing up water falls is as difficult as it sounds.  There were a few scary moments as Leo and Ed almost slid off a ledge into a river but managed to scramble to safety. It was fun to have Joel point out our river crossing errors only to immediately fall in himself.   We have taken a slight detour to Ambleside to get to the only place to stay in the area. Itâ€™s not the season for campsites and hostels and as camping wild during this stage can get us a one hundred pound fine each we decided to give it a miss.  Ben and Ed's home cooking, some friendly locals and radiators have made up for tramping through bogs and our other hardships.  Speak soon!
