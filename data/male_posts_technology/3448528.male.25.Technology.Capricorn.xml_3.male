I installed Greymatter on my website and I called it moobl. within a week it got hacked by some random hackers from indonesia. I was honored.  Then the webhost went bankrupt, i moved my site and didn't log on the web.  Then my friend told me he's blogging at blogger and got offered a GMail account. so I thought "i'll start to blog at blogger and get offered a gmail account" because my brain makes no sense like that.  So here I am, blogging for GMail. In the process I am rambeling on about stuff that noone cares about and in the end I will probably not end up with one of these coveted pre-release accounts but I can always hope...  later!
