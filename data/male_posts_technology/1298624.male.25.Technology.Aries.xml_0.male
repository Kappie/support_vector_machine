I've been thinking about it for the last three days and whether I needed one or not. While I don't code anymore, I'd really like to learn again and a laptop allows me to learn that while I'm somewhere else other than my desk. Sometimes you just don't want to be stuck sitting at a desk for so long.   I purchased an IBM Thinkpad T40. Rated to be among the best of thin laptops right now, it is lighter, sturdier, and made of quality parts so I don't have to worry that three years down the road, it'll break...cause it won't. Although this comes at a pretty price, I think it's worth it if the laptop will last beyond three years.
