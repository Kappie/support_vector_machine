And only three weeks left till i am leaving the U, S, OF AAAAAAAAAA. w00t, w00t. I am getting a little nervous, but not a much as I expected, it will all come out at the airport, one of those delayed phsycological thingamabobbers, There was somthing about it in my Phsycology course, but I dod the whole course in two weeks so I'll be damned if I remember all of it. Or even parts of it. I hope I can get a good camera before than, or atleast get my old one fixed. I do know that I will have a computer there of fot those non existant people who actrually READ my blog there will br crazy German thoughts in English. That makes no sense now but it will soon. I want to get me a Belkin I-Pod battery expantion thinga mabobber for the flight so i can listen to my newly aquired Silent Hill CD's. Till l8ter
