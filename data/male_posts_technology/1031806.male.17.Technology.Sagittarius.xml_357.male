Doubt that I'll repeat that this morning, but I'm well on my way.  I didn't really do anything today 'cept work on assorted computer stuff and clean my room(s). I removed that LAN I had running secretly into my upstairs room because I'm moving entirely down here and if I ever need it again, it's quite easy to reinstall... just need another half-hour with the house to myself.  Oh, Brent called me right after 11 tonight (... technically last night) and said that Tyler had run over to Bally but it had gotten dark and he needed a ride. Brent would have done it, but he was sick, so I got to get out of the house to give him a ride... I LOVE driving at night... hot nights. I'm getting better at driving with my knees; nothing beats blazing down TV highway at 70+ with the seat reclined and your hands behind your head with the windows down and the music blazing at midnight on a hot summer night. ;)  Dos cervesas~ ('two beers' in Spanish)
