So too bad I missed the beginning  of the  urlLink PBS  version which aired tonight in honor of the 50th anniversary of the play's  urlLink debut .  It's certainly strange to see all those stage directions acted out, and to feel the effect of all of those pauses.
  
As nice as it was, I don't think I'll be spending $150 on the 4 DVD  urlLink box set  containing filmed versions of all 19 of Beckett's plays.  How big is the market for that deal?
