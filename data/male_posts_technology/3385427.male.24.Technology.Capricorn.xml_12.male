I remember a time when the only people who actually hung around forums were the technical geeks. I remember a time when chat-sites were the ONLY way to converse online.  Things have changed since then.   Nowaways, forums are more generalised and allow room for open-ended conversation. Nowadays, forums have developed to a point where friends can be made (or lost...). I have found that more and more people have been gravitating towards the use of forums because of its many benefits, and at the same time, have been leaving the chat-rooms across the net, empty and bland.  I think the major contributor for this phenomenon is due to the fact that, unlike a chat-site or IRC, you have time to consider your responses and formulate your phrases. This is somewhat of an ego booster, as it can make even the densist character seem witty and intelligent. Perhaps someday, chat-sites will fall away altogether, leaving forums as the only means of online chat.  Doubtful, but hey, a man can dream, can't he?
