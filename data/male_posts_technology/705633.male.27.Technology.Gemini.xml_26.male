My MCSE studying is going well, i'm getting good results on the mock tests and getting my head around the finer points of Win2K wierdness..  In November I had a random text message from a strange number, saying "Friends leave their footprints in other people's hearts, and you left yours in mine". I replied "Did you want Adam in Jersey, because that's who you've got?" and the reply came back "Martin stop messing around". I decided to call the number, and spoke to a charming young lady called Donna form Nothern Ireland. The conversation was a bit strange but we kept in touch and have been good buddies since. She is back home in Northern Ireland for Christmas and returning to Jersey in a few weeks to work. She's a good buddy and I can't wait to meet up. :-)
