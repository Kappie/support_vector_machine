And i dont commit myself to just oging with one person if i get another offer then i will go, i went with darren. Maybe you should set a date early then i wouldnt have gone to see that with darren i would of seen sometihng else. You gotta get in tehre early with me cause i go to the cinema all the time even if there is only me and darren.
