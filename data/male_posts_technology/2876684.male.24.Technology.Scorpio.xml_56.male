Tonight a girl I knew messaged me about something and when I tried to start a conversation it was kind of like this...  "So how are you?"  "Fine."  "You know I might be in Brisbane for work one of these days."  "Ok."  Yea okay, I get the fucking hint. Why do I waste my time on these people? Can you spell "B-L-O-C-K-E-D"? *grrr*
