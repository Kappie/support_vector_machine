So at 4am I went to sleep, solidly, blissfully till midday. Excellent :D I've discovered my phone can take about 35 photos, before it is 'full', horrible rainy poo day anyway.. and needless to say I wasnt about to aggrivate my throat and chest with a brisk morning 2 degree rainy run. Not a lot else has really happened today :) omelette for lunch..  Sausages for dinner.. not sure what I'll do with them, casserole? maybe. Anyway, peace out :D
