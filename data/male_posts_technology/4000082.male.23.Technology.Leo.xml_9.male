Is this all that an IT Job is about? No there is much more than that.                 There is a very interesting phenomenon which takes place in corporate workplace.        That is the topic of this blog...CORPORATE WORK PSYCHOLOGY.                 Its very fun to watch human beings making a comment about other human beings. People        in a meeting never ask the same question and never share the same thought (sounds like a theorem).                Well its all about mindset people have. Most of them do not have open mindedness.                Why is this happening? Why can’t people free their mind?        Why can’t there be a dream corporation where everybody gives hand to everybody for advantage        of their individual development and that of the corporation.                 Corporations boast that they have great team which can deliver what they want…that’s it…that’s        What corporations are concerned of the damn end result. But do they know what goes on the mindset of an individual        in that team, the sub team members which is formed by neglecting a particular individual who is smart, out of the box        and finally the team as a whole which finally contributes the end result.                Well there might be some formula for this of how the weightage to the end result counts.                Here goes a fictious formula        0.4* (Sub-team contribution ) + 0.4 * (Smart individual contribution) + 0.2 * (Whole Team contribution) = END RESULT                Well…got anything from this…I write more about this in my next BLOG
