Anyway, hindsight is 20/20 and I'm living the hindsight life. Last night the upstairs bathroom leaked water into my befroom until about 12:30am. I didn't find out about it till around 11:30 and I don't know how long it was leaking before that.  The waiting is the hard part.I can't help wondering, hoping, worrying... maybe I'll go to bed early and I'll have a nice surprise... (Christmas memories come back like a flash) No, no surprises, I just want the job.   *sigh*
