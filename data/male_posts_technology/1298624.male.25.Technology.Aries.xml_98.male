Let's see... oh I could start off by saying that Edgar is a great cousin, who single-handedly brought me to L.A (:D), and deserves a better job. I know he can do better, and could accomplish whatever he sets his mind to (for the unexistant god's sake, he's learning japanese!).  Now Stephanie is a different story. Always mad, cursing, and flailing her arms everywhere. Just kidding! Stephanie, another great cousin. Seriously, you guys are my favorite cousin's (well I only know about 3 others, lol, but they don't even keep communication). I like how you are so charismatic and cheerful, bringing up the morale!  Ok now this sounds like a yearbook signature.  Edgar, never lose this blog thingy, as it will be a living testament of your insanity!  Happy 100th Post.
