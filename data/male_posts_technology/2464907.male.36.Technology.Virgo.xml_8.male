The box had the main small TV unit, antenna earphone, wrist band, external battery-pack, AC power adaptor and neck strap.  The TV unit itself measures 48x48x18mm and weighs 50g (my measurements), making it the smallest TV I have ever seen. The TV display itself measures 1.5" diagonal. Above the TV display is a digital Time indicator. NHJ (the manufacturers) did a great job to make the wearable TV versatile to use. I could either snap the TV unit on the wrist strap to wear it as a Wrist Watch, attach the neck strap to wear it or clip it onto the external battery unit to get extended power. The external battery-pack functions also as the charging station for the VTV-101. Because the TV unit is very light, wearing it at the wrist is quite comfortable. With 18mm height the Watch is definitely bulky, but acceptable. The wrist band is a free adjustable Velcro band.
