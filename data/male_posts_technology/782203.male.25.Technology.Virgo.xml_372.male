The fight scenes were totally amazing (but extremely gory) and the movie was full of hot ass chicks, the hottest of which was this Japanese girl dressed in a school uniform. I don't normally go for that but this gal was like evil to the bone, and for some reason it was such a huge turn-on. I almost orgas when she asked this guy at a bar whether he wanted to f**k her or not. OK ya I know I need help. But seriously she can slice my gut anytime! Well then of cos there is Uma Thurman, She had a baby during the shooting of the movie, but you won't even notice it cos she looks so damm hot in the movie. Dialogue-wise it was very interesting but nowhere near Pulp Fiction, but afterall it's a homage to the Samurai and Kungfu movies of days yonder (me trying to sound cheem). But still an amazing movie, probably the best movie I seen in quite a while, and I wanna see it again !! (HINT) Preferably with a chick (HINT HINT) But R(A) hor.     calm these hands before they snare another pill and drive another nail down another bleeding(needy?) hole please release me     Gravity by A Perfect Circle
