Eventually I'll line it with 1/4" Spanish cedar. I'm going to need to do some additional work because of its odd dimensions.   I don't want to store my cigars on edge, so I have this 5-ish" by 11-ish" dimension to work with. I'm thinking of building a wooden tray or two and then stack them (its 8-ish" high. We''l see how it goes.  I bought an old cedar cigar box off of eBay. Still waiting for it to arrive. I am going to clean it up and oil the exterior. We'll see how we a Drymistat can keep it humid. I'm betting it will be a losing battle.  I bought a cheap punch that lacks an easy way of disposing of the plug. I did not do my homework there. Make sure if you go with a punch to get one that will eject the plug of Tobacco. Otherwise, whatever coolness and class you exuded by plugging in the first place is all lost (and then some) as you begin flinging and banging the punch on some hard surface and you try to knock the plug loose. It is not a pretty sight.
