There are no role models and no one to look forward too. Even if at the national level there might be some people, the small constituencies are just empty.  But still I have casted my vote, twice in the last few years. I think when democracy gives us so much - which we take for granted - we must as citizens of a democracy play our role of keeping that democracy intact.  The election results have shocked most indians including me. It never looked that Congress could return to power after what was going with the economy. May be its anti-incumbency or strong campaign of the Congress which tackled weaknesses of the BJP, the fact is democracy and the citizens of india have given their verdict.  What appears more shocking to me after the election that people still making a hay of an indian citizen of foreign origin holding the post of prime minister - as a big issue. We the same people talked tremendously and extended support when people of indian origin earned laurels in foreign lands - Mahendera Chaudhary became prime minster of Fiji, Bobby Jindal ran for Lousiana governor or may be for any other non-political post.   I am not defending any particular person or party but I am trying to have a debate on why a post like prime minister cannot be open for indian citizens of foreign origin. If one finds a person incompetent or lacks experience, then one should tackle it on that front. I myself strongly oppose some policies of the Congress party. But I think the world in which we are living today, we have to grow and be independent and think about competencies rather then an individual's origin. I was never taught at school to distinguish people based on their origin. Let India the greatest democracy, take a step ahead and show what a democracy is meant to be.
