Dogs have a natural, inborn philosophy toward the life they live. It doesn't matter where they are or who they are living with. You can learn some good attitudes to follow by observing what a dog does and enjoys.       Questions you may have about this are:           What can I learn from such an animal?         Can this be applied to business?         How does that relate to my life?          18 things to do       Observing what dogs do can teaches us how we can lead a better life. The following list of 18 things dogs do--written by an unknown author--points toward attitudes to follow:      Never pass the opportunity to go for a joy ride    Allow the experience of fresh air and the wind in your face to be pure ecstasy.   When loved ones come home, always run to greet them.   When it is in your best interest, practice obedience.    Let others know when they have invaded your territory.   Take naps and then stretch before rising.    Run, romp and play daily.   Eat with gusto and enthusiasm.   Be loyal.   If what you find lies buried, dig until you finally get it.   Never pretend to be something you're not.   When someone else is having a bad day, be silent, sit close and nuzzle gently.   Thrive on attention and let people touch you.   Avoid biting when a simple growl will do.   On hot days, drink lots of water and lie under a shade tree.    When you're happy, dance around and wag your entire body.    Delight in the simple joy of a long walk.   No matter how often you are scolded, don't buy into the guilt and start to pout. Rather, run right back and make friends.      In conclusion       We would all lead happier lives if we followed these 18 principles, taken        from observing the way dogs act.    You must lift a leg to do things...ha ha...with Regards,  Mahen
