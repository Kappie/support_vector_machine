My take on the issue:  Rini, It is difficult to maintain the same level of thinking right through a discussion that too a discussion that is interspered with lots of interferences in the form of time zones, geographical boundaries and other things.   Why, it is difficult for people sitting face to face to continue a discussion for more than two hours. Tell me what end should a topic be discussed.   The Third Law of Online Discussions says "There will be a death of the discussion after a point of time." The corollary says that after such an event, it is not wise to continue a discussion.  If this law is not valid, we would still be discussing about the "which came first, the chicken or the egg?". Hope you get it.  Is it interesting? Maybe we should try a discussion on "the effectiveness of harakiri vis-a-vis other traditional self killing methods" or "the correlation between lunar orbit and the growth of deep-sea anemones". Both seem to be interesting. If Darwin's theory could be brought into context here, you'll find that only the fittest survive or only the interesting threads survive.  The Fourth Law of Discussions (also known as the Law of Threading) states that "discussions will lead to discussions". This discussion is an example.  More after lunch,
