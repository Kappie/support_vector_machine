I suppose... run out and take off your pants on that day.     urlLink No Pants Day.com  has a quiz that tells you what you should be wearing on this august day (not AUGUST... it's in May).  Here's what I got... not sure I'm ready for that.                         You Should Wear Your Girlfriend's Panties!
