These people have an underlying need to feel superior to those around them so they concoct elaborate mind games that they play out with friends and lovers in which the only person that knows the rules is the person that created the games to begin with. No one can “win” these tests of intelligence because no one else knows that they are playing a game and even if they do figure out that the other person is playing mind games with them they certainly aren’t going to understand the ground rules.  In this way, the person always seems to be winning in their own heads and therefore posses more intelligence than the people around them. Their entire lives are spent manipulating people so that they can feel superior in some way. Obviously these people suffer from severe emotional problems, the first of which is a total lack of self-esteem. They are unable to find self worth in the normal day-to-day things that most of us do so they must create elaborate fantasies in their minds in which they always come out the more intelligent, creative, thoughtful person.   The biggest problem with befriending these types of people is that they are completely detached from reality. They go through life with an unusually inflated ego that has no basis in reality. These people will think themselves far superior to those around them in innumerable ways and nothing in the real world will convince them otherwise because they are living in their own separate reality.  I should give an example. My now ex girlfriend Wendy is one of these people. Her ego is inflated beyond any rational explanation given the true facts of her life up to now. How did this happen? Well, it seems, Wendy is always playing out games in her head and all the people in her life are just the pawns she moves around. Every word spoken by other people and every event around her is woven into her sick perpetually running fantasy.   How did I figure this out? Well the fantasy she creates in her head is so far removed from the reality around her that it leaks out in almost every day-to-day conversation.   In her mind, she is a genius. In her mind, she is a successful writer. In her mind, the people around her just don’t understand her. In her mind, she is happier being alone. In her mind, she is a self-sufficient woman and that has gained everything in her life through her own hard work. In her mind, she is a heterosexual woman. In her mind, she has an enormous amount of close personal friends. In her mind, she is truthful and faithful to a fault. In her mind, she is the best of friends. In her mind, she has never lost and argument. In her mind, all her relationships have failed due to some fault in the other person. In her mind, she is a successful businesswoman. In her mind, she is this vibrant younger looking woman from years of hard work and exercise. In her mind, she is a caring loving individual. In her mind, she is a very creative person. Let’s look at the facts.  “In her mind, she is a genius”. This is the most laughable one. I had recently taken an IQ test and scored a good, but not genius, 134. I was happy about it and shared it with her. Her immediate response was “so what, I scored 165 when I was younger”.  I almost fell over laughing. While she is certainly a bright girl, this wasn’t someone that could deal with spatial problems in her head. This wasn’t someone that was adept at math. This wasn’t someone that any special skill in any area other than a decent, although not especially remarkable, understanding of the English language. A 165 IQ is reserved for people that are well beyond the norm. A 134 is in the 97th percentile (as I recall) and a 165 would make them in the 99.999th percentile. This is not such a person. I take nothing away from her intelligence, but I would never have considered her more than average.   “In her mind, she is a successful writer”. She actually has “writer” listed as her profession on her Yahoo profile. Her profession is “Marketing Manager”, although I gave her a loftier title so as not to bruise that extra large ego. Her previous jobs were, PR manager and various other marketing and PR manager supporting roles. Although she is a very good editor, in the year that I have known her I have not seen published works other than some of her old PR work. I have not seen manuscripts lying about. I have not read her book of poetry. The facts are clear. She is no more a writer than I am and her profession certainly isn’t “writer” unless you consider creating and editing marketing literature for a tech company “writing”. It is just more proof of her fantasy world.  “In her mind, the people around her just don’t understand her.” The reality is that most of the people around her understand her perfectly. Her friend Sandy had her pegged as a selfish individual who was more interested in talking about herself than in listening and helping Sandy with her substantial issues. Her ex husband Tim predicted her entire meltdown here in Massachusetts and the ultimate outcome of it all. He did this several months in advance! It seems that every friend I met of hers understood her perfectly as do Scottee and I.  “In her mind, she is happier being alone”. That couldn’t be farther from the truth. She has always had a roommate of someone living with her until now. In moments of truthfulness, she admits that her worst bouts of depression happen when she is alone. She has admitted that her alone times is when her negative self-talk is at it’s worst. This is why she surrounds herself with a ton of acquaintances. She can’t stand to be around any one person for more than twenty-four hours, so she has a multitude of acquaintances so that she can be around different people each day and not be alone.   “In her mind, she is a self-sufficient woman and that has gained everything in her life through her own hard work”. She stated to me once, in her usual fury, that I just couldn’t stand a strong independent woman. Nothing could be further from the truth. I love a woman that isn’t dependent on others and that can think on her own. Wendy just isn’t one of those people. She is 35 years old and hasn’t done a much of anything “on her own” yet. She was late going to college. Her parents paid for that until they mysteriously stopped and she had to drop out. She did however finish college through correspondence courses that were paid for by someone. To this day she hasn’t been forthright about who paid for them. The house she “owned” when I met her, turned out to be owned by her parents. She paid them rent. She claimed that a few years ago, she struck up an agreement that her rent money would go towards purchasing the house, but when she moved out to Massachusetts her parents mysteriously claimed that the agreement never occurred. She filed for bankruptcy after her divorce because, and I quote here, “ my parents wouldn’t give me money to pay my large credit card bills”. Does this sound like an independent woman? Every thing in her life up until now has been handed to her on a silver platter. I got her the job in Massachusetts. Scottee found her the house and made arrangements for her to move out. I talked to the movers when there were problems. We both helped her settle in to her new surroundings after being asked for help. There has always been someone else helping Wendy along the way. I have known many strong women, Scottee being a great example. A strong woman isn’t one with strong opinions, or one that can do everything on her own in life. A strong woman is someone that knows her limitations but is always trying to improve herself, not someone with strong opinions trying to hide their limitations. I give you more proof of the fallacy.  “In her mind, she is a heterosexual woman.” The fact is she had a love affair with a woman and professed to be “in love” with her. The fact is that she downloads lesbian porn and frequently masturbates thinking of being with a woman sexually. I certainly don’t think that it makes her a lesbian, far from it, but it also is proof that she isn’t the heterosexual female she claims to be. This is stark proof that she lives in her own fantasy world where her fantasy world is the polar opposite of reality.  “In her mind, she has an enormous amount of close personal friends.” The reality is that she rarely speaks to any of these friends. She claims to have between 5-10 “best friends”. I have known her for a year now and have met three of her friends. Three. Most of these people live out of state, which helps Wendy because of her severe phobia of being around other people for prolonged periods of time. These so-called “close friends” are really just email and sparse phone conversations that might take place over the year. Just enough information is passed between them to catch each other up on what each person is currently doing with himself or herself. These conversations are rarely if ever about anything meaningful. Emotions are not discussed. In the year we were with her she told only two “close friends” about her supposed love affair with us. Both of these people were male and one was an ex husband whom she lived with and couldn’t exactly keep it secret from. The reality is that none of her friends know much about what goes on in her day-to-day life, and none of these friends know the complete story of Wendy. She likes it this way because it perpetuates her fantasy that she is some mysterious person with a rich and meaningful life. The reality again says the complete opposite.   “In her mind, she is truthful and faithful to a fault.” This is the second most laughable fallacy. I can’t think of anyone I’ve ever met that lies as much as Wendy. She’s a compulsive liar that lies even when there is completely no reason to. The list is way to long to put into this post but here are some examples. She has lied over one hundred times about being late to work. These lies range from the reason why she was late, to lying about what time she arrived at work. She has lied about her reasons for breaking off prior dates. She has lied about her past. She has lied about being a writer. She has lied about her friends. She has lied about smoking. She has lied about snooping on my computer. She has lied about her whereabouts and she will stare you straight in the face and lie about what she is thinking and feeling at all times. I don’t think I have ever gotten a straight answer out of her but then I don’t think she would know how to tell the truth about herself. Being secretive and manipulating the truth is more of Wendy living in her fantasy world. In Wendy’s mind, being evasive and untruthful is part of the game. She wins if you don’t catch the lie and therefore she is the smarter person (in her mind). The biggest problem with this part of the game is that she also assumes that because she is always being evasive and untruthful, that everyone else around her must be doing the same thing. It has led to Wendy having severe trust issues. She is always looking to catch someone in a lie so she can “win” while at the same time being ultra evasive so she can win on both sides. It’s comical when you think about it since, as most rational people know, winning and losing isn’t the point and when you choose to believe that it is, you waste your whole life away being paranoid of those around you.  “In her mind, she is the best of friends.” This is a common mantra from Wendy.  The truth again lies far from this statement. Wendy has no clue of what friendship is. She is a user in the foulest way. The biggest part of Wendy’s game is the game she plays with those she calls friends. She feeds off their kindness and generosity while giving back the bare minimum. Wendy would expect that if she were having a bad day and needed a shoulder to cry on, that you would come running. Wendy would expect you to pay most of the time when going out, while saying afterwards, “you didn’t have to do that, I would have paid my own way”. It goes on and on. When she needs to talk, you need to be there for her. When she is feeling blue, you should have guessed at it. When she is angry, you should just understand that and not take offense to her taking it out on you. Wendy talks about Wendy, she doesn’t listen. She doesn’t ask. She doesn’t care to know. You can talk as long as it isn’t about anything serious or anything about emotions. She’ll call you when she is bored and wants to go out, but wouldn’t think of going out if she isn’t in the “mood”. In one year’s time, Wendy has never called or done anything that Wendy didn’t want to do. She expects you to be at her beck and call but also expects you to understand that she is an independent woman and needs her space when you need her. A great example of this was when my little girl was very sick one night and we needed to take her to the hospital. Scottee and I were very distraught and needed company to calm us, so I called Wendy and asked if she’d keep us company. It was about 9pm, she wasn’t asleep, but all I got back from her was, I’m sorry to hear she is sick, but I really have to sleep. Good luck tonight. I hope everything goes well. If it means getting up before 9am in the morning she will not meet you at the airport because it’s too much trouble. I’ve never seen someone as callous as her. I remember a conversation before we started going out that should have given me a clue. Her best friend Sandy was going through a rough emotional time and wanted to go down to southern California with Wendy to take her mind off things. Wendy, didn’t want to go because she didn’t want to “deal with her crap”, she did end up going, but she very quickly ended up doing her own thing while there so she wouldn’t have to “be a friend”. That is typical Wendy. If she isn’t talking, she isn’t listening. The last quote I’ll leave you with is one she gave early on in our relationship. She had just trampled on Scottee’s (her lover’s) feelings by doing something callous, and I had written an email to her asking her why. Her reply? Hey, I’m not responsible for other people’s feelings. That sums it up.  She sets new records in selfishness. Her comments of “I would do anything for her/him”, actually mean, I would do anything for her/him as long as it doesn’t interfere with something I had planned and as long as it doesn’t discomfort me in any way. It’s all a game.  “In her mind, she has never lost and argument.” This one best describes her games. When confronted with an issue that someone has about her behavior or something that she has done or said, she never loses the argument. Why? It is because she doesn’t argue. She uses deflection, which is a simple form of manipulation. If you were to say to her “I can’t believe you cancelled plans you had made with me” she would respond by saying something like “Well I can’t believe you think I’m always late to meetings”. Instead of responding to the actual issue, she deflects the argument and redirects the argument back to you. This puts you on the defensive and the original argument is forgotten, or if it is remembered later, she’ll use defection again until the subject is dropped, or you are so angry over her blind accusations (usually she deflects arguments with some preposterous statement out of left field to really throw you off balance) that the argument then becomes about YOUR anger. In one year’s time, I have never had her actually discuss anything that has been brought up about her behavior. She either uses deflection or simply stays silent and leaves. The dastardliest game of hers is after the argument. She will either do one of two things. She either, stays angry with you and refuses to talk to you until you decide to drop the subject and just move on, or she will actually apologize and admit “I have issues” and I need to work on them. The second choice is by far the most manipulative. Since she has admitted fault, you can’t bring the subject up even to ask her what she is admitting to, and then since she has admitted fault, she never actually has to change! She can just claim that she is trying hard the next time she does the exact same thing! This is what ended up being the last straw for Scottee and I. She has admitted to us that she has some real emotional problems and that she really wanted to try and work them out. She then said I need time to work them out so she could actually do nothing! If we complained about her not seeing us and being callous, she just could say we weren’t being understanding of her problems and proceed to have a reason to be angry at us and not talk to us for weeks. If we said nothing, she could just carry on like there wasn’t an issue and ignore our concerns altogether. It was a win/win for Wendy. She could do exactly as she pleased and continue to use us when she wanted company and forget us when she did not (which was 11 days out of 12) We finally realized that she was playing this huge game and we were falling right into it by caring. We stopped the cycle by not confronting the behavior and not going out with her when she asked. We used the same game back. When asked if anything was wrong, we would say no, but then used lame excuses to not see her or go out.   “In her mind, all her relationships have failed due to some fault in the other person.” The reality is once Wendy figures out that the person she is in a relationship is tired of playing the games, she breaks it off with them so she can claim that is was always her choice. In her mind, she wins again.  “In her mind, she is a successful businesswoman.” Reality: She has jumped from job to job and has either been laid off or quit all of them. She isn’t committed to any job because in her mind she’ll always be “better than this job” and she’ll always “deserve” better. To listen to her, she is always underpaid for what she does, and all her jobs have been beneath her. It’s an incredible arrogance and it has always been far from the truth.  “In her mind, she is this vibrant younger looking woman from years of hard work and exercise.” The truth? Guys love telling a woman that she looks younger than they know she is. I’ve got pictures, and they tell the whole story. If she wants to use that to make herself feel better fine, but she carries it further than that. The other lie she is fond of telling people is that she used to be “fat”. I have seen all her pictures and I have never seen her “fat”. Heavier than she is, yes, but not fat. I give her credit for losing weight, but I don’t giver her credit for exaggerating the whole thing. The thing with Wendy is that you never get a straight story. The story she gave is that she lost 70 pounds all on her own and that her current body is a result of all that hard work, The truth is that there is no way she was 70 pound heavier according to the pictures I’ve seen and her current body is a result of losing some weight she had put on and then SURGERY to create a flat stomach. That part is always left out. This is another example of her deception and lies. Her accomplishment would be just as valid if she told the truth. She lost maybe 45 pounds and needed help to get rid of the last little bit. That is more than most people could do. Why does she feel the need to portray herself as superwoman?  “In her mind, she is a caring loving individual.” If you were talking about her animals this would be true. See all the above for evidence contrary to that statement when applied to humans.   “In her mind, she is a very creative person.”  She used to be. She used to make music. She used to play an instrument. She used to write. She used to draw. She doesn’t do any of that now and from what I’ve seen I doubt that what she did in the past was her creativity to begin with. Wendy is a human voice recorder. She takes bits and pieces of other people’s thoughts, statements and work and spins them together as her own. I have given her every opportunity at work to be creative. To come up with her own designs, her own words, and her own ideas for websites only to be told that she hasn’t a clue. She is the first to be critical of someone else’s ideas, but when pressed, has no alternative ideas of her own. I don’t know if it’s because she doesn’t actually care about her job or that she just doesn’t have the creative spark she used to. Either way, she is anything but creative. In her own mind, she is another Emily Post, even when confronted with the facts.  I now come to the end of this post. Before I go, I should explain the title. Wendy plays multi-level games and in her mind she is master and commander of all. To prove this point, she added the caption “Grant no quarter” to her profile. Since she isn’t in a war, one can only conclude that she meant, “take no prisoners” in reference to the games she plays in her head. When Scottee calmly asked what she meant by that, she couldn’t come up with an answer, so she lied about the meaning of the phrase. Last time I checked, “grant no quarter” had nothing to do with the word “parlay”. It was either a lie, or her 165 IQ failing her.  Written 6-26-04
