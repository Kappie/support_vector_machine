Mind you, what do you expect when the Queen bee kills her mother and any siblings. The 'drone' bee has it all, all HE does is mate with the Queen bee. Lucky him.  I have found out how bees have sex, read below:  The mating flight follows a pattern. The virgin queen flies to a congregation area where hundreds or thousands of unrelated drones await. The drones pursue the queen and several mate with her in flight. The drone mounts the queen, inserts his endophallus, and ejaculates his semen. During ejaculation, the male falls back and his endophallus is ripped out of his body and remains attached to the queen. Drones mounting later remove the previous drone's endophallus and lose their own through similar matings. The emasculated drones die very quickly with their abdomens burst in this fashion.   Um, interesting. And if you could see the diagrams I do then you shall see that the male bee looses his stinger. I wonder then if they do actually sting each other? So not that anyone wanted to know any of that but there you go! That is how bees have sex.
