Getting paid is really cool, especially when it is $24 per hour.  I have always felt that my current income is the result of a combination of hard work, luck good and bad, and making good decisions.  I have had problems in the past with being guilty about making money when other people have little or no opportunity or luck and are dirt poor, struggling all the time.  That's how I grew up, so I am familiar with poverty.  I want to impress upon my kids the good fortune they have to not have to worry about food or clothing or electricity, but I don't want them to feel guilty about it like I do sometimes.  When I am in a depression spiral, I start obsessing about work, that I have trouble concentrating therefore I'm not being a good employee, I'm not earning my money, I'm a fraud, and so on.  I don't really know what the answer is there.  I have a serious problem allowing myself to feel like I earned whatever I get without feeling guilty about my success or that anything less than total success is a total failure.  I have a habit of saying that a chimp can do my job, that I can be replaced tomorrow, just perpetuating my insecurities and adding stress that I don't need.  While I've met some smart chimpanzees, I am learning to take pride in the fact that my work DOES have value and IS challenging and IS worth getting paid good money for.  However, this does not change the fact I don't really like my old or new job (new duties in same company), and I have many other related issues.  I'm just not happy working right now, because I sense that it is the least important to me in terms of what I want to focus my energy on.  I really want to be a wildlife or wetlands naturalist or study native American culture or a bus driver or a million other things than what I am doing now..  I have a good rant from a few months back about my sense of value related to my so-called career, so I will look for that and post it when I get time.
