The previous topic on "carrying-over" traditions got some response from ony 3 or 4 people. It's great to hear varied view points about many ideas and it all surely adds up to our wisdom and our ways of thinking. The discussion on M:R cud not have got much response as many might not have seen it...   One interesting link I came across y'day... Not sure how many of us are aware of it... but if u have really known the source of our national anthem, then u can check the validity of what is below.   Check out this link on  urlLink national anthem  and do share ur views.
