Rest assured that this does not mean that this blog is finished, we have managed to design a series of strings and pulleys when used in conjunction with a pair of dark sunglasses and a hawaiin shirt will fool even the closest friends into believing that she is still alive and still posting on the site. Readers will find that the content, humour and wit will remain at the same standard, it is suspected that Miss Posa's brain never really did function all that well.Please send all condolences and flowers to  urlLink kitty_no_1_2000@yahoo.com.au  Please standby for further messages. Regards The management.
