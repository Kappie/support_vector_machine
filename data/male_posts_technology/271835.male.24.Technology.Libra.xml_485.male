The  urlLink RIAA is under attack by zombies ,  urlLink Dawn of the Dead  has been remade  now  zombies are even going in for glamour shots at  urlLink Zombie Pinups . Spookiest of all though is the fact that   urlLink Night of the Living Dead  is available free from the  urlLink Internet Archive  due to it's copyright expiring - or is it some part of evil living dead conspiracy? You decide.    I'm convinced - I'm off to make my house safe with the aid of  urlLink Zombie Alert .
