WTL is a toolkit for developing lightweight Windows applications. It has always been a little-publicised and barely documented alternative to the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) toolkit." Ladd said he prefers WTL as a smaller, faster alternative to MFC. "MFC is a big, bloated library that's not well designed. WTL was developed internally for people at Microsoft. It's small and fast. If you're going to write pure C++ code, I recommend people go with WTL." WiX and WTL both were released under the Common Public Licence (CPL), a license developed by IBM that does not require derivative works to be freely released, as the GPL does.
