Secondly, India won as i expected.The last few overs of the match made me restless and i wonder how it would have been, if i had watched the match in TV instead of checking scorecards online stealthily.Certainly a commendable performance by Jayasurya and Sehwag. Last night was again one of those wetly nights.Had watched two movies. Runaway Jury and Quills. I have heard about 'Runaway Jury' as john Grisham's novel,but never read it. The movie had all it ingredients to fill up for a novel adaptation with commendable screenplay and dialogues. Worth watching. Later i watched Quillsalone in the laptop in my bedroom at about 12 am. Who would be interested in storyline at that time, well certainly not me. Yes u guessed it right, I fastforwarded the whole movie,playing it only when the need(!) arises. Well, what shall i say, Kate winslet has it all.
