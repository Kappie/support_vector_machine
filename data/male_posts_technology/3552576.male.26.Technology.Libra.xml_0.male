I know everything will be okay, but it just seems odd that I am not going into this situation with anyone.  This was never a dream of mine.  I always thought I would meet someone, get married and then find a "home."  So much for dreams.  I am very thankful though.  I understand that everything has a purpose and, while not currently apparent, that I will see the light at some point.  I have so much going on in my life right now.    There are so many wonderful people in this world and I wish I could tell each one of them how grateful I am for their love and support.  There is a certain family that I am so proud to be helping.  I was able to give the father a job to help them pay the bills and to put food on the table.  I don't want any thanks or recognition for that, because it wasn't me who gave him that opportunity, it was Him.  I just wish that He would give me the ability to touch others the way I have touched this one family.  I am grateful for everything I am given; the good and the bad.  This may sound random as it is, completely, but I feel as though I need to start taking a journal.  God Bless you all.
