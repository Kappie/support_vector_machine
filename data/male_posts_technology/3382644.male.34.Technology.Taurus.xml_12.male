I did pull off my first royal flush in the 20-2 tourney though.  That was cool.  I did make a mistake on it though.  I tried to play weak against the other two players since they were raise happy through the river, so I checked it.  They both checked their hands as well.  Just figures.  So much for setting the trap. I can see that my game needs some harsh evaluating.  I'm hitting these 4th or 3rd if I'm lucky because I go into the final rounds short stacked.  I'm not playing aggressive enough in the early rounds to build up my stack to get me through the big blinds in the later rounds.  Much to learn. If you don't know me, you can find me on PartyPoker.com as IndianaSlims or RoyalVegasPoker.com as IndianaSlimm.    Indiana Slim
