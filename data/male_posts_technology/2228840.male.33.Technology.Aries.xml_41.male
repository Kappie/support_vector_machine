I arrived at work this morning, popped on my  urlLink Trillian  (aka MSN Messenger and a whole lot more), and saw that I had a message from my good buddy  urlLink Torfeida . "How do you like the new Blogger?" he asked. What? New Blogger? Whatever could he be talking about?  So, having 20 minutes or so to kill before starting my day, I surfed on over to  urlLink Blogger  to see what was up. Low and behold! It was different! In fact, quite a bit different... New layout, new color scheme, something called the  "Dashboard"  from which I can manage my blog... Impressive, to say the least!  Now, I guess I'm going to have to get back into the swing of things and post a couple blogs...  You know, it's funny how guilty I can feel if I let it go for a few days. Kinda like I'm letting people down by not having anything new for them to read (isn't  that  presumptuous of me!). Personally, whenever I go  Blog Surfing  and find that my favorite reads haven't changed since the last time I was there, I feel disappointed... It's the same feeling I get if I tune in to catch a show, only to find out that it's a re-run. And if that sort of thing starts happening more and more often, I'm likely to give up trying after a while. Since I'm sure most of you are the same, I better get crackin'!  Well, keep your eyes open for more  "Scenes from the Forklift"  and the usual  Calgary Flames Updates  (they are leading 1-0 in the Western Conference Finals against the San Jose Sharks, by the way), and whatever else crosses my mind. Until then...
