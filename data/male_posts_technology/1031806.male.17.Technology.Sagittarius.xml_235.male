That was pretty cool... there was one part where all the lights were turned off except a powerful black light in the middle of the stage, and people signed a song wearing black clothes with white gloves, so all you could really see were their hands.   Afterward, Adrie and I went to my youth group (there was still a half-hour or something left). It was the first time I've been there in over a month. Steven (not Sus, a youth leader) was talking about how we can still honor God in Christmas celebration by making the whole thing about Him, even though almost every symbol of the holiday and the holiday itself has pagan roots. Later Melissa and Gwen came for some reason... that was um... awkward... yeah  Anyway, Adrie, Steven and I eventually went back with Ben to his house for a bit to see his newly painted room. It's really cool - the wall that his organ sits against has a red sun painted on it such that the organ's in the center of the sun and rays of red shoot out across a yellow and orange sky. It looks really cool.
