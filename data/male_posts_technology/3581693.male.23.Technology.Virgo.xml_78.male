There are a lot of things that I suck at - I think I need to do more of them - well more often anyways.  I get bored so quickly with things - I learn how to do new things - pick it up really quickly - and then I get bored of it. This can obviously be quite a downer.  Take this week at work for example - I was logging cases like crazy - I was a case loggin' foo'... I then found myself sitting around with nothing to do (but blog)... but then I realized - the resolution to my problem was to take on new challenges - not to be so afraid. This is one of the things that I like most about myself - is my ability to pick up new things - so I just need to do them more often.  Earlier today I was faced with a problem - and the one person who normally fixes it - is off. I went running around trying to find someone to fix it. Of course - no one would - this was at first a little upsetting - and then I thought to myself - I'm going to fix this - and I got my nose into it and voila - I solved the problem - made some women very happy - and I even felt great inside.   I am a very capable person - I just sometimes fear the unknown.
