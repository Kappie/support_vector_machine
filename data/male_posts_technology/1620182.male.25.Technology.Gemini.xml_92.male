When I don't have time to write down what I want to say, I'll just update less frequently with a "notebook" of items that I think are noteworthy (to me, not necessarily to the world).  This is the first such notebook...

 I went to go see  urlLink Control Room  on Wednesday night.  This film is a documentary following  urlLink Al Jazeera , outlining the differences in perception between western and middle eastern media sources on the Iraqi war.  It was an interesting concept and started out well but started to feel very repetitive towards the end of the film.  If you don't have 1.5 hours to spend on this movie, just read the  urlLink Washington Post's   urlLink synopsis .   Note that the article requires free registration with Washington Post.com.

 I was in a very annoying meeting yesterday.  Basically, the team that was supposed to deliver the meat for one of our applications is finally in position to do so.......one year too late.  So they want to compare applications, theirs (an acquired product that they extended) vs. ours (a bandaid solution that was put in place waiting for them).  So they showed off a little bit.  The guy presenting constantly had this cocky smile on his face.  That bothered me.  Another guy came in late.  That bothered me.  His arms were freakishly short (circus short).  That bothered me.  An all-in-all annoying meeting.

 I'm on the road again tonight.  I have to get to LaGuardia airport for my flight to Indianapolis for the  urlLink US Grand Prix   urlLink Formula One  race on Sunday.  This is an annual trip for me that was bumped up from its usual September time slot to June.  I'm hoping that the weather will be okay.
