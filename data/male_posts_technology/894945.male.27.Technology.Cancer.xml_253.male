I would of course take my camera if some bastard didn't knick it from under my nose. I'm not bitter, just annoyed. I would add that although I don't condone Psyco's post, I do feel that he has just as much right to post his views as anyone else. Laughter is the only multicultural expression that can be understood across the language barrier. Even the western Ok hand single means something else in eastern Europe (go there and do it… see what I mean) But the object of laughter is different for different people. Jokes about the Challenger space shuttle disaster, Princess Diana's death or even September the 11th were not funny at the time, and to some people never will be, but after??? To some people laughter is a way of releasing stress from a very serious situation. Enough bad things happen in the world, we cant be sad for all of them. Is not a nervous laugh is better than a hysterical psychopath? I laughed at the post. I feel sad for the people in America terrified with the same situation, but the reality of that situation is NOT the reality of a drawing on a computer screen. I for one can separate the two. And  I sincerely hope that they can catch the idiot doing the terrorising before he ruins someone else's life. I will not even broach the subject of American gun law and how it (allegedly) improves the quality of life as this is not the place to discuss such a subject. Needless to say, after that rant, I am dropping the subject.
