The Treaty of Waitangi is a document for a specific time and place. The time is long passed and the place (19th century New Zealand) is now gone. Let me illustrate that with quotes from the treaty of Waitangi.   From the first article:- "the Chiefs of the Confederation and all the chiefs who have not joined that Confederation give absolutely to the Queen of England for ever the complete government over  their land". This comes from the Maori version. Question:- Where is the Queen of England now. Sovereignty has again been ceded in all practicality to New Zealand. This document is now outdated, since the sovereignty that was ceded has now been placed back into the hands of those living in this land.  From the second article:- "The Queen of England agrees to protect the chiefs, the subtribes.....and all the people of New Zealand in the unqualified excercise of their chieftenship over their lands, villages and all their treasures." Where the heck is the Queens protection now? Once again handed back to us. This is the Maori version, but the English version seems to indicate even more obviously that what is being said here is that Maori (and others) will be protected in their ownership rights. In other words what you own cannot be taken by force by another more powerful tribe, which was what happened until British law and order was introduced.  The second article English version:- "........undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates Forests Fisheries and other properties which they may collectively or individually possess as long as it is their wish and desire to retain the same in their possession..." Obviously here we are talking about property rights.   The third and last article gives all people of New Zealand citizenship of England. Ha ha. Well those days are long gone.   When the tribes of New Zealand, the Confederation of Chiefs and the British Crown signed the treaty, morality based on justice replaced morality based on might, and British law entrenched the concept of permanency of claims to land, where previously, land was owned and occupied up until it was forcibly taken by a rival tribe. Queen Victoria's promise that all people in New Zealand would be granted the rights and duties of British citizens, changed this situation, and ownership became permanent. What is being protected by the treaty  are property rights. Property rights to land, and other property. It has nothing to with getting into university with lower grades, being able to fish introduced trout without a permit, being able to raid the coastline without heeding laws about how many one can take. It has nothing to do with camping out on a spot of land you like, and refusing to pay rates (when you do not even own that piece of land). It has nothing to do with allowing you your own special members of parliament. It has nothing to do with forcing other New Zealand people to consult with you about whether they can do certain things with THEIR own land. It has nothing to do with Maori getting special rights to the airwaves, coal, gas or fishing at depths that they never could have fished at. It has nothing to do with.........need I continue?  Where land has been taken unlawfully, it must be given back. Where it has been sold at foolish prices the case becomes more difficult. Plenty of people sell cars and houses at very low prices today as they are in need of the cash, but their ancestors cannot come back later and say "hang on guys I should have got more for that." Where it has been sold it should not be claimed back. That is as far as the Treaty goes and should go. To take it further than this is to take it out of it's original context and to twist it to suit politically correct purposes.  I am not at all even sure that any of the treaty should be considered valid. Since it is clearly outdated due to the fact that some of the parties in it no longer exist. Further to this, property rights are already protected under New Zealand law. We have broken away from England, and the monarchy in all but a technicality.   Let me also remind you that this document is beginning to be viewed as a legal document. But how can it be? If the English version significantly differs to the Maori version, then the Treaty surely is invalid, since neither side can be reasonably expected to know what the other sides version of the document says. And therefore are signing different agreements! If it is invalid, then it must be done away with entirely.  As I said earlier the Treaty was written in a specific context. Take it out of that and try to apply it today, and you get madness.
