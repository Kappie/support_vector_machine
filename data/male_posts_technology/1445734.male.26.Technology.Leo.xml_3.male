Aka. incarnation. I don't believe it. That's my current stand for that topic which is known to be esoteric amongst most reason-oriented geeks like me. Beliefs apart, I love this nice program which supposedly tells you about your past life. Just input your date of birth and boom....there you go...    urlLink http://www.thebigview.com/pastlife/    Its always interesting to know and read fantasy stories. For I love to imagine the history.
