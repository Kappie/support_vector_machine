Here is an  urlLink article  that talks about the feature changes in XP SP2 RC2...  A word of caution: XP SP2 RC2 will not be installed on the pirated copies of Windows XP. The official response - "SP2 will check the OS' product ID [PID] against a list of known pirated PIDs. If a PID is found to be invalid, SP2 will not install"  The SP2 RTM is probably coming out in July/ August..
