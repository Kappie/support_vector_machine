I work as a software Engineer at Torry Harris E Distributed solution.My main stream includes VC++,VB,C++,COM and ATL With support from databases like ORACLE and Object Store.  Everyone in this world dreams to be successfull in his stream of work and i am sure 75% of the people are not satisfied with the work they are into. That is becoz they dont do the work they are best at. they dream of being some thing in there life but endup being something which they would never have dreamt.
