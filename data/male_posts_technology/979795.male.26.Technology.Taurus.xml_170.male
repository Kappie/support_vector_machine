I found out online that there seems to be a train around 0700 hrs. I managed to get a discounted ticket at 250 SEK (around £25) to Stockholm. In total, I spent less than Daniel or Justin did for their tickets down to Stockholm yesterday. I think it’s because I needed to make 2 changes and part of the ride was on the older trains instead of the new X2000 series.   1241 hrs  Arrived at Stockholm. At the Tourist Information counter, I had to pay 20 SEK for a map (not FOC leh). By the time I left, I had wasted 20 mins just to queue up. It took me about 1 hr to orientate and get myself to the hostel that Justin had told me about. Naturally, given my ‘fantastic’ sense of orientation, I did make some wrong turns here and there. The hostel is really unique. It is a ship, permanently secured to the side of a harbour / waterfront. Its reception is located in a building opposite the ship. In addition to accommodations, the building also houses the common kitchen and a lounge. I was staying in a separate dorm from the guys. But it was pretty comfortable. Point to note, they sold disposable bed covers which cost cheaper than renting them. Most other hostels we’ve visited only provided rental sheets. The disposables are a good idea for travelling in Scandinavia. I shared my dorm with a family of about 9. It looked to me like the grandparents down to the grandchildren and an uncle or family friend were here on holiday. Felt a little awkward being the only Chinese in the dorm. But they were really nice and friendly folks.  After checking in, we went on to explore Stockholm. Again we decided to go for a canal tour of the city. However, this time it was a pre-recorded message. The whole thing lasted about 2 hrs, which was really a little too long. Naturally I fell asleep again. This time, it was because of the music. It kept coming on, then after awhile the message came on, then the slow music, then the message, and so on. I think I also have some kind of thing about sleeping on ferries. I feel that they just put me to sleep sometimes. Could also be because I woke up really early this morning and I haven’t gotten much sleep on the train rides because of the short span of time in between the changes.  There was a part of the city called the Old Town. This was an impressive place. The guys had visited the area yesterday and they took me to a sci-fi store. It was really cool. After that, we headed back to the hostel and prepared pasta for dinner again. After dinner, we explored the little island that the hostel was built on and then returned to hang around the TV room. Here we called back to check up on Lynette and Annie. I noticed 2 Welsh English playing pool, befriended them and played a few games with them. After awhile, a group of Scottish teens joined us. 1 of the latter was an Australian who is actually staying in Scotland now. Daniel decided to do some bouldering on a rock wall behind the hostel and Justin left together with him. Daniel looked pretty impressive as he climbed. I told myself that if my results were alright, I will try to visit the Rockface back in Birmingham to try to do some climbing one last time before I went back to Singapore.   2330 hrs  Returned to my dorm, grabbed a shower and got ready for bed. Everyone else in the dorm was already asleep. I had forgotten that there were kids in the dorm too and they probably needed to go to bed early. Tried to move around as quietly as I could.
