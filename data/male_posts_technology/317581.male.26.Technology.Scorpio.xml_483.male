A friend described someone as an emotional basketcase, was/is that me? Is that a valid description of me.  Growing and learning to move from 'in love' to 'love'. I need to be able to love a person that I was in love with, without being hurt. I need to not harden my heart. I need to remain emotionally vulnerable and allow myself to grow.
