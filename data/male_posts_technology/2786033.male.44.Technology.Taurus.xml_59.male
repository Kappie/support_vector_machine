Unlike that Hockypup, I was 19 when Reagan took office.  I was at a liberal arts College, and my politics were millimeters to the right of Mao.   I was shocked that Carter hadn't won by a landslide!  By the time Mondale got absolutly creamed, and I was a workin' man it all started to make sense. Oh the stories I could tell.  Unfortunately, my son's graduating tonight, so you should go read  urlLink this guy  instead.   If you'd rather read a seething, hateful and shrill screed, go read  urlLink this guy's june 5 and sixth entries .  (The left can only be compassionate when they're doling out OPM.)
