It's funny how time fly's when you have lot's to do.  "Idle time is the devil's workshop" (or something like that).  What is the opposite of idle time?  Hmmm . . . I'm eating Ho Ho's and drinking straight black coffee this morning.  Sometimes I like to dunk my "ho's" in my coffee.  Kind of like "Dunkin' Donuts", but instead I'm dunking Ho's . . . he he he.  My wife thinks Ho Ho's are gross, but I like 'em!  She especially despises the cheap Little Debbie ones.  They're great because you get like 8 for $1.25!  Mmmmm, snacky cakes . . . Oh, if she could see me now!  *dunk dunk*  *munchie munchie*
