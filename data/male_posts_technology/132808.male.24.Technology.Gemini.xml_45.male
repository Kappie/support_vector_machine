I've been getting positive feedback on the reviews, so tell me whatcha think!!!  Besides, even if you don't want to read my reviews, there's some cool pictures of Anakin Skywalker with his face burnt off!!!  Yeah, we missed out on that Bidwell deal.  Oh well, I guess we'll just have to live with that David Boston for Jamar Fletcher and a sixth round draft pick trade we just made.  You know the guy takes 102 supplement pills A DAY?  It's insane!  The guy is a monster.  AJ Feely to David Boston and to Chris Chambers.  Easy as A-B-C.  Now you can't put 8 in the box against Ricky, and you can't double down on Chambers.  I'm calling Ricky Williams, without the dreads, will lead the NFL in rushing next year.  As for Kordell, I'll say that if Kordell ever played in the CFL, he would go down as the greatest player in the history of the game.  He is the prototypical CFL quarterback.  Quick legs, strong arm, no accuracy (which isn't a requirement in the wide-open CFL).  With that said, he will NEVER come to Canada.  He can make more holding a clipboard in the NFL than taking hits in -30 degree weather here.  Even if we were to pay him 400k, which is 100k more than Dave Dickenson, he can still command half a mil AMERICAN to be a clipboard jockey.  We have a better shot at Ray Lucas, but I don't know if he'll be any better than Khari Jones, who I think is already in the top 5 all-time Bomber QBs, and if he'd only get us that Cup, could climb to #1 when it's all said and done.  Yeah, Stoddard's clutch.  He's been our best receiver in the playoffs the past two seasons.  We're going after Jason Tucker, but he wants 150k.  Fuck that.  He ain't that good.  Anyone can get 750 receiving yards when they aren't even the first, second, third, or fourth option in the offence.  And he had a good Grey Cup cause Don Matthews brain farted and started two rookie corners over Wayne Shaw.  And I wanna apologize to all the boys: I haven't seen you guys in the last little while.  I've become somewhat of a recluse, as I haven't left the house other than for kuya duties (dropping my sis to school and coaching) in like a week.  I'm so broke, and all of my money for the next six weeks is already spoken for.  I have to pay rent with my next three cheques.  But after this rough ride, it should be smooth sailing.  Nex, do you really want me to list 99 DVDs on here?
