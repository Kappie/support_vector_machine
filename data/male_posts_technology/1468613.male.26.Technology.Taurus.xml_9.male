Well I think I mave brought SARS with me up to Glasgow because now 3 other people in my team are now coughing, sneezing and have runny noses. But seriously, it just a cold.. I had a runny nose yesterday and crashed after I had tea but now I've just got a runny nose and feeling better by the minute.  Work is coming along better than I expected. At first it was all very new and I didn't know what I was doing but now I've got a bit more of an idea of where I fit in and not so daunted by the fact that I don't know very much about what I'm working on. Particularly considering just started working for Accenture at the start of last week and here I am in another country with completely new people... just a lot to get used to in a very short space of time.  I've just realised what time it is and it's only turned dusk.. it's about 10:30 at night. But I'll keep going to you guys know the latest news :o)  Well the offices I'm in are  interesting ... On Monday we went into one set of offices in Buchanan St but there wasn't really space for us. We were sitting at other people's desk when they weren't there and borrowing other people's lan connections. It was fine while it was early and people weren't at their desk... but... as people actually got to work, it became a bit unworkable as you could understand. So we moved over to some other office in Queen St which where we are now... the only problem is there's isn't really much there. Well we've got some desks and there are chairs. At least there are lan connections and phone lines, except that people keep on calling through asking for people who definitely aren't there. That's because the floor had been cleared out and we are the only ones there... it almost feels like we're camping because there is literally nothing else. And for some reason my swipe card lets me in the door when it wants me to and not when I really do.  Well I think I've got the whole food thing kinda sorted out. At first I was relying on pub and restaraunt meals but that really only lasted for a couple of days. Then, I discovered Marks  Spencer prepared meals.... and I have to admit.. they're not bad. The spiced Morroccon chicken was pretty tasty and tonight's pasta with a bolognase-type-of-sauce was very apetising and filling. So I'd give the Morrocoon chicken 4 stars and 3.5 stars to the pasta... it was a little bit heavy. However, 5 stars to M Belgian Milk Chocolated Coated American Peanuts and to Tesco Jellie Babies.  oops. the connection from the appartment timed out... I'll continue this tomorrow morning.  well it's the morning now and for some reason the blog site just wouldn't sign me in at the apartment... so here I am at work!  I'll post something new in a few hours... -gede  PS: thankyou guys for all being so supportive (in particular Kai because I love her so much :o)
