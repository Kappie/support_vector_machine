For a sexually terrified (not just awkward, absolutely terrified—I’d lose my soul if some evil woman seduced me. I’d also not be able to say “no”….) 13 year old being required to change clothes in front of dozens of other awkward teens was just about the worst thing that happened in my adolescence. Some Sean-Penn-in-Fast-Times-at-Ridgemont-High asshole used to call me “stinky” and hit me as he pushed me out of the way of his locker.   I spent most of the rest of my secondary school years trying to avoid ever going into a gym locker room again.  Almost 20 years later, fat suffocating my internal organs, I went back. After 3 years of fits and starts I’m at 13 weeks of regular workouts (and twice as many pounds shed). And more than 20 years have done nothing for my locker-room anxieties. Indeed, they are worsened by my adult knowledge of the world of micro-biology.   I workout at a downtown Seattle gym, which means that I have a larger assortment of odd characters than I encountered at the suburban gym I started at 3 years ago. I’m glad that I didn’t start here—I’d have never gone back.   They gay men flirting with each other doesn’t bother me (ok, just a little when they start the half-naked foreplay…), it’s just a little shocking for a sheltered lad from Utah, and the mentally unstable with poor attention to their bodily functions can be excused (except the one who glared at me from far too close a distance because I was at “his” sink) as long as I don’t have to get too close to their mistakes (ick) or smells, but the ones I just can’t get over are the 50, or more, year old men who seem to have no sense of shame at all. Just let it all hang out there, grandpa. We *want* to see your wrinkly ass and grey pubic hairs—that’s nifty.   Must be a generational thing (as opposed to just my neuroses). They just don’t seem to notice or care. Then again, maybe it is just me—I need to wear my giant, white, beach-towel around me at all times. Maybe it’s part of getting old—they don’t care what, if anything, anyone else thinks. That loss of inhibitors that becomes worse (better?) as we age.   So I go back 3 days a week (I have the weight set at home and I can, actually, walk on pavement twice a week—don’t always need that treadmill…), wrapped in my tent of a towel, plastic shower slippers with drainage holes on, and with my preventative, anti-fungal, foot powder. I feel too much like Niles Crane and look forward to finally moving to a new place and buying a treadmill of my own.
