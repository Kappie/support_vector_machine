Yes, I'm having the time of my life..." wonderful song - can't get it out of my head (lol)  Back on Tuesday (or was it Wednesday...) night, I called Gwen and asked her about the conversation we had almost a two weeks before. (We almost never talk about our relationship and things involved thereof, in person; perhaps because of lack of time... I know from my side at least, there is a slight intimidation factor involved too.)  The ensuing dialogue went something like this: (please note this is not exact, just as correct as I can remember from a couple days later)  Me: Remember that conversation we had about a week’n a half ago, when you were asking me if it was ok if you date other people? Were you thinking of someone, or were you just wondering randomly? Gwen: Ooh… how to answer… Me: Yeah, It’s kinda a tough question for me to ask as well. Gwen: Yeah, it was a tough question for me to ask too [in reference to the conversation 1½ weeks ago]... I have another person who, kinda wants to go out with me as well, and I just wanted to know that if I did decided I did want to go out with him... I just wanted to know what point we were at.  Right now, I’m just kind of watching both of you, and deciding if I would want to go out with either of you. Me: In a way, I’d actually prefer to be in my shoes. Gwen: Haha… why? Me: Well, I guess I wouldn’t want to have to make a decision. Gwen: Haha, yeah you’re juss chillin’  We continued talking for another twenty minutes or so, mostly about schoolwork, before getting off. The conversation certainly didn’t end as abruptly as the one preceding it, though it left me with more unanswered questions.  I remembered a Biology class, way back around the time of the banquet, when she mentioned offhandedly, that she had actually gotten two invitations to the banquet. Later in the period, she said that it was actually from one of the people in the room with us, but refused to say more, and I didn’t push it.  Looking back on that detail, I found myself starting to wonder who the person was, if I knew them, and how to best size up my “opposition”.  Immediately after, though, I started thinking more along the lines of what true love really entails: is it self serving, or is it putting the other (or others, as the case may be) first?  I really began to think and pray about that for a while, and felt peace that I would be able to cope with it all, either way.  Sure, it would be one of the saddest events in my still young life, after all, she is my first love – and I use that term rather blindly, I still have not come to terms with myself about whether or not I actually am capable of loving her in the truest sense of the word… I mean, well there’s no question about whether or not I’d die for her – I’d do it in a heartbeat, but that’s just a drastic example, not really capable of weighing the delicate balance between “I want a relationship with her because I feel all warm and fuzzy and complete around her”, contrasted to “I want a relationship with her, but I would rather have what is best for her than what is best for me.” i.e. is she wants a relationship with someone else, I would do my absolute best not to stand in their way. Of course this brings up the question of what love actually is: is it a warm fuzzy, self-fulfilling feeling, or is it the complete denial of your own feelings to satisfy the needs of the other?  I’m looking back at that paragraph, and realizing that it’s more just chaotic thoughts that I have written down, and less what I’m feeling in general, so I’m going to write some main point that probably need re-communication:  I. I am completely and totally unsure if I’m ready for a stable relationship yet. II. To the best of my knowledge and my ability to reason, I believe that I truly love Gwen. III. In reference to point I., I have truly no idea how to proceed if she decided that she wants to have a relationship with me. IV. If she does in fact, decide to begin a relationship with the other (currently nameless to me) guy, I will do everything in my power not to stand in her way, including attempting to suppress my feelings for her. (Not that that will be easy, in any way.)  Man, I can’t believe that it took me almost an hour to write this relatively short entry. Actually, I can, considering the content.   Well, it’s already 2:24 a.m., and I’d better be getting off to bed.  Since mostly likely I’m not going to be able to say this to you in the near future, or maybe even ever, I’ll say it now. Gwen, wherever you are (hopefully safe, asleep in bed at this late hour), I love you. Good night.
