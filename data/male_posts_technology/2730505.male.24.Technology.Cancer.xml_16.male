After this extreme bout of being a little bitch constantly whining and complaining and just really being a fucking little biatch about shit that just happened I am now done with it and it's definitely time to move on.  Fine fine it was time to move on a long time ago but I took my time and am now feeling better.  So anyways, I just want my fucking car back.  I miss my baby.  She was so new and full of promise and some little punk-ass HS drop out fucks up her oil change rendering her pretty much dead.  I was contacted last week by the service manager who said that they will be replacing the engine and they got their top mechanic working on the damn thing.  Yeah I hope so.  I will for sure be asking for all the warranty papers and shit like that and will always be bringing my car to that damn dealership so that if things like this happen again, I got my ass covered.  I can't wait to rev her up to 7g's hearing that high pitch sound that she makes and just driving her hard, stretching her legs.  Oooo.  I can't wait any longer.  So I am not sure if everyone knows but January 22nd marked the beginning of the Chinese New Year.  Hell yeah!  My fucking year baby!  It's the year of the Monkey.  See I'm not one of those retards that believe in astrology and crap like that but it was definitely fun to read and think about what it has to say.  Here are a few excerpts from a few websites that I plagarized.   Forecast for the year:  The year of the Monkey will be a fast-paced year, where nothing is straightforward.  You will enjoy the year if you enjoy a fast pace and are risk-taker, however, it will be a trying year for those that prefer a slower tempo. It is a time to give way to your imagination. This is a great year for business with communication being very important. The Monkey year will bring new and unusual ideas. Keep alert!   what is   urlLink this  ???  This sounded good too!!!  If you have been thinking about making a major move, this is the year to do it. It will be a lucky year for those who are willing to work hard. In the love and romance department, love abounds for monkeys this year as many romantic opportunities will arise.    Really?!?!?!  Hmm, looks promising.....I hope   Oooo what about   urlLink this  ...hmmm.....I gotta find my   Rat 90%  Tiger 81% Dragon 82% Monkey 85% Pig 81%    urlLink Wow   what the hell is this?  Well enough of this shit now...Who am I kidding...  People born in the Year of the Monkey are the erratic geniuses of the cycle. Clever, skillful, and flexible, they are remarkably inventive and original and can solve the most difficult problems with ease. There are few fields in which Monkey people wouldn't be successful but they have a disconcerting habit of being too agreeable. They want to do things now, and if they cannot get started immediately, they become discouraged and sometimes leave their projects. Although good at making decisions, they tend to look down on others. Having common sense, Monkey people have a deep desire for knowledge and have excellent memories. Monkey people are strong willed but their anger cools quickly. They are most compatible with the Dragon and Rat.   Man, that was a whole lot of nothing.  Ha!  I swear everything on the Internet is true!!!     Ahh, brand new week, we'll see what the week holds.
