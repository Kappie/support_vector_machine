(ok fine, Ddee) , her sister  urlLink Kristy  and  urlLink Andrew M. . Will post a TON more on that L8r, complete with some pics :)   Anyway, about Gwen: I got home from a *fun* da.... I just said that... ok moving on... Once I got home, I called her and asked if I could bring some DVDs and stuff that I had borrowed, up and she answered yes, but she seemed really tired. I drove them up and borrowed another DVD that my mom wanted (A Walk To Remember), but Gwen seemed so tired that I changed my previous plan of going back home and calling her to talk, to calling her tomorrow night.  btw, I got a messageboard up! :) Untill I set up my home-base webserver and translate my blog to that, I think this will do the job nicely. Though when I do start hosting from home, I'll get a little more elaborate.
