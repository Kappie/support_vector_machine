Canada.com sums up one point of view in their story, aptly titled:  urlLink   'Bring them on,' Bush says; Iraqis do   .   The most daring of yesterday's attacks took place just before 10 a.m. in Baghdad when a man on foot fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a three-vehicle military convoy moving down Haifa Street, a busy thoroughfare in the centre of the city. One Humvee was struck, wounding three soldiers, witnesses and a military spokesman said.  Witnesses said soldiers in one of the other vehicles opened fire indiscriminately, seriously wounding, and possibly killing, at least one Iraqi driver nearby. Blood pooled next to the slain driver's blue Volkswagen Passat soon after the attack.  A crowd of people gathered around the destroyed Humvee and looted it, taking whatever they could remove. Children and adults climbed on top, stomping on it and chanting, "God bless Mohammad!"  Then someone set the vehicle on fire and the crowd backed away, watching it slowly burn. Children hurled rocks at the blaze and, in a particularly Arab insult, threw shoes at it.   Of course, the guy who fired the grenade disappeared into the crowd and could not be found.
