I need to get a 76% to get a B in the course which shouldn't be to hard but It does depend on how nasty the final is. Anyway don't expect the amount of posts I usually make until saturday when my final is over. p.s. If anyone wants to sponser my nervous breakdown I think it would help promote you product/service.
