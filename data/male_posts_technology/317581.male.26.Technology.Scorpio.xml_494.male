We didn't receive our mail saying our time was approved, but the website says we are. If I don't have my money by noon today, I'll be making some phone calls ;)  Anyway, I hope the world is a better place today. I went out and shot pool with Joe last night and today I'm doing a weird work schedule so I can get our of here early. I almost made a live internet video at this  urlLink link here . In one scene that looks like it is at night, that is the one in the room I work in.  Which brings up the point of, How much light does a human being need?  Well, need to look busy, Peace- Tim
