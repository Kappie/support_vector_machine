To my wonder I saw the footprints of a stranger following me, invisible. I asked God, "who is it?".The reply was soft, "its me son". I got angry, because I couldn't see the footprints in situations of crisis. I am alone. Then came the answer, "its not your footprint, its mine son". Then where is my footprints. Came the answer, "I was carrying you in my hand son".    'We are never alone'
