Okay, my mother wrote that...so it is me back again...  Kaia, what tender words....Is there a reply to such a fine softness of sentiment? YOU ROCK PRINCESS!!!! So now to the real love.....  MY SHOPPING LIST:  New watch (Big, silver, baulky, Swatch, Cartier, Tiffany, Guess, Boss, whatever you can find) NOT FAKE OK!! I can tell! Even if they are sending the warranty!
