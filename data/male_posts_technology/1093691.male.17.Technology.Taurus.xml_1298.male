The Meaning of life.... who says there is one? Life doesn't have a set meaning. Life is a journey, not a destination. Guess it also depends if you believe in the afterlife. If you do, the meaning of life will probably be to lead a good life. If you don't, then the meaning of life is just to makea s much of your life as you can. But nah, there is no 'meaning to life'
