Oh, and my AirCard is expected to come today, but if not today, then Saturday, and if not then, Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday. I want it!! Oh, and I'm selling a laser printer, if anyone's interested. It's a Brother HL-1240, 12PPM, TRUE 800dpi. I'm selling it for $50. Consider that new, it costs $180.00, and it has toner, the power cable, and the USB cable. For $50.00, not bad. Contact me at  urlLink beej_55@comcast.net  if you're interested.
