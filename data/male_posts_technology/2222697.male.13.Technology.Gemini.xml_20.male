Peeing in your pants is like happiness, everyone can see it, but you are the only one who can feel the warmth.  ok i'm done. i just thought that was funny. Well i dont know what to write about. I didnt get any homework today so thats awesome. I've so far burnt 8 naruto cds with episodes on them. Yeah if you dont know Naruto is an anime with ninjas and stuff. I've been looking around the net and noticed that techtv's show "Anime Unleashed" is making an rpg, they have already taken in ideas for the first chapter but im definetely gonna help out on the second chapter. If you wanna give me ideas for MY!!! rpg send me an email, NOW SEND IN IDEAS (you will be given credit for making the game). I'm still tinkering around with html and still havent gotten a hang of it but dont worry my site will be up soon i know all of you have menacingly been waiting for it. I encourage you to comment on the entries. Oh and if you want to read another anime videogame geek blog check out morgan webb's blog she is a host on X-play (she reviews videogames) you can watch her on techtv and the URL is www.morganwebb.com. Now for my closing statement.....i have a problem with social activity involved with people that wear abercrombie (also know as the PREP). ........and if you are a jerk that actually cares what i wear you should leave. DNE EHT HAEY....mre (figure it out)
