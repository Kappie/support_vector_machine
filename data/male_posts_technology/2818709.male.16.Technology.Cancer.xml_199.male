Far more shocking than anything i ever knew...right on cue *GUITAR WAIL* Cant stop, addicted to the shindig, top cop, he says i'm gonna win big, choose not the life of imitation, distant cousin to the reservation, defunkt the pistol that you paid for. (Can't stop - RHCP)  Ladiladlalalal.  I'm still on an Xterra high right now. I still havn't ridden in it. But it's fucking sweet. I SHOULD be bored. But i'm pleasantly satisfied.     "Dani's got herself a new job, but she wishes that she had the old one.  Now it seems her dreams have shattered  And all of her pretty friends have scattered, now that dani's underpaid.  Oh dani, don't go crazy."  Don't do it, dani. Don't work at wal-mart. I'll....I'll...Well, i can't think of a bad enough threat for this situation, but it will be bad. Really bad. If you work at wal-mart. There's gotta be SOMETHING else you can do. Walk out onto sunnylane, and hold up a sign that says "suck for a buck" and in little letters at the bottom put (at soul calibur II) Can you imagine the $$ you'd get? Or a "free blow" sign. and in little letters at the bottom (with the full payment of college tuition). I wouldn't mind! At least you wouldn't be working at wally world.  For the Commonwealth! Yeeeeehaaaawwww! For the Swarm! Ultor! D'ni!  If you don't understand, then you've gotta believe, there's too much of you, there's not enough of me. There's not enough of me. yeahhhhahah, whooaooaaoaoaoaoa. *guitar riff* (Not Enough - 3 Doors Down)  Well, my left pinky is starting to hurt from typing, but...yaeaahr. I want my double park season pass.   *remembers* Oh yeah, sorry about messing up your bed, dani. *remembers* That starry blanket was pretty comfy, though. *remembers* Those purple spikey things...they haunt me... *remembers* Gir and the Dog do not need to have sex. Ever. Badbadbad. I KNOW that gir's head looks like a phallic object, but you don't have to treat it as such. *remembers*  Grammatical. *remembers* That shelf kept on beating my skull. It was painful.  *remembers* "...this place is not secure." "?" "I could be sniped...from anywhere. *ducks*"   *ROCK OUT*
