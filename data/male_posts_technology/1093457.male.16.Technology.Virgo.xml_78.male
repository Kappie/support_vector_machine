Written off like some bad deal, if you're breating you know how it feels, call it karma, call it luck, I just don't give a  I never knew Virgin radio could be so dirty, extreamly dodgy stuff going on at this time, all kinds of things. Tune in after 10pm to 105.8 FM. It is the 16th of January, which means we are half way through the month, which means it's nearly February!  At this present moment in this thing we call "time" I am extreamly annoyed with myself, I really don't understand what is going on. Teachers keep telling me that I need some help, and then they decide that I need to work harder and that I don't really need any help, so I have no idea what to do, and it's rather annoying.  Jackie, tell all, I do, and look what happens. It is perfectly okay, we arn't exactly going to take the mick or anything, and so what if somebody sends an e-mail? I know people talk about me for different reasons (mainly bad things) but so long as I don't hear it, I don't mind. If I where you, I would get it all out of your system and really go for it. My problem is I never have anybody to talk to, there are so many things I want to say, but I really don't want to bore people with it, but I really want somebody just to listen. I am trying to convince myself of this as well, but here is a theory of mine; You are born, and then you die, and anything in the middle is a bonus. So I am going to live as long as possible, and if I muck it up, oh well, I am hardly going to be regretting it when I am dead because I won't be able to think.  Are we all in touch with the news? We are sending the biggest ship in our Navy to join the rest of the guys in the Gulf. The thing that is really annoying me, a question that Charles Kennedy raised, if the USA go to war, but the UN don't - will the UK? I personaly believe that if the UN say we should go to war, then we should "join in" and go along with it, otherwise we are going to be the misserable Brits who don't do anything. However, if the UN say "no" to war, and the USA go to war, we should definatly not go with them. Without UN backing, they are making an offensive move as Iraq haven't exactly attacked the USA.  But we don't need to talk about rubbish such as war? We need to be happy and smily, even if we are in tears. I need to dream, and I have just remembered, I haven't answered Nicki's question about honeymoons. For my location, like I said, I really want to be somewhere different and unique. Away from anything else, just completely me, my wife, and nothing else. Perhaps a deserted island? Something with beatuiful scenery, next to a beach, blue waters. For the perfect wife? I am not fussed about looks and colours, blue or brown eyes, dark or light hair, I don't mind, I have the same preferences as most people, big clear eyes that you can just stare into for hours on end. They have to have a good sense of humor, enough to make me laugh, however beable to be completly serious at other moments. She has to like active sports so we can go to interesting places walking and things. I really want to do some back-packing somewhere, like in India. Anyway, I could go on for ages...  Life is rather dull, January is always like this, nobody can really be bothered to do anything. Once we get into February and half-term, people will start to pick up again, and then it's home free 'till Easter, then that's it, pretty scary. I am curently sorting myself out for work after I have finished my GCSE (last one is on the 25th June I think) - what is everybody planning to do over the holidays? Remember, you have two months free.  Good night all.
