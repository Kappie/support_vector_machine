 Do you feel it?   urlLink Tiesto ...thirty minutes in...can you see them?  Can you see the girls with pig tails?  The ones with the ultra-baggy pants and ribbed tank top mid-drifts?  The ones with the glitter and stars on their faces, arms in the air, spiraling as the music sweeps over the crowd?  Can you see the guys bouncing, glow sticks swinging, pervasive sweat drenching them and everything around them?  You can feel the rythmic throbbing of the crowd.  Tiesto is driving your emotions like a sheppard.  He knows where he's taking you...and you're going to love it.
