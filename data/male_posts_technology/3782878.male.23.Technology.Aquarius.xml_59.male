I awaited them, and Ellektra, Kretais, Konath(who we recently saved from Runnyeye, though I do not remember when we did that :( seems my dwarven mind is slipping), and a new compatriot, and member of the Call of Honour Elos arrived. We setup just as we had before, only without a Cleric for a short time(Akcron was still sleeping in at the time I believe.) we fought hard for a decent length of time before Akcron finally broke camp, and headed over to join us. As she joined us, another of our Guild, an Arch Convoker and one of the elders of the guild, was not otherwise occupied and said he would come down to give us a hand in the raid on Karnor's.  That's when I decided I wanted to show Mordjan, the Arch-Convoker just how great our group was. Mordjan, had never seen my style of fighting, nor had he seen what my friends love to call a Ziggur Pull. Well eventually after a few warm ups, I managed to bait around seven or more Drolvargs and a few other things on top of us. Mord had a look of shock, as he said "Damn!" while we went after the enemy and dealt them swift death. The Arch-Convoker even admitted that he had gotten frightened by the pull, and that he had eliminated one of our enemies, just for safety reasons. I felt a great deal of pride, seeing as Mord is such an experienced Arch-Convoker, that he has seen many things even I have not. I look forward to becoming as experienced as Mordjan, and grouping with him, so that he may get the benefit of my fast and heavy style of fighting.   Eventually the ladies became tired, and decided to leave us, as did Konath. So it was just me and Kretais. It had been a while since it was just me and Kretais, but we decided to run off to Dulak, as we arrived in PoK Kretais began to recruit people for an assualt on Dulak Harbor, a place full of pirates and shifty types of people. We picked up MadCricket, and headed to the harbor. The run from Gunthak to Dulak has always gotten my heart to racing. It is like a decathalon, first you have to swim the gulf of gunthak from the lighthouse to the shore, then while dodging the undead shipmen who had crashed on the shores, you have to reach the tunnel, the tunnel is filled with man eating plants, sentient mushrooms, and infected drogmars as far as the eye can see, and if you are not invisible, you have quite the run ahead of you.   We made the run successfully, though I took a wrong turn ended up in nadox before running the right way and arriving. When we arrived we took over a boat, the Storm, a hardy boat and one not to be controlled by the pirates. So we began to dispatch the pirates, the top decks were full when we arrived, and empty once we were through, we ended up having to wait for their reinforcements before we could find anything to fight on ship again. Eventually another person met up with us, whose name I forget.   The new person told us of a location just as good as this one, but with better treasure and less downtime. So I took her up on her offer, and we ran our way to the Dulak Warehouses. When we got there, someone else was already there, and said he was hunting gems in a certain warehouse. We agreed not to bait his quarry out, and instead focus on our own.   Eventually the other man, Paladin I believe left, and we had control of the warehouse's. When this happened Kretais summoned forth a Druid Reiahla, and a Cleric. we spent a great deal of time there, and I managed to get a large amount of valuables before calling it an evening. It was a fun evening, and once we were complete the Druid teleported us back to Plane of Knowledge, where I sold my goods, and made camp. Came out with over 100 platinum pieces after that battle. not bad for a night.  If ever we meet may it be as Brothers, and not as Enemies, Ziggur Rathebringer
