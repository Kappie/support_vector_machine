Y'see, as much as my lawn is really small and fairly quick to mow, it's also kinda shady, and so it doesn't dry well. Add in the fact that it rained every day for a week and a half, and so we couldn't mow it, and I mowed it in a rush Saturday morning before running off to my parents' for the night... Well, it was distinctly not dry, but very long. When I went to my parents, I took my sandals and my loafers, not the boots; so yes, my boots are now distinctly green, and I only just noticed it a few minutes ago. Amazingly, no stupid comments from the co-workers, yet.   Here's to hoping it wears off soon!   Just to keep my life interesting, there are now yet more problems with my degree. The application went through and everyone was all set to just make it official and sign the documents and dot the i's and cross the t's... Until someone asked the Bursar's office. The Bursar, of course, said "No, his account is on hold; he owes us a large sum of money." What IS this money, you might ask? The $5,000 and change left over from fall of 2003 - when I wasn't a student. I was supposed to have been withdrawn well before the deadline, but somewhere the system failed, and I never was. A couple of months ago that $5,000 was supposed to have been dealth with by the vice president of the graduate school. Since I hadn't received a bill since December, and since all the paperwork and things went ahead for a couple of months with no problem, I just assumed that it was all good. I was accepted as a delayed part-time student, and everything... And NOW this freaking thing rears its ugly head again. Did it ever get dealt with? Noooooo. Do we know why? Not a clue. The guy who was supposed to have dealt with it then, and has to deal with it now, isn't there; he's out for the day.   My wife's response was "Why does everything have to be so difficult? Are you SURE I can't just beat them over the head with a 2x4?" And while I assured her that no, she couldn't, it took a conscious effort. NOTHING comes easily. I'd love, just once, for there to be a "Can I do this?" "YES!" And it be done. Once. Ever. Well, once since my driver's license. That was the last vaguely important thing I can think of that went simply and without problem. Even my under-grad degrees had problems; some stupid complaint that was never closed out, and some weirdness in my status because I was a double-major, that almost delayed my graduation.  Some years, it just doesn't pay to have gotten out of bed.   And just to add insult to injury, my old dog is getting... Well, old. Star, the wonderful dog I grew up with, is just aging. I mean, we got her when I was in elementary school, and now she's just reaching the end of her time... But it's kinda painful to see her stiff and grumpy and gray and half-blind and -deaf. I'm afraid that next time I go to see my parents, she won't be there. It's a really depressing thought.   The trip to my parents' was pretty good, though. It was mostly because my parents wanted to take us out for dinner near our anniversary. My wife and I's anniversary is this Tuesday, the 27th. Our second anniversary, specifically. We're not doing much (it's expensive to take two days off work and go to a nice hotel!!!), but we'll go out for dinner, and I'll give her her present. Hopefully, a nice relaxing day.   And for those of you listening (*cough*) carefully, yes, I did say "give her her present" instead of "exchange presents" or something similar. Why? because of my digital camera. It was probably far more than we can really afford, but she got it for me anyway, so it's pretty much the only gift I'm getting all year. And while it isn't exactly sentimental, it IS something that she knew I really really wanted, so complaint is the last thing she'll get from me on the subject.   Besides, if I know her (which I do fairly well...), she'll probably do something cute - get me a sheet of frog stickers, or find me a nice bookmark with a frog or a nice Bible passage, something cheap and sweet. Life is really good, on occasion.   So, um, yeah. Sidetracked, am I being, constantly. Trip to my parents... Anniversary... Dinner! Right. So we went out to dinner on Saturday night. A great little restaurant, called The Dickens. It's British-themed, so it tends to be a hit with my family. My wife had never been before, which was a nice addition. I got a wonderful (though not particularly British...) clam strips and fish, and fried calamari as an appetizer. It was quite good. Very unusually sea-food-ish for me (I tend to stick more with Beef and Chicken), but delicious all the same.  Yesterday, we went and visited the local flea market. This year (or, at least, this weekend), it wasn't very good, at least from my point of view. The guys who tend to do gaming books, board games, war games, models, and things of that nature didn't make an appearance. Even more unfortunately, the blacksmith/weaponsmith didn't show!!! Normally there's a guy there who makes swords and knives and similar things, and he wasn't there. There were two booths that had your stereotypical mass-produced imported katanas and stupid novelty knives and things like that, but nothing I was interested in. Well, there was one full-tang rope-wrapped sword, matte black, which was nice... I guess more like a big knife or a machete than a true sword. Very odd. Kindof a modernization of a half-Japanese half-South American item. Nothing like I'd ever seen before. Either way, I wasn't spending $300 on it, so I didn't buy it.   I did reach one odd conclusion, though. For some reason, it seems to be a common thing for people who sell knives and swords to also sell handcuffs. It struck me (and I really don't remember why) that both boothes that sold swords and such also sold handcuffs, but I didn't see them anywhere else at the flea market. When I noticed it, I also remembered that at our local mall, the pseudo-oriental-import store (it's all oriental style, but little of it is actually Chinese or Japanese; it tends to be cheap Indian knock-offs) also sells knives and swords - and handcuffs. Why on earth would they go together? I mean, if it was actually a blacksmith's store, I could see forged manacles or something... But... I don't know. Just struck me as a weird correlation.   Either way. My wife got an Enlarger, for her hypothetical darkroom. It was really cheap, so we picked it up. Now, here's to hoping that it works! I, on the other hand, got sun-burnt. Pretty badly. I'm very pale and burn very easily, and I (of course...) forgot that until I'd been in the sun for two hours. Now, if only I had my cowboy hat I wanted from a few weeks ago...   I'm not certain why, but I have a really strong urge to learn how to photograph people better. In my head, I have these mental pictures of poses that I want to see taken as pictures, and so I'm leaning towards doing it myself. Now if only I knew how to work my camera better. :) In the process, though, I've also reached the conclusion that I prefer black-and-white photography to color photography, at least when it comes to portraiture. Color photos have their place, obviously, but when it comes to actual art, I can't help but feel that black-and-whites are just... Nicer, in an artistic sense.   Well, I should get back to work, at this point. I've finally received a piece of work to do.  Oh, and just because I can... I'll mention  urlLink Alredhead ! She linked to my blog, which I think was very kind of her. If I ever get around to figuring out how to do it, I'll post a link to her blog over on the side of mine. But probably not today. :)
