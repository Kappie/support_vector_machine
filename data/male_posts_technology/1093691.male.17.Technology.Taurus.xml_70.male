I know, it's misserable, it's January, it's cold, it's wet, it's annoying, and generaly, it's shit. There really isn't any other way of putting it.  Something to look forward to, I think my mum and I may be going to the lake district in the Easter holidays for some walking, yay!  Anyway, blog lots over the weekend, have a good one guys.
