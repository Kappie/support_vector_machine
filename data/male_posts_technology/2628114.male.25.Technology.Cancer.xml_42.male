We ran from my house through Eden Park, Mt. Adams, Sawyer Point, and even into Newport for the worst smelling bathroom break ever thanks to a backed up sewage pipe or something dead in that bathroom.  We went for a total of 97 minutes but with all the random breaks, we probably ran about 90 of those and covered close to 10 miles.  We ran much of the early areas of the marathon so it was good to get some perspective how much the course will climb in the first ten miles.  We conquered, yes conquered, one of the worst hills in Mt. Adams (Monastery) top to bottom and bottom to top.  The whole run felt amazing except for the fact that my body was tired come that last mile which led to my decision to buy more running stuff (explained below).  Cool Running Stuff  Update for 4/9/04 After my run on 4/7, I realized my legs were getting too tired so I figured it was the weight of the shoes after having experienced my other lighter shoes that Brad gave me.  I conceded that I should probably try some new shoes for the longer runs, especially the marathon so my legs and body don't wear out so quickly.  It works out well that I got an enormous tax return this year so I was financially able to buy some more shoes.  With that said, I was off to the Running Spot (RS) to buy the lightest, brightest, most well-fitting shoe I have worn yet.  Since they encourage you to try out the shoes at the RS, I was out on Madison trotting up and down in these shoes and I knew within 50 feet that they were my new shoes.  All I can say is that they are bright yellow and weigh nothing, but with the proper arch supports, they feel like clouds on my feet as I whisk along.  Also with the shoes, I got a new carrying case for water and gu for long runs, some gu, and some 3/4 arch supports so I can still feel the magnificence of the air in my shoes.  In order to try out the new shoes on a run, I met Brad and Bobby at the RS.  We did a quick 4 miler from the RS around one of my favorite runs up Madison, Grandin, through some amazing neighborhood off Grandin, Erie, Observatory, and back on Madison.  Even though I had taken that route a couple times before, they introduced me to that neighborhood where I realized what a wonderful place it would be to retire.  The run felt great, even with little stretching, mostly due to the slower pace and probably some to do with the shoes.  As yellow as the shoes are, they carried me up and down hills with greater ease and my body still feels great and ready for the long run this weekend.
