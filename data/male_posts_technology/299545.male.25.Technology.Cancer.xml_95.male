I showed up and went through a bunch of orientation meetings, went out to lunch with my mentor, some more HR-type meetings dealing with benefits, set up my computer, and then home!  The team I am on seems really good -- all seem laid back, but extremely smart and driven at the same time. Though beat from the first day, I am excited to go back, and ready to start the real project work (which will begin next week in earnest I'm told).  I'm am going to be able to post little or no information about what I am working on (especially anything remotely specific) but I got lots of well wishes for my first day, and thought I should post some feedback here.
