That means, by my calculations, it should only take two months for us to get to THREE MILLION MEMBERS.  Remember, to do your part, all you have to do is tell two friends.  Then they'll tell two friends, and so on, and so on.  Since I can basically talk about anything I want, I'm crazy psyched about this upcoming NFL season.  Maybe it's cause my fantasy rosters are pretty sweet, maybe it's cause my Dolphins actually have a chance this year, or maybe it's cause you have absolutely no idea who will win, but this season is shaping up to be pretty sweet.  Here's my predictions for this year:  - Miami will win the AFC East - LaDanian Tomlinson will lead the league in rushing - Charles Rogers will have the best year of any rookie wide reciever since Randy Moss (he would have bettered it had James Stewart not gotten injured) - Green Bay won't make the playoffs (Yeah, I said it.  Hear that, Nick and Kevin?) - The Greatest Show on Turf will return, but their defence sucks too much ass to compete. - Seattle will have a breakout year, and I'm not just saying that to convince Feeds to jump in on this. - Peyton Manning will remain perfect in the post-season: winless - Pennington's done, Vick isn't.  But TJ Duckett and Peerless Price are fucked. - Tommy Maddox and Matt Hasselbeck will rise to elite quarterback status. - Kyle Boller will outplay Carson Palmer, but only because the wicked Raven's D will give him better field position. - AFC MVP: Ricky Williams - NFC MVP: Donovan McNabb - Offensive Rookie of the Year: Charles Rogers - Defensive Rookie of the Year: Terrel Suggs - Super-Bowl Champs: Who else?  The fins, baby!!
