I really hope Nintendo sticks it to Sony and their PSP (PlayStation Portable, look it up if you never seen it), and to Microsoft if they throw their hat into the portable gaming arena (which is likely, seeing that they would love to get their hands on a big chunk of the pie). Nintendo, show all these people who's king! ( At least in the handheld world )  - Looks like  urlLink American Idol  finished it's third season last night. I personally didn't watch because I don't have cable in my apartment. I watched last year's final episodes, and I realized that I  hate  Clay Aiken. Anyway, I think Fox has a gigantic cash cow on their hands, and they're milking it for all it's worth. As long as there's imitations like  urlLink Puerto Rico's version of Idol , you know you can keep on bring it each and every year.  - The record industry (or RIAA) seems that they're going to have their way soon, thanks to the U.S. Department of Justice. A proposal dubbed ' urlLink Piracy Act ' is currently waiting on the Senate to vote for it. If it passes, then thousands could be directly sued, with fines up reaching more than hundreds of thousands of dollars. That's a lot of money! Of course, the RIAA is rooting on the Act, in order to "stop diminishing sales and downloaders who have thousands of songs". Of course, most of the people that have been sued only have less than probably 50 songs, and with CDs selling almost $20, I wouldn't blame them for downloading. So all my fellow puerto ricans, stop the Kazaa / Limewire downloading now!  The only question on my mind is, has someone from Puerto Rico been sued? If there's actually someone reading this from Puerto Rico, and knows someone who's been called up by the RIAA, let me know, so I can post it here and let everyone know.  Creating this blog wasn't a bad idea, as my headache is almost gone. Hopefully certain people will leave me alone for the rest of the day, like that's gonna happen... Hope everyone has a great day, see ya later when I post again!
