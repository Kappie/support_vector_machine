What's unusual is that she eats about as much as it would take to sustain a small bird. Me, I start to hallucinate if I miss a meal. Going to buffet places is out of the question because in that scenario, the house wins with her. I'll stuff myself so that I can feel like I got my money's worth. Because there is such a disparity in the amount of food we eat at meal times, whenever we go out to eat, her favorite tactic is to suggest that we order something to share. She'll skip meals at work because she is too busy. Okay, I've done that a few times. Yet she does it with disturbing regularity. She'll also skip meals if she is too tired. Hmmm, maybe you're too tired because YOU HAVEN'T EATEN ANYTHING. Now when she does eat, sometimes it'll be a hearty meal like a cup of yogurt, or a few stalks of celery and a scoop of peanut butter. I'm sorry but that's not a full meal. That's a snack. When she was pregnant, it scared me that she might skip meals, which is not exactly healthy for the baby.   I don't know how she does it. With the volume of food she eats, she should be about 50 pounds and built like an anorexic Olsen sister. Maybe I shouldn't worry about it. After all her weight seems fine. Me, I'll just keep feeding my fat ass to keep from passing out.
