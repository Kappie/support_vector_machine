I spent my usual Wednesday night in my drunken mid-week relief stupor but at the end, after seeing two friends into Liberation Square, I set of for the fifteen-minute walk home when....  This gorgeous, sexy girl jumps up from a bench, my eyes, always looking for an opportunity to perv, scan across to her as she moves perpendicular to my path, noting that she is of legal age by a sufficient margin (hey it was the Lib). As she approaches to intersect me, I wonder, "is she asking for a light, shit, I don’t smoke!" but no!  Wonder of wonders, she asks me for a hug!!! "Do you mind if I give you a hug?" she enquires!!! Confused as to why, I agree and wrap my arms around this angel. After a brief tangle, we thank each other and part ways, me wondering why someone would ask this? Nay, Why people don’t ask this more often!!!  As I said, A weird night.
