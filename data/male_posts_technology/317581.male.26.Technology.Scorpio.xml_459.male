At least I think attraction partially works due to outside influence. I saw a movie, Iris, where the heroine chose the nerdy guy, I think as a safe bet, partially because she had already had the wild lifestyle she wanted. So that movie actually goes against what I just said, but I think that it is due to the fact that having a greatly desired mate by others is not the only reason people hook up. I think sometimes people get together because they are lonely awnd find someone they can connect with on a deeply spiritual and emotional level, and mutual attraction helps.  I blog and match.com, and take my female friends out to coffee. Not such a bad way to live.   Well, I need to get ready for my piano lesson. I'll check you guys on the flip side, Peace-
