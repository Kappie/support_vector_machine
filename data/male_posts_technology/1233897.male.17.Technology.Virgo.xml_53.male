Started out I went to work, which was the usual (nothing wrong with that though!). Later in the day (around 1) I got lots n' lots of work so Jeremy and I were working most of the afternoon until it was time for me to go. Oh yeah, yesterday was also payday, which is good.  After work I went to the bank and cashed my check, got out money for the weekend and for some stuff I wanted to buy. I had a list of CD's I've wanted for a long time (like 8), so I went over to Best Buy and got them, it was pretty neat too cause they were a lot cheaper than I had thought they'd be, so I got another CD and a game. So lets see... oh yeah, here's what I got:  Stroke 9 - Nasty Little Thoughts Hoobastank - The Reason The All-American Rejects (Album by the same name) Hawk Nelson - Letters To The President The Ataris - Blue Skies, Broken Hearts... Next 12 Exits The Ataris - End is Forever The Ataris - So Long Astoria Yellowcard - Ocean Avenue Simple Plan - No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls The Life Of Brian on DVD (Funny Monty Python movie) and Return to Castle Wolfenstien for the computer.  All it all that was pretty fun. Patrick H. was the one that rang me up which I was lucky for me, cause the game was M and I would've had to have ID which I don't have (the game isn't even that violent, but whatever).  After that I ordered some stuff online, most of the rest of my computer parts, a cool beanie, and some other small things. I also got some pictures developed (I won't get them back until Sunday, woohoo for then!)  I got out quite a bit for tomorrow, money for the theater and food and also I was gonna get Sarah's anniversary gifts before then, but she's not able to come on Saturday so I guess that I'll just keep it around for a while. I probably will get the gifts today though. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, I stayed home sick from work today... I didn't sleep too well last night.  This weekend is going to be pretty slow, which is exactly what I've wanted for a while. Planning things gets me stressed, though I like doing them.  Yeah last night I was in a pretty bad mood, it got better though once I did get some sleep and some time to think about things. I'm not really worried now.  Hum... can't think of anything else to put in here, I'll post something later if anything happens, or I won't if I just sit here *shrug*  Oh Pat, in response to your comment on a deleted post, the term is "dramatic", and my problems are caused by apathy.
