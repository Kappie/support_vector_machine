Good - the song playing while the closing credits rolled. Bad - everything leading up to that point. It had nothing to do with the original film. 0.5 out of 5 stars.   urlLink Warlock III: The End of Innocence . This direct to video dog had nothing to do with the prior two movies, but was a slight improvement. Hopefully they'll quit making these movies. I'm through watching them. 1 out of 5 stars.
