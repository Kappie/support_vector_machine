Most of the fun happened during the morning, actually - nobody slept last night, haha.  I met Chris and Scott at the Shady Grove in Shadyside.  It was a beautiful night out.  When I got there I also met some new folks that I haven't hung out with yet:  Brad, Ron, and Jeff.  We had fun together all night.  Scott got Chris a big piece of birthday cake that we all shared.      urlLink     Me and Ron  urlLink         Ron and Brad(In front)  urlLink      Then, would you believe it ...we went to DejaVu, haha.... Someone bought Chris another piece of cake... it was tiramasu actually... I talked up my party.  Looks like we're gonna have an GREAT crowd tomorrow night. I'm so psyched.      urlLink      urlLink       urlLink      urlLink       urlLink      urlLink       urlLink      urlLink        We hung out outside of DejaVu for while... where we made a new friend names Scott and firted with young hotties like Tricia in the pink - hot. Hope she comes to the party, hehe...    urlLink         Chris and Scott  urlLink     Brad with Tricia and Friends...  urlLink        Then we dropped off Brad to his place downtown and went to party at the house of another new fiend, Deran.  Deran lives on the Northside.  What a great apartment!  He had a great view of the city across the river. We hung out for the rest of the morning with Deran, his girlfriend AMY, and their friend Jodi.    Deran likes to cook, too.  He had some big pots on the back patio where he grows his own basil, peppers, tomatoes, and some other herbs.  I spent some time with Amy talking about her Jewelry - she was showing me some pieces they bought at Banana Republic that were pretty nice.  I love jewelry for some reason - I think it's because it makes me think of my parents... they love to shop for jewelry together and I always tagged along. Anyway, we had fun checking out her jewelry.  At some point I remember dancing in the livingroom with Jodi.  And Scott fell asleep as some point.  We had some fun taking pictures and fucking with him about it, haha... Here are the pics:   Jodi, Daren, and Amy  urlLink      urlLink      urlLink  #666666; margin:2px' src='http://photos1.blogger.com/img/291/1204/168/PICT0397.jpg'>     As you can see... the sun was shining when we left...    urlLink      and we ended our time together with breakfast and conversation at a diner in the Strip District.    urlLink      ...I still need some sleep... time for a nap!   -Ryan Riehle
