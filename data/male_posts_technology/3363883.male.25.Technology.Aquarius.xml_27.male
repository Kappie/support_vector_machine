They were used as excuses for some drinking.  My god.  I think I managed to knock back over 30 pints [+] this weekend.  Euuuugh.  Of course.  This all came around because it was planned to have a nice relaxing weekend with the occasional beer.  Oh well.  So yes.  It was a very good weekend, but I've the got a hangover which is the accumulation of three days worth of drinking right now.  Currently, reality isn't a fun place.  It's full of very loud noises and bright lights.  I managed to only fit in a single trip to the gym.  But I did a 7 k run in just over 40 minutes which I though was pretty tops.  So I'll see if can try and keep up that standard.  I didn't get around to the gym this morning.  Far to scary an idea.  Will hopefully get there tonight.  Yeah Right :- )
