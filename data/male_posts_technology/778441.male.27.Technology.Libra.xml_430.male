But having watched "A Beautiful Mind" yet again on a movie channel yesterday, three news items seem to leap out of the page at me.   urlLink Natwar, Powell discuss bilateral matters    urlLink India to reconsider troops to Iraq    urlLink G-8 may open doors to India, China   Now it may just be an attack of paranoia. But then again... maybe not! After all, I'm not John Nash!!
