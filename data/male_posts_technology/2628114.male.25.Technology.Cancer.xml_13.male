I don't feel sore at all and after running, Lisa and I could have run even longer.  We ran at an almost exact 10-min/mile pace putting us right at 5 miles.  At that pace, we would finish the marathon in 4:20. We ran (and I mean ran!) one more 400 just for fun.  We both continued to realize the benefits of running the long runs with somebody else so I will be hunting someone down to run a 60 with me next weekend.  :)  That's just about all for me until Monday when I will come back with a 30.  Have a great weekend!  I hope your long run this weekend goes/went well!
