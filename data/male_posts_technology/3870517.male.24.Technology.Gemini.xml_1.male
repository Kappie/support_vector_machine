I found the job hectic and tiresome, I get to shout at some of my hard-headed students, I sometimes think too much on whether to pass or fail a student. It was more than just a mental activity, talking for long hours about the same topic to different classes; I was like a pirated CD. I was teaching college students, and some of these students were about my age or older so I get along with them very well. It seems awkward that they pay courtesy to me even though they knew all that I am younger than they are. The uniform is the only thing that separates me from them and my position but on days when I will not be wearing my uniform, I am sometimes mistaken for a student.    During break times, I get to sit with my students, talking anything from their classes to their evening gimmicks. Sometimes, I got invitations from them, to join them in some of their crazy nights drinking and spilling beers and other intoxicating liquors. Although I must admit that the invitation was tempting because most of my friends where not here in Davao and some are busy with their jobs. But what I always keep in my mind is that I am their teacher and the distance between our obligations in the institution must be kept apart, as much as possible. If my co-teachers would invite me out, I won't have to think about the invitation. There are rules and regulations and even ethics that I must follow once I became part of the institution.    On the recent seminar I attended on Team Building our facilitator stressed to us that when a person is joining an organization, he has to adapt a new kind of behavior being set by the rules and regulations mandated by the company. I do agree with her as long as the rules and regulations are beneficial to me and the company. She said this behavior is called the adaptive behavior. These behaviors are not being taught in our own home and we only exercise if we are inside the company. These include punctuality, observing the dress code, wearing IDs, and a lot more. This behavior also applies to universities and schools where girls are required to where long skirts and such which they have to wear. Basically, these are implemented to create a harmonious relationship among co-workers and to promote good character of the company. These behaviors are not meant to be kept with us wherever we may go but when the time comes that we leave the company, it then that it is taken away from us.    So to speak in relation to the teacher and student relationship, as long as I am a teacher, I should not cross the line so to be able to achieve the effectively of the said behavior. I was thinking, if I gave in to the invitation, what would happen tome then? They might take away their respect and my position might become questionable. Should I care? Yes, because it is what I should as part of the institution.   If I am not part of the school anymore, I do not bring the behavior with me. It is only then that I can join my students, I mean my ex-students, in their hang-outs.
