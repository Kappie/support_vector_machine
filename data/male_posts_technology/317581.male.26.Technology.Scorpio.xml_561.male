I think they(God, genderless plural) must have taken the bottle of beauty and the bottle of Grace and poured almost the entire contents into woman. Then when they saw what a great job they'd done, they decided to make man. But they didn't have as much beauty or grace to use on the second model. So they made up for it with fat and muscle and clumsiness. This ended up with the male model so prevalent in today's society.  Anyway, I was thinking about that as I was walking home from the park tonight and thinking about out more fair, pleasant looking sex.  I think that's all I have to say about that. Peace- T
