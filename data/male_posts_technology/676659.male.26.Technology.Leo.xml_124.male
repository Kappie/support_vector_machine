Hay, summer naman, wala opisyo luto naman kag kaon! hahaha May utang pa ko kay Laurie luto home-made Churros dipped in melting chocolate! Sigh.   Bon, sadya gle sa Main Strip Alley noh? Actually, iya na sang ... ano mo gani Mel? :) and Neil pa gid? :) Baw, suki pa gid ya? hehe Ako nag lang ko sa RC (Royal Carribean) sang patties...Jerky! hehe Matyag ko gin kaon ko nga snacks gapon mas mahal pa sa lunch kow! hehe And yes, thanks for that reminder Bon! Ara pa na ang poster diri sa kwarto hehe ... I can pass Calculus, gin calculate ko na actually ang grades ko sa Prelim  Midterm. Galing kay ano ma ubra ko, phobia gid ko sa numbers ya. P6 naman next year, mayo lang wala na Chem. hehe   Hay, the frustrations I release here, matyag ko sometimes gina underestimate ko na lang si God sa ma-ubra nya through me. :( Sorry Lord. :(  Oh yes, I was sharing this since yesterday, I was asked by urlLink  Boogs Software  to "join their team" cos may job opening daw sa web designing team nila. I'm not sure if the guy was serious pero I really think he was. And then he was quite shocked when he realized that I was still in college because I told him jokingly, if he is willing to pay my tuition in Manila then I would gladly join the team.  If I was in Manila right now, I wouldn't hesitate to grab that offer! I guess that's just one of the reasons why I'm placed here in Bacolod. Most probably if I was in Manila right now, I wouldn't be as active in church activities.  I used to have the dream of going far with what I love to do, and somehow, that lure to go back to that dream is just too inviting! We can't serve two masters at the same time, but as much as I want to go into web developing, I choose to serve God above all. Please pray that I won't be fickle and that God would give me strength to stand on the commitment I made to him. :)
