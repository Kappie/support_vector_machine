During the approach to the Death Star, the squadron leader asks for a sound off.  Wedge was Red 2,  Luke was Red 5, and I think Porkins was Red 6.  Later in the fight, someone asks Red 6 if they can spot (or cover) Red 5.  If it was Porkins, that would be a little difficult seeing as he was already dead.  Oops.
