The reason being that it's cheaper (albeit, compared to PC Gamer, not by much), and that I wanted to support an effort by the locals. Now, I'm not so sure. Comparing NAG to PCGamer is like comparing a beat up, old glue-fodder mare to a prime racehorse. NAG really  is  a nag. A tired, ugly nag. Seriously, NAG's been in the business for years now, and I think it's only gone downhill. Recently, they stopped shipping the issues with cover CD's. Apparently they will be rectifying that shortly, but nonetheless - without the cover cd to lure us poor Africans without broadband into buying it, NAG has precious little to offer. And it's sad, because it isn't entirely a lack of content, but simply that the mag doesnt feel  polished . Everything about it screams 'amateur'. Horrible fonts on the cover, a garish layout, and the covers look really bad - each issue's cover is a hodge-podge of clippings , different font faces and sizes, murky text and just general 'ickiness'. It gets worse. Many of the reviews are really dull, or just filled with inconsistincies and mistakes. For example, they reviewed an ATI Radeon card recently, and refered to ATI's new Catalyst driver initative, as "Cataclysm's". This was repeated often. I know of several such examples where bad mistakes were made, unforgivable mistakes. As a game rag publisher, they just can't afford to make these kind of cock-ups. I don't know whether it's a lack of sufficient editing, or merely time constraints. Add to that the real lack of imagination regarding language use by many of the mags contributors , the pretty damn sad lack of humour in the screencap captions, and so on and so on - and it's easy to see why I can't help but feel that NAG is a really sub-par publication. I hate to say it, but even SA PCFormat does a better job regarding layout and content. Sure, it's copy-pasted from the UK version, but that just illustrates how much  better  the UK and American mags are.  Fact is, NAG relies on a core of fans who will buy the mag no matter what - perhaps to save a few bucks, perhaps to support an SA initiative. I was one of those fans, but now I doubt I'll miss any sleep if I miss buying the next NAG. As long as CNA keeps distributing UK-PCGamer here, I'll keep buying it, it's easily worth the extra 20 bucks to get a real quality publication. My message to NAG fans - try thinking out of the box for a moment. We, as readers, deserve the best our money can buy in a publication, and the sad truth is that NAG just doesnt deliver. Pick up a foreign import mag every now and again and compare - I'm sure you'll see where I'm coming from. And if a NAG employee ever reads this blog, here are a few pointers, and a few things to consider. One, this isn't simply pointless flaming, this is honest concern from someone who used to be a big NAG fan. It's time to up your standards. Yes, it's great that you're bringing back the cover cd, yes it's great that you're including posters - these are all great gimmicks, but they aren't enough. It's time you guys took yourselves seriously. Look at your font faces, look at your layouts, look at your cover. Keep It Simple, Stupid. Get an identity, create a brand. Don't clutter the cover too much, it looks  ugly . Take a look at PCGamer. Or Electronic Gamer Monthly. And try to emulate them. Don't accept mediocrity - we consumers don't.
