As I was walking by the free book self today I picked up two new books. One was called hatchet jobs and the other one was called desiderata. Both a hard cover book which is rare on the free shelf. I think I need a vacation to read all the books I have been collecting. LOL I think a vacation would be a good idea either way.  So the guy I share my office came back from vacation today. Damn and I was getting so used to being in here alone. Don't get me wrong he is a nice guy but he doesn't seem to grasp the simple things you tell him. Like he had his computer replaced over the time he was gone and I told him that he will have to call the help desk to have his password changed before he can log in. What does he do, he tries to log in and then says his cant. LOL some people he.
