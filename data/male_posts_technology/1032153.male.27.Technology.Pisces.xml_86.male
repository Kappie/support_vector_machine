An email went round at work today saying that a silver nissan pulsar had left it's lights on. Anyway at the end of the day I went down to the carpark and attempted to start my car, and found that I had left my lights on. The lights of my kinda silver Alfa Romeo 33ie! Jono being the kind and wonderful person he is did not hesitate to come in from Manurewa and jump start my car. Jono you are a legend of a friend. Thanks.
