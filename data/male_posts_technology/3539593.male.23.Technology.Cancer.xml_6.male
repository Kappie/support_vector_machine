So I stopped writing.  I put my head down and tried to plow through this summer, as if something better were waiting on the other side.  Some other time I'd have the inspiration to begin writing again.  Well, bullshit.  This is not a work of art, or at least that should not be its driving force.  This is my conscience, my voice, and my mirror.  I don't even think there's a single person out there who reads it, so it's about time to put these words to good use - that is, to start making some consistent sense out of my life.  I'm always afraid to write about my philosophies - they sound so trite and self-riteous when I go back to read them later (I think trite and self-riteous describes most of philosophy for that matter).  Writing through self-consciousness is bit like shooting through a slump in basketball, only way to get your rhythm back is to keep at it.  So that's what I'm doing.  The best thing I ever did for writing was keep a 'throw away' notebook.  I made myself just write whatever, not worrying about its quality, all the time knowing this was just excercise - nothing I would want to keep for later.  It gets me out of my head.  Softens my focus, so I'm not so worried about the product, and more invovled and interested in the process.  It's also really good for organizing my thoughts.  Not necessarily so I can sort out specific thoughts, but so that my mind becomes comfortable with following through on moments of inspiration.  It's a matter of tricking my mind into getting out of the way so my self can come through.  I like that description.  Anyways, that's what this was supposed to be, and that's what it shall be.  Maybe eventually I can stop writing about my writing and get on with my writing.  Here's to perfect simplicity.
