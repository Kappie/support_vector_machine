Those infected with this logic variant seem to blindly swing their fists at anything that comes close enough for them to touch. And then there are the invincible. Those untouchable by anyone, because they're big, and they're strong.    Note: Don't fuck with me, I'm crazy.   So speaking of these 'big and strong' individuals, some choosing to fight with fists, and some even with words, these truly shallow beings that are mocking depth are the ones that are my targets.  To truly hate this breed of human, the shallow and invincible, the false smiles and lies and stories they tell, and the ones that attempt to interfere, will fall first.  Those who ruin others' lives, those who hurt others, tell great tales and pretend they know just how you feel, that they are in the same position and always will be, that they are just like you, they will fall first.   To enter a domain that is sacred, to interfere, will be the death of you.  CG
