( hope u'll not mind it)..such a cool guy...sharp witted..humor filled up from head to toe.. some people do call him "hakka chow" but he himself calls him as  urlLink 'The last manipuri samurai'  . he is working in IT industry for so many years but always up his sleeves against it. According to him, IT is not at all creative...so my ideology with him clashes sometimes.. basically, he is a normal guy (as girls are always on his mind, if this was not the case , then he was not normal.. :) ) Dude, i am trying to write about you... but not able to find words.. Describing this guy is real tough.. he is a very nice company.. always keeping you in high spirits.. he has just become a team lead.. Cheers !!!!  Hey man....u  r beyond words.. thanx for being such a nice friend.... if u wanna know more of him.. just be his friend..and..u 'll love him...
