I don't really know what it is I like about the music, but I do. There's something I like about their style, both intense, soft, loud, harmonic, dissonant, rhythmic, arhythmic, and a lot of other stuff. Maybe I feel like they do a good job of conveying emotion, of taking my mind off the fact that there's a voice combined with drums and a guitar and other instruments. When a band succeeds in taking you away from the fact that they're playing instruments to make sounds, they're doing something right. It's like the figure skaters that make it look as if the triple lutz is simply a matter of pulling your arms into your body to create more speed.
