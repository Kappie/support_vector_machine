What used to be extreme sensitivity constant internalization is being replaced by a numbness or indifference to things. Even those subjects, people, places, and things that I used to have passionate feelings or toughs for seem to have become less important thoughts that pass through my head without consideration. Don't get me wrong....my peeps are my peeps, but I just have a far lower tolerance for bullshit and drama. I think I'm just tired of the anxiety that comes with being so concerned about things. I think I need a long holiday......and the right companion to join me.
