I headed left from my house up the river, knowing that there was a nice secluded area bout 3 min up the path where I could sit along the river and enjoy my breakfast.  When I got there, I looked out in the grassy field and notices something dark and out of place.  At first I thought it might be a snake, as there was what appeared to be a head poking up out of the grass.  Then as I got closer, I realized it was a big ole' painted turtle.  Very cool.  I managed to snap a few pictures of him (her?).   I got pretty close for the closest picture, but I didn't want him to get all hidden in the shell and disturbed, so after that I left him on his wild journey.
