So now, when I click on a hyperlink inside of an MSN chat window, the URL opens in Firefox instead of IE. The method is pretty simple. Here are the instructions for disabling IE.  Do a search through the registry for 'iexplore.exe' and 'url.dll'. Replacing  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT  instances of these two with the path to your alternative browser seems to do the trick. I now have all my other Microsoft apps that would normally call IE, now calling Firefox.  For instance, I have Mozilla Firefox as my alternate browser so I replace with the following:  open/command -> C:PROGRA~1MOZILL~1FIREFOX.EXE -url "%1" DefaultIcon -> C:PROGRA~1MOZILL~1FIREFOX.EXE,1   It seems to have worked for me. Give it a try. Don't forget to back up your registry before editing it. You might have to restore it if all goes badly.
