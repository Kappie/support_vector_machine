I have been at school this evening doing stuff for stagecoach, i dont mind too much becuase i get paid for all that. Anyway i am suffering from sleep deprevation, actually it feels like in the night when my body is trying to go to sleep, a team/army of small ompa-lompa type beings is creeping into my room, picking me up and taking me to several amusment establishments, where i am forced onto a vast amount of high intensity rides, after which i do one lap of the world (running) after which i am thrown out of an airoplane traveling at extream veloicity (without a parachiot) i would then land in the sea and have to swim the length of the atlantic, followed by many a hungry shark back to my bedroom, where the seemingly nice small people would tuck me in and leave me there to awake in the morning feeling like the night never happened. So thats that out the way. See you all soon, Dave
