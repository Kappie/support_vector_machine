How could there be multiple books at the #1 slot?  And before I expose the obfuscated philosophy of writing  #1 bestseller's let me tell you one thing. This article is based on my wild imaginations and by categorically stating this; I hereby absolve myself from all the legal implications that you may beget by misinterpreting and misrepresenting it thereof.  ...and yes dont take my buffoonery seriously. :-)  So how do you write a #1 international bestseller?  You don’t have to have that maneuverability in your style of writing. Writing in prose can do. The mass, people like me, who you should target, would anyway not appreciate your phraseology. Don’t target those book reviewers or intellectuals. One way is to strike a deal with them to share revenue based on the quality of their reveiews. Impressions matter. Its ok if you don’t earn from your first book. Once your brandname is established, people like me will will buy your books and after completing reading it and feeling proud about having read it (at least having completed yet another book in their lives) they’ll invariably rattle about its contents to their friends.   Concentrate on the content, but don’t worry about the quality of it too much. The more varied it is the better for your readers to converse on the newly discovered information. Don’t go deep. Don’t make them work hard. Serve everything on the platter. Understand their psyche pal. They need something to talk about; to show that they know and to prove that they are not hollow within. That they are more than X kgs of emotions and flesh. So concentrate on the content from this perspective.   If it’s not good they’ll talk about how bad it is. Anything will do. But something has to be there. Most of them don’t watch their thoughts and don’t care about the quality of what enters within. They are congenitally predisposed to ingest any and every thought that’s predominant of that era. Remember this, and remember that they are unable to conceptualize something out of the box.    A little mental stimulus is a human need. But offering too much of it is a recipe for disaster.It should do good enough to their ego’s by making them feel that they are intellectually more evolved after having read yet another book. But don’t go deep. Don't try be a historian. They just need an assurance that you have gone deep enought form them to be able to quote your work during their evening get togethers. Don’t expose your acemadic interest. Remember your objective, to be a #1 international bestseller.     This is a big world my dear friend.Some will read you for they have the habit of reading and a curiosity to explore and know others.Some will read because they have fought with their husbands, some will read because they are depressed and some will read because they want to do something more worthwhile in their life that reading newspapers and watching TV. Some will read to increase their reading speed and some will read because the feel that they should read more.   Your books should satisfy all of them, at least to a certain extent. People want something to do. At at the end of the day they’ll want feeling of accomplishment. Something that gives them Joy. They are all the same and strive for the same objective, joy; eternal Joy. And these humans have devised innumerable ways to find that joy. One of them is competing with each other and striving hard to prove in some or the other way that, their choices, their habits, inclinations are superior to others. The intensity of this desire varies in individuals. So you need to figure out how to relate with most of them. Remember your objective, to be a #1 international bestseller.     Give them what they want. And don’t you live under the illusion that it should be something out of this world. And if you have come till this point you know what i'am saying is right. People are interested in nonsence. They love wasting time.But dont get offended. Your objctive is important.Writing a #1 international bestseller. Don't get distracted.     Then the question arises, what should you do to write a #1 international besseller ?   ...More in part 2... :-)  till then take good care of yourself !
