The crowd was smaller than usual. But I think the few people that stuck around until the end ( thanks Chris! ) had a good time. So did I. Noticed that I tend to close my eyes or stare into the sky when performing in front of crowds. Ah well. Better than imagining them in their underwear...   Watched  urlLink Mitch Hedberg  at the  urlLink Improv , and was let down. Too much new material that didn't always work. Plus the crowd was a bit slow to appreciate the stuff that did work. I wouldave been happy to just watch him do his Comedy Central special all over again.   Rushed to the  urlLink Quarternote  to play at my first non-work gig with the  Red White And Blues  (which I'm apparently part of, now). We did 9 songs. Or was it 10? Doesn't matter. I didn't really know half of them anyway. And the crowd of 5 odd people didn't care. I've concluded that people have very low expectations of harmonica players. I can dish out pretty much the same crap over and over and over and over again, and everyone's happy. Good for me. Need more practice. And a louder amp.       Saturday     Played tennis with Apu in the afternoon. He's getting very good. And that serve keeps getting deadlier. I had one of  urlLink these  wrapped around my arm, and it worked!! I lasted a good hour on the court! Good bye tennis elbow !    After a late late lunch at Inn-N-Out (yum), Rachel and I headed out to the  urlLink Mojo Lounge  for their 1 year anniversary celebration. 5 hours of non-stop FREE blues!  urlLink R.J.Mischo  and  urlLink Gary Smith  are freaking awesome on the harp. And they both sing pretty damn well. More reason to take vocal lessons. Oh, and this time around, I remembered to clear my tab before I left.
