The nonpartisan agency said the annual budget shortfalls will total nearly $1.4 trillion over the next decade, compared with a $5.6 trillion surplus the CBO forecast in 2001.    $1.4 trillion is a lot of money. But that's not all.    If the tax cuts are extended, the CBO said, deficits would grow by an additional $1.6 trillion over the next decade    What's this? The $1.4 trillion deficit will become $3.0 trillion if the tax cuts are made permanent? Who would have guessed Canada would be in a better financial position in 2010 that the United States?
