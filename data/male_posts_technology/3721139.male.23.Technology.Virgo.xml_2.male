Anyway, someone I trust a whole lot says it's totally addicting, and a good idea.  So, I guess I'll try it out for a few days.  I figure, sure, I'm a bit of an exhibitionist, so this fits right in.  The great thing about exhibitionism is that you get your thrills even if no one sees you.  It's just that the opportunity was there.  So that's my way of saying, leave a comment if you want. Or not, no worries.  No promises though.
