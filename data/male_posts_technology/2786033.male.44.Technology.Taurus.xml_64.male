Their most recent Email:       Subject: Short  Quick -- we need ya Sunday (plus internships etc.)       We need you Sunday.       The local campaigns are just getting up and running, and  we need some      extra help  this Sunday for the trip to the Coast.  Please RSVP by      emailing lucas@busproject.org.  (emphasis mine.)   I'd offer to help, but the 'help' required for these hippies begs to be administered in the form of a Louisville Slugger to the back of the knees. And I'm NOT spending another Father's Day in court/jail.
