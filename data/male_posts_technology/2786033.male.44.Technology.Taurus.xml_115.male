DON'T PISS ME OFF!  Let's say somebody is a really  good  fighter, would they advertise like that?    What if somebody isn't too good with their fists?  When they're about to get anihilated, do they say, "OH!  The shirt?  -I was just kidding."   OK, Mr. DON'T-PISS-ME-OFF, what gives?  Why did you get dressed today with such a singular lack of taste and discernment?  Did you think you might get better service at the clinic because you wore that?  Haven't you ever heard the proverb: "If you want sweetness, don't kick the bee hive"?    Maybe it was just laundry day?
