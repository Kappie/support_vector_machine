Diet, as in reduced calorie intake, is a good thing... for me specifically but theres probably a few of you that are nodding patting your bellies and going 'hmmm' First thing I want to talk about is the 'hah, I'm the shit' diet... on this diet, I do what -I- think is best, and what -I- think will be most effective in regards to losing weight. The key? eat less, and make sure what I do eat minimises muscle wastage. Results? 9 days, 5 kg. "but thats unsafe!" oh fuck off.. no more unsafe than being MORBIDLY OBESE.. sheesh.. I'm sure me forcing my body to feed off its stored fat (which incidently is exactly why your body stores fat ANYWAY) is no harder on my system than say, drinking a 40oz, smoking a fiddy bag, and jogging a fricking marathon through snow and ice. In the whole scheme of things starvation is a very bad idea. Why? because your metabolic rate slows, as your body goes into self preservation mode.. also the first thing your body feeds on isnt fat.. its muscle.. oh fuck.. yeah thats right - you kinda need those, unless you wanna be a girly man for ever. Also, some of your internal organs? yeah.. they need the muscle they have to be able to work.. your heart.. yeah it wouldnt work too good if it was too weak. Bugger. Death. So dont starve yourself, this is bad. Sure, you'll lose weight quick, but like, what are you fucken stupid? so keep your protein levels up, to stave off any muscle wastage, keep your electrolyte, vitamin and mineral count high, keep your fluids high to float the toxins from your system, and it wont kill you, try walking instead of driving. That said, I think tomorrow Ima have a pizza, 4 bags of chips, a 1.5 of mountain dew, and lots of chocolate.. ok I'm pulling your leg, but I'll let myself have some reward, otherwise, I'll get pissed off at myself for being a hard task master and beat myself to within an inch of my life. Dont believe me? you bluddy try me!!@#!@ dont think I wont do it! Diet is good. Diet bundaberg gingerbeer, is infact god. This is possibly the diet drink to slay all other diet drinks. This brings my favourite diet drink selection to include: 1) Pepsi Max - caffiene, need I say more. 2) Diet Coke with Lime - oh shoosh, go try it, its actually good. 3) Bundaberg diet ginger beer - It's just plain nice.  I'm eating more fish, egg and chicken, virtually no carb rich foods, ok I stole a chip right outta the newspaper, but hey - yum.  I walk in and outta town, cept for when its raining because I'm a wussy girly man and my shoes leak. I've scored a new phone, due to arrive sometime.. actually I have no idea.. soon I hope - tomorrow would rock, but I'd almost put money on it NOT arriving tomorrow. It's the new telecom 027 flip phone with camera that they're advertising a 'buy one get the other for 99' thing for? yeah.. how much did I get mine for? 699? nah. 99? nah.. free nig-GUH. so like 500 texts a month, game on.  I'm still keepin my vodaphone coz screw getting seen with a flip phone in public.. but this'll mean I've got 3 digital cameras, coz the phone has one.. so I'm like 'hmmm'. My current vodafone is coo' its a nokia 5100, its got a rubber jumpsuit, and is about as close to indestructible as I've seen a phone... hell, I throw it at brent.. hit him occassionally too - yeah, I rock. I thought it was Friday today, rocked up infront of the TV to watch The OC - ahh crap was gunna claim to have intended to watch something else cooler, but like, I dont know what else is on at that time coz I only watch the OC if I'm watching tv on a friday. Gay. And yeah, I pretty much only watch TV on a friday night, on account of my friends all being in auckland, and me not liking the locals - they smell and wear swandris. >_ Tadpole rocks. Listening to 'allright' at the moment, and yeah, its allright. Duh. Oh, yeah where was I - its *NOT* friday. gay. But, on the upside, I got to see this american tv show (mtv funnily enough) where they took a clapped out piece of shit car that wouldnt get a warrant in NZ, and poured literally 20k USD into 'tricking' it up. It was called some shit like 'pimp my ride' - anyway, it did, on tv, what I mock most of the rotorua boy racer fraternity for doing, which is putting several grand worth of kit, rims, and sound system on the equivellent of a rolling hunk of shit. It cracks me up, so like dont -stop- doing it, I need stuff to laugh at , but nigga please.. get some sense. Till then, I'll go get some shut eye and dream about more automatic cars with blow off valves, and my new phone OH JOY! K thx, bye.
