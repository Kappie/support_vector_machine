An excellent example of doublethink in modern society is the  urlLink war on drugs . If you ask people their opinion on alcohol prohibition in the 1920s, most people would agree that it was a complete failure. People agree that it only caused more crime, it made gangsters rich, it corrupted politicians, and most importantly ... it didn't keep people from drinking.  Yet, we have almost the exact same situation today with war on drugs, yet most people think that our modern prohibition is a good idea ... and more than that, they believe that anybody that thinks that the war on drugs isn't a good idea must be completely out of their minds. In order for a person to be effective at doublethink, they must master the art of  crimestop .   crimestop:  (Orwell's definition) "The faculty of stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of any dangerous thought. It includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing to perceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical to Ingsoc (the philosophy of the powers that be), and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction. In short... protective stupidity."  -from  urlLink the newspeak dictionary
