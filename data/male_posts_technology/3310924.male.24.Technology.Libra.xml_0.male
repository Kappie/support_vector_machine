Here are a couple of pictures for ya to see.       These were taken on Anne's first visit to the Birmingham Zoo.  For that matter, probably the first trip to any zoo.  I was amazed at how good the zoo looks now.  They have this whole kids section that is really cool and includes a petting zoo.  The best part, though, was seeing the alligators.  There is this pond that is just covered in a thick layer of alge -- it literally looked like it was solid ground.  There was one alligator that you would have missed if you didn't look hard enough at the green-alge water.  Just its eyes and nose were sticking up out of the water.    Well, last night I went to see Shrek 2 and it is great!  I thought that it was a few time better than the previous movie.  I also go to see Troy and it was cool too.  I was actually surprised by the acting in it.  Brad Pitt really plays his character well.  Overall a movie worth seeing if you have the time; it is 2h45 long.    Ok, I need to go get something to eat with Joy.  I may try to post more later...  Cya.
