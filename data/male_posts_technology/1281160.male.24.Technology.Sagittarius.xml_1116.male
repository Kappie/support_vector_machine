It is good to see everyone moving into newer areas in terms of opportunities.   For the past one month, I seem to notice a drop in the number of posts and an increase in the number of mails. Is it a sign of the blog outliving its usefulness as a communication tool?  People usually have the idea that only women ought to take care of thier skin. But the skin is really an important organ for men also. I came across an  urlLink article  today. Though the products specified may not be available in India, the articles anyhow gives several tips.
