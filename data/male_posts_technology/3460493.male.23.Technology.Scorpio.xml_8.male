I went this past Saturday at 3:00 PM, only to find out all the tickets were sold out in all three theaters until  11:00 PM ! Maybe I'll be lucky and be able to check it out this weekend during the daytime.  - I finally cracked and bought myself a Nintendo Gamecube. I swore off gaming consoles when I souped up my PC and got the latest titles that couldn't compare to whatever the PSI, xebec or Gamecube was offering. But after playing games like  Super Mario Sunshine, Mario Kart: Double Dash, and The Legend of Zelda , I couldn't resist buying it, especially in these lonely and boring times alone in my apartment.   Metroid Prime   is one of the best games ever!  - There's a lot of commotion going in the Linux and Open-Source world. I personally love Linux and use it for most of my daily tasks (except gaming, the one gigantic hole Linux has yet to seal). I really don't care who wrote the Linux code, if it was stolen from Unix or Minix or any other *nix. They should focus on making it better, and let's see if Linux can finally take off on the desktop like analysts (whoever they are) have been telling for several years.  That's about all I have now, let me get back to work before I'm fired! :)
