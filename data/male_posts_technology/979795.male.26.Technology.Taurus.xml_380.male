Simple reason to it, I've been procrasitnating work and getting disorganised. I realised how it's affected even my personal life. Not physically but in mindset. My mind don't feel totally relaxed even over the weekends, I tend to forget / overlook stuff easily, etc. (oh no! senile liao!)  At least past few days I'm getting back into things. Haha, suddenly from watching all the Yi Tian Tu Long Ji vcd, I got a craving to play chinese games again. Was replaying my Jin Yong Qun Xia Zuan again. I think it's gonna be a long game man. Slowly lah, rushing also no use.  On Aikido, gee, realised I've been mising a lot of trainings at BV past 3 wks. In fact, think it was something like since Freddy Sensei went Vietnam. Alamak, I better decide properly whether I'll be training in Pillars or BV. And decide soon I must. At least I've been really consistent at Siglap and ARCC.  I suspect that I'm beginning to compare things in different dojos and clubs. But even under AFS, I Siglap gives me such a nice feeling compared to BV. Someone once told me, the average joe in BV trains so hard and so much but they don't seem to be improving much. Why ar? I have to admit that I'm kinda inclined to agree. From a personaly point of view, I see myself that way. Maybe that's why I really want to jump out of the box a bit to experience something different. Yesterday pia like siao to BV only to oversleep on the bus all the way to the interchange. Missed Aikido lor. Wasted, apparently Tomita Shihan, 8th dan, from Belgium was conducting the class. I didn't have the fortune to experience his lesson. Head his class was quite profound, but I'm interested in these. We don't get enough on this aspect I think. Won't be able to go BB East for training today (Tomita Shihan again). I never get to BB East on time one. Previous time I rushed like siao there to see them doing kokyu ho as a final exercise. Yestrday I got there in time to help keep some mats only. Must admit I felt quite sian lah.  Never mind lah, take things as they come.  I feel quite happy because Steff from 1st year is visiting S'pore with 4 friends. They are all English. Will be meeting them later for dinner, but a bit of delimma as to where to take them for dinner. Thinking of giving them a bit of treat if dinner isn't too expensive. Daphne was suggesting Don Noodles at Park Mall. Just nice since I'm meeting the girls at Dhoby Ghaut MRT. This week gonna be quite chor coz I'm not makaning at home at all until the weekends. ~$~
