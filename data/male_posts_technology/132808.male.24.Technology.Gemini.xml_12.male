I'm just glad I wore my Ricky Williams jersey on Friday, cause there's no way I'm wearing that thing until at least next Sunday.  I have my picks, but instead of showing all of them, I'm gonna do a little segment called, "Nexus Terror??  More like Nexus Error!!"  It will be the four games I most strongly disagree with the Nextser on.  Wow, this is guaranteed to make me look really stupid at some point or another.   Cleveland @ Baltimore  - Gotta go with Cleveland.  Kyle Boller is only in his second game, and William Green is due to bust out.  Maybe not against Baltimore, but I still can't bet on a rookie QB with no recievers to help him.  Pittsburgh @ Kansas City  - In Priest we Trust, baby.  The man's back, and with Trent Green, Boa and Gonzalez and an improved defense and home field?  I smell an upset.  Washington @ Atlanta  - I don't have much faith in this one, but I promised four, so here it is.  Coles vs. Price = Draw.  Dunn/Duckett vs Canidate/Betts = Atlanta.  Brookins vs Arrington = Washington.  Bailey/Smoot vs. Buchanan/whoever = Washington. The kicker would have been Vick vs Ramsey to give Atlanta the win, but he ain't here.  Look for the Jetskins to shine again.  Chicago @ Minnesota  - You're gonna hear a whole lotta Culpepper to Moss in this one.  Kordell Stewart?  Slash?  Kordell's slash alright.  Kordell sucks/blows/couldn't find an open reciever if he was sleeping with his wife/... you get the picture.  Also, and this'll probably piss Russ off, but look for Houston to maybe be 2-0 by the end of the week.  Why?  New Orleans has lost 4 regular season games in a row since last year, losing to such perennial Super Bowl contenders Cincinnati, Carolina, Minnesota and Seattle.    Oh, and this weeks tip: If you decide to get into a UFC fight with one of your buddies, do everything in your power to make sure it's not the one who's father is a seventh degree red belt and one of the scariest men in all of Manitoba.
