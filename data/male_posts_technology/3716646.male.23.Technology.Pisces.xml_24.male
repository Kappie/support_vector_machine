Impressions follow.  It was more emotionally exploitative than I had hoped for.  Probably a little more than I expected, even.  The montage for the actual 9/11 event was subdued albeit heart wrenching.  The close ups of a mother describing her grief at losing a son to war affected me the most and could have been cut back a little I think.  Subtitled Iraqi mothers screaming at their loss of family were equally disturbing.  The point (I hope) of all this severe emotion is to impress the silly liberal ideal that killing someone is wrong, and touches lives in ways we can't comprehend.  Weird concept.  I knew once I had watched the film, I could label it.  Clearly Moore's bias prevents this from being called a documentary.  This movie is reality television.  Every single thing you see is real, but the images and sounds are put together in a produced manner to impress a particular point of view.  A thin line of actual reality is shown, but truth is reflected no matter how shallow it may seem.  That said, the movie is effective in laying out the truth vis a vis the Bush admin's fundamental mishandling of the War on Terror.  Don't call it propaganda, unless you are ready to call White House press releases the same.  As a friend just told me, I don't agree with how Mike Moore handled the whole movie but someone had to make that movie, and it wasn't me.  Laying out everything in a line like he did will open some eyes.  Nothing new in the movie, but a good way to present facts en masse.
