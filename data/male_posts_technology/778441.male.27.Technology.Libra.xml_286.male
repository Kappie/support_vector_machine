"I had no such intention because when any company in America, or Britain or Germany, decides to ask Tata Consultancy Services or Infosys Technologies or any other Indian firm to help it as far as outsourcing is concerned, it (the US company) does so for its own commercial gains," Advani said.  "It (the US company) is not in any way helping India. Its objective is not to help India or to help that (Indian) company. No. So if any US state feels this is not in its interest, let them take a decision," he argued. Well said, Mr. Advani!! I'm glad you did not "plead" on this issue.  But now... can you do the same on the cross-border terrorism issue? Please cut out the pleadings and start fighting our wars on our own!
