This is really odd because I usually don't wake up until 8 or 8:30 and I end up being late. But this morning I was up early and since Jenny and I are in the middle of a Cold War I didn't bother waking her up because in the morning I would get more shit than usual. This made me awake and dressed at 8 am. So I went to work early. Sounds good so far, doesn't it? I did my usual work stuff and came back from Ann Arbor, that's when the shit started to break.  I stopped at the house to make a call about insurance for the stupid trailer I'm trying to sell. I called them up was just going to pay to renew my insurance and in the conversation I told them that it ran out because I only get my mail from there like every 2 or 3 weeks because I don't work there anymore. This led to the girl telling me that she couldn't insure a place I wasn't living in. That was the straw the started the back breaking. After I hung up with her I ended up crying and punching things, which is how I usually deal with not dealing.  So calmed down a little after going through all the Jenny fucked up my life ranting in my head. I calmed down and bit and went back to work. Then I started to lose it again when I calculated how much my monthly bills would be if I didn't sell that stupid trailer..... and the ground total was $180 more than what I make a month. That's right if I pay all my bills I still end up in the hole every month.  Why the fuck did I ever move? I knew I couldn't aford it.
