What's remarkable, however, is that older adults use different areas of  the brain than younger people.      The study, in conjunction with the  University of Toronto and Brandeis University in Massachusetts, is to be  published in the Oct. 25th international journal Current Biology. While other  studies have conducted comparisons of young and old brain activity, this is the  first to focus on how the interplay of brain regions relates to cognitive  functioning and aging.      "The older brain is more resilient than  we think," says Dr. Randy McIntosh, Rotman scientist and assistant professor,  Department of Psychology, at University of Toronto. "If aging brains can find  ways to compensate for cognitive decline, this could have exciting implications  for memory rehabilitation."      Ten young adults (ages 20 to 30) and  nine older adults (ages 60 to 79) participated in identical visual, short-term  memory tests while their brain activity was measured using positron emission  tomography (PET). PET measures regional cerebral blood and acts as a marker to  show which brain areas are lighting up during a memory performance task.       Participants were shown pairs of  vertical grid patterns on a computer screen and asked to select which one had  the higher spatial frequency. After viewing each pair, they would press one of  two keys to indicate the correct grid. Researchers measured their ability to  discriminate stimuli over half-second and four-second intervals.      Results show that young and older  participants perform the memory task equally well, but the neural systems or  pathways supporting performance differed between young and older individuals.  While there was some overlap in the brain regions supporting performance (e.g.  occipital, temporal and inferior prefrontal cortices), the neural communication  among these common regions was much weaker in older individuals.      Older individuals compensated for this  weakness by recruiting unique areas of the brain, including hippocampus and  dorsal prefrontal cortices. Scientists are most fascinated by the older brain's  activation of the hippocampus because this area is generally used for more  complicated memory tasks such as learning lines from a Shakespeare play.       Dr. McIntosh was assisted in the study  by Dr. Allison Sekuler, Department of Psychology, University of Toronto, and her  father Dr. Robert Sekuler at Brandeis University.      Funding for the study was provided by  the Alzheimer's Association of America, the Natural Sciences and Engineering  Research Council of Canada, and Medical Research Council of Canada.
