Gwen (man, I miss her) > For her mission trip, that everything will continue to go well, that people will continue to function with lack of sleep and that they would all be protected from any diseases that might be going around (and bugs and stuff). 2. My mom > She's been under constant emotional attack lately, not only from my dad and sister, but also from the majority of her church, who have sided with my dad. 2. My sister > She's kinda heading down the wrong path, siding with my dad in all the new issues. She's becoming harder and harder to live with and I want that to change. 3. Bwitty > She's going through a tough time in her life right now. I don't really know any details, if you read  urlLink her blog , you'll be about as informed as I. 4. Josiah, Jesh and Jalon's family. > Apparently they just lost a grandpa. 5. People like me, Steven and Laurie (a friend from  urlLink YouthFire.com  - check out  urlLink her blog ), who live in situations involving an abusive, or at least, over domineering parent.  Goodnight fellow firework-toting patriots and others, alike. Go with God.
