TCS will soon be a major component of indices and every MF will want to have TCS to have an average weightage of  5 %  in their portfolios to match with Infosys and Wipro. They sure have already bought some but will buy again after listing, as they have a tendency to buy in lots periordically as they generate cash, with a wait an watch approach. This demand will have a chain reaction later by way of demand from Foreign Institution and then lastly from retail investors. All the retail investors who invested now are lucky, but they should still be carefull and keep watching it continuously for price movement and book profits periodically if rises above 1250. Otherwise in any case it is a sureshot long term bet. You can keep it for your children. They will make a fortune. It has the potential to become a Microsoft. The Company's strategy is to be among the world's top 10 Tech firm by 2010.       Saurabh Birla
