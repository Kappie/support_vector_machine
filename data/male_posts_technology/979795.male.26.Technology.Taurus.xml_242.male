I've always thought that I would take a bit of time before I even get any ideas about another relationship. Well I made a mistake about the girl's intent and the we had a good talk about stuff. It seems that all the girl did was just being really really friendly and sociable and that kinda gave me the wrong idea. Sure it was embarassing but what struck me the most was the amount of courage she must've mustered to come tell me nicely. Take note, I know a lot of girls who just have a problem telling people they're simply not interested in the guy. They tend to be really really nasty about stuff. But with her, she was really nice about it and that helped things along a whole lot. The way things turned out was so great (honest!), we could talk again right after the conversation we had. It's really kinda embarassing talking about all this stuff online here and now. But when you think about, I think I managed to face the truth of the situation. It's a growing process and I'm not ashamed of sharing it with anyone else. In fact, it feels kinda good. :)  Girls out there take note on one area you may want to work on. Guys out there take note about another area you want to be careful with. Heh ... today has been a good day, let's hope 2moro will be too, especially being my last Aikido practice for this month. Gonna video it down again. Erm, talking about Aikido, the daily practice I put into my 8 diretional exercise is definitely helping. I dunno any meditation stuff that I can use to usually calm myself but doing repetitions of bokken work for about 30-60 mins is definitely a way to reduce any tension you have and clear most thoughts from your mind.
