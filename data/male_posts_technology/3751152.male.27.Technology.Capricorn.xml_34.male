I've finally found a free ten minute window to write something down in (although as I say that, here comes my boss to ask some random question...)  Anyway, it's been a hectic few days.  The biggest saga is that my roommate has graduated and is now off to San Francisco in a month for a job.  This leaves me considering options for housing in the near future, with the favorite being to stay in my current place and find a new roommate or two (it's a 3 BR place), but of course this requires either screening random wackos who answer a classified ad, or hunting down people I know who can get out of rental agreements in short order.  Human interaction, of course, is not something that I have any semblance of skill in.  So we'll see where this leads over the next few weeks.  Meanwhile I find myself playing on two crappy soccer teams (and before you ask, they were crappy BEFORE I joined, although I'm not going to help the situation any.)  This would be fine and dandy if it weren't nearly 90F (~32C) outside all week and we actually had subs.  As much as I enjoy running around for 90 minutes at that temperature, there's a point where there's just no more fluid to sweat out.  Hmm.  Maybe I can find a roommate who has an interest in soccer.  Oh, and book your seats now on the Lorax Express to Trail/Fruitvale in October.  We're aiming for new world record times.
