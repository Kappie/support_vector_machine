Apparently Dr. Hunter, a professor at Cambridge University (she is no relation to me as far as I know â€“ and que lastima too, I want to visit Antarctica!) did some observation of penguins and has recorded numerous cases of penguin prostitution!  Yes,  urlLink sex for pebbles .  Apparently some of the males seem to realize what is going on, while others think they are courting legitimately only to end up short a few stones and singing the blues.  What an odd world we live in. 	Also I went for a little bike ride with Isaac and Kristen tonight.  We were only out for an hour, but rode 15 miles over some fairly hilly terrain so it was a nice workout.  On one particularly steep downhill spot I hit 31+mph, a new personal record (and kinda scary on a bicycle).  The uphill spots went a bit more slowly.  Bicycling is certainly easier on the old joints than jogging however, and one goes SO much faster. 	A new release of  urlLink Firefox  (0.9.3) has come out to fix a few bugs.  If it seems like a nuisance keeping up with the updates, don't give up hope.  Apparently there is an auto-update feature in the works, maybe for version 1.0.  Plus, it is better to have an update to install, than to surf unprotected. 	And finally, I am headed off to a  urlLink conference  at  urlLink ISU  this Sunday which has me all excited.  Apparently there will be some heavy hitters there however, so I might be a bit out of my depth (at least in the bio and chem stuff).  I am looking forward to trying to hob-nob with serious scientists, and especially to making a long list of all the cool computer stuff a certain college near me needs to acquire.  I will take my laptop and try to look professional.  On the down side, this means I won't be here for the next two inventories, I will have my cell, but I am really hoping that late night calls won't be necessary.
