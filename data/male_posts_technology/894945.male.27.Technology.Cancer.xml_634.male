Firstly, Toaster, great night at yours on Thursday dude. Much fun was had by all. I feel that I should perhaps tell everyone of the nights events, so here I go in brief....  Got to Toasters to discover that Custard, Hannah and myself were the first to arrive, so we drank beer to pass the time until others arrived. Once everyone was there, we cracked open the red wine (YAY!!!) and got out the Trivial pursuits. Now at first I was a little apprehensive that Damo, his lady and Jo were all on the same team! I was however, not bothered at all that Damien (TIT!), Toaster (WIMP) and Dougle (Pussy with nails) were in team two! And so the game commenced and to my surprise, my team (Custard, Hannah and myself) were the first to pick up a piece of pie, although I must say that Hannah was the smartest of the three of us, commanding a veritable hotpot of knowledge that stunned and amazed!!! Although we got all of our pieces of pie, leaving everyone else with only three pieces behind, we stumbled on the final center circle because the other teams gave us history (usually my strongest subject, when I'm not drunk!) questions! In the end, 'Team Brain' as I now call them won, much to my horror.  And so the night carried on and we, or maybe just I, drank lots more wine...... Later we got out the Pictionary and changed the teams around, leaving me on Toaster and Damien's team (I was doomed!). As it turned out, we all gave the game up after a while as people were either tired of too drunk!  The only other incident was Toaster taking his shirt off and going out on his balcony, and for some reason I ended up getting into a fist fight with him and Dougle, who by the way, used his nails to scratch when he fights, and I have the little marks to prove it!! I cannot say who came off the best, but I can say that the two of them were no match for my Splash hardened psyche!!!  Now last night I went out with some good friends and got drunk, enough said!  One last thing...... Damien, I normally draw like a god when I'm playing drawing games, and if you did indeed tell me that I was shit at drawing then fair enough as I was obviously too drunk to remember, however, I am not drunk now and I'd just like to say that you are a fucking tit!! Also if you would like to take it any further then just let me know as I think you would be quite impressed with what I can draw, using my fist, on your face.  Anyway I'm done, all is said......  Baity signing off.....  'Into Glory Ride'
