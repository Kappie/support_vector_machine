It's also cool that I have been placed in my cousin and uncle's crew, Errol and Spencer. Before I got there, started work for the company, they were working on cleaning up a spill that occurred at location 2-11-B. Today was the last day on that job.  It’s complete. Onto what's next on the list (fiberglass line at Area 6).  So, yea...since yesterday I have been helping with the final clean up in that area (2-11-B). Mostly Back-hoe work, back dragging and what not. Since there were three in our group, we all took turns operating the back-hoe (I still know how to operate :D). Kinda funny because we could only fit one back-hoe in that area, so when one was operating the machine, two persons kicked back in the truck, doing nothing *L*. Anywho, that area is along the river. We had to use extreme caution because of all the flow-line that run through the area. One mishap and the San Juan River would be polluted with either gas, oil, or salt water.  Well I got off early today, at 5:00 or so. I went to my aunt at the counseling center. This is where her office is at. The other day she asked if I could clean up her computer (A company system). So I went there to do this, but she was working with a patient and I offered to take her PC home with me and I can work on it here. All went OK, until she couldn't find the OS disk. Because of that, I couldn't work on her system. So I left for home without the tower. I'll probably work on this when she does find the disk.  I got home and started on cleaning up the house and what not, finished this and started to write an entry for my blog...I do all my writing on WordPad before I post it on my blog. I was a bit tired so I laid down on the couch and fell asleep, spaced my entry I was typing. I slept for two hours or so, got up at 8:15 and was like "whoa," thinking "huh?" I got out of that daze and remembered the "aminals," and walked down to the corral and fed them. I also took apples for the horses, *crunch* *crunch* is all I heard.  Altogether we have 14 cows, four bulls, and four horses...oh, and nine sheep :P. I killed a lot of our sheep with the latest batch of hay we've had. Pure alfalfa...sheep can't really handle all that protein I guess. Our cows, hmm...only two or three of them have papers, registered. The rest are reservation cows, cows without papers :P. All the bulls are registered, and are used for breeding purposes only. Yet local stock contractors still come around asking if our bulls are for sale. We have four horses. Only one is registered, the Arabian, "Dynasty M Dancer." The other three, despite their good bloodline are not registered.   We've tried to get the Arabian impregnated, just to have another pure bred Arabian around the corral. Twice, a $1000 stud fee was paid, but to no avail, no lil "horsie." All I can say is...*Hmm*. In the horse industry this type of service can range from...in the low hundreds for a stud that doesn't have a “good” bloodline up to...heck thousands, or even up into the hundred thousands for a good bloodline. That would be cool though, to have a stud fee for your services *L*. Money in the pocket :P.  Our "aminals" are always kept in the corral, in their pens. Only time they get to be out is when they go to the pasture. It's kind of a good thing to keep them in the corral/pens when they are out here because they don't contribute to overgrazing like some other peoples livestock. One time, way back then, it was...ugly looking out this way due to overgrazing. I don't know what happened, all of a sudden there were fewer livestock out there roaming and grazing wherever. And now it's starting to look...really nice out this way, green and colorful with native plants, bushes, etc.  Whoa. Yea...Anyhow, I'm actually starting to feel a whole lot better. Mainly because I keep myself busy with whatever I'm doing at the present moment. Working with Errol and Spencer also contribute to myself “feeling better” as well. When we're just sitting around, they talk crazy nonsense in Navajo, and it just makes me laugh. I don't know..."Laughter is the best medicine" I guess :P. I don't know what else to say. Wish I could keep writing about this and that, but that would only take more time and I need that time to sleep and rest for tomorrow.
