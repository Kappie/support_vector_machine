But now I've upgraded to  urlLink Astrojax  - the Swiss yo-yo of the future.  And it's only a matter of time until the ladies go crazy for my advanced three body technique.
  
There's some hot stuff on the Astrojax website.   urlLink Physics equations  to explain how the whole thing works.  And ridiculous  urlLink video  of Swiss kids with dreadlocks working the astro magic.
