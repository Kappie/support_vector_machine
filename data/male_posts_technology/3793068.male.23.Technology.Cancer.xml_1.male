If you happen upon this blog, then feel free to look around and explore, but I doubt you will find much of any interest. I am a wholly un-original person (hence the title). I am not funny, nor do I write very well.  The true purpose of this site is for my own amusement. It is a creature that I might do my insidious and sinister experimenting. There might be times in which I update everyday, or I might go weeks on end without a single post; I just don't know.  Also, all views expressed on this site are strictly mine. If you don't agree with them, then that is your problem, not mine.  Without further ado...let the blogging begin.
