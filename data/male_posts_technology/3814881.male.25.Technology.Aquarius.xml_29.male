After doing some reading, I'd like to offer some new insight into that question and officially make up my mind.    In a word, He did not.  This is very important question, because it has implications regarding covenant theology, the importance of the Law, and other things.  So, I officially think that He kept the Sabbath not only according to His own standards, but according to the Word of God revealed to Moses (as if they were different).    My decision has been based on some very interesting commentary on the Gospel of Mark by Mark Horne (see  urlLink The Victory According to Mark ).  He looks at the famous story of the disciples picking grain on the Sabbath, and how Jesus claims that He, being the Son of Man, is also the Lord of the Sabbath (Mark 2:27-28).  In a nutshell, there is nothing contradictory with the Old Testament Sabbath Law in this story except the Pharisees' interpretation.
