I think the trick to a good layout is balancing functionality with artistry - too much of the former is boring, too much of the latter makes for difficult reading.  As for the background music, I thought of using one of my  urlLink chainsaw  sound effects in an infinite loop, but then I couldn't stand to be on my own site for more than 30 seconds.  I think I'll toy with it some more and try again.  Learning, out
