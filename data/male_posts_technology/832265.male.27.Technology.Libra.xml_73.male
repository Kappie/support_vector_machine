What's less certain is whether he ran afoul of the notorious  urlLink Star Chamber  for being an atheist and decided to fake his own death to escape torture.  Assuming that he did, there are those who further believe that he fled for Italy where he continued writing.  These pseudoposthumous plays, some set in Italian towns, others about exiles, were sent back to England and published by the man we know as William Shakespeare.  Now, I heard about this by watching Michael Rubbo's  urlLink documentary  on Frontline.  When this documentary first came out last year, Rubbo himself  urlLink posted  about it to Metafilter ... but only identified himself as the filmmaker in comments.  So, this is the guy we're meant to believe in an authenticity of authorship debate?
