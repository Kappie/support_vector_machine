Anyway, as if I wasn’t geeky enough, I had the headgear for s short time, until I simply refused to wear them.  Anyway, this teen moment came after the braces were off, but I still had a retainer my soph year.  I was still getting used to it when one day, I happened to be playing around with a girl (a senior) I had known for several years.  We were just pushing each other a little when she slipped and fell on the floor.  I leaned over to help her up, and at that moment by retainer fell out of my mouth ... onto her fuzzy sweater ... and hooked itself into the fabric right between her breasts.  We were both stunned, but she recovered quick enough to start screaming “oh my GOD”, recoiling in horror from the ghastly orthodontic device.  My first reaction (the wrong reaction, of course) was to attempt to extricate the retainer from her cleavage.  I had one chance, and quickly grabbed it, twisting as if I were removing a hook from a dying fish, but it would not come loose.  At this point I have vomited hardware onto her AND grabbed her chest.  That was too much, and she ran into the bathroom to remove the retainer.  I had to wait for her to come out of the bathroom to get my retainer back.  Obviously, it was slightly awkward between us for a while.  Sorry, Jeanette.
