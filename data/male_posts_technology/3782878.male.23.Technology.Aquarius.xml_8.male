I will cure the world of all the pain and suffering it could have. I didnt think there would be so much. I traveled with a few friends of mine in the begining, ranging from an Froglok wizard, Ribbikolos, to one of my close friends an Iksar shaman named Shaktolas, both have since moved on.   I met my closest friend a paladin named Ziggur in about my 10th rotation. He also feels the innermost need to cure the world of pain and suffering. He introduced me to all of my current companions in the guild of Call of Honour. There are two Vah Shirs, a shaman named Kretais and Konath a warrior. However, I find that Ziggur needs the most of my attention. He is a wonderful companion and bodyguard, yet I find that, like myself, he puts his own life as forfeit for others to live. We ran along Norrath for many years together clearing the world of all that is evil, however as I roamed I found that evil is everywhere that I go. No matter how big the Call of Honour becomes the evil will always be bigger. Yet, we can try and what we dispell will never come back again. Their cousins and sons might, but they certainly will not.   Along the way we also picked up a few more for our journey, another paladin name Katheena and a Dark Elf named Ellektra. Both are essential for our plans. Ellektra, though her race is not one known for good has been convinced of our mission. Brell has even blessed her with the ability to mezmerize the fierce creatures that we fight so that I can heal our companions. Katheena is also essential, though not yet as strong as our Ziggur and Konath, she will soon be able to kill the monstors as swiftly as they.  For now, I must go. Tommorrow we are going to Lower Gukta to kill the Arch Magi. Ellektra needs a robe that a certain Magi drops so that she may be a more effective enchanter. I also hear that it is a prime place to clear out the undead of the area.  Akcron --- Ziggur! Wait for Backup!
