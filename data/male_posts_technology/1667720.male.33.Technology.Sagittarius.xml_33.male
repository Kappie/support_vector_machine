I immediately stopped running and just as quickly as the pain started, it stopped. Strange, no? Wondering what a heart attack would feel like and thinking about  urlLink Jim Fixx  and  urlLink Douglas Adams , I walked a stretch. Having regained my composure, I started running again and lo and behold, the pain came back. It seems that bouncing was inducing the problem.   Still don't know what was causing the pain but I'm guessing gas.      [Listening to: Intermission -  urlLink Combustible Edison  - I, Swinger (3:56)]
