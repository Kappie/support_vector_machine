God fears nothing and no one.  God moves with intentionality and power.  To live outside of God’s will puts us in danger, to live in his will makes us dangerous. How could we ever think the Christian faith would be safe when its central metaphor is an instrument of death?  How did we ever develop a safe theology from such a dangerous faith?
