Jerry (one of the guys that I live with) and I played a little Halo before the highly anticipated sweep of the Pirates in the hands of the Cubs and it was a whole lotta fun.  We played Slayer Pro 2 player death match on the map Derelict.  I haven't played Halo on XBOX for a little while now so it did take a little bit of getting used to to be able to play with some skill.  I was getting slaughtered.  I was getting slaughtered severely.  I was really getting embarrassed with my game play.  I haven't sucked that bad since I started playing the damn game.  It was terrible.  My scoping was slow, my targeting was way of.  I couldn't even kill him with a fucking shotgun.  Kill after kill, I grew more and more frustrated, but I didn't lose my cool.  I knew it was going to come back to me.  The score was 8-0, with Jerry taking credit for all kills so far.  Suddenly with a chance kill with a grenade, I was able to rattle off 12 straight to catch up and take the lead.  We exchanged kills for the next few respawns and it was fun.  A couple kills here a couple of deaths there.  The score was now 18-23 with me needing two more to take the win.  Jerry then goes on a mini tear and gets me three straight times.  Once with a shotgun, a grenade and a shot to the head with the pea shooter pistol.  Score 21-23.  I was getting scared.  I knew Jerry had been playing a while now, he's been practicing at certain levels with the sniper rifle and the pea shooter but I didn't expect this sort of skill increase.  He has gotten better, a lot better.  I give him props for raising his skill to the next level.  He is now a worthy adversary and an even better partner.  I won the game 25-21 with sniper shot to the head and a nearby grenade.  After that we played Snipers on the level with the warthogs and the desert.  I forgot the name but that started out the same as well.  I was getting picked off left and right.  I couldn't get a kill nor get my sights lined up correctly on him that I missed.  But then again, that's what you get when you play against a good player.  I was shot and killed 5 straight times and it was just hell because I did so well the first game and here we go again.  Mind you the kill limit is 15 so it's not going to be another marathon.  This is some sort of a sprint and yes, it was frantic.  He too has also gotten more proficient with the sniper rifle.  I couldn't believe it.  Shots that he would normally miss were hitting me and the little moves that I would do to avoid his shots were only buying me a few seconds to get cover.  I had to adjust and adjust I did.  Came back and got the game even.  And then it was a 1 for 1 scenario from then on.  I pulled ahead by a couple after he pulled of three straight kills.  Man was it intense.  I give him even more credit.  He is definitely better then the last time I played him.  He better with everything, grenades, rocket launchers, pea shooters, shotgun, sniper rifle, shotgun, everything.  I still won Snipers 15-13.  A lot tougher this time around because of the vastness of the level but, myeh, it's all good.  I'm really glad that he's better so when HALO 2 comes out, it's just going to be nuts!  Yes, the game is a lot of fun single player as there are unlimited amounts of enemies to plow down and the plot/story is solid but where it lacks in multiplayer and it's age, it makes up for in multiplayer fun.  I still suggest this game for people who own an XBOX but don't have Halo but I wouldn't suggest buying it for full price, try and scope around to make sure that you get a used one in good shape.  It's still worth the $30 to go buy it while waiting for Halo 2.  Now I do admit that I bought the XBOX for Halo 2, I'm glad that I bought Halo to prep myself for Halo 2.  Halo 2  I can't wait for this game.  This is going to be sweet.  This is probably the most highly anticipated game of the season for XBOX.  From a continuation of the first storyline to improvements in multiplayer game play, SHIT.  This better be good.  With games like this, one can't help but scrutinize every single fault that the game has.  I mean it's been delayed so many fucking times that when it comes out, it just better be perfect because if it's not, they will most definitely lose a lot of their fan base for constantly disappointing fans by delaying the game and then on top of that putting a product out that is well below the populace's expectations.  A few highlights that I have read about Halo 2 multiplayer are but not limited to  New maps - I am curious about what kinds of environments that Bungie made up to reinvent the wheel.  I mean you can always have the multi tiered huge as sniping levels that could take hours to accumulate 25 kills in to the oh so intimate killing rooms where to reach 25 kills would only take 10 minutes.  I hear that there will be around three classic maps that will be added to the game.  That's always fun but who is going to decide which is the coolest?  Vehicles - along with the warthog, the banshee and the ghost.  All of these will be playable in multiplayer with their  respective maps.  Remember the really big open maps where it would take forever to traverse from one end to the other on foot and even on a warthog, the Covenant ships have some sort of booster that will allow you to take a banshee and get to the other side of the map faster than ever.  The Covenant will be playable - this gives another dimension to the while thing.  I think you can play as an Elite and have their weapons but also use human weapons as well.  Sarge is still there (DUH!) but it would also be cool to have another class of humans to play as.  It would be cooler since it would really differentiate the characters.  Heck you can even put attributes to certain characters.  Say for the other class of humans, you can make them be hurt easier because they don't have the armor suit that Master Chief has.  Since they don't have the suit, they can run faster and aim their sniper rifles better.  I don't know, just an Idea.
