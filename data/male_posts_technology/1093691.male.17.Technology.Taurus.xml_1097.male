There is something that I am wondering about though. Back in the 60's and before hand or whatever, we had no such things as AIDS or HIV or any of that rubbish. So what the f*** has happened to society?  The government are getting worse as we speak, go fascism and conservative. The world today is piss. I would have loved to live back in the 80's. I could have gone to college and expected something good to be on the radio instead of something crap. Thats just going off topic now.  NHS sucks, pity I have to live with it. I'm gonna wrap myself in cotton wool and try not to break my neck or anything.
