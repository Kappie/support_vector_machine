Vito Corleone is one of my all time favorite film  (read 'film', not 'movie')  characters.   The Eugene Police are trying to regain the respect of the community. Half of Eugene was already disrespectful to the police because they might find their stash, and the other half thinks a police-free society is plausible. They have an uphill battle.
