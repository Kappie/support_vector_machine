Took off the doors, removed all the shelving and nails everywhere and shot down the floor with the hose. Lots of that unknown red powder everywhere. Later, we pulled up the fencing along the wall in Rosebud's pen. The grass had grown over much of it making it a real pain to get the fencing free.   Yesterday we went to Kona to shop. Picked up a bolt cutter from Home Depot to cut the fencing we pulled up Sunday. Bought a couple of curtain rods and shower curtains to use as temporary doors for the outside closet. Bought some tile squares to cover the board over the old barbecue grill. Ran into Jill Stewart at Lowe's. Tried eating lunch at Killer Tacos but the place was closed for Memorial Day. Ended up eating at Taco Bell instead. Costco and Fite's Furniture closed too. Stopped at Foodland in Waimea on the way back home and picked up dinner from Don's.  Got a call from Kevin. He left a voice mail message.
