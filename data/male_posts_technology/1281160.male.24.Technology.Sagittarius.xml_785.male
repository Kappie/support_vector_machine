Although I read quite often, it will be of my taste  kind only... like personality books, mental dynamics, health issues, autobiographies... and mostly tech books.. only...  Yeah philosphical like upanishads, astrology, astronomy, numerology, palmistry, sun / moon signs, body language... etc books do I have, but not reading them as often as above...  Regarding a review about ur topic.. its nice... and I liked the definitions by vivekanada  aurbindo... sorry quite indulged with some other matters...... these days.... will be free in a month or so....  Cheers
