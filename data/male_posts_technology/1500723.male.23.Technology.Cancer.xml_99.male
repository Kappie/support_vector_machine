I initialy thought of buying some cool dolls for her. After going there.. I started looking at Hand bags for my sister. I don't like the items like that and also got confused with a wrist watch. But I remeber gifting her a wrist watch a year ago and then I went to portable MP3 player area.. Just adjuscent to that there were sony sport boom box stuff which attracted But it didn't have facilities for DVD or MP3 or else I would have bought that for sure and then I moved one more rack left to go for DVD Mp3 players.. Almost purchased a sony MP3 DVD Player On my way to the billing counter.. Sales person just showed us the home theatre and now its in my room :).. I was neaway thinkin of buying a home theatre So it was a good deal any way Home theatre for 120 bucks...
