Maybe it is the depression talking, but I feel like I have already done my mourning.  After all, about 4 months ago, I passed by her (empty) desk and had a little mental flash that said "she will never sit at this desk again".  As far as I know she was right, but I don't think it took any clairvoyance on my part to figure that out - she has been sick for over a year.  I have been sad for her a few times, and felt like I should do something more for her, and somewhat guilty for not really doing anything.  I was not really that close to her, though.  Am I a heartless bastard for not crynig with everyone else yesterday, or visiting the group grief session at lunch, or not going to the service??  There is a small service Sunday, but I think I will not go.  I am sad (but not grief-stricken), but I just don't feel like it is my place to go just for the sake of showing my face.  That would be somewhat insincere of me, I think.  Maybe I will send my poem from yesterday.
