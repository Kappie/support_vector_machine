I've been working full time +, while trying to figure out what I wanted to actually go to school for. This turned into a 5 year adventure, for a 2 year degree. Hopefully my pace will increase while I go for my B.A. this fall. Best of all, I don't have to do the job hunt thing. Now I just need to finish up my Microsoft MCSE. Me and my motivation...
