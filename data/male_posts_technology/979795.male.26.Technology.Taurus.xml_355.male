I've even gotten permission from my HoD if I can arrive earlier in school so I can leave earlier too. But even then, I think my timing is going to be really tight as the last time I tried getting home at peak hour, it took me aaaaages. Anyway, no choice lah. Just do what I can liao. Eileen will be loaning me her digital camera as well so I guess I'm going to be the unofficial cameraman for the night. But seems like she'll be late because of late classes. Everything seems to be falling into place nicely woohoo.
