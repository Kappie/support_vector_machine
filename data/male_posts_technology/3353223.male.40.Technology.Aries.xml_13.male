We got to talking about life, what we want to do and how we intend to achieve it. XXX is very interested in economics and would like to make a career out of it but where would he start on the salary scale? With a bit of luck he would get more than 40K NZD a year but he already owns his own business and pays himself (significantly) better than that. He now has a mortgage so taking a salary cut would be very hard, if not impossible. Finally, being a economist in New Zealand, would probably entail a move to Wellington. And I don't think he's all that keen to move to there; after all, he lives in Christchurch for a reason. At one time XXX worked for ARM in the UK and Texas. He chose to return to NZ. From what I see he is pretty happy with that choice but ... he's not doing what he (thinks he would) love to do.  And, of course, this sets me to thinking. With Pauline away in the UK, I now have far too much time to think. What about my career? What do I  really  want to do?  There is a scene in the movie  Good Will Hunting  where the psychologist asks Will what it is that he wants from life. Will doesn't have a clue; and the psychologist knows it. He tells Will that he can't even answer a  "very simple question" . From this we are supposed to see how weak Will truely is; how fragile his image is; how empty he has allowed his core self to become.   What do you wanna do? [pause] You and your bullshit. You got a bullshit answer for everybody. But I ask you a very simple question and you can't give me a straight answer; ... because you don't know.
