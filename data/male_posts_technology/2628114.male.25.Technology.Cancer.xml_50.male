I went up Victory Parkway just past Walnut Hills High School, right by Xavier, then west into North Avondale (or whatever that area is).  I was tired and it took a few minutes to really get going.  My body felt fine even though I probably started out too fast leaving me breathless and slow by the end.  I cease to stop learning things on my runs.  Today's lesson was the noxious odor of garbage day mixed with car exhaust fumes makes for difficult breathing while running.  This is especially noticeable when you are running uphill and downwind of garbage, yecch!  It was again good to get up early and get my run done despite being more tired than yesterday.  My knee pain has mostly subsided to a dull ache and with the rest from running I will take over the next 5 days combined with a steady diet of ibuprofen should fix most aches in and around my kneecaps.  We shall see.  I'm off this weekend from any long runs due to a RRG trip.  I know my legs will get enough of a workout thanks to that.  I'll be back next week.  Today's thought for the day hit me at the end of the run for whatever reason but seemed quite appropriate considering this time of the year. And I'm proud to be an American, where at least I know I'm free.  And I won't forget the ones who died and gave that right to me.  Have a great weekend!
