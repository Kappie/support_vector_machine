Will be sticking with standard 12V DC fans. Managed to actually find some fan grilles for said fans in this burg - quite an accomplishment I must say. My old man also has a 27mm metal hole saw someplace,  which will prove  much  easier for cutting holes than using a jigsaw. Methinks, sometimes it's smarter to try and lighten the workload, eh? Chances for success improve dramatically if you lower your standards... ;) Hope to get some photos done of the process and post em. Ve shall zee...
