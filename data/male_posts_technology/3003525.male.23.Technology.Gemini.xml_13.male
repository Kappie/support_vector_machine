Instead of waiting around for the next train back to the city (which would be at 10:45-ish), I decided to just stay over at my brother's house. He'll let me borrow some clothes tomorrow, I guess. I fucccckkkkiiinn hate riding the  urlLink metra  in the morning.. the people are so friggin quirky, it drives me insane. and they talk, OH my god do they talk. I'd rather just sit there in silence, like on the  urlLink L ... bah.  the last week has been interesting. I've taken over the work that my former manager had before he was laid off. it's not tough; just annoying. he left so many pieces to pick up because he just didn't give a shiz, that it's kind of frustrating getting things organized. I have to dig up all sorts of vendor contacts for the 8 projects  that I know of . it's very likely that there are tons more that will surface eventually.   Last night I had a dream that I was at a bible camp studying passages from the bible. Part way through, Jesus came back from the dead. He was 30 feet tall, kind of ugly, and very much bald.   alright, I've gotta go to bed. I'm friggin tired, and tomorrow will be another long day... work all day, and then Brendan's birthday tomorrow night. egads. that shit is guranteed to keep me up until 4 in the morning.   ugh.
