I got a hold of his live album DVD " Live at the Astoria " a month ago.  I can't get enough of this guy.  His music sounds like it comes from another visceral plain, a totally different universe. When I was still 13, my standard for good music was if it sounded like the theme songs of the cartoons I was watching.  Whenever I listened to  Steve Vai , It somehow reminded me of robots and spaceships, aliens and warships.  I used to do very well doing his songs with air guitar (with my left hand too, mind you), but when I finally learned how to play, Iwas frustrated that I couldn't do his "simple stuff".  The album is a more culturally diverse mix of melodies and rhythms.  " Blood and Tears " has a dominant hindu flavor all throughout.  " Ultra Zone " is african, " Asian Sky "  which is Vai turned J-pop, sounds like either an airline commercial or the theme song for Dragonball. Vai described the name " Ultra Zone " as being the musician's state of mind where everything he plays is perfect and cannot make a mistake.  Michael Jordan expressed the same idea when playing basketball.  Any which way, it is easily understood.
