I leave on September 22nd in the afternoon and on the way back I'm going to stop over in Germany on October 3-6, returning to the US on October 6th.  I'm psyched! Now, to plan my trip.  My parents aren't coming to Germany, unfortunately... so far I'll be there by myself - but I'm totally ok with that.  I also have to expedite my passport since I'm going to Trinidad soon.  I found that I can do it all at the post office.  It's going to take 2 weeks to get it and I'll have to pay $60-$80 additional. But it's worth it.
