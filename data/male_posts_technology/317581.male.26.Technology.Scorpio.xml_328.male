Brad bailed, so we're looking for a roommate. Marc might be thinking about it, but I doubt he'll accept. Even for a few months:( Cliff has someone interested, so we'll see about him.   Friday night, I went to tradition, but it was mostly boring, but I got to see lots of cool people. Then on saturday I cleaned up the downstairs. and dejah came over and we watched, X, Emporer's new groove, and 2 episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion. It was fun. After I dropped of Dej, I came home and watched, Zero Effect with Kevin and Cliff. It was fun, but I stayed up way too late (3:30 am)  Got up for church at 9:30 (actually got up at 9:50) and then we got to church at 11am(it only starts at 10:30:) Oh well, it was fun. Then I had lunch at Rosita's and then went to REI with Dej. Worked from 3 - 4 then went home and saw "Spy game" with Kevin and Craig. It was a good movie, but I can only handle Craig in very small doses.   Ugh, anyway, I watched Malcolm and Simpson's with Cahlen then we came down here and watched the last 2 episodes of Evangelion. I wan't to watch them all, but unfortunately dejah doesn't have them all for me to borrow:(  Well, I've now rambled and made a huge post, when I can't even read huge posts:( And now, I'm watching Gunbuster episode 3 on the internet, so what can I say? I'm an anime slut:)  Catch you on the flip side:) T
