I'm glad my Creative Writing final portfolio is finally done.  I'm just so damn glad that everything seems (there's that key word) to be going rather all right. That's just because my new philosophy:  "I should have known going into this that I was going to get wet."  -Ben Jones (1988- )  -beej  (Maybe I'll FTP TheKelMixOne. Maybe.)
