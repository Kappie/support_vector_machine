There now should be no doubt that al Qaeda has ties to Iraq after al-Zarqawi brutally killed Nic Berg.  These people (Fundamentalist Islamic terrorists) will not stop by any means other than their own deaths.  Life means very little to them.  Your life means nothing, and their own lives mean little more. They don't fear OR respect us.  At least the old Soviet Union did fear and respect us (vice versa).  Sure, we hated the Soviets, but we respected them (from a military perspective)...hence nothing more than sabre rattling.  Of course, we did fight wars and battles over Soviet Expansionism (Korea, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Cold War), and people died on both sides...but the nukes never flew and we never attacked each other directly.  These quotes show the lack of respect al Qaeda has for our country...and also a lack of fear.  Of course it doesn't help when our media go over there and kiss OBL's ass (thanks Peter Arnett and John Miller).  Keep in mind, both interviews were after the Sudanese Government offered bin Laden up to President-in-Sheep Bill Clinton (between 1996-1998)...and he refused...and 9/11 was already in the planning stages.  Don't believe me...go  here,  and listen to the MP3 where Clinton states he could't extradite bin Laden because he did NOT commit any crimes against America.  What does Bubba call the 1993 WTC bombing?  The 1993 battle in Somilia (where it has been established that al Qaeda was there)?  The bombings of our embassies in Tanzania or Kenya?  The USS Cole?    It wasn't about legality anyway...it was war as far back as 1993...we just didn't engage them until 2001.  1997 Interview with Peter Arnett    OSAMA BIN LADEN: "some Arab 'Mujahideen' who were in Afghanistan ... participated with their brothers in Somalia against the American occupation troops and killed large numbers of them. After a little resistance, The American troops left after achieving nothing ... after some resistance from powerless, poor, unarmed people whose only weapon is the belief in Allah The Almighty, ... we learned ... the low spiritual morale of the American fighters in comparison with the experience they had with the Russian fighters. The Americans ran away from those fighters who fought and killed them, while the latter were still there. If the U.S. still thinks and brags that it still has this kind of power even after all these successive defeats in Vietnam, Beirut, Aden, and Somalia, then let them go back to those who are awaiting its return."   PETER ARNETT: "Mr. Bin Laden, you've declared a jihad against the United States. Can you tell us why? And is the jihad directed against the US government or the United States' troops in Arabia? What about US civilians in Arabia or the people of the United States?"  OSAMA BIN LADEN:  We declared jihad against the US government ... As for what you asked regarding the American people, they are not exonerated from responsibility, because they chose this government and voted for it despite their knowledge of its crimes in Palestine, Lebanon, Iraq and in other places ...    1998 Interview with John Miller of ABC News   OSAMA BIN LADEN: "We have seen in the last decade the decline of the American government and the weakness of the American soldier who is ready to wage Cold Wars and unprepared to fight long wars. This was proven in Beirut when the Marines fled after two explosions. It also proves they can run in less than 24 hours, and this was also repeated in Somalia. We are ready for all occasions. We rely on Allah. ...  NATO, that America created, we know it spent $455 billion American dollars in improving weaponry to protect Europe and America from Russia, and they did not fire a single shot. ...  The youth ... headed for Somalia and prepared for a long battle, thinking that the Americans were like the Russians, but they were surprised ... at the low morale of the American soldiers and ... after a few blows ... left, dragging their corpses.  JOHN MILLER:  Mr. bin Laden, you have issued a fatwa calling on all Muslims to kill Americans where they can, when they can. Is that directed at all Americans, just American military, just Americans in Saudi Arabia?  OSAMA BIN LADEN:  We do not differentiate between those dressed in military uniforms and civilians; they are all targets in this  fatwa.     So much for the "Religion of Peace  â„¢  "
