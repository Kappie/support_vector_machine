A few months have passed since the last time we played together; in themeantime he has written good lyrics and gave the song some structure. The problem is the balance between the instruments -- my piano is way too dominant, and Miron's guitar lines are too sparse. And there are no drums. Miron has a kit, maybe i'll try to learn it? There's also a major problem with Eran -- he's a genuinely good songwriter, but has bad timing; he just couldn't manage recording his guitar over a recording of piano and elc. guitar that Miron prepared. Completely out of beat. I'm sure we'll get over it. 
 Miron is great songwriter too. Every time he plays us some of his demos, of which he's unrightly ashamed, but i'm constantly stunned. It will be very bad if they don't develop into complete recorded songs. He's gotta get an album out, to paraphrase Waters.
