Maybe I'll post some of the other UML diagrams for a compare/contrast. There is a ton of information left out like what the requirements and specs should contain, the different types of developer and QA tests, and integration of the feature into the existing product, infrastructure and build systems.  I think accompaning the diagram with a checklist (pdf) of tasks and tasks' tasks is the next step.   urlLink     CLICK the image for a larger and readable picture    A nice site with examples of the different types of UML diagrams:  urlLink SmartDraw UML Center
