I got to the bar and started drinking with people from work as well as people that I used to hang out with a lot in my younger days (19-20).  That was pretty fun.  I did get sucked into a volleyball game with total strangers though, that was an experience.  I had to take my shoes and my socks off while still in my dress pants and take off my turtle neck.  I was not looking forward to playing a spirited game of volleyball because I knew I was still going out that night.  So I did it anyways.  Played for an hour there and it was a lot of fun.  I was the only guy there playing volleyball with a drink in one hand and a smoke in the other.  Pretty impressive if you ask me.  I was able to hit the damn ball over the net with my foot, my thigh and my head.  I guess it's the soccer player in me that was able to contribute to the team.  The other times that I did play normal were just horrible.  I couldn't get an overhand serve over the net for the life of me so I had to do the underhand sinker serve that was just too perfect.  We got done and I don't even know the score, I think we won.  It just sucked that I got super sweaty and just covered with sand that I really had to clean myself well before going to the next club.  Me and some friends from DeVry then decided to go to Alumni Club in Schaumburg.  That was fun too.  We drank quite quickly to loosen up and then proceeded to cut up the dance floor with some moves.  I was not impressed with any of the dancers that I saw there.  It was retarded.  I was just cringing at the fact that there are people like this that dance like this and their friends encourage them to dance like that.  I have no problems if people actually tried to dance to the beat and try to look good.  That's fine, I can manage with the thought that they are trying their best and not just fucking around.  The other segment of the dance floor was just plain pathetic.  Imagine this girl who was good looking but couldn't dance to the beat/rhythm for shit and at the same time she thought that she was hot shit.  It was just painful.  I would rather see a fat cow try to go with the beat and actually move accordingly to how the music went than watch a smoking hot chick with no sense of rhythm and still dancing not giving a fuck.   UGH!  The place wasn't conducive to conversation either so I couldn't really figure out if these girls were worth talking to or not.  I could easily talk to them and not listen but it just seems so unfulfilled and superficial that I can't do it.  I was even out just to get some booty but my picky ass just wasn't cooperating.  We then left there for some food since it was 2:30 in the morning.  Went to this Mexican place that was open .  Los Tapitos Tapatillos (or something like that)  $5 will get you full with a burrito suizo and a drink.  MMMMM I am still full.  Satiated even.  While there I over heard this one guy sitting next to us and he mentioned his name.  I recognized the name as someone my friend from NOW Foods (who moved to Sweden) talked about.  I mentioned to him that I was his friend's friend and he mentioned that the girl that my friend went to Sweden for was his third cousin.  UGH UGH UGH.  Yeah, then came the jokes and we had the whole place rolling.  Even the off-duty cop was ripping on my buddy that moved away.  It was a lot of fun.  I don't think my friend would have appreciated it but it was still funny as hell.    Left that place and now have been typing for the last 15 mins.  I gotta go to sleep.  I wish that "almost" was here........
