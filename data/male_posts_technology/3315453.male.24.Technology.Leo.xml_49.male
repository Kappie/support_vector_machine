Anyway I had to work today but it was not too bad. Becca had a small little party for the two of us when I got home. She made some Riblets (vegan of course) and mashed potatoes, put up some streamers and balloons, and made a cake. It was small but fun and tasty.   We are going to go to Vancouver this weekend and I am going to help Clair work on their house. He has also graciously agreed to loan us their extra car until Becca gets back from China. Of course I said I would come down every weekend to help him on the house until Becca leaves. Then I will be there for three weeks helping. We are going to take the  urlLink Amtrak  down there and will take the car home.   Well I need to go to bed because it is 12:05am and it is no longer my Birthday.
