It's not that I don't like being called a right-winger, it's just that the perception of being  right wing  is skewed in southern africa. If someone calls you right-wing, it seems a given that you're then some khaki-pants wearing beerbellied racist pig. Which is most definately  not  the case. I prefer centre-right, or right-leaning. Or right-wing-in-the-Northern-Hemisphere sense.
