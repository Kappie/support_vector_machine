The sleek compact design of the new All-In-One Gateway Profile™ 4 provides the freedom of more space and the incredible performance required to meet all of your computing and digital needs."

  Gateway is going head-to-head with Apple and the iMac on this one and even publishing  an  urlLink  independent comparison report . I think it looks pretty cool although I am not the target audience for this PC. It does seem to be a pretty powerful little machine. I guess I'll have to go to my local Gateway Country store to kick the tires in person.
