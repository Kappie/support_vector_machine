I personally don't like cats (dog person) but these were just adorable.  There are four I think that are available.  I belive that two are already called for for there are two left.  There are three gray ones and a black cat.  The gray ones have blue eyes and the black one has black eyes I think.  The shyest one is the black cat.  He/she likes to hide from people.  All of the grey ones are pretty playful and relaxed kittens.  Here are a few pics.        So if you or anyone you know likes cats or wants a cat, feel free to email me and I will go ahead and give you some contact info.  P.s. these cats aren't for eating!
