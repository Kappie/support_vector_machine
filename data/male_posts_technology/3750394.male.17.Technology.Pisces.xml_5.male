I went to see my grandma at the hospital today, which was nice :), she was really happy to see me, and I was happy to see her too.  I was glad to see her getting good care and treatment too.  As for the rest of the day, went to hang out with my friend Lyndsey, who I haven't seen in a while, so that was kool, watched 50 first dates (FUNNY!).  And now, I plan just to chill out, do whatever, might work on my page a little bit with XML, but im feeling really lazy tonite.  Nite all!  Eric
