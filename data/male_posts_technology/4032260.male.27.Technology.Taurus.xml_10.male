That is one of the reasons that God gave us His Spirit... to be our Counselor.  The Spirit teaches us the things of God so that we may be able to judge all things yet we ourselves cannot be judged by anyone (1 Cor 2:15).  We have the mind of Christ (v. 16).  Do any questions pop into your mind about this?  Here are some of mine:  - What about all the sinful acts that have been committed by Christians claiming that "God is telling me to do this...". - If all Christians have the mind of Christ, they why is there such disunity in the Church? - How do we know what is from the Spirit and what is from the flesh?  I don't have time to go into it now... but I believe the answers to these questions lie in passages like Romans 12:1-8 and Philippians 2:1-16.  Can you think of any other passages?  :)  (I've turned on anonymous comments...)
