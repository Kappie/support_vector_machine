Unfortunately this means I will have more homework to do tomorrow which means I won't be able to play Planetside until Wednesday which I really need to [see  What I've Been Playing ]   What I've Been Doing:   School today. My English teacher tells me that she forgot to right on my coursework draft that I had to put in a load of stuff on camera angles (media piece on Bowling for Columbine) so I have English coursework to do :( I also have to revise for my maths exam on Wednesday and do loads of science homework for then. Not... cool...   What I've Been Playing:   Hitman Contracts last night, got quite far and got another 'Silent assassin' rating so all is well. Also, I have been up for a promotion to Legion Officer in my Planetside outfit the Renegade Legion. This, the second highest rank available would be totally awesome but I have little time to play right now. I was hoping to get a to of commanding done this week but I may not have time :(   In the News:   Two days ahead of schedule, the US have handed power back to the new Iraqi government and Prime Minister Iyad Allawi. The bringing forward of the hand over was probably to prevent any large scale terror attacks that may have been planned to mark the occasion.  At the NATO summit in Istanbul this week, the 26 NATO states have agreed to offer training to Iraq's new Security forces. Hopefully this will see Coalition troops leave Iraq sooner as their own forces can take more of the weight.  Also at the summit, police clashed with protestors - protesting about pretty much everything - and used water cannons, batons and tear gas to disperse the crowd.  To fight of Google.com's Gmail service, currently in the beta testing stage, Hotmail are boosting the free email storage size to 250MB. This however is still far short of Gmail's 1GB.   Other Stuff:   I've decided to request an increase in my allowance. I currently get a meager Â£5 a week which I can't live on. Â£10 or Â£15 would be much fairier I feel and bring me inline with my friends. Whether I get it is questionable... Was hoping to take Kirsty's cake round today so I could see her, if only for a few minutes but my family ate it all :( So I won't see her until Saturday evening which pisses me off because I miss her soooooo much!  cvx  Thought of the Post: If one experienced everything it is possible to experience, would they still have desire?
