Its official, www.grouphug.us is  THE BEST WEBSITE EVER!  Everybody who reads this must go there RIGHT NOW! Its the funnies/saddest site you will ever see. Here's a sample:   "In 1990 or 1991, someone left a large salmon head hidden inside the piano in the Diamond residence hall at Southern Oregon State College. After several weeks, the smell was unbearable, but it would be several more weeks before the source of the stench was found. The paino was seen that summer outside, covered in plastic, presumably because it was ruined by the rotting fish head... That I put there.  I still laugh about it to this day. That fish head was the best 75 cents I've ever spent (I bought it at Safeway. Why they were selling fish heads is beyond me, but when life gives you fish heads, make stinky pianos I always say)."   And theres a lot more like that, but its mainly about angsty teens and cutting themselves and how they weigh 100 pounds and are too fat, or how they're boyfriend is a dumbass and they're only going out with them because they feel sorry for him. Its hilarious, yet sad because these confessions come from actual people.  Only 3 people besides myself will understand this next part, maybe more if I feel like explaining it, but its like midnight, so probably not. A 4 FUCKING 7!! Every rule in the poker book just gave me the finger!! Jason (Not Stubbs) I hope you burn in hell for that act of bullshit!  And on that note, it looks like I'm gonna be getting somewhere around $75 this week, and Saving Private Ryan on DVD! :D  Not much else to say....
