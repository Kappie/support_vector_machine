Well today I did some at lowes with my dad... so I can now do it myself... now watch my mom still complain that I do not do anything for the house when I do HER job! I could see it!  I still havent get a e-mail from the girl from the bus stop from yesterday!! DAMNIT I knew I should of gotten her fone #! Oh well I will learn eventually!  So I guess this blog will be a journal of sorta for me... I created another one that will have some of my writings on it... the link to it is  urlLink right   urlLink here  I already put one there.. I'll get a guest book and such there after later..  Well tommrow is gonna be an intersting day. Dad and I got a qudit to do in a walmart, and I have a Med Eval mental health.. to help with my deptression, and possibly my ADD... Let's hope cos I know I need help....  So until tommrow.... shalom.
