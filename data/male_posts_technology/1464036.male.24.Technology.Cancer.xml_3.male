I weighed myself on the 24th, 457 lbs., and I weighed myself today, 450 lbs..  I lost 7 lbs. in one week, a lb a day.  I'm doing the  urlLink Body For Life  routine.  It is awesome.  Six meals a day, small of course, 6 workouts a week(upperbodyx2, lowerbodyx2, aerobicsx2).  I've kept up with it pretty good this week and I'm hoping, through the continual love of Christie and my folks, I'll be able to do it.  GOAL weigtht: 265 lbs.  ILY
