Sitting at work waiting for my wife to get back from the vet so that we can go home!  YAY!  Since I'm not on the clock and nothing exciting is happening, I'm re-reading 8-bit theater.  At least I'm amused.  Well, except for the whole "dry eyes" and "being hungry" things.  :)  I feel bad for the cat, though.  She's apparently very traumatized.  Something about vets and dogs and long waits and cages.  It wasn't very clear.
