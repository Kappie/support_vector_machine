I certainly have a few must-visit web sites everyday.    Ok, we'll have a poll. Each one of us will have to post the first 5 websites they visit everyday.     Well, here is my list:        urlLink Yahoo Groups     urlLink Google News  (major source - I keep visiting links from here)    urlLink MSN Joke of the Day       Websites I used to visit regularly, but have stopped now:         urlLink NY Times     urlLink Astro.com      urlLink Google Web Directory     urlLink Rediff.com       Websites I visit on and off again:     I visit these sites only when i feel a need to visit the site. mostly this list contains only sports sites    1. FIA  2. Wisden  3. BBC  4. Sify  5. Indiatimes    Bye,  Jax.
