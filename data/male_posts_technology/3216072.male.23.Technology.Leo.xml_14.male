He himself had not only witnessed them, but led some of the worst. The winner called them untold victories, but the looser was not left to have an account. It was a growing burden that he feared could not be lifted. Yet he stood here in front of this buildingof whichhe could not count the number of floors, preparing to win another. Why he kept on with this charade after all justification was lost hecould not say. He just knew that he was born with a gift, and he needed to weld this gift for his purpose. No longer was his purpose, their purpose.    Not noticing anything that mattered he entered the building and stepped up to the information desk. Finding the name he was looking for with out the help of the attendant he looked toward the elevator. During the ride to the fourteenth floor he was alone. Knowing there was a camera located above the round buttons on the left panel, he kept his guns in their holster. His eyes never strayed from the digital screen with numbers ascending to the eminent death of his next victim. With the chime of a bell the doors slid to the side and the hallway that was laid before him seemed never ending. Within the first few steps he had drawn both guns from beneath his floor length leather coat and started to prepare to take life.    He found the door which was located further from the elevated than he had hoped, but still he knew that it would not matter. He stood there for a moment in silence with his arms hanging at his side. Then with a quick movement the door shattered into pieces and exploded inwards. From the sound of hysteria inside the room he knew the element of surprise was achieved. He walked in as if he were a welcomed guest with the guns still by his side. The fragments of the door seemed to float in the air around him. He could watch debris of all sizes brush of his coat as he moved through the wreckage. Time it seemed slowed to a crawl at his command. Turning to the desk using the confusion he’d caused to his benefit he started to acquire his target. Then he realized he was watching a bullet slip out of a muzzle pointed at him. At this instant he realized for the first time that not moving out of the path of this bullet could be his only peace. Still the will to live was too great. With his eye on the passing bullet he raised his right arm and put the gun on the head of the man sitting behind the desk. With a silent prayer he pulled the trigger as the bullet meant for him struck the far wall.    The scene he was left with was one he was all too familiar with. Then it seemed that time could not go slow enough. He knew that he had to escape unseen, but that others had heard what just happened. He walked to the door and peeked out both ways and seeing no one was coming to investigate what had just taken place he sprinted for the elevator thankful he had jarred the door.    The elevator seemed to close in around him as the fatigue set in. He tried to calm himself so that he could walk out of the building as if he belonged there. He holstered his weapons as the doors slid open to the eighth floor and a lady that took no notice of him stepped on. This was reassuring that the alarm had not been sounded yet. Maybe I’ll have time to get out unnoticed he thought and the elevator started again for the first floor. When the doors opened it appeared that he was correct and the alarm had not been raised. The lobby looked just as it did when he entered and as he walked out no one paid him any mind. He stood in front of his car and looked around watching the people passing him. They were all walking by unknowing of the act that had just taken place. He almost felt sorry for them.
