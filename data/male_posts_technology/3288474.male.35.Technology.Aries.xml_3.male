     
      One big truck overturned to the sidewalk just before the windows of my office, shaking the floor just like an earchquake, lucky the driver was safe and can walk away by himself and nobody else got hurt. People were standing by and talking for whole afternoon, making lots of fun of the poor guy. and following will be our company meeting for status update, is this a bad sign for our company's future?
