I was naturally the worst of the group of 4 I was in, but I did have a few decent shots.  We started playing shortly after 5:30, and it took about 2hrs to play all 18 holes.   It was different, as we were playing from "alternate" tee's, which I think helped really throw me off my game.  It made all the wholes 20-50ft shorter.  My best shot of the night came at the very end, when we had a CTP (closest to the Pin) throw.  We went outside the entrance of the park, and stood by the parks sign, and threw 2 discs at the practice basket. The closest to the basket got a free "mini".  I was about the 3rd or 4th from last to throw (about 18 of us).  I threw my Super Roc tie-dye, and I about fell over stunned, as from the 300ft shot, I landed it about 6ft from the basket.  WOOHOO!! So I got a few mini-marker, so when I throw, I can drop my mini to mark my spot, and pick my disk up to throw.  Oldest son got a free disk as well, for playing as the younest player. He got a free FireBird, a disc I've been wanting to pick up for a specialty throw.  I was trying to talk him into giving it to me, but he wanted it as it's an Ultra-Long Range drive.     He just offered to give it to me, but I told him to keep it, as he wants a ULD©. He'll have to work to throw it as far as ULD© should be, but as he's so young, he's not throwing his Mid-Range driver as far as he should.  We'll keep practicing, and we'll get to the point where we can throw these chunks of plastic as far as we should, with control. It'll just take some time, but we'll get there   :-)
