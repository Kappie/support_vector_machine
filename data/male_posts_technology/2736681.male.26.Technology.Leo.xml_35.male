It had been relatively stagnant at about 50 for a while, as I struggled to keep up with the volume of blogs like Scoble and ESPN's NBA news, but today Michael pointed me to a whole bunch of blogs from (shock, horror), people I actually know. I've put the blogroll on the sidebar - its roughly sorted, but the emphasis is on rough rather than sorted.
