You have no idea how much impact such an event can have on your life until it happens.  There's the constant pain and irritation, the inconvenience of not being able to wash that area properly, and of course the difficulty of not being to see properly because of it.  I type now with considerable difficulty thanks to three layers of protection between my eye and the outside world...  The actual event was terrifying... and it took quite a while for things to happen as well.  The operation was delayed for an hour, as was my discharge, so in total I was in hospital for about 11 hours.  Not groovy.  And then came the problem with sleep, and much, much leaking, which contributed to the lack of sleep, and so on... in a vicious cycle.  And don't get me started on the damn drops...  However, I made it, and am now alive to go on and sample the delights of the new editions of  World of Darkness  and  GURPS .  Rejoice!
