A girl that is bursting with joy that she can't wait to share with everyone she met or introduced to. Despite her age, she time and time , have shown wisdom that she gathered from her relationship with our Father in heaven.    She never showed any grumpy face , or angry face or anything negative . She serves God in every way possible in AYA ,or campus city or in church with great spunkiness, grace and definitely loads and loads of enthuasiasm that heaven can spare. She is humble to learn everything yet she have the authority to take charge whenever leadership is needed.   In the years i have known her, she have left a great impact in every lifes that she bonded with and yes lives and attitudes changed once i met with her.   She is a wonderful and genuine song writer who writes songs under the impression of the Holy Spirit and have great desire to lead and point people to Jesus. A great friend and a wonderful sister in Christ.
