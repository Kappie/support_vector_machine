I was a little late because I had to work until 7 (we were booked at 6...), but it worked out ok because it gave the rest of the guys the opportunity to start setting stuff up.  I arrived right around 8 and I was charged to go.  After a day of working my shitty little job and trying to get into my zone, it arrived about the time I showed up to the studio.  I slugged my amp and guitar and gear bag into the place, and saw that the room where my amp sits was all wired; I just had to plonk it down and plug it in.  The mics were all set up, including the plethora used for the drum set, and everybody else's gear was all hooked up and ready to go.  I figured "Yeah...we're gonna have a poopload of time to just get stuff down now".  But it was not to be.  Greg (the guy who was recording us) is taking a recording arts in school, and we are two of his projects: a three piece rock recording we did a couple weeks ago without Darren, and a four piece we were doing this night.  On the three piece there were some wierdnesses in the kick drum sound, so we decided to spend a little extra time and get it right for this one.  Now, it can be fixed, the stuff on the last recording, but it's much easier for Greg the engineer if it records well off the start.    So I hooked up my gear, did a little warm up noodling, and waited. And waited. And waited.  After about 35 minutes it was time to start setting the levels.  So that started with the drums...takes about 45 minutes to do it right slowly.  Then the bass, then bass and drums, then darren's guitar, then my guitar.  It was 10:30 before we were ready to start recording.  I could see that Greg the drummer was already starting to get the go jones on.  Then Darren and Sheldon went to grab sandwiches, Greg the drummer went to call the wife, and Greg the engineer wanted to play my guitar a bit.  So I went out and had a smoke.  And got locked out of the building :/  I tried calling Greg the engineer...no good; his phone doesn't work to well in the studio.  I tried calling Sheldon...no good; his phone works, but was sitting in his gear bag in the studio so even if someone was right beside it they wouldn't hear it.  I tried calling Greg the drummer, but his phone lost signal after 2 rings.  I kicked the door a few times...no one could hear.  Sheldon and Darren showed up with the remains of a tasty looking subway meal, and I decided to try greg the engineer's phone again...got him this time.  So we were ready to go.  The wait wasn't that big of a deal...a big part of recording is spent waiting for set up, and theoretically the longer it takes to set up the better it will be.  So I didn't mind all the waiting that much...other than the fact I was totally itching to play.  We got all tuned up again and launched into Bus Stop.  Greg the drummer was ON FIRE, and rocked totally.  Unfortunately the rest of us were pretty flaccid...no performance.  But it was the first run, and that's ok.  So we did another one.  All in all it was pretty rockin, but Sheldon didn't have his best run on the bass.  Greg was still on fire, and Darren and I were rocking pretty hard.  So was Sheldon, but he did make a couple of boobups...nothing major tho.  We went in and listened and it sounded fucking HUGE! We almost decided to stop after that one, but I suggested we do one more just in case we hit the zone on it, as we were pretty close on that second take.  The third take was pretty hot too...almost identically played to the second one, but with two of them Greg the engineer will be able to take the best overall one and make something pretty cool.  We chilled for a bit and then launched into Control.  The first take I played pretty well, but no one was totally happy with it.  Again, it lacked a bit of enthusiasm.  On the second take we all played pretty well, except I did a brutally awful solo at the start, and sheldon completely missed the ending...that's ok; that ending was only 3 days old.  We were getting set to go again when the security guards came in and said we had to shut down...it was after midnight and they had expected us out by 10 (!!!!).  The said it was ok to rip off one more take so we did.  And I think we just about nailed it.  Even my solo bit was pretty good (a nice change from the previous version we had played).  The drums were definitely there, we were definitely tight and the performance was pretty rocking.  Sheldon missed the ending bit again, but that's easy enough for him to do over.  So then we helped Engineer greg tear down the gear, loaded up our stuff and went home.  I look forward to hearing what we did in a mixed version, but it will be a couple weeks.  Actually we still have to go in next week and do the vocals too.  I'm stoked about that.
