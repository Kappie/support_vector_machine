I have to say that I really don't like the fact that some days I might not make anything and some days ill make 20-30 bucks a hour but the best part is that I get to travel around(like Calgary, Edmonton, Denver, ect..), hang around other people my own age with similar problems and reasons for having to work, I constantly get free bonuses like free dinner and extra money, and when it comes down to it for me this job is all about having a good time. Another thing I like is I get to learn a lot about human negotiation and study peoples tendencies to make impulse buys by complementing them and showing them that I have a lot of energy and making them feel guilty for not buying my stuff. It really is quite a interesting job and I am going to stick with it as long as I can even tho my parents want me to quit when I have a bad day but they don't see what the senior sales reps make($300-$480/week for 3 hours a day and 4-6 days a week with extremely flexible schedule).     The only problem with this job is I gotta get home as quick as I can and am not able to go to the gym as often even tho I get about 3 hours of cardio in from just this jobs requirement to walk all the time. Another problem is I tend to get home late and just end up slacking on the homework because I am too tired after a shift.     **Well I gotta get up tomorrow morning(Saturday) at 8am to work a shift till about 4pm so I'm gunna go catch up on my beauty sleep cause these bags under my eyes don't look too great.**
