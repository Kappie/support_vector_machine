I like this article because Mike gives specific real world examples of how the controversial targeted advertising works. It sounds to me like it isn't all that controversial at all. He also lists the cool features:  Gmail's most outstanding feature is the cogent and convenient way it organizes mail by collapsible threads, displaying the messages in context and sequence, just like conversations. All the e-mail is searchable.  Other nice touches include a spam filter, a spell checker and keyboard shortcuts you can program.
