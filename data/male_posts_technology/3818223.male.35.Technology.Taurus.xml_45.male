After a promising and interesting start, the movie falls into repetition. The formula goes:  Main Character (I forgot his name already): I must catch the evil Dr. Luther.  Main Character and police find the evil Dr. Luther and associates. Violence ensues. Secondary characters from both sides die.  Police Captain: Main Character! You allowed the evil Dr. Luther to escape! You suck! But, even though you're outside of your jurisdiction, I will begrudgingly allow you to continue!  Repeat for nearly two hours. Make it seem even longer.   Don't get me wrong. This is not a completely rotten movie, it just would have worked better as an hour long episode of something. Something interesting I noted - it was given a PG-13 rating despite a little gratuitous nudity and the use of the fucking F-word. Thefilm was released in 1984, which I believe was the first year that rating saw use. I guess the picture people hadn't hammered out the boundaries.  - 2.5 out of 5 stars.
