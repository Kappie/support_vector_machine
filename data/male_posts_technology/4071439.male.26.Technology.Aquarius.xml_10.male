Especially interesting is  urlLink the Grey Album  by  urlLink DJ Danger Mouse  - a mix of  urlLink Jay-Z 's Black Album and the Beatles White Album - and the movie  urlLink Spin , documenting satellite feeds from the 1992 american presidential election campaign that shows what happened off air.  Should Art be Free? Oh yes... stick it to them.
