Any and all are invited, Bring your beverage of choice and only as much money as you are willing to loose ;)  Seriously though, one and all are invited (even if you don't want to play it will be somewhere to go on the day that the pubs closed :) Let me know here or by e-mail if you think you're hard enough :)  Mike
