In one episode of the show (episode number 96,  Deep Space Homer ), Brockman watches a video broadcast from a space capsule, within which a number of ants have accidentally been released. The ants appear huge because they float directly in front of the broadcast camera and close to the lens. He mistakenly assumes that alien insects are invading Earth and attempts to ingratiate himself to them by broadcasting propaganda: I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords.    Subsequent to this  Simpsons  episode, variants of the phrase came into common use in 2002-2003, generally used to suggest that whatever party referred to as the new overlords is engaging in Orwellian behavior.    --        Any fool can tell the truth, but it requires a man of sense to know how to lie well. -- Samuel Butler
