This little man on a crotch rocket pulls out in front of me and hits the gas so I don't have to slow down......that's about the time things started to move in slow motion...  The jockey's (little man on a big motorcycle) back tire looses traction...and I see his bike go down!  He slid and rolled for about 150 feet.  His bike was tumbling and bucking.....I couldn't believe my eyes!  I slammed on my brakes so I wouldn't run over this guy.  I got out to help him...got him and his bike to the side of the road....brand new bike...new rider.  He walked away, but man....being someone who has a motorcycle (cruiser) it just made me think.  All those times I've ridden in shorts an a t-shirt with my skull helmet on....how lucky-stupid of me.  I am resolving myself to always wear my body armor, and to get a new helm which covers my face (since that dood ended up face down...if that were me....i'd be lookin pretty Rockey Dennis).  I'm glad that kids is okay...just shook up....out a bike....and up a few cuts and bruises.
