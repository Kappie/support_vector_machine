But worse than that is the idiots who think that the way to solve that particular problem is to pass dozens of cars using highway on-ramps and off-ramps.  Yes, they get to pass 20 cars at once, but those 20 people have to wait just a little bit longer to get home. So you save yourself 60 seconds by stealing (and that's what it is, a theft) 3 seconds from me and 19 other people.  The police should really crack down on those idiots. A couple of $100 tickets will help drivers resist the temptation to be wholly inconsiderate to others on the road.
