This weekend heading to Coventry VT to see Phish's last festival.  Should be a lotta fun.  Have been listening to Phish lately quite a bit.   Have a lot of mixed feelings about them and the music.  I suppose ultimately I'd rather just sell the tixs.  They have been going for about $400+ on ebay.  I think I'd trade my weekend for $800.   However good friend IG is flying up, and I am very excited to spend a few days hanging with him.   That itself might be worth the $800.  IG is one of those guys that if I lived closer to, I know we would be absolute best friends.  He is a great guy, and we enjoy similar music/movies/lifestyle, not to mention share the same rather ironic and offbeat sense of humor.  He has chosen to live in Cleveland, but I sometimes wonder about the basis of that decision.  Speaking to him about the subject, he seemed to just be very adverse to paying rent.  Living in Cleveland, he can stay with his parents, until he can afford to buy a house.  I suppose that decision makes sense from a financial standpoint, but I question if it good for him socially or emotionally.  That being said, I don't worry too much about it.  I suspect he has reasons that span the financial ones, and I suspect that those ones are his better reasons.   Things are going very well with CW.  We have these pseudo-arguments about abstract ideas-- neither of us gets angry, but we both are very animated as we talk.  Interuptions are often and quick -- typically it is difficult for either of us to get a full thought out.  In a primal sense, I enjoy these discussions.  I often think that I may have some need of conflict in my life, and in my relationships.  I think CW may be the same way.  Amazing on how compatible we seem to be.   *Disclaimer* we have only been dating for two and a half months, so yes we still are in the honeymoon stage.  I think the important part is knowing when we are in a pseudo-argument, and when the argument is no longer pseudo.  Back to work...
