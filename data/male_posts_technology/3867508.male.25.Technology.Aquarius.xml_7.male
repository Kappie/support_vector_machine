"Strength and wisdom are not opposing values." Another Bill Clinton, quote, and I wish I could give it context, but these quotes will have to stand on their own, if you missed the convention tonight.   Ok also Al Gore has become a better public speaker I think, he seemed very loose and you could feel his anger towards georgie shrub, and I think it has made him a better speaker. He was GREAT.   And lets not forget former President Jimmy Carter. Wow, what a great speaker he was tonight. He is truly a shining star in the sky.   Seriously folks if you aren't watching the Convention, at least from 8-11PM EDT you are missing some wonderful speakers really speaking from their heart.   America is in peril, America needs help, America needs change. We need to take back America for  ALL  Americans, not just the elite! It's a call to arms, will  you  be there?
