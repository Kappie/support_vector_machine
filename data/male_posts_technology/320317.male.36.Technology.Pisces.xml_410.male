 This is what I have been waiting for a long time. However, they don't mention the new locations that they will be adding, or at least  urlLink I couldn't figure it out . Another major downside is the price. At  urlLink $29.99/month , I can't imagine many people taking advantage of this unless they spend all their time at Starbucks. Regardless, it sounds like an interesting service for Internet addicts like me.
