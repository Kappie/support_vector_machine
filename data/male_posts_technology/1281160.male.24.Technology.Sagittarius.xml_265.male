     
      Had a long day yesterday. Went on a location finalisation with my CEO and a couple of others. Started from office at 10:00, came back by 9:00. Clocked up almost 200 kms yesterday. Went to a lot of places. Interesting places.   I have to go there today also. So I'll be back by evening and post my travels later.
