 Dream from last night:  I cannot remember the bulk of the dream, but it involved a large number of my friends from both Microsoft and UMich at a presentation of some sort.  Everyone was sitting in rows of chairs waiting for it to start.  I was supposed to drive to this with one of the devs on my team, Matt, but when I got there, he was sitting with Matt Weber.  Just before the presentation started, I remember that I borrowed Jeff's can opener and he needed it back!  I was quite concerned since this was a limited edition can opener.  Oddly enough, there were shelves and shelves of shoe boxes and skiing equipment to the side of the presentation room.  After a frantic search, I finally found the can opener at the bottom of a shoe box.  The can opener was a WRX model in Sonic Yellow, which would explain why I was frantic to find it (the Impreza WRX in Sonic Yellow is a very rare sight).  That doesn't explain why I am having crazy dreams.

 FloorBurn improved to a record of 3-2 after our 6-2 win on Tuesday.  I scored twice, so I'm back as leading scorer.

 Wall of Meat (flag football) is perfect so far at 2-0!  We had a come from behind win on Saturday with our new quarterback, but I can definitely see the team improving from here out.

 I'm getting closer to buying the Camaro.  The owner just needs to get it to pass emissions and then I will almost certainly buy it.

 The NY auto show is tomorrow thus I expect information about the 2005 Subarus to be released tomorrow.  Rumor has it that the WRX will go a complete redesign for the '06 model year, so maybe buying an '05 would be silly.  I don't want to look dated that fast!
