Looking at things that fit his criteria as well as being strategic, progressive (preparing his team for 2005) and taking care of logistics (meals, housing, etc.).  Found some very cool other sites as well:  K - this one is for you.   urlLink Destination Summit  - Part of New Tribes Mission - specific to reaching the unreached.   urlLink Network for church planters among the unreached    urlLink Reaching the unreached people groups of NYC
