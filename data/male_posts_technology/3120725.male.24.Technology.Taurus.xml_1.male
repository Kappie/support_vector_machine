It involves a man that had coated his entire Motel 6 room in Vaseline, his entire fucking room people.  "Police found 14 empty Vaseline containers and numerous pornographic magazines in the room's trash can."  Flogging the dolphin I can understand, hell I can even support it (insert pervert laugh here), but what kind of masturbatory act requires you to grease up your entire room, if you happen to know please for the love of God email  urlLink AverageCypress , and no pictures you sick freaks. It does gets better though people, "A sheriff's deputy found the Virginia man a short time later at another motel. The deputy said the man was "smeared from head to foot with Vaseline."  Chalk one more up for the boys in blue for keeping the streets safe and penetration-free.  If you're surprised that our culprit is from the South please raise you hand, and an attendant will be around to smack the stupid out of you.
