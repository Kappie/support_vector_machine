But anyway the moment i turn out of Bayshore park to ECP changi airport saw 3 cars was driving quite "interestingly". After the potted plants all went like 140kph so I follow them and I decided to go all the way till 170 and to my susprise i saw one Mazda 323 coming up very fast and tailing behind me. I simply can't shake it off even taking fast bend. It is simply too easy for him to catch even at 170kmph, do not know what the hell is implanted inside.  After exiting at Loyang fly over I gave him a thumbs up. Pretty friendly racing.  FUN after boring work at my auntie's office.....But have no idea why I feel like finding someone to chat with but no one to. The kind of loneliness creeping in again.
