After I announced I was voting straight Libertarian Ticket in 2004, I had a rather heated debate with the die-hard Republicans around here. The primary reason they cited for NOT voting Libertarian for President was that I would "waste" my vote. Though they agreed with me (for the most part) on Libertarian views, they could not make the conceptual leap to vote with their conscience. I was criticized for "not trying to change the Republican Party from within."   I countered with the following:   1. I was active in politics in my youth and was elected a precinct delegate for the Republican party in my hometown in 1988.  2. I actively campaigned for George H.W. Bush based on the premise that he would "stay the course" of continuing Reagan's policies.  3. When Bush Sr. went back on his promise, I was deeply troubled...but I did vote for him in 1992 because I hated Bill Clinton.  4. Starting in 1996 I split my ticket, Republican for President, and Libertarian for all other offices.  5. Hopeful that the Republicans who controlled both the House and Senate would limit the size of government in addition to cutting taxes, I voted for Bush in 2000.   I DID try to change the party from within...and I am tired of it. It's pointless and fruitless. I basically came to the conclusion that it was time to votein a different direction.   It is now apparent to me that the Republican party is only moderately better than the Democrats ...or should I say not as bad. They have increased the size of government 5%+, passed the horrible Medicare and Education Bills, expanded protectionist trade policies (subsidies and tariffs), and pushed the Patriot Act through under the banner of increasing national security.   The other concern I have with this election is that the winner will likely be able to appoint at least one Supreme Court Justice. However, Bush (and Congress) have failed to stand up for any of his appointments which leads me to believe he would never appoint a strict constitutionalist and he'd stick us with another Justice Souter.   The only things I believe the Republicans got right were the tax cuts and the prosecution of the war on Terror (for the most part).   Though Liberals may whine about the 2000 election being "stolen" by the Supreme Court, I have a serious problem with any justice that considers the Constitution a "living" document. The activist Supreme Court has superseded their powers and is writing law rather than interpreting it.   To me, the Libertarian Party best exemplifies what I believe in:   1. Greatly reducing the role of the Federal Government.  2. Greatly reducing taxes (I personally prefer a  urlLink National Sales Tax .  3. Eliminating government subsidies and tariffs which only hide inefficient businesses and are non-competitive.  4. Elimination of ALL foreign aid. Screw the rest of the world...they hate us anyway. We'll trade with them, but we wont' give them money. Furthermore, we should enact a "mirror" policy with our trade partners. If they won't trade fairly (such as China), then we won't either. Emergency AID for disasters would be acceptable.  5. Ending the "War" on Drugs.  6. Stay the hell out of the home. This includes anti-gay laws, drugs,etc. What happens in the home between to consenting adults is NONE of the government's business so long as they aren't killing each other, hurting anyone else, or stealing from anyone else.  7. Elimination of Affirmative Action. This is used as a crutch by the weak minorities and an insult the capable. Furthermore, it's condescending to minorities as it says, "You're not good enough to compete fairly so we'll tilt the field."   Though I take issue with the Libertarian Party on Defense and Immigration, I believe since the party is still relatively young, I can help to change the Libertarian Party from within.
