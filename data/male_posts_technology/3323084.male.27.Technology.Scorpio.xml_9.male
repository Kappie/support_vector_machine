It seems that Suse has finally decided to offer ISO images of their Linux distro.  I would have tried Suse before but they never offered ISO images.  Instead,they offered some complicated ftp install, only suited for those with a fast internet connection.  Also it's nice to have the images on CD so you can share with friends.  I've wanted to try Suse for a while now.  From what I've heard, Suse and Mandrake are the top two Linux distros as far as being user friendly and having a complete and useful Desktop.  I use Mandrake at home now and it rocks, if Suse lives up to it rep it should rock as well.    Until next time...
