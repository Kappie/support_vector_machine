Not having ever worked in such an environment, I can't really comment, but working in a research environment, where time is to be wasted in equal measure with money - again, opinions are my own and no-one else's ;-) - it was certainly much nicer doing MOF stuff (which I hope might be middleware in 5-10 years' time) was a hell of a lot nicer in Ruby than Java. As a side note, doing MOF stuff in Java was a  hell  of a lot nicer than the 2 weeks I spent doing it in C.  However, I don't know whether it was really the dynamicity itself that was the problem, rather the level and nature of type-checking, and other features commonly associated with dynamic languages, such as closures.
