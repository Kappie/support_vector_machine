All I can say is that it brings back the terrible memories of that day in a vivid form. I am angry and sad all over again. Some details in that first section are hard to read. I can't help but think at each juncture in the recount of this morning how this possibly could have been changed, how this possibly could have been different.   Now I am not claiming that this could have been completely prevented, as there is simply no way to back up this claim, with all the variables that were at play. But I do believe that small changes could have averted the full catastrophe as we know it.   Well I don't know what else to say. I hope to god that something like this never ever happens again.
