No, you don't think you'll sell. You are a bit clueless as to what is really going on around you, in fact, you seriously annoy everyone you come in contact with. Although, this does not seem to phase you in the least. As long as you've got your glasses and your backpack and your mom is away getting her makeover done, you're happy, and are content to ask useless questions and give useless answers until the cows come...which they do, every Thursday, right after they lunch with the President.    urlLink   Which Kids in the Hall Character Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
