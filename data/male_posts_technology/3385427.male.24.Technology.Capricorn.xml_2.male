I will keep adding more chapters, until I get to the end. Then I'll go back, do some editing, and try to get it published somewhere.  Any feedback or help will be greatly appreciated.  Most of my stories are horror/fiction, but occassionally, I write one or two silly stories. The novel I am currently working on is called: "The Reach".  So, come on in, grab some tea and rusks and read to your heart's content......  Visit my F1 Blog  urlLink HERE  Also, check out the  urlLink Lotus Zone
