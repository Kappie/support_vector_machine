Yes I was in a restaurant, ant yes I DID draw the Twin Towers onto a place map which depicted a view of the New York skyline, however...above that drawing I wrote the sentence 'Your memory remains forever'. Anyway, to move on from the subject I would like to offer Alex an apology for the crude remark I made about his life style, I is not my place to criticise you mate and I hope you will accept my apology to you, I have known you longer than anybody else in the Toaster crew (ten years plus!), and I also know that we wouldn’t fall out over this dispute (although I do expect that you might ask me to grovel haha.....not a chance!! lol). We have all had our say in this political discussion but lets call it to an end.  THE END.  Now as far as the weekend goes, my body is telling me to 'Go the fuck away!!!' as I have been abusing it for the last forty-eight hours and plied it with all sorts of alcohol, leaving no unit of blood untouched haha! Went to the splash last night and I gave it all I had left which wasn't much, must be getting old!!! Well thank you to Kate for the cool party on Friday night, thank you to my cousin Noel whose party I went to on Saturday lunch onwards and a 'Big up ya' to the splash.   Oh and one last thing. The upcoming 'Lord Of The Rings' film has a new trailer available and I advise any LOTR fans to download and check it out at  urlLink www.lordoftherings.net   Baity signing off....
