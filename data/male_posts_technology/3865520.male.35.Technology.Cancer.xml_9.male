However, several of my colleagues who came up through the IT Engineer ranks with me have stopped by to say "congrats". Not sure why but I guess there is a presumption that my transition to PM included some financial or status improvement- I can assure you nothing of the sort has happened. In some ways it has made things tough for me since I have no idea how many other PMs there are in my job grade(and all indicators are that I am no closer to a promotion). All-in-all though, I believe this was the right step for me since I have grand visions of going into the management track- and still hold to the idea of someday being in an executive position.  Otherwise, Info Delivery II is now a "Real" project and the clock is ticking for us. Actually, I have to come up with a reasonable resource plan in very short order. As people roll off other projects, I want to try and recruit them to ID2. My goal is to be a Cisco-employee heavy team. My fear over the past few years has been that we have relied on contractor knowledge and not done a good job of developing employee skills to fill those voids when the contractors walk. BUt for now, its me and one analyst who recently joined the team. I'm giving her plenty of room to ramp up and get a feel for the technical and business environment we're operating in. Soon, it will be hammer to the floorboard so I don't want to burn her(or myself) out. Actually, with the scope of ID2, I think we may need a second analyst and may run this release as a multi-track project. I still need to mull over the tracks, but I have some good ideas in la cabeza.  On the home project front, I just finished my seventh DVD of family footage (or as Isabella calls it "Baby Isa TV"). It has been a blast reviewing all the old footage and photos. My new Dell Inspiron 9100 has bee invaluable since I can now port the PC from office to living room- to wherever- and work on the DVDs whenever I get a spare few minutes(and no contention with Mrs. D on the keyboard). THe new PC actually is faster than the Vaio desktop, and it has more RAM and a better video card, so it is a better experience all the way around. Also, the 9100 came with a great software package called MyDVD for putting together quick DVDs. I already had more specialized software, but MyDVD definitely helped me crank stuff out faster. Someday, I'll probably go back and cull out a highlights DVD and showcase my creative side- for now I'm trying to get as much raw footage editted and loaded onto DVDs in chronological order. Right now, DVD#8 is underway (Fall/Winter 2003). It won't be long and I'll have to changeup my DVD theme to include Baby Annie...
