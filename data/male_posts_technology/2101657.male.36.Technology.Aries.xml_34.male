It was a  VERY  windy day, so on occasion, the 52deg weather felt  REALLY  cold.  We probably walked a mile or two, on very squishy ground. Was a very beautiful day and we had an excellent time.  Afterwards, we made our way over to Culvers. That was a good experience even.  Then we came home.  Then that tell-tale sign of the right temple started to throb.  I got up and took 1000mg of tylenol, hoping it might help some. Well, wonder of wonders, it didn't.  So, at 7:20 I climbed in bed. But...being me, an Episode of  STAR TREK: Enterprise  on that I hadn't seen, so I stupidly continued to watch it.  I made it to the end, and happy that it turned out to be a really decent and thought provoking episode.   Then I tried to get to sleep, and that was fit-full. Z*lda was working on quilt-squares or something, as I was laying in bed.  She stopped, and grabbed the ice-pack that I had handy, and I put that on my temple to try to help (think it did help some).  Then, I had that rumbling in the tummy that told me I'd best move toward the bathroom.  Huh, what do you know, my tummy was right for a change.   After the massive bought of vomiting I had, I went back to bed, and felt better for about 10 minutes. Then the hot/cold flashes started. I think I fell asleep toward the start of them for a change, and went into dreamy non-migraine pained bliss.  Think it's time to check in with the doc to see if he has any migraine meds in-stock yet, or if I should just break down and have him give me a prescription.    If I get a prescription, I think I'll see if I can get the inhaler and pill form of Imitrex.  I've found that my best luck is to take a tablet when I can start to feel the signs of a migraine, and then an hr later use the inhaler. That seems to give me the best protection.  I've had that fight off a migraine on a few occasions that way.  The doctor has the injector version, but I just cant get into the idea of giving myself a shot (shudders). I hate needles as it is, and just cant get past the idea of using one myself.  I know...I'm a wimp.  I'll stick with the pill and inhaler form of it.  So I put in another Saturday night in bed with a migraine. Got up about 8:40, so only about 13:30 hrs in bed again.  Migraines, what a wonderfully relaxing way to spend your evening.
