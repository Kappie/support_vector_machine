Look, definitions of it:   College  An undergraduate division or school of a university offering courses and granting degrees in a particular field.  IE: SIXTH BLOODY FORM  AAAAAAAAAH. Now I have been getting the feeling recently Jo that you don't seem to be liking me right now. Whenever we've had discussions on here you seem to love writing paragraphs about how wrong I am and you seem to like to point out your intelligence by bringing up facts etc... Just because I do Art and Textiles doesn't mean I don't know my own opnion. I don't need facts and figures to base my thoughts on. And so what if we go to Sixth Form which happens to be at Warlingham? It is a college, its not better or worse than anywhere else.  And I'd rather you wouldn't post random comments about Paul and Charlene or whoever because you will start to put thoughts into my head and I will start to panic so could you possibly refrain from doing so. That and remember we're not stupid so can you not talk to us as though we are. Or me. Or to anyone else who feels simlar.  Yes I am in an annoyed mood today.
