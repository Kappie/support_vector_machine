My feelings are too mixed and my expressive words are too limited, nevertheless, writing is the only avenue for me to release the build up pressure. I had a dream.. and its a sad dream.  You see, i fall in love with a girl i should not love. She has a bf and she loves her bf very much. Yes, you realised it too. She has a bf or don't is not an issue. The issue is, she loves her bf very much. I realised, when you fall in love with a girl you shouldn't love, you might end up with a very sad dream too. Whatever reality does not brings, your sub consciousness refuse to bring too.   The dream goes on like this..  In the dream, i dreamt of a girl, a face whom i do not know but the idea is, she is beautiful, perhaps to the eyes of the beholder. Other than the only female character in the dream, there are also 3 other guys, whose face i do not know either but seems to know them very well.   In the dream, i liked the girl a lot but i did not confess to her. In the end, she even addressed me as her brother. Knowing that she will never fall for me, i accepted her conferred title quietly. Between the 3 other guys, one of them had a serious crush on her. She noticed it and they started dating. I became a brother to her and attempt to protect her and her interests in almost every aspect. However, they had sex and he told everyone about it.   I was devastated and disappointed with the boy. However, she not only stopped me from bashing him, she also insisted that i have no rights over her matters. I could only see the both of them from far and not get involved in anything. Gradually, i left with some wishes.   If you fall in love in reality and get rejected, your dreams might not let you go either..  Hap, it has been a while for me to find myself and get myself to fall in love. The last time i fell in love, was 2 yrs ago. As time become longer for me to love somebody, i gradually know that a resistance has been formed within me to safeguard my fragile affections. 2 years ago, after broking up with my gf, i loved another girl but she is getting into her wedding grown this July.   Her husband married her because she asked him to do it. When she was sicked, her boyfriend not only wasn't worried, he even asked her to request her colleague to bring her to the doctor. When his mother bullied her, he was also quiet about it. When they meet, he only end up sleeping on her bed and wait for time to pass while she do her washings and cleaning of the house. Yet, she is willing to marry him because she wanted to settle down.  The world is weird.. so am i.. to always find trouble for myself.  Hap, thanks for listening. I seriously doesn't know when i would fall in love again after this. I hoped i don't do it anymore. Its too tiring and i rather be someone who can have sex with any women than the person i am now. I want to change.. rather be a  man who lived by lust than a man who lived by feelings.   DJ
