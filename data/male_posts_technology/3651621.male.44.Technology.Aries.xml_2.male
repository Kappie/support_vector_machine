So what got me thinking along these lines?  I'm an ex-fundamentalist Christian. I won't bore you with the details, but I was once a Christian and now I'm not. I do think a lot about Christians, however. It's a hobby.  [My wife and I were perusing the Bible shelves at  urlLink Powell's Books  the other day. Upon hearing me explain the difference between the 1909 "First Scofield" Bible and the 1917 Scofield Reference Bible another customer remarked that we obviously knew a lot and asked for some help. She appeared shocked when we commented, "It's a hobby."]  Anyway, I was a Christian from about age 8 to some forgotten point in my early 20's. I grew beyond that belief system, so I've been on both sides of the fence - I now can't see how a rational person could embrace a conservative Christian faith any more than I couldn't see then how a rational person could NOT embrace it.  [So what's the "it" I'm talking about here? It's not the spectrum of Christian denominations, many of which accept alternate beliefs. (Saying one is a Christian is almost as vague as saying one is a human.) I'm referring to the specific Christian belief structures which state that there is only one truth and that each of us will be tormented and punished for eternity if we do not accept God's Son Jesus Christ (who is Himself God) as our Lord and Saviour and turn our lives over to Him.  You may be familiar with this doctrine, but in case you aren't, let me repeat:  a) there is only  urlLink one truth , so all other religious views, including other Christian sects, are fatally incorrect and will result in  b)  urlLink eternal, never-ending torment  for those who do not turn their lives to Christ.  That's the core of the "it". There are other interesting points such as the acceptance of the Bible as God's complete and perfect revelation to man. I'll probably touch on those other points some time in the future.]  So, there's the problem. I don't hold these beliefs, but lots and lots of other people do. This isn't some "we all have different paths" dilemma. This is all of those other people saying, to quote the band Utopia, " urlLink Everybody else is wrong ." And will suffer on and on forever and ever. These "other people" aren't just guys in white shirts and crew cuts passing out tracts in Pioneer Square, either - they're hep youths with  urlLink aluminum-clad Bibles , grooving to the evangelism stylings of "Growing Pains" star  urlLink Kirk Cameron . And lots of other very mainstream-looking people.  Thinking about myself and about the multitudes of Christians out there, I'm just left with the following:  THERE MUST BE SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH ALL OF THEM, OR THERE'S SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH ME.  Or, maybe we're all just dreaming...
