It should have been posted on November 17, but I accidentally put it on a different blog that I have, which isn't really alive. Anyway, here you go.  ----------------------------------------  Newsweek Article:  urlLink Twilight of the PC Era? --tells an interesting story about the idea that Information Technology has lost its importance in business, because everyone is using it and so there's no competitive advantage to it.   The article gets its legs from an article written for the Harvard Business Review by Nicholas Carr. The Harvard article is called "IT Doesn't Matter."  I think we're looking at the industry of information technology the way people looked at the car industry during the early days of Ford. Despite the number of computer manufacturers, software companies, consulting companies, and others, the industry is still quite small, considering that there could be so much more computing done with everything we had. What about the fact that my computer and my refrigerator can't talk to each other yet? How come I can't program my lights to come on and off from a centralized console?   Of course, those are changes to my personal life, and not necessarily changes to the business landscape. Still, any time a technology comes out, there's this lag time between the debut of the new technology and the moment a company is able to understand exactly  how they're going to use the thing!  It's no small task to figure out what to do with something, especially when, as in the case of a lot of new technology, you can't see it, taste it, touch it, hear it, smell it, or even remember what it's called.   It would be easier if new technology were just a car that you could see coming up the road, with pedestrians jumping out of the way of the iron coach. Of course, maybe people had trouble really envisioning the way the automobile would impact them, as well. Who would've thought we could build our lives around the existence of a particular innovation, like we did with transportation that can get us to our workplaces twenty miles away in less than an hour? And we're still rebuilding our lives to fit the huge convenience that is the Internet. Let's face it--we've only gone part of the way down that road, and who knows what is next? It's always going to be a rebuilding process, and the innovations that take place will always be the catalysts for the types of change that make it possible for some to not even have to travel to work anymore.
