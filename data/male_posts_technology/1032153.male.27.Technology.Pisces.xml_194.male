My room is virtually empty and makes an echo sound when you talk loudly.   Yesterday I went to the supermarket to set up my kitchen. Ouch. $200 dollars later. But shouldn't need to spend that much for a very long time.   Sorry blogging has been cast by the wayside due to pressure of getting other stuff done for the move. We'll see if I can get back into it soon.
