I would go so far as to say he is the grandfather of all the "reality" shows today. The man was always "on" and always in character (from what I've read), and always doing his own thing.  Living or dead, Andy Kaufman is certainly a man worth remembering.  PS: There's also a  urlLink blog  out there claiming to be that of Andy. Probably complete bullshit, but makes for interesting reading nonetheless.
