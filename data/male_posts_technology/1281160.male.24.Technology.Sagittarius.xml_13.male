The founding fathers had an interest in sports. They might have never envisioned the growth of a sport as a religion. You might find that every constitution in the world doesn't allow sport as a major  factor in public life.  It might have been so in ancient Greece, but not in the present world.    BTW. When is George Bush going to quote Shakespeare?  urlLink "Cry Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war.  -Shakespeare, Julius Caesar III.i.270 .  Jax
