Black Hawk Dan, you are a moron in the way you think. Why does he ask the same freakin' question 30 times? In this post, TGM gets pissed and fires one at him. I don't blame him much either, though, because some people need to be taught some life lessons here:  1. If you're a newb and have a question,  ASK IT ONCE  2. Before you butt your head into a community, find out people's personalities, get to know the oldbies, and do  not  post unless you do know this. Of course, you can ask questions but otherwise, don't go spreading your flaming butt everywhere. Eh, yeah. 3. Learn to write out your sentences and SPELL CHECK them. It really isn't that hard. 4. DONT SPAM 5. Follow board rules as well as the invisible rules (like spamming, and double posting, and again, whatnot.) 6. Do something for the community, write a tutorial, be helpful with suggestion (don't be far fetched with them, though) 7. DO NOT act like Black Hawk Dan.   urlLink Twokids are stupider than one   I shall now end this pointless rant- -RC
