I mean, things were in motion when we adopted our kids, definitely, but I've been feeling stagnant, creatively and inspirationally for some time now.  It was frustrating these past 5 years or so, not writing any poetry.  Why didn't I want to write poetry about my kids?    The poem from yesterday, which I picked a title for, "TODAY" was inspired by S, by my weekend with her, and even by conversation with her on Monday night.   I guess I need to rewind a bit, since my last real post was on Thursday last week, after the mediation and my second date with P.    While I was on the second date, I could help but think about S.  I mean, I got home from the date, and after decompressing, I called S and we talked for about 2 hours.  Just today I received an email back from P, but, well, I guess I'll call her because I can't email her back, and just let her know what's going on with me.  But I'm getting ahead of myself again.  Rather than go camping Friday night, directly after work, I decided I really wanted to see S again, so I altered my plans so that I'd go camping on Saturday instead.  So Friday late afternoon, I drove to Hamden and got my free cell phone and signed up for a calling plan.  When I got to her house, she greeted me a little put off that I was early.  I thought she leaned in and give me a sensual kiss, but later she said that I was the one who kissed her.  After the kiss, I greeted her dog, Sampson, with real fervor, petting him, and being really playful with him.  He responded really positively and seemed really happy to meet me.    S had to finish getting ready, so I sat in her room and looked at her stuff while she got ready.  I put on a Billie Holiday CD for a change of pace.  She was happily surprised to listen to something different.  I liked her eclectic collection of stuff - from her teal chest to her computer table to the knick-knacks on her bookshelf.  After she was ready, we went out to eat.  I suggested Mexican and we got in her car.  We chatted in the car, and after a while driving down one road, she started to wonder if she'd missed the restaurant.  She continued a little ways, and then turned around.  Couldn't find it, she felt a little embarrassed ... we went for pizza instead.  She got roasted red peppers on her half and I had a hawaiian pizza on my half (ham and pineapple).  The waitress was hard of hearing, and when I told her what I wanted, she said, "do you want sauce?  do you want cheese?", and I was like, of course I want that stuff, but I also want the hawaiian, and salad, too.  After the pizza arrived, the waitress asked if everything was okay, did we want anything else, and I said I'd like to order drinks.  She started to walk away.  Uh, hello?  S got a beer and I got a smirnoff ice.  After dinner, we stopped at a grocery store, because I wanted to get water for the camping trip and frozen yogurt for that night.  I wanted phish food, but got fudge brownie instead (ben  jerry's of course).  Then we went back to the house and I met her sister, Mo, who is an INTP and a vegetarian.  She was nice, friendly, and soft-spoken.  It ends up the Mexican restaurant was a little further down than we'd gone.  We went upstairs to her room to talk and kiss and lay on her bed.  After a while, we put on the DVD, Pieces of April, we continued to kiss passionately on the bed.  I told her about my feelings about sex, that for me, sex = love, sex = commitment, and commitment = exclusive.  She felt maybe it would be best if we didn't have sex until after the divorce was final.  Yeah, right!  For some reason, I lost track of what the movie was about, and it wasn't as funny as I was hoping.  We turned it off midway through and turned out the lights and continued to cuddle with each other and talk until around 1:30.  I woke again around 4:30 and we fooled around some more.  Then I got up and left around 7:30 for the camping / kayaking trip.  The drive took longer than I expected, and I started to fear that the group would leave the campsite for the canoe/kayak trip without me.  At around 9:15, I sent Rodney positive thoughts, that I was coming ... maybe he would hear me.  I got to the campground at around 9:45, skipping check-in.  They were waiting for me, and were about to head out in 5 minutes.  Whew!  by 10:30 we were on the river - John and I were in kayaks, and everyone else was sharing a canoe (6 or 7 couples).  John was a bit of a hotshot in the kayak, and I was clearly a novice, but it didn't really matter because everyone else was hung over from partying the night before.  It was slow ride down the river, a nice mix of slow patches and rapids.  No one seemed to want to make any effort to row.  By the end I was getting impatient and I went ahead of the group.  All throughout the trip, I kept thinking about S and how much I wished she was out on the river with me.  Afterwards, we got on a bus and were dropped off near our cars to drive back to the campground.  I stopped to check in for the campground, and then drove back.  Once there, I saw that most people had not come back - one couple was about to go out, and one couple was drinking beers near their tent.  I decided not to pitch my tent yet.  The campground was close to the road (noisy), I wasn't sure what I'd do with myself, I was feeling a little lonely, I missed S, and I wanted to talk to S, but there was no cell phone service.  So I decided to drive until I found cell service.  Once in the car, I was listening to Deep Forest and I was starting to feel really low and depressed and regretful about the decisions I'd made in my life.  I cried in the car as my emotions overcame me.  I felt like there was a huge connection between me an S, and for lack of a better word, that we were soulmates.  Maybe I was crying because it felt so good to be in love again.  Or maybe I was feeling like I was rushing into things and I would have another relationship end in disaster.  Or maybe I was feeling I would inevitably make a bad decision again.  I may have also been feeling very introverted where I was running away from the campground, where I was camping with a bunch of people I didn't know.  So while I was crying and looking at the beautiful vistas I was also feeling a little like driving off the vista - ending everything.  Maybe it's like my emotions were just overwhelming and I didn't like being so out of control.  But I also felt like I had felt the tears coming on and I pushed myself to cry.  To cry for a lot of things, because I typically can't cry and I wanted to encourage myself to release.  I got cell phone service and called S.  I asked what she was doing that night and whether it would be okay if I could come see her.  She said she'd love to see me.  So I drove 2.5 hours back to Cheshire to see her.  I cried some more during the drive back.  I told her about my day and my crying in the car and some of my suicidal feeling.  I felt very vulnerable with her but felt I could trust her implicitly.  We got chinese food and then sat down on the couch to watch a movie with her sister.  I was feeling really drowsy, and excused myself around 9 to get some sleep.  She came to bed around 11:30 or so, and I woke up.  Again, more talking, kissing, cuddling, and fooling around.  We went to sleep around 1:30, and this time I woke around 4:30 and asked to use her computer to do some email, and download some of my music to her computer.  When she woke up, we talked and fooled around some more.  We kind of lazed around and then went out to breakfast around 11.  After breakfast we took sampson for a walk.  I had to leave around 3 to get back home.  It was very hard to leave.  I had such a great weekend, not having to deal with my other life.
