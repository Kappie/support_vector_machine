I know, it's still 3 months to go 'down under', but I like to think a head...   Anyway, what I've been thinking is that I need a new computer, either a S775 Prescott P4 or perhaps an AMD64 machine, dunno just now. Depends on 3 things I guess:  - Mainboard/Chipset quality/performance/price - CPU Price/performance - Availablility on both  I have pretty strict requirements for the rest of the box as well, more on that some other time. Suffice to say I want it to be smart, good looking and not to 'big'. Yes, I agree, that might sound like an ad for a new wife or something, but it's not! I want it to be in one of them cool small factor boxes, good looking and easy to transport, to LANs and whatnots. Anyways, what I really wanted to say something about was p|azma, my 'old' computer. Just to sum up what it consists of:  - AMD Athon1600+  - ASUS Maiboard (A7V?), with RAID controller.  - 512 MB SD-RAM  - 80+120 GB HD (IBM and WD8MB)  - Hercules Radeon 8500 128 MB  - 10/100 Nic, Some cheap ass sound and other effects  So what possible uses are there of this 'not-so-dated' 'puter? Well, the usual suspects would be:  - Media Station, running XP or Linux and serving A/V to stereo/TV  - Secondary 'puter, running all kinds of 'test-os' stuff  - Server, either with Windows or Linux on, serving all kinds of stuff... (dunno what, but still!)  - Something completly different that I have yet to scheme up...  But neither of these are really roles that I NEED it to do, I mean I can do most of it on my 'to-be' new computer. So I figured I had to do something different with it. Looking at my requirements for my next 'puter, I won't have a lot of room to store stuff on, usually there is only room for 1 HD... And since there still is no 1 TB HD out there, I need another solution! :) So I figured,m why not make p|azma my NAS (Network Attached Storage) box ? The hardware piece is straight forward, all I need is already there, I might wanna get a Gigabit nic to make sure I have plenty of bandwidth there, but otherwise I'm all set!  So then I figured I needed some software to serve the data over the net for me. Before I started I took the time to list my requirements: - Windows Share access (Samba on *nix) - FTP Access (sFTP?) - HTTP/Web Admin - Webmin must be able to create new shares, set up network etc. - Some kind of backup method, from other 'puter to the NAS.  I started to  urlLink Google  after other projects, but didn't really find anyone doing exactly the same as I wanted. However I did find some:  urlLink Build your Own NAS Box   urlLink Blackbox Stoarge   urlLink TUX Server   All these are pretty cool, but not entirly what I need... All I needed was the actual software! So by the power of Google, I tried over and over again, typing in different versions of my search and so forth... And behold! I found! :D  urlLink Zetta Systems  has a software called Zetta Server, that does more or less exactly what I wanted! How cool is that ?! they have a Lite version that is free for personal use!  The only really 'bad' thing about it is that its not a Linux/BSD based software, so the potential for customization and such is very low and addons are virtually impossible...  So even though I like their product, I'm still looking for a specialized linux distro that will do it for me... Let me know if YOU know of such a thing! :)
