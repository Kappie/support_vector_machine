And with desire comes passion. Passion which tend to create  urlLink arguments.  My argument being Huntresses are overpowered. Horribly so. It seems every 'good' player on the net uses mass huntresses. I've been playing on USEast for about two or three weeks, and EVERY SINGLE LOSS has been to mass huntresses. I doubt this is because the good players play Night Elf. Surely not ALL the good players prefer NE? That is statistically impossible...UNLESS...Night Elves have an ace up their sleeves. Ie Huntress. Anyhoo, rantings on game imbalances aside (Blizzard is reportedly working on the problem - Night Elves have created much of the same issues that existed with Mutalisks in Starcraft), it's weekend again. Can you beleive it. Time for drinking, sleeping, and playing more WC3. It's hard to be pissy and remain in a black mood when it's a Friday afternoon and 45 minutes left before the weekend begins. Have a good one folks.
