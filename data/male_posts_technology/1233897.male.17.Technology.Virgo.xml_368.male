Wow, I think that was  along sentence but I'm not sure because I don't feel like quinting to read it ;) Speaking of touchtyping, I recal a time steven was here, turned around looking at my tv, talking to me, and still typing IMs behind his back  ... he just wanted me to mention that ;) (It did really happen though)  TO give you an idea of how late I've been getting to bed lately, I got to bed at 12:30 last night and it took three hours+ for me to get to sleep. LOL The start of summer school was this morning... I didn't make it... woke up at 2:30pm  I'm realizing now that I haven't really posted anything realivant to anything going on lately for the past week+ soI'm going to do taht, provided I find my glasses and/or contacts in a timely manner (lol)  For now, goodbye~
