Since he both wrote (as a screenplay) and directed it, the story doesn't take the beating they normally do making the transition from book to film.  Plus, being released 31 years ago, it's fun to see a vision of the future run by computers that are banks of flashing lights and reel-to-reel magnetic tape.  Still, Crichton's future seems more possible with each passing year, especially in its depiction of computer malfunctions due to viruses.   - 4 out of 5 stars
