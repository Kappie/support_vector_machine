Tickets were 10 bucks a pop, but it should be excellent. I caught a match on  urlLink ESPN2  about a month ago. It was pretty intense! Many of the players are Olympic medalists, so I'm sure that there'll be some pretty sweet action. Plus, they have  urlLink Ivana, the official Killerspin KS4HER clothing line model . How awesome is that?
