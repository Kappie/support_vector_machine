Yesterday Bwitty stopped by - lol I didn't reconize her for a second. We talked for five minutes or so and I invited her to my after-party tonight (which I don't really think will be much of a party at all, but oh well.)  Speaking of tonight, tonight's finally WINTER BANQUETTE!! *yay* That should be interesting. I'm picking up Andrew at 5:30, Cam and Kelli are getting to my house at 6:00 and we're picking up Adri and Melissa at 6:15ish. The banquette starts at 8:00 and we'll prolly be ready to head out at 10:00, though actually it might be much later than that... I invited Steven to come over afterward if he wants... have no idea when 'afterward' will be though. The girls have to clear out at 12:30 (which also means Cam since he's going with Kelli) and *... thinks* Andrew, Josh and Steven might stay over night.  I'm getting out of school at 11:30 :) that's a plus right there too.
