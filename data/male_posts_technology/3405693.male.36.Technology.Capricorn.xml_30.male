Anni is a little Vietnamese lady who i've known for years.  When I first met her I figured she didn't like caucasians because of a couple of comments she made.  She was a customer of mine, and we dealth with each other lots on a professional level, and soon became friends.  I completely forgot about my original misgivings, and we socialized lots; camping trips, birthday parties, drink fests...we were part of the same social circle among which everyone respected everyone else and we all got along smashingly.  When I got laid off a couple years ago, I maintained contact with many of these people.  As my situation grew worse, someone else in Anni's company offered me a job there.  I took it...a part time job, few hours a week, perfect supplement to my teensy little income.  After the end of last year, they transferred me to anni's store because it's closer to my home.  Now for as long as I've known her and she was in management, Anni has had a grand total of 4 white males who worked for her, me being the fourth.  The first one, Ron, was a nice young kid, flaming gay but a nice guy and pretty good at his job.  Within a week of him starting I started hearing from Anni about what a poor worker he was, and how he didn't follow her lead etc etc.  I believed her...figured he was a bad employee with discipline problems.  After 2 years of this from her he quit this company.  The second one was a guy named Steve, who was in a position similar to what I am in.  I heard quite often how he wasn't a good hire, how he probably shouldn't still be in the company, etc etc etc.  Steve was transferred to a different store (ironically, to the store I left after christmas).  Next, Cory.  Cory is a sharp guy with a sharp tongue.  Very good employee, fun to work with, good sales skills, good product knowlege...all in all a guy I would hire.  Cory's been there for a while now, and he's good friends with Anni's boss.  Before I started, I heard second hand stories of how awful a person cory was for anni to work with, how he had her near tears with his horrible disrespect and lack of dedication and how he goes over her head all the time.  Now, I've worked with cory for 4 months now, and that's BS pure and simple...he's a good guy and a good employee.  So now me.  I've been given a letter from management about unprofessional things i've done, and they've been told I stink.  Now, anyone who knows me is well aware of the fact that I have an extremely sensitive olfactory system...I can smell BO 300 meters away and it makes me ill.  I have since asked everyone I know if I've ever stunk and every last one of them has said they've NEVER known me to smell bad.  It's something I'm a little obsessive about.  Now when this was first told to me I asked if it was smoke from taking a cigarette break (I smoke), but I was told no it wasn't that.  So what the hell?  That one just about made me fall of my chair.  I even asked all the other co-workers about that, and they said they've never noticed anything like that.    Also, she knows I have two jobs, yet every week she changes the schedule to try and screw me.  Without telling me.  And then tells me the previous schedule wasn't the real one and that it's my responsibility to keep on top of it.  Well, no it is NOT my responsibility, it's hers.  Last week my schedule said I was working next tuesday.  So I switched my schedule at the other job to accomodate her, and they scheduled me on Thursday.  Now all of a sudden she has me working Thursday.  So now I'm hooped.  I either skip a shift at the one job, or the other.  I desparately need every hour I can get right now.  So this sucks.  So how is all this racism?  Well, every other person she's worked with is asian, and she NEVER says boo about her asian co-workers.  Now I've been in telecom a LONNGGG time and have tons of Asian friends from it, and I know that they will always give the business to another Asian first; it's a cultural thing, and that's fine.  It's not conscious discrimination, and it is easy enough to get around (just be better at it than your asian competition), but none of my Asian friends actually generate ire towards caucasians (although a lot of them don't really like most east Indian's...).  I'm mostly caucasian, sorta brown cuz there's a bit of East Indian in there, but mainly seen as white.  I've wracked my brain to come up with why she is doing this to me (she's even attempted to poison me with some of our other mutual friends, and THAT crosses the line), and the only thing I can come up with is a subconscious dislike of caucasians.  I've asked her what her expectations are and done everything in my power to meet those, but it is not enough for her.  So, I think I must quit that job.  Her boss is away right now, and I can't go to him for a transfer or something, and this needs to be sorted out this week because of the double shift.  I would report her to HR, but I don't have any actually proof of this, only my feeling and past knowlege which is all just hearsay.  I sooo need both jobs right now, and it's crushing me to quit, but what the hell am I supposed to do?  Stick it out til she fires me?   Continue along with this scheduling nightmare and avoid her?  Try and get all the other guys she's tried to screw together and bust her for discrimination?  That's just not in my nature; I would like it on record that I feel discriminated against so she can't do it to the next guy, but that just makes me look bad to the company.  Which I guess doesn't really matter if I quit, but it kind of matters to me since I have so many friends in the company.  Sigh.
