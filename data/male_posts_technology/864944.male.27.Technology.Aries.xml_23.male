And we're trying to make the best of it, pick up the pieces, and come back swinging!  GO US! ---- Jay and I have made amazing progress on our gaming work.  Our website is up for or group,  urlLink http://www.smallfrystudios.com , and we hope to have our first game, "HIllBilly Whack: Save Whinny May" out this spring.  Things look great to meet that target  :) ---- I have been playing  urlLink Command and Conquer Generals  as of late  and having tons of fun.  Its a solid Real Time Strategy game, and worthy of the legacy of the Command and Conquer series. ---- I am upgrading my machine at home.  YAY!  It will be some fancy hardware working inside, replacing the motherboard, CPU, and adding some ram.  BUt I think I can do it.  ANd when I'm done i may be able to rebuild my 3rd machien with new parts since it has fried in the meantime :( ----  Wedding plans are going well, we have invitations chosen, and now the big thing is the wording on the invitations, and also the rehersal dinner location.  Many are in the air, and unfortunately many are being shot down.  It seems that every location is changing ownership this year.  Maybe its a good time to buy resturaunts.. who knew :)  Thats all for now. Feel free to drop me an email any time.   urlLink website@russellminer.com
