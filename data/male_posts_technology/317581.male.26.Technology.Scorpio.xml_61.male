Actually, I was trying to decide between a Corolla and an Echo,  but after test driving them, I decided on the Corolla. Anyway, so we sit down to go over financials and the dude is like, I'l be right back. And I'm like, cool, cause the corollas are having a special 4.9% APR for a 60 mo loan. So, I'm like "Kick Ass"....  About 20 minutes later (mind you all I had to keep me entertained is my cell phone with snake on it.), he comes back with his manager. The manager goes into this little speel... "Today, we can get you in a 2001 Tundra, and at 60 mos, you'll pay 505/month, plus we need a down payment of $1200"... or translated... (*We don't think you're serious so please leave our store*) Assholes.   Anyway, I hope everyone is enjoying my postings, I know I am:)
