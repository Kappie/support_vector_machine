I should be more calm..... learn to relax and take thing easy. but i just couldn't control my emotions..... this shit is too much for me. so much so that I need painkillers last nite in order to sleep.  keep checking my emails to see if my boss replied. Either they don check their mails during weekends or they wanted a face to face talk instead. I'm looking forward to tomorrow, when i can talk to them face to face. I cannot just sit there seeing my name being pointed out as 1 of the cause. I din do anything wrong.  was trying to find info on web abt selecting on huge database table. remember telling my buddy that if the thing exist, u can be sure to find it on the web. but this is an exception. i suppose this case is too unique. don think there is any write up on this......  so i decided to turn to asking pple in the forums. SPUG.net forum. where i always feel there there is a big group of talent from all walks of life. where u can get info on the most powerful torchlights to the latest news update. surely there would be someone who could answer my question.....  while i din get a definite answer, most of them are sure that a select statement, no matter how huge the table is, will not be able to crash the server.   too bad there isn't any confirmed write up on the net that i can qoute to my boss. but they do boast my knowelge on sql..... and i'm quite sure that i'm correct all these while..... select statement can't crash a server.....  i will fight back to clear my name..... sql is my strong point in office. i cannot let these stupid consultant put the blame on me and destory my reputation for being good in sql. i will not sit down just like this.....   i will fight back..... i must fight back......
