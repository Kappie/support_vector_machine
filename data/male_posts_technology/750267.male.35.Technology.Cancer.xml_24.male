Well, I met some aliens who gave me medicine that can cure every disease, and extends natural life by 50 years. I started selling injections of this medicine for $1 million per person. I once heard that there are over 1 million millionaires in the United States alone. How many of these wealthy individuals would give up a large piece of their fortune to cure their terminal illness, or extend their life? I bet most if not all would.  Or would these people not give me every thing they had to save the life of their sick or aging spouse or child? I bet you could sell 10 million doses of these things at $1 million each. That's $10 trillion dollars. When the ultra-rich have been cured, I would offer it to the middle class at only $400,000 per dose.  And I hear the first trillion is the hardest. After that, the money will come rolling in from other enterprises. And those aliens will be back to give me something else valuable to sell. How about a machine that produces an unlimited supply of gold? You see, a quadrillionaire in no time!
