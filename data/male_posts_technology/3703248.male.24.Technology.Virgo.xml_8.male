She has been though    a lot lately with renal failure, blood clots, and other horrible painful problems.    Hopefully she will come back today fully rejuvenated and ready for veterinary college this fall.    I am excited for her and I hope it isn’t too hard on her.             My job is going great; I failed to do a migration of MS Exchange 2000 to its new hardware.    It was a domain controller which is where I believe the migration problems started.    The entire firm’s email was down for four days, now luckily it’s over with.    Now that the Exchange server is finally migrated I can begin working on other issues.             My diet is going well though I went high protein, medium fat, and low carb.    It wasn’t due to hunger or anything but greed.    After reading about ketosis I decided to jump on the metabolic advantage bandwagon.    October the 6 th  I plan on going back to my high protein, medium carb and low fat diet.    While I am having no problems with being on this diet, it just doesn’t feel right to eat this much fat even if weight loss does occur rapidly.    I only want to achieve and maintain 180-200 pounds.                 Maybe things will continue to go well… I am studying for a MCP certification exam now.    It’s taking a lot of time.
