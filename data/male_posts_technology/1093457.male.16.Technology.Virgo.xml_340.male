My sister and about 10 of her mates r going to Thorpe Park too on the inset day- look out for them! 4 days left till easter now thouh (well, school days)- all courseowkr deadlines are t his week I think, although I have everything but my music ocmposition finished, that shold (fingers crossed be finished tomorrow though, at lunch and after school). I still haven't got a brief though, hadve u Tom? Anyway, gtg do some History that I had put right ot the back of my mind, I can't risk not doing it for a 2nd week in a row, Mr Weston will have my guts for garters or something quite similar, no doubt. Talk to ya later guys.
