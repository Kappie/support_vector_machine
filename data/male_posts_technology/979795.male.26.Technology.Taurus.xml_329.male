Nervous and excited I guess. :P  Got up at 0415hrs, washed up and had a quick breakfast before I went out to meet the cab. It was already waiting when I left the house. Went down to Neo's (campmate) place and waited awhile before we went to the National Stadium. A lot of road closures so we alighted along Nicoll Highway instead. There was already a crowd by the time we arrived. I called Robin (sec sch mate) and we met up at the bags deposit area which was actually just a small lorry labelled A and B. Things were pretty organised and systematic because lorry A only took bags for tag IDs 4000-5200. Mine was 4440, not very auspicious lah :P. Despite the crowd, it wasn't as bad as the Sheares Bridge Run/Army Half Marathon. Today's crowd was just around 10000, but I heard that this event attracts a lot of foreign and professional marathon runners each year.  We started the run at 0600hrs. There so many people packed together at the starting line that we had to walk for 2min+ before we actually reached it. The 10, 21 and 42km runners all started at the same time, but the end point will be different. 21km will end at ECP, while the others will end at Padang (if I'm not mistaken about 10km). The first 5-6 km was nice and comfortable, but it got kinda boring the moment we hit ECP at the Fort Road junction. I had to start taking drinks at almost every drink booth fro this stage onwards to sustain myself. The first 10km was quite alright and light. All the while, we were all running at a small pace and slow speed to conserve strength and energy. Along the way there were cheering teams and drink stands which really helped the runners to push forward. I think the toughest part for me would be the last 3-4km. By then my legs were feeling fatigued, my pace was smaller and speed was slower too. Kinda entertained the thought of ending it early by walking but I kept telling myself "There'sonly slightly more than our usual 2.4km run left. I can do this!!" haha ... I think Standard Chartered will be mailing my timing to me at a later date. There's this electronic chip on loan to runners that we had to attached to our shoes. It's suppose to monitor the start and end time to provide us an accurate record of our running time. Apparently, some metal plates were placed on the ground at the start and end points to act as a trigger for these chips.  Well I did finish the run in the end, my timing seemed to be around 2hr 20min or so. This was considerably better than the 2hr 30+ min I did for AHM. But I expect there's some discrepancies because AHM used a clock to record the timings. Somewhere during the run, I lost sight of Robin and I think he went on ahead. Hope ghe got a good timing for himself. Neo was just under a minute behind me. I was surprised as he was usually a better runner than me. After the run I must have gulped down about 4 cans of Gatorade and 1 bottle of mineral water at the end point. Didn't manage to meet up with Robin as he had to go to church soon so Neo and I took a free shuttle service back to the Padang. By then the first runner had already finished the Full Marathin. It was an incredible timing of 1hr+, just under 2hrs. Oh man, by the time I finished 21km, a bunch of others had already finished 42km. Wooooo...   From here Neo met 2 of his old friends and the 4 of us made our way to the 42km finishing pt to see how everyone was doing. It was quite encouraging really to see so many people cheering. We went to grab some food at BK and changed into clean clothes. The weather today had been fantastic. Not sunny at all and neither did it rain. I think this was a very important factor during the run.  To conclude this long entry, I hope to go back for AHM 04, but I'm not sure if I'll go for the Singapore Marathon 04. Even if I do, doubt I'll sign register for it as I still think $30 is still pretty steep, considering it's an early bird price. 42km? Hmm, won't entertain the thought for a few years at least. Maybe only if I can shave down my timing to under 2hrs? Hahaha ...  How do I feel now? The mind is fresh and awake but the body is really sore. Because I'm wet through down to my shoes and toes, it kinda made my nails brittle and the skin wrinkled. Luckily the nails didn't break like it did during AHM. Some light abrasion along the ... ahem ahem ... common areas and the sole of my left foot feels bruised though it seems to be getting better just by removing the shoe. Threw away my old series SAF New Balance running shoes, which in my opinion, is a lot lighter than the new one.
