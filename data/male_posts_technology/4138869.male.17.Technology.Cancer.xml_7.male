Heartbeat and panting.]    "Must run" he whispered to himself.    [Player has "darkness" chasing him down a set of narrow coridors. Candles turning out as the player runs past them. The darkness is visualised as black fog/smoke quickly gaining in on the player.]    The candles turned out behind him. There was nothing to do but run. He could hear the distant screams. The screams of a thousand lost souls in their never ending pain and agony. "Must run" he panted, "must run!".    [The sounds of distant screaming getting closer as the darkness gets closer. The darkness will keep up and close in on the player.]    Then he saw the door. It was open. "Run through! Close it!" his mind yelled at him in panic.    [Player sees a door, slightly open. Player runs through and enters a dark room where only the senter is lit by a candle. The black smoke starts to slowly pour through the door.]    It could taste his panic now. It could smell his fear. He felt the chill.    [The walls in the room are veiled in darkness, the candle dims and eventually everything fades out as the black smoke covers it all.]    Then nothing.
