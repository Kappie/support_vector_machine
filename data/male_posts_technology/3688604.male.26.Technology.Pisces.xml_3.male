I have no idea what that statement was all about, so you can consider it *abstract*.  Motherfucker, let me just rant and rave for a few unimportant moments about generic "pop punk".  We're talking Green Day offshoots here, because as far as I am concerned, those guys are solely responsible for the rapid proliferation of this "genre" of "music".  Jesus, I watched this band the other day - they weren't technically deficient or anything, it's just that everything about what they had come up with lacked imagination.  In its entirety.  They had no spark; nothing AT ALL that separated them from their peers - HOW IN THE FUCKING FUCK do they expect that they will be memorable?  And why did they seem somewhat surprised that they got no reaction whatsoever from the crowd?  I don't know, maybe I am just insane, but perhaps it has something to do with not accomplishing or even attempting to accomplish any one thing that distinguishes you from any other shitty band that ever had an over-inflated self opinion and bothered to WASTE MY FUCKING PRECIOUS TIME on stage with it.  Take your crappy, overdone, Green Day knockoff MTV garage band and cram it up your boring, syphilitic asses before I take a chainsaw to your sorry necks and earn myself a place in the humanitarian hall of fame.  For the love of Christ on a fucking stick, please keep your bland, washed out crap out of my town.  IS THAT SO MUCH TO ASK?!  This has been a public service announcement.  Also, THE BARON HAS SPOKEN.
