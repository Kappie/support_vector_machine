And usually I've found it to be true mostly with girls. but the fact that he asks if it's that time of the month is bad. The fact that he doesn't argue with you means he probably doesn't think it's that big of a deal to argue about, but he shouldn't blow you off by asking if it's "that time of the month". So, maybe what I'm refering to as "craziness" is overreacting to the smallest of things.  I dunno.  Also, it's 11pm and I'm the last one up. Weird.  PS - Weezer, Tenacious D, and Jimmy Eat World on November 15th. I'll be there, will you?
