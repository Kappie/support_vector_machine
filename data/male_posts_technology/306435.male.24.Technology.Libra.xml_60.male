There was a man in it who sang by just talking louder than normal.  He later came up to Jim and started to talking to him aout having to push a pebble with his nose across a street.  Confused?  So was Jim.  Tom seemed to be doing pretty well, or as well as one could expect.  We are gon to go out him Friday.  it should be fun.  I hadn't hung out with all of them in a while.  I am looking forward to it.    Tom informed me he bought American Movie on DVD.  I advise watching the movie.  You'll spend te first half trying to figure out if it is real and the second part trying not to laugh so you can hear the dialouge.  That is all I really have here...I am woring on the  urlLink web page  and hope to have new stuff daily.
