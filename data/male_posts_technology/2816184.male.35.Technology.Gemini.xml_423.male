I have a feeling it's going to keep lasting too, like into tomorrow and even the next day.  *sigh*  But I content myself that I'm not as bad as my best friend, who regularly runs 10+ migraines in her cute little head.  I don't know if I could deal with that.  Had an interesting dream last night.  She, the one who I truely love, handed me a box of crystals.  She's big into crystals.  Well, turns out that the crystals she handed me are good for healing, delving into past lives (which I've dwelt on a lot lately) and also issues of love.  The whole thing really adds up to a divinitory meaning of "wait, take time, learn lessons and it will come, enduring love will last".    It all adds up in my mind to the answer to a question I've been asking myself a lot lately.  Could we, She and I, have been brought back together in this life only to be kept apart?  I like to think no, but I've not been sure.  Until now.  Now I have this dream, and it answers my questions for me.  Perhaps it just wish fulfillment, but how could I dream things that I don't know about?  I'm good, but I'm not that good.  It gives me some peace and contentment to know this.  I followed it on with a "crystal tarot" reading...and the result was basically the same thing!  I think I'm being given a message here.  I'll take that and go with it, I think.  And I've been lucky enough to have been paid large and wonderful compliments by Her lately.  They make me happier than I can say, more than I ever would have imagined they could.  So I guess you could say, dispite my migraine, I'm still happy.
