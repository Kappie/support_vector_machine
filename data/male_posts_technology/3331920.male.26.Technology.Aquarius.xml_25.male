It's really tough to make something that's dry and technical actually sound appealing. I mean the product is really powerful, but the trick is explaining it without sounding like a technical manual. :)  Anywho, Angel's friend Kathy is in town, and the two of them will be hanging out tomorrow night, so i'm going to get the heck out of Dodge for a while i think.  Still haven't decided what i'm going to get up to, but we'll see.   I'm out.
