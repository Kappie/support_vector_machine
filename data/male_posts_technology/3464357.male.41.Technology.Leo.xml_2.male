My goal was 1:40, but considering my effort a week earlier in the Ogden Marathon, I wasn't disappointed in the results.  The course was fun, although the first 3 miles were a little buggy.  The race began on the dike at Farmington Bay.  Mile 3 was just inside the bird refuge, and once we got past the gate to the refuge and were on blacktop road, the bug population declined, the surface became smoother, and we were no longer running into the sun.  The route is a familiar one to me--I frequently do training runs through west Farmington and Kaysville.  The temperature was good, low 60's, with a cool breeze from the north.  The aid stations were well-manned and had plenty of drinks, and there was ample food at the end.
