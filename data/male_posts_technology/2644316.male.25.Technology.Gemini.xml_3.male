This vendor has a chain of shops (huge shopping malls type) running across the city under the name "Vijay Sales".  I checked up on a TV (Videocon Brand)and checked up the price tag. The product MRP was Rs. 14000/- and due to a festive offer they were selling it at Rs 10000/-. Along with the scheme offer they were giving a exchange offer where if bring your old color TV and get it exchanged than the new TV costs you Rs. 7999/- only.   Well looking at the figures, the final price is almost the half of the MRP of the product. It is even more surprising to know that they earn still good no. of percentage amount after all the discounts.  Can you just imagine that we keep bringing inn lots of stuff with just marginal percentage of discounts being offered during the festive season. After getting the discounts we get the feel of doing something in a smart way... but still those manufacturers are earning a lot, taking out all their profits from your pocket.  That's the way product industry goes.  What say?
