Your average Jane or Joe wouldn't have any real use for a bluetooth-enabled phone....yet.  The scary part is that bluetooth holds the potential to solve a whole bunch of annoying daily life problems for very low cost.  This makes it an enevitiblity, in my mind, that it's going to be everywhere (if WiFi doesn't take over, that is).   Why does it seem the hardest lesson to learn is to keep security as part of your design plan?  How many black eyes is the IT industry gonna take before they learn their lesson?
