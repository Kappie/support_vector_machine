Even though I do have a phone line and I've updated the blog template to show my new address and home phone no. The phone is still connected to the previous tennant so it will change at the end of this week.  This place is very very very cool, It's in an old building but has recently been refurbished. It has high ceilings and parquetry floors in the main areas except for the two bedrooms which have carpet. The main bedroom has an en-suite bathroom (I've always wanted one) and the main bathroom has a pretty decent bath in it. I have views of the River Clyde complete with white swans swimming up and down in the morning and afternoon. The kitchen has Bosch everything and finally, a gas stove!!! So overall, I like the place very much. There is a Somerfield supermarket just 20 metres around the corner and I'm the same building as Craig and Danielle so its cool to have some friends just upstairs to go and watch some TV or just to hang out for a while...   Well I have to go to work now, so I'll keep you updated with my new home phone no.  lots of love, -gede xoxxoxo
