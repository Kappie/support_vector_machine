It looks like these  urlLink same allegations  have been previously investigated and dismissed by child welfare authorities before:   Both the boy and his brother told investigators Jackson had not sexually abused them, according to the memo. Their older sister said she had never witnessed anything sexually inappropriate between her brothers and the entertainer.   And this:   The boy's mother told investigators in February that "she believed the media had taken everything out of context," the memo said. The mother said that the children were never left alone with Jackson and that her son slept in the same room with Jackson but never shared his bed. She said Jackson would sleep on the floor.   I wonder what the mother's excuse will be for those statements?  This case is starting to get sad. I mean, this poor boy is apparently dying of cancer. Apparently his condition is quite bad. And Michael Jackson's life and reputation has been forever destroyed. And the truth is, nobody knows what really happened. Maybe Jackson did do something, and was able to convince the family to overlook it for a while. Or maybe nothing happened, and the family is now exaggerating things to get back at him.   Only two people know for sure what happened - Jackson and the boy. Jackson tells his side (and nobody believes him). The boy cannot tell his side, since he is protected (and rightly so) by our system of justice. The mother can tell her side, but her story is full of holes. So what's this all about?
