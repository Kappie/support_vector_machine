My weekends seem to see me tired at the end of the afternoon..hmm...anyway i had tennis early in the morning with some friends..tried to call my primary sch friend but she couldn't make it...she had a bowling tournament and represented her company. Oh well, anyway Elaine, Andrew, Ben, Nat and Ariel were there..had quite a fun time there and also we had excellent overcast weather..at least for the 2nd hour..because after that it started to rain. I finally knew what's wrong with my service. Coz my arm wasn't swinging straight up that's why. And i could hit the ball on the sweet spot much more often than last week which is excellent. Anyway, i'll post some pics of me. Oh yes, also my graduation pics.  So nice, nat and elaine came to my graduation just to take photos. I graduated together with jeffrey so both of us had photos taken after the ceremony. It was a nice experience and we had fun posing for the shots. We went outside to take and it was funny, coz even though i was wearing long sleeve shirt with tie and a gown on top, i didn't feel hot when i was having fun. Oh well..
