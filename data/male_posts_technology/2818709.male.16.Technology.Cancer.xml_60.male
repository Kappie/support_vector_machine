He's a really cool guy...I hope he makes it. Why couldnt one of the bastards/bitches of the world contracted it instead? I mean, if the reaper's just getting bored, kill off a few old people. Or a few assholes. Like the guy that drove by and called me/eric/adam pussies while we were riding our bikes to super cao-nguyen...He could die. No one would miss him.  !!! Diana never noticed that i wear glasses !!!  [so un-noticed]
