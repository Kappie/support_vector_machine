There must be some point in time where a line needs to be drawn between family and career... Vivek and Shobana did have a number of ways to handle the situation. But they kept considering that an onsite opportunity is the "holy grail" that needs to be obeyed irrespective of family circumstances... which should not have been their attitude...  Even at the close of the story, they decide it the hard way to stay "onsite"...   This just needs a little thinking in the lines of their common goals... and the steps they need to take to support each other to achieve their individual ambitions too... And, what it requires is mutual understanding and proper prioritization of their life's activities...
