Lazy slackers. :)  Anyhoo they've put up a couple of links in lieu of a newsletter and one of them is  urlLink A Case of the Crabs  which is a pointy-clicky adventure like Monkey Island. This is a black and white 'film noir' detective story and looks pretty good. It also features Dogs playing Mahjong so it has something for everyone. Well everyone except Dogs himself as it seems a bit light on pr0n.  Oh did I mention it was made by otters? Clever little fsckers.  More free pointy clicky adventure goodness  urlLink here ,  urlLink here  (and  urlLink again !) and  urlLink here .   via  urlLink b3ta
