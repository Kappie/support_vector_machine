Blogger have introduced photoblogging now. So what does photoblogging mean to we New Linkers? Well I could pretend it's all about riding the cutting edge of blogging and that we are hip, trendy  urlLink Generation Xers . But that would be silly. The reason it is going to get used here is of paramount importance to the net's premier cheapskates - it means  FREE  hi-res image storage! YAY!  A  urlLink full tutorial  is available at Blogger. But the basic premise is download and install a chat gizmo called  urlLink Hello , choose send picture, then choose BloggerBot as the recipient. You will then get an option screen for resizing,captioning etc. Once you have done that, choose publish to blog and off it goes. The picture is published as a thumbnail which is a link through to the full size picture.  When resizing images for the thumbnail choose one of the two smaller sizes for publishing as the largest size will probably screw the layout of the page. As for the size of the stored hi-res image choose the largest. After all we aren't paying for the hosting! ;)   CAVEAT:  I haven't looked at privacy implications yet re spyware etc as I had to have a fiddle with it straight away. I'll be going back to the Hello page to have a read soon.  ps. Bungers was going to have a look at this and write something but there are several reasons I've done it instead.  I couldn't wait to have a play  We would be waiting for months for him to do it ;)  Most importantly of all he is doing the Victoria Tunnel Report tonight. Parp!
