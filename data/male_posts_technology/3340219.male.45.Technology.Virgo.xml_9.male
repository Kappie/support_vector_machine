Few are in a better position to answer that question than Jim Highsmith, author of Adaptive Software Development, Agile Software Development Ecosystems, and a founding member of the AgileAlliance.  In fact, Highsmith, fellow, Cutter Consortium, says he sees a move underway to expand the agile modeling concept to the domain of management. Highsmith spoke at this week's Cutter Summit in Cambridge, Mass. Somewhat narrow agile modeling, he indicated, may come to include broader agile practices.  In agile modeling, quick initial planning of software projects is accompanied by iterative development techniques associated with Extreme Programming (XP) concepts. Agile modeling could be said to add a bit more structure to Extreme Programming methods, without becoming 'over-structured,' a trait some individuals ascribe to traditional software project management.  "Agility," said Highsmith, "is the ability to balance flexibility and structure."  "We see agile practices moving from early adopters to the mainstream," he said, "so an issue facing the movement is what we do now." Some even ask, Highsmith chided, if we should move Extreme Programming to moderate programming. Highsmith dismisses this notion. "We have to retain the basic value of the agile system," he said.
