Saturday was the best day by far, there was a nice enough wave in Garylucas, not the Garylucas I've grown to know and love but a smaller, tamer version. There was a good crowd in the water and a bit of banter, all in all a fairly good sesh.   There was a guy ripping up with his kite too, that looks like a lot of fun! This guy must have been getting twenty foot airs off little two foot waves. Hopefully the cost of the equipment will drop at some stage, it's still a little too pricey for me.  Sunday was pretty poor in comparison, the waves were weak and the rip was strong so there was a hell of a lot of paddling done. There seems to be a lot of sand movement in Garrettstown lately, in particluar there's a really strong rip in front of the bigger groyne. Maybe we'll see some nice sandbars forming. At the moment the outside waves are just backing off and the inside is closing out. Still though, if you can get the right one on the inside you can have a lot of fun!    Crevin Taking Off.
