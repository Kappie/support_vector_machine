It's been quite a while (years, really) since that has happened to me, so it has really driven home the point about the importance of backups.  I was lucky this time. At work, I was able to retrieve the data on the disk before it completely failed. (That's the thing about hard drives... They often fail slowly.)  And with my home computer, the drive that failed was only a few days old, and I hadn't installed anything on it yet. Like I said, lucky me.  As I sit here writing this blog entry (on my new Toshiba e750 Pocket PC), I am running PowerQuest DriveImage 2002, which is backing up my complete computer to a new partition of the replacement hard drive I just picked up from the store.   Note to self:  I need to schedule this to happen once a week at least. I hope this practice really saves my ass one day.
