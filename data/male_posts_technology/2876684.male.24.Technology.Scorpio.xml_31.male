Oh that and I need to get my visa for NZ organised, but what luck! Philippine passport holders are NOT required to pay the visa fee which is normally $110. (Of course Aussies don't need to concern themselves which such things.) Wow, for once in my life that passport actually had an advantage... sorry if i'm oozing bias against my nationality, but talk to me about it after you've been in my shoes! *end rant*
