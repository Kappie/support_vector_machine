Just a way to give gifts to people, and allow everyone who reads this a chance to support the transition back to school life (and the dramatic drop in income that usually accompanies such a transition.)     I take the GMAT on October 3, and the GRE in November.  Math class is currently quite difficult for me.  Quel suprise.  But it is a prereq for the accounting class in the spring.  Microeconomics is relatively easy.  I wonder though, do economists really stand around the water cooler at work and wonder, "What's the opportunity cost on that?"  I start volleyball in 2 weeks.  I think the exercise will do me good.  Since I don't do any now.  Anyway, go buy something.  The prices are reasonable, and the quality is good.  And if you see other products you would like to buy from my store, let me know and I'll add it.
