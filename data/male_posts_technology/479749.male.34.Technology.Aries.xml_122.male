John McCain, R-Ariz., while non-ABC affiliates and radio stations in Sinclair markets stepped in to carry ABC's broadcast. "There is no valid reason for Sinclair to shirk its responsibility in what I assume is a very misguided attempt to prevent your viewers from completely appreciating the extraordinary sacrifices made on their behalf by Americans serving in Iraq," McCain, a decorated Vietnam veteran and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said in a letter to Sinclair president and CEO David Smith. In a swift response to McCain's comments, Smith attacked the "Nightline" special's objectivity. " 'Nightline' is not reporting news; it is doing nothing more than making a political statement," he wrote. Sinclair prepared its own news special to replace the banned "Nightline" special "addressing what has gone on in Iraq as well as addressing (the 'Nightline' pre-emption) issue," Sinclair general counsel Barry Faber said. Following requests from KTRS-AM in St. Louis and WHNS-TV, a Fox affiliate in Greenville, to broadcast the special, ABC News on Friday made the program available to the markets affected by Sinclair's decision. Other stations that aired "Nightline" on Friday included WPXS-TV, a Pax affiliate in St. Louis; Ohio News Network; WJTC-TV, a UPN affiliate in Mobile, Ala.; the New England Cable Network; and KWBM-TV, a WB Network affiliate in Springfield, Mo.
