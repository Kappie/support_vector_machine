You see, I am considerably pissed… But not too pissed to use word for its spell check ability :-)  Today was a fun if not abnormal day in the life of a Grist. To start, it was a normal day, with the standard, “go to work” routine followed by the “the rest of my department go for a fag break, I shall go for a Internet break at the same time as their cigarette smoking siesta. The first one being the moment I walked in the door – the next most remember able one was at 12:00 pm, exactly the time I go for lunch. “John, We are just going for a ciggy” says my boss, disappearing down the corridor closely followed by my other departmental colleague,  My only other colleague, leaving me the only person to man the phones… Any way. With a blog to the Toasterfiles, I feel better… Even more considering that I stand an opportunity to meet the wonderfull women (well 2/3rds of the women) that make up our companion blog at  urlLink Shut_it..  Princesses Kate and the Slapper McSlapperson Andy. What a surprise (sarcasm to those of you that don’t know me)  it was to find the lovely miss slapper has missed the ferry to our lovely island (I say, bighting my finger) Oh well, As I have planned for it anyway, Alcohol beckons me. So I go to the Sports Bar to meet Baity, Toaster and Custard. To my surprise, I am not only ten minutes late, but no one else has tuned up yet… Toaster turns up next to my surprise, quickly followed by the lovely Princesses Kate. Who not only put up with me for the entire night, but actually remained on speaking terms with me after… Anyway, Drink ensues in a bar that caters for the sports fan. Football is on television. (for those Americans out there, Football is a game you call Soccer, You know, the game you use your foot and a ball as the main game constituents? Much like American Football where you pick up the ball and run. Except for the picking up the ball part.) After a few pints, (those of you that are Australian, that’s a couple of Jars per Pint, We are multi national here) Custard and Baity both turn up. To my surprise Kate hasn’t made her excuses yet to leave. Which makes me feel a little uncomfortable. Knowing someone’s life from a web page before meeting them made me feel like a Stalker of sorts… Which I am not. Except for the going through your garbage bit…. Kate reminds me much of the only other Canadian person I ever met. The same one that let me share a bedroom with her and her best (female) friend one night. That night happened to be after Custards 21st party, I was blond.. Oh and Psycho also shared the bedroom. Anyhoo. She was nice too. And if Andy is anything to go by, I think Canadians will feature on my all time nice people to speak to, along side the Aussies. Because they have my cousins there.  More Alcohol ensures and we end up in Follies. I was drunk. So drunk. So drunk that I danced That’s bad. I cant dance. Kate sait “Im gonna have to find you a woman” I laughed. Andrew Arnold hasn’t got engaged again, so how am I supposed to get a girl. ( that’s because I did a hat trick. Sleeping with all three of his fiancées. None of which were going out with him at the time. Except for the middle one. Who got engaged even though she had been going out with me for a year and a half…) I saw my new boss and his girlfriend and understood why he is always late to work. I got drunker. Great night. I also apologise to the wonderful Liane, Andy and Princesses Kate, who have kept me amuse throughout my trials at work. I have not commented on your site for a while, even though, Big feet = big Socks, Kate, you didn’t upset me, it take a lot more, a hell of a  lot more than you are willing to do to me to upset me. Cross Blog posting is a thing that I am trying to cut down even though its been hard most of the time, I have also found it difficult not to post to you folks, but if you click on my name at the bottom of this post, it will give you my E-mail address :-) Im not sobering up quickly so I wil leave it there and regret what I have posted tomorrow. My Bosses last day (her last *Working* day was a couple of weeks ago) Ho humm...
