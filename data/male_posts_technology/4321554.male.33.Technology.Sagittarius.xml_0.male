Hellenic Wiccans Hellenic Reconstructionists Hellenic Traditionalists: a term in flux, characterized by detractors in various ways (which we should really put to bed).  HT can also be used in contrast with HR in the sense of reconstructionism being an activity.  Hellenion: an organization of which I am a member and in which I am taking on more responsibility. Hellenion is suffering from some identity issues which should be resolved in order for the organization to move forward in a well-founded way.  Has been called "too liberal", "too conservative", and "trying to be all things to all people". The last accusation should be better stated:  1. Define the term. 2. How does it apply to Hellenion? 3. Even if it's true and applies to us, is it really all that bad?  OSNT has been called too inaccurate to recommend to newbies. Perhaps a good way to put this to bed is to recruit the detractors, asking them to detail the complaints they have with the book.  Hellenic Wicca: By all reputable accounts, a 20th-century innovation. It seems based on WMT, masonry, etc. There's fair enough reason to see Wicca as an off-shoot of WMT with a polytheistic wrapper of sorts. Most Wicca do not appear to be "hard polytheists", but influenced by Jung, Joseph Campbell, etc. and see deity as archetype. Some of the particulars of Wiccan symbolism may stem from ancient Hellenic mystics, though. Wiccans who attempt to incorporate Hellenic deities as archetypes aren't going to be very popular with Recons, but we can benefit some of the more polytheistic Wiccans by providing research that can inform them.  Eclectics vs. dedicants of specific traditions: Eclectics may choose bits and pieces from traditions that seem to fit well together in their eyes. When eclectics are contrasted with recons, the recon will tend to lean toward a more holistic approach to a given cultural framework. Eclectics may be more likely to change fairly radically in view and practice over time, whereas recons will endeavor to become progressively more consistent in dealing with the specified cultural framework as more is learned and new research sheds new light on the subject matter.  Hellenic recons have a lot more to work with than some other recons who reconstruct cultures in which there was less literacy or from which less material survives today for various reasons.  We have to make decisions about whether we're going to reconstruct within our own cultural framework (animal sacrifice, women's rights, and pederasty being hot button points). Assuming we're going to do this, we have to deal with other issues, such as researching the ancient culture really well to transcend what Wittgenstein might call a "language game" separating ourselves from the ancient culture we're reconstructing.  Language Games: Even under the best of circumstances (face-to-face conversation between people sharing common language and culture), language games limit communication. The greater the divide between individuals (due to language, culture, etc.), the more severe the limitations placed upon communication, and the more challenging the reconstruction process. For instance, there are serious differences between an English-speaking 21st-century North American and an Attic-speaking Athenian from the era of Socrates, which present situations with which we simply need to come to terms. Most HR's I have encountered so far seem to have a basic respect for this.  Adopting antagonistic stances further complicates the process of communicating and reconstructing effectively.  Once one states a position, one becomes open to criticism and "Socratic" questioning. It might be tempting to turn the tables on the accusers, but this is generally not a good idea. Readers and viewers of this sort of thing can generally see the pettiness and egocentrism of it. A better solution is to extend xenia and hospitality to our detractors as much as possible, not as a strategy but to reinforce community. We're an amazingly small minority and should come together as opposed to further driving one another away. Differences need not imply divisiveness. A communitarian and inclusive approach, founded on mutual respect and humility before the gods is the way to go.  We need to beef up our programs such as Hymnodia and publish lots of practical material for people to use in their own study and practice. If our publications are criticized, we should accept the criticism. If the criticism is spurious, accept it as so and move on, but if there's something in it we can use to improve our work, let's be grateful for it and use it to enhance the integrity of our efforts.  More on culture: We have to be honest with ourselves about some of the realities we're dealing with. It is astonishingly difficult to reproduce an ancient culture with great precision, which does not imply that the effort lacks merit.  Some people rely more or less heavily on UPG, which is perfectly fine but presents challenges when it comes to persuading others of one's findings. If you don't present your findings as founded on good research, you need to rely on something else in argumentation, such as results of some kind.  Not everyone is going to go for your approach, no matter which approach you employ. Even if every single Recon on the planet does agree with you, we're a startlingly small fraction of the world's population. So ultimately I think it's really important to invest your energies and efforts in something important to you and in which you find satisfaction.
