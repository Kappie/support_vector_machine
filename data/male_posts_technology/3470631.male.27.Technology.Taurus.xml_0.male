Don Vito is on board with Lufkin and Lobron - RV arrangements need to be made asap. And when I say made - I mean Lobron - get your Credit Card out and rent us an RV bonus boy.   Can someone provide me with examples where a band of the magnitude of Phish had a farewell concert tour that culminated with a huge 2-day festival? Is this unprecedented? Am I overstating the significance of this event?   No. It will be life changing.   Last post before my Cross Country flight to San Fran tomorrow. I figured I'd state that I'm fully expecting it to be hijacked by a team of Arab hooligans. That way if it happens it would be historic that I documented it here a day before -- and I've never done anything historic in my life.  I just saved my life.
