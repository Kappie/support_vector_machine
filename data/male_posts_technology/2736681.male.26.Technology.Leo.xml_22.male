Anyway, his  urlLink latest post  is about practical implications of applying MDA, and is in some ways a followup to  urlLink Hayward's ideas  (which I've discussed  urlLink before , in some depth) about elaborationism vs translationism, but with a more practical perspective on the former. Its good to see someone posting about MDA without getting caught up in the terminology wars (what is MDA vs MDSD vs MDD vs DSM, what exactly is a PSM, PIM, CIM, etc).  Its interesting that he mentions the testing/debugging issues associated with MDA, in both elaborationist and translationist forms. I have been working on the testing aspect with  urlLink Franck , and we've submitted a paper on it to  urlLink ISSRE 04 .  Interestingly, although I've seen quite a bit of smoke about a clash between MDA (or IBM's approach thereto) and Microsoft's DSM, I suspect that there really isn't any fire within either IBM or MS. They both seem content to keep progressing along their respective trajectories, which is entirely as it should be. Of course, it would be nice if the two tool-suites could either interoperate or interchange at some point, but that's a secondary concern to actually get sophisticated tooling for model-driven, er, stuff (I don't want to offend the acronym-nazis).  Incidentally, Stuart was right on the money with  urlLink this post , too. I have long been a critic of the approach of using profiles as the only UML extension mechanism, after being bitten while helping try to squeeze the  urlLink EDOC language  (square peg) into a UML profile (round hole).
