Well that's what you call "appeasement"! With the peace talks between India and Pakistan taking big strides forward, suddenly the Hurriyat seems to have been rendered redundant! So its not unusual to see the Hurriyat cosying up to the Indian Government... primarily because they know that the Pakistani Government doesn't look to be too keen on continuing  to be pals with them!
