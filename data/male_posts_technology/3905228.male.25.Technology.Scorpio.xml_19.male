A  foreword from me : " I partly agree and mostly disagree " with this stuff. But  if U find it useful well and good.       Here it starts       RULES FROM MEN:     We always hear "the rules" from  the female side. Now   here are the rules  from the male side. These are our     rules! Please note these are all  numbered "1" ON   PURPOSE!     1. Sometimes we are not thinking  about you. Live with   it.     1. Don't cut your hair. Ever.  Long hair is always more attractive than short hair. One of the big reasons guys  fear getting married is that married women always cut their hair.     1. Shopping is NOT a  sport.     1. Crying is  blackmail.     1. Ask for what you want. Let us  be clear on this one:     Subtle hints do not work! Strong  hints do not work!Obvious hints do not work!     Just say it!     1. We don't remember dates. Mark  birthdays andanniversaries on a calendar. Remind us frequently   beforehand.     1. "Yes", and "No" are perfectly  acceptable answers to   almost every  question.     1. Come to us with a problem only  if you want help   solving it.     That's what we do. Sympathy is  what your   girlfriends are for.     1. Anything we said 6 months ago  is inadmissible in an argument.     In fact,all comments become null  and void after 24   hours.     1. If you think you're fat, you  probably are. Don't   ask us. We refuse to  answer.      1. If something we said  could be interpreted two ways;and one of the ways pisses you off,--- we meant  the      other one.     1. It is genetic for us to look  at women. Just deal   with it.     1. You can either ask us to do  something or tell us   how you want it done.  Not both. If you already know     best how to do it, just do it  yourself.     1. Christopher Columbus did not  need directions, and   neither do  we.     1. ALL men see in only 16  colours, like Windows   default  settings.     Peach, for example, is a fruit,  not a colour.     We have no idea what mauve  is.      1. We are not mind readers  and we never will be. Our   lack of  mind-reading ability is not proof of how       little we care  about you.     1. If we ask what is wrong and  you say "nothing," we   will take it as  truth.     We know you are lying, but it is  just not worth the   hassle.     1. When we have to go somewhere,  absolutely anything   you wear is fine  -Really.      1. Don't ask us what we're  thinking about unless you   are prepared to  discuss such topics as design of the       new V6 engine,  the shotgun formation, or monster    trucks.     1. You have enough clothes...You  have too many shoes.     1. It is neither in your best  interest or ours to take   the quiz  together.     No, it doesn't matter which  quiz.     1. I'm in shape. ROUND is a  shape.     Thank you for reading  this;
