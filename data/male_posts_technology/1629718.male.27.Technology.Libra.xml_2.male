Wake UP! Let us look @   urlLink Yahoo Oddly Enough News  And there's more where that crap came from.   Do yourself a favor..save the popcorn and 10 bucks it costs to see the damn movie and just head straight to the local jail... it works, and it's less expensive, after all we all enjoy prision food, and admitting were stupid right after a movie, that of all people, mel gibson (I do remember all his movies such as lethal weapon, etc, included VULGARITY), would produce. Let us think, its not about 'touching others' for free..it's about money, and if mel was so advertly a clearly christan man, he would be donating at least 3/4 to the churches...wait...I'm yet to see that....  Well more picking on others later... if you have any comments, by all means feel free to email me admin@wickeddreams.net and don't forget your movie pass.
