Not too shabby, some nice visuals, fairly dark but not so dark as to be impossible, not too crowded. So Joe, Daimo and I were there for about 1.5 hours and then Kate and Simon showed, followed not long after by Steph and 'Tine.   Pretty good, stayed there for a few rounds, then Joe and 'Tine went home and the rest of us headed off to St Jerome, which is one of Daimo's hangouts that I'd been keen to check out. Pretty cool, weird in that it's kind of leftover space, part inside, part outside under a tarp, part back laneway, part next building over. Not many bars have rain falling into part of them :).   Had some good Kate conversation, which was an essential part of the evening. The walk over consisting of a discussion about Melbourne and our bars that are up laneways. I think I'm not alone in thinking that a bar really needs to be in an obscure location to be cool ;) I mean if you can't find it then what makes you think you belong there! Just joking of course. I mean there's an element of tuth to it, in that a bar that's too popular can get too crowded or too hard to get into, so what's the point. Whereas the little out of the way places can usually manage to stay un-busy for a while.  So the night was a good one, some good conversation, and two cool bars added to the list. Kate's keen to go to Croft's, so we might have to go back there. I'm keen to see what the middle level looks like, as I haven't been there since they opened it up. Hopefully Boze is still on the door so we won't have any hassles.  Anyway, that's it for today. S
