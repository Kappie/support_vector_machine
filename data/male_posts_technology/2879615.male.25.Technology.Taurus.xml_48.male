And don't forget the Doug Birthday Dance me Yastine and la tried to come up with...and then it turned into the electric slide! "mmmm mmm m mmmmmmm m It's ELECTRIC! mmm mm mmm mm mmm" Hell yeah pop the shoulders.  Also, craig jumping on furniture and screaming in everyone's face while thoroughly bonding with an absolutely HAMMERED Doug.  And also Craig trying to pose me and la and yast in a "sexy" tongue pose. Mmmm thanks for the experience Mr. Craig.  Beware the Cave of Downward Spiral of Confusion  Can we get a REGIME CHANGE?!  defeat bush '04  vote.  Smashley T. Rustmee
