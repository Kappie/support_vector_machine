Two people one old man and one younger, crack-whorish, looking woman got into a heated debate that ended with both parties walking down the road a block and entering the local law offices of H.D. Pate just before the cops showed up.  The woman was histerical and screaming, "Mark, please don't leave me!!  I don't want to go to jail!  I can't BREATHE!  I can't BREATHE!  I can't BREATHE!"  and falls on her butt, gets up and follows after the older gentleman, think of an elderly trucker with crazy eyes, around the corner to the law firm.  It's things like that that makes working here sooo nice!! lol  =)
