I went to the 2003 Philadelphia International Auto Show and I sat in a new 2003 VW Beetle Convertible.  I liked it.  It was cheap.  I bought it.  Check  urlLink  here  to see how it went at first.  Anyway, after my initial problems, I started getting grief from some friends about the "masculinity" of my choice.  Well, I kind of expected that.  But, I'm married with 4 kids.  What do I care?  I just keep the flower vase thingy in the dashboard filled with a cigar.  Its not much, but it helps.  Then the cherry topping was a friend who said, "Oh, it's not gay... but it IS liberal!"  Well, I also failed to mention that I work in Princeton, NJ.  That's East Coast Hippie Central!  Oh they just all LOVE my new Beetle.  So then I got an idea!  I'm really an undercover hippie!  They think I'm one of them!  ...  and then I had to go and ruin it all by putting on a  urlLink Viva Bush  bumper sticker.  But you should see the looks of complete confusion I get while driving through East Coast Hippie Central!
