Ilayaraaja the ultimate man....enthusiastic music in Kamal's "Virumaandi" (Sandiyar)...  All songs are good...of all the songs, this one "Kombumela poova suthi..." Nice to hear a mix of great beat and rhythmic lyric...let us wait to see the film...  Imm sindhu after a short while... what about others...ganesh, valli, rajesh,  vijay....
