Got her shit from her car and went to Best Buy to pickup Jerry's PCI wirelss card (802.11b).  We then proceeded to Fuddruckers.  Damn good burgers.  *hungry*  Yeah nice 1/2 pound burgers.  Damn it was good.  Juicy medium cooked burgers that was just sooooo good.  We went back to my house to pick some shit up to bring back to the apartment and set stuff up.  Got to the new home and setup tried to set up the wireless network.  That was fun.  We actually had it right the first time but we fucked a bit and got it all screwed up.  Meghan was watching, that was cool.  What a nerd.  She learned though and pointed out the mistake that we made the first time around because we couldn't get back into the thing so we pressed the reset button and logged back in as admin and it worked.  So now we have a wireless network here and it works perfectly!  The wireless router is also working perfectly as we were able to secure it accordingly and only allow the "known" MAC addresses to be able to connect.  Currently the thing is sitting underneath my bed and it shall stay there because it works.  After we got that shit and I am now able to be online, we went and saw The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  What a movie.  It was good.  That's all I gotta say about it.  Just watch it.  It's kinda sad but hopeful at the same time.  Definitely worth the price of a movie ticket.  I think I might purchase it on DVD as well.  Good movie.  Jim C. displayed good acting ability as well as Kate Winslette.  She was kinda goofy looking as a "punk rocker" bookstore clerk stereotype character because she is just a classic beauty but it worked at times and didn't distract me from watching the movie.  Elijah Wood's character was creepy.  Good movie, definitely a good movie.  Came back and just hung out for a while before going to bed.  Saturday - Got up around 10-ish but really got out of bed around noon.  Plans were to go to the  urlLink Art Institute of Chicago .  We wasted away till noon that was fun.  Got out of bed and ate some reheated fries from Fuddruckers that was good.  McDonalds was also calling my name so we had some of that on the way downtown.  Drove around the city, it was a gorgeous day, absolutely gorgeous!  Sun was out, no clouds (car wasn't clean though) warm except for the wind but overall it was a great day in Chicago.  Drove around and looked for a parking garage to spend $20 to park for a few hours but was unseccesful.  Drove up Randolph and turned left on Wells (right underneath the EL) and found a car leaving a spot.  Immeadiately turned on the turning signals to park there for FREE!  Yes free, saved $20 and parked for free.  Now Mind you that was a long walk to Michigan Ave but it was worth it since it was a nice day and damn it's fucking free!  We got to the Museum and there was some sort of line but there was a bunch of people beating some drums to some crazy ass beat, that was entertaining but I also felt bad for the old Chinese guy playing "Danny Boy" on the violin.  He was getting drowned out by these kids.  Oh well.  We got in and got the tickets and proceeded to find where they take the tickets from you.  We got to the gate and walked right on by.  We were kinda walking side by side with this professor/curator or something and the people just assumed that we were with the old guy.  They never took the tickets.  Too bad those things were dated, we could definitely use them again in the future because the damn place was huge and we didn't even get through a quarter of the place.  Definitely have to go back and chill there.  One word, AWESOME!  Found out that my favorite artist is Tanguy and his art falls under surrealism.  I never knew that I liked art.  It hold's you for a second and lets out emotions and feelings that only certain paintings can.  It draws you like a magnet attracting iron shavings closer and closer.  His work is in the same catergory as Dali but I think I am more in tune with what Tanguy was showing.  We saw some Max Earnst, Rothko, Pollock.  Just absolutely good shit.  Good shit.  Good shit.  I can't wait to go back and see those paintings again and looks at the other stuff.  Wow.  I definitely a fan of the museum now.  I could just go back and back and back and back there and just chill out, hang out, relax.  Shit.  IT was that good!  *SIGH*  That fucking good.  We left because they close at 5 that day but whatever, it's another place to go to, another place to back to.  I can't belive that I am gushing over art.  Who woulda known?  We took a somewhat legnthy walk to the Lake and hung out there for a while.  It was nice, blue water, no one around to disturb us, seagulls (or Sea Cats I guess they are called in Japanese) were everywhere but it was fine until it got colder than bearable.  We went to Dunkin Donuts but no one was there so we went to Starbucks and got some shit to warm us up.  Proceeded on home and rented Ferris Beuller's Day Off at the local Blockbuster and watched that eating Hungry Howie's pizza.  Good stuff.  Fell asleep kinda early cuz of the walking and got up kinda early as well.  What a great day!  Sunday - Woke up and ate left over pizza.  Showered and went to Mitsuwa.  Meghan was super excited because her mission was to peruse and purchase some "little girl" manga for herself to read.  She bought a bunch.  It was cute.  Ate some chicken from the food court but that wasn't filling at all.  Came home and she did her homework and we read.  She read her recently purchased manga as I flipped through the pages of Murakami's After The Quake.  It's a good read, not done with it yet but next up is The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera.  The latter of the books is purpotedly a good read so I want to finish this one that I am reading and start reading the next one.  We just hung out at the new apartment because no one was home so it was definitely some needed good "down time"  People got back and were watching TV.  We were talking about things.  Mark P called and we talked for a little while (Yes Mark, there is more than friendship).  She left for MI and that's what happened to my weekend.  It was good, real good!  Here are a couple of pics
