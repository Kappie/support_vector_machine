In the deepest of my dreams, 'midst the shadows of my thoughts, it whispers soft and true"it is I".   Though I fight it long and hardknowing it's against my will, and the feelings deep inside I push away.   The fight is won already as the whispers call upon me, "Come meet your kindred spirit.It is I."   In the hand that touches my hand; in the thoughts that twine with mine; in the eyes that see right through me, touching deep within my soul.  All the thoughts and simple feelings  shared by two- so close- now one.  Deep within my sheltered conscience  winds of knowledge whisper through me,  "You have found your kindred spirit...It is I."
