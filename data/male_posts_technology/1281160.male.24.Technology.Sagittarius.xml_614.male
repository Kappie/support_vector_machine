The Tamil Nadu Government is turning a welcome shade of green with Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa announcing a series of measures to protect animals and the environment.  From banning animal sacrifice and protecting elephants to cleaning Chennai's famed Marina Beach and enforcing rainwater systems in every house, Jayalalithaa is doing it all.  And most of it has happened in the last fortnight alone.  The immediate provocation for banning animal sacrifice came from a complaint about 500 buffaloes being "sacrificed to God" in a village in Tiruchirapalli district with senior police officials watching.  "A ban is already in force under the Tamil Nadu Animals and Birds Prevention of Sacrifice Act of 1950. However, the provisions of the Act are often breached. Therefore, people should be educated not to do so," said a letter from the Chief Minister to district heads.  She also ordered that the senior police official present at the spot be suspended.  For political expediency or otherwise, Jayalalitha has supported the proposed federal legislation for a ban on cow slaughter.  Responding to reports of a temple elephant running amok and injuring its mahout because it was "too stressed out" and another being forced to beg on Chennai streets, Jayalalitha took several corrective measures to "de-stress" captive pachyderms.  Elephants used and kept in Tamil Nadu's temples have been granted a holiday for the first time in their lives. Moreover, the government has ordered that all temple elephants be kept in a camp for one month in a year.  The one-month camp would not only be a holiday but also an occasion for an annual compulsory health check up.  Jayalalitha has asked officials to ensure that all 41 temple elephants in Tamil Nadu temples, on government records, are taken to the rest camps.  Besides, a coordination committee with representatives from the government and the temples have been entrusted with the task of identifying distressed elephants.  And there is still more.  To take tips on how to go about the job, a special team of experts has been formed to study protection and healthcare measures for elephants in Guruvayur temple in neighbouring Kerala.  On another front, the Jayalalitha government's environment activism has resulted in a compulsory rainwater harvesting system in every building in Tamil Nadu.  The deadline for implementation is August 31. If buildings don't comply, municipalities will enforce the system and cut fresh water connections from the corporations.  The Marina beach in Chennai too has been cleaned up vigorously by the civic authorities, which even demolished all old structures on the beach last week.  Enforcement agencies would keep a vigil to ensure that people don't litter the beach.  The government has this week also come out with a notice to fishermen asking them to confine fishing only to specially demarcated areas.  The department of fisheries held a meeting this week to give notice to the millions of fishermen working in the state's 1,000-km coastline through the Tamil Nadu Fishermen's Union.  Besides, the government has been working at Tamil Nadu's largest vegetable wholesale market on the outskirts of Chennai to generate 5,000 units of power every day from bio-waste.  To be set up at a cost of Rs 5 crore, the plant would supply power to the market itself. This bio-methanon plant would be supported by the ministry of non-conventional energy and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  Another pet project is Enviro Vision 2005 set up to monitor the quality of air, water and land resource in Tamil Nadu as part of a 15-point agenda for development.  A federal grant of Rs 492 crore is being used to clean up Chennai's five canals and rivers.  When complete, the city river conservation project will help plug the 422 outlets into the waterways flowing through Chennai.  A Rs 37 crore project to stop sewage flow into the Cauvery river is also being implemented.  Many more plans are expected
