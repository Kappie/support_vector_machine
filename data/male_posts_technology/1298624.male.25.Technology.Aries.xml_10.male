They even tried to call up Frys (because I didn't have the price listing with me) and they said "Fuck it" and gave me the price. I'm so happy because this game is seriously awesome! I spent almost 6 hours this weekend going through the story and checking everything out. When this game comes out for PC, it's going to be so awesome.  On another note, Luigi came by on Sunday. It was good seeing him again.
