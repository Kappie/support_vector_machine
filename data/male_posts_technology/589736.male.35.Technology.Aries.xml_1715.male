Visit apple.com for details.   ok, i'll bite - is anyone else in this group planning to buy songs from the apple site rather than just continue to download them for free from the p2p networks?  c'mon, i know all of you have stolen your share of mp3s at this point; why stop now?  the only users getting targetted by the RIAA are the ones sharing out the huge catalogs of songs.  as innovative as this apple thing may appear, i'm hoping it's just a beta test for what's to come; namely: artists over the next few years allowing their contracts with the record companies to run out, and then start selling their music directly to the net from their own sites.  now, *that's* the sort of music i would pay for - my $ would go straight to the band, not some musical megacorp that pushes us to buy overpriced crap product designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator.
