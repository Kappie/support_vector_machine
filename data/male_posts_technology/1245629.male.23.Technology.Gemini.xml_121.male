But got those forms few weeks back from the payroll folks, put them in my desk,locked. Got a mail that I need to submit it again. After a couple of days, I went a submitted it to the Ken Consulting fella here. Yeah, one job over. But I dont understand it yet. :)  Btw, for my reference my PAN Card number is   AAGPO1627H   ( hope next time I need it, I should be able to google for it)
