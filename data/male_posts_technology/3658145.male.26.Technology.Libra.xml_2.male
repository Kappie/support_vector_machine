Where Do I begin oh well here goes How bout them Pistons   Having said that I will now give you my take on the game all games last night Shaquille Oneal's Last Stand  Well truth be told I never can watch a whole NBA game just never have been a a true 82 game fan but I decide to call a few friends over to "Casa De Wooten" (for those of you who don't know what that is its my apartment here in Albany) After going and making a run for the border and picking up some tacos, I come back and flip on Abc to see whats going on with the game and who are the the two people in the crowd that have actually done something for the music industry in the last 5 years and not 25years Detriot's Own Kid Rock, who I will see one day live might have to rob a bank to go but i will get there Might have to drag my trusty sidekick steveo with me but he will most likely come.  The camera pans to Kid's right and who do you think is sitting on his right  A true Country Singer Hank I hope I dont have to say his last name but in case I do for those of you who dont follow Country music Hank Williams Jr was there!!!  Lets see Jack Nickalson compete with those two!!  I dont think so he was his old pissed off self last night almost fell out laughing at him. Glad to see the Pistons win a championship they havent won one since 1990 thats longer than me and my sidekicks been I alive was in 8th grade at Center Jr High the last time they won!!  That is my take on the game from a slightly mechanically advantaged point of view   Woo10
