It takes place in a village around 1900. The village is surrounded by a forest. The villagers are forbidden to go there, because of the creatures who dwells there (called "Those We Do Not Speak Of"). If the villagers stay out of the forest, the creatures won't disturb them. The village is isolated and that's the way the inhabitants want it - the towns, they believe, are filled with sin, greed, rape and murder.  Newcomer  urlLink Bryce Dallas Howard  plays Ivy, the blind daughter of  urlLink William Hurt 's character who is the leader of the village. Ivy is in love with  urlLink Joaquin Phoenix ' character, a quiet boy who seeks permission to travel through the woods to the nearest town to get medicine. His mother is played by  urlLink Sigourney Weaver , a village elder who has feelings for Ivy's father. Ivy is the village teacher and one of her students are the town idiot, played by  urlLink Adrian Brody , who also has a thing for Ivy.  Strange things are happening in the village. Dogs turn up skinned and one night one of the creatures enter the village and scares everyone. Something must have angered them, someone must have entered their territory.  There are many good things about this movie. The aforementioned actors are good and make their characters and their actions seem believable. The explanation of the creatures, when it comes, is not shocking, but a logical way to explain matters. This is good as the "explanation point" is usually the weak point of Shyamalan's movies - a bad one can ruin the movie, like it did in  urlLink Unbreakable .  Despite these good things, it somehow doesn't add up to something great, just to something okay.    -->
