They were quite unresponsive and rude at times too. Now, I can take cheekiness to a certain extent. In addition, I allowed them to be on the Net for most part of the class. Wrong decision, they can't even concentrate on the task at hand. Very poor participation. Worse still, at the end of class, I found scraps of paper on the floor, on the table and spilled drinks. And no one bothered to clean it up. Such irresponsible behavior is totally unacceptable.  When they came back to class this morning, I wanted to overlook the mess they made yesterday but they started making so much noise. I had to step in, scold and lecture them. I know these are good kids, but sometimes I find that I really need to remind them of their place. At least now they are busy producing the video work I want them to. All I want, is for them to have fun and learn something out of the whole thing.   2nd Class Yesterday   The second class was a lot more fun and responsive. AT least they produced some really really good work and appeared more interested. But this afternoon, they were a bit more noisy and some of them didn't listen to the specific instructions I told them - no Internet until work is done. Had to raise my voice at them again. Today is a seriously tiring day. I feel very taxed even during lunch time. Will probably be able to get a good sleep later on the bus journey to BVCC for Aikido. Hope tonight's training will be a good one.  Another incident yesterday afternoon occured around 5pm. Classes had just ended for me and Daphne and the school auntie came to knock on our door informing us that she was locking up. I reeeeeeeeeally hate the kanchiong attitude I saw, comparable to the 'kanchiong spiders' in NS - what we'd call people who were rushing and panicky about stuff and always wanting to go home early etc. Just wanted to point out that things like off and early release is a PRIVILEGE!! NOT an entitlement. This policy in NS stands whether we're in NS, govt or pte sector of work. Just wish some folks will understand that.
