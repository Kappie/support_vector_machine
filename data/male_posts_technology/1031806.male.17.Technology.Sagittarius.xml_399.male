(you can find the latest version  urlLink here )                                                                                On Monday I went up to Brady's house for what was supposed to be another going-away party for Peter, but alas, Peter himself could not make it. (LOL) Anyway, Pat, Brady, Cori and I just hung out for a while. That was pretty fun. While I was up there, I tried to dl that fireworks video from last post and decided that I wanted to make a short video of just the cooler stuff fireworks that we set off this weekend, so here it is:  Cool fireworks (1:53)  urlLink divx 12.8Mb   Then, yesterday (the 6th... I haven't slept tonight - still consider today the 7th) James 'became a number'. LOL He joined the Navy... Jen, MJ, Melissa, Darren and I went to MEPS to meet him and his gf, Jessica, and went with him to the airport to see him off.                                             Andrew and I were talking afterward and apparently he still is really thinking about going SEAL... the only issue is his eyes, but he prolly can get Lasic surgery. I've got the same problem as far as joining the SEALs, and we're both thinking that if the draft does get re-instated next year that we're going to enlist.  Today, I woke up really late for some reason... totally missed summer school (lol). I went to my math teacher's house for a party with my Calc class at 7pm. It was to finish watching LotR RotK, we'd finished the class early and were trying to watch all three movies before school was out, but we didn't make it in time, so Miss O, being the awsome teacher she is, invited us over to finish it. Everyone but Gwen and Danie came (we had a small class).
