I had to pay $200 on top, but at least I didn't forfeit my original fare of $400. Now THAT would have been really annoying...  Right now I'm sitting in the netcafe underneath McDonald's on George St trying to waste some time before I attend this launch of  urlLink Maya 6  at Hoyts across the road. The software was used in the movie, "The Day After Tomorrow" (and countless others), and we get a free screening of the aforementioned movie after the launch. Not bad, huh? :)
