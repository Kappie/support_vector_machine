So how to make an application which acts to send a document to a web client such as web browser always download the document rather open it?  There is a simple way to do that by using   content-type: application/octet-stream   HTTP header instead of using proper MIME-TYPE content-type for a web document to be sent. Most web browsers will downloaded a web document with this content-type including MSIE.
