I was at the Topanga Plaza (a Mall in the San Fernando Valley thats probably called something else by now) and it was night time.  Some basketball player/star had given me a rubber/toy basketball and I was bouncing it outside the Trader Joe's entrance area.. then I got another one from another player/star and it was bigger and I couldn't keep control of both of them.  Thats all I remember.  Weird.   I should mention the first really weird dream I had the other day.  This was the first dream I can remember in quite some time.  There was a band playing at some warehouse type place and I think my pal Gus was in it.  I remember being all stoked that FIVE horn players had shown up to play that night... I guess it was kind of a jam session or something, anyway I then went 'out back' behind the warehouse/store whatever (it was like being behind a mini-mall or something) and there were these guys that were sorta sky-writing... but the letters were on strings or cables, sorta like the banner that flys behind a plane, but the guys sorta threw the letters into the air by hand. (very weird) THEN, there was this cute (iirc) chick, getting hasseled by cop(s), and I was consoling her... and she starting to like nuzzle my cheek and stuff and I was all, 'uh uh, I'm married' and I showed her my ring.  I was so proud of myself... I turned her (a cute chicky) down, EVEN IN A DREAM!  Now, on the job front... Had a meet-n-greet @ Robert Half yesterday.  Met with a nice enough bloke and took a Delphi 5 eval test.  I got a 55, which might not seem too good, but if I read the results correctly, the top scores were only 64(ish), so given a/the curve, I think I did great!  They might have a Delphi gig for me.  I'm also still in touch with another Company in Santa Ana and am awaiting a 2nd interview.  There might also be a C++Builder position in Marina Del Rey!  Needless to say, I'd LOVE to have 2+ offers to choose from.  I know there was more I wanted to say, but can't think of it now so will just have to close for now.  Later dudes.  ;P
