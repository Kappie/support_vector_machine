The little bugger has scratched the fuck out of my shiny new, sweet smelling lemon coloured sofa. He's been here nearly a month and now it looks like the crap  urlLink Mr Men  character, Mr Messy. We decided to give him a try on the balcony, to see how he got on. Supervised, he made his first little steps out into the fresh summer afternoon. Later on, he'd try it again and (as I have found cats do for no reason) cacked his feline panties and bolted, head first, into the glass door. It made a impressive sound considering his size, I thought he might have brained himself but luckily he seems just as nuts as normal. We have been giving him steroids for his dodgy eye and it's started to clean up well.  My only complaint today is the utterly vile, completely evil stench that exuded from his dirt box when I got home. He eats the exact same food every day, normally his poop is fine. Today it made my eyes melt and my lungs shrivel up and beg for mercy.   Friday night is curry night boys. Call me for details if you're down with it.
