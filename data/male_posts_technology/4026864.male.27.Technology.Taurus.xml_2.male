Slut  Ok this is how my day started. I woke up 50 minutes late forcing me to rush to get ready for work. I was unable to walk in the AM to work from the train because I would then be behind in time. Of course this happens when it is 65 degrees and a beautiful day for a walk! I get here (on time) and things keep going down hill.  I cannot understand my boss. I bust my ass to keep up with my job and provide the best in customer support, so why can he be such a dick sometimes? There is no need to pop attitude with me!   I guess that is one thing many will never understand about me...if you pop attitude you piss me off. If you act respectful I'll do whatever is necessary to get the job done.  I am recovering from my disasterous night with very little sleep (highlights were the ne Dead Like Me and Arrested Development). My head still feels groggy and I think in some sense it could have something to do with removing myself from Zoloft. I hope that this feeling eventually stops.   Well...back to work. I am going to pop on the headphones and zone out.
