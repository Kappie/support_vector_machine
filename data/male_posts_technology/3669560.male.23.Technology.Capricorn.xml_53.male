Movie Review? Wuzzuh . . . He wasn't that poorly shaven in Collateral [these are the banal conversations I have with myself], and that only opened up a week ago . . . there's something fishy going on . . .   It turns out his new movie, or rather,   newest     movie  , is called  urlLink We Don't Live Here Anymore  (reg. req.).  That makes  urlLink four movies  this year and three last year. That's a staggering number. So far, he's given varied and insightful roles in all of them. He wasn't even that bad in A View From the Top, which I watched under the threat of some   serious relationship terrorism   (unlike our country as a whole, my terror level stays at orange most of the time). I also missed 13 going on 30, so if anyone would like to comment on that movie, I'll probably figure out a way to ban your IP.  I can't wait for  We Don't Live Here Anymore . It opens this weekend, but only in New York and LA. Let me know if anyone knows anything more about release dates. Mike, let me know if you get off your ass to see it.
