I thought "That'd be easy(ish) to monitor and shut down the servers".  But after some random searching last week I stumbled on an idea.  If you do a search (on google) for sohardtopicksn@aol.com you get dozens of message-board/feedback-form hits.  The 'email address' appears on hundreds of unrelated sites.  The content of the posting is apparently garbage.   Redundancy   One of the principle design goals of the Internet was  Be resiliant to an attack or outage to a single node .  Meaning someone can take-out one router or cable and the US gov doesn't loose it's comms network - all installations/nodes are still accessible.  Traffic that would ideally go over the link just taken out uses an alternative path.    This is redundancy.  Hmmm, those sohardtopicksn@aol.com messages have a similar level of redundancy.  You have clean-up dozens of notice boards if you want to prevent the 'message' getting through.   Crypography   When you don't want someone to read your messages  cryptography  is a way to 'scramble' the message in a way that makes it (approx) impossible to read.    The US gov doesn't want us to have access to strong cryptography - they want to be able to crack the 'scambling' on our messages.  They want the ability to read them when they think we're terrorists.    My buddies at the EFF ( urlLink http://www.eff.org ) don't like that idea - they think we all have the right to privacy and must be allowed to use strong crypto to protect our love letters.  Those seemingly garbled messages sent by sohardtopicksn@aol.com  might  actually be encrypteed texts.      Ergo    Pissed-off individual    + Message boards    + Redunndancy    + Cryptography       =  Co-ordinating a terror attack ?     Conclusions   Maybe the US government is right to restrict access to strong cryptography.  Perhaps they do need a backdoor to unlock and read our love letters.    Lame    Perhaps people who run newsgroups / discussion groups / blogs should remove all the garbage messages that are on the list.  Don't be so lazy and untidy with your lists.  Don't just assume it's a message that got "mangled" in transit.     Better    FYI: messages can't get mangled in transit with  IP+TCP+HTTP transport.
