It really is a good deal of fun and I like hanging out with them and mentoring them (although much more of the former happens than the later).  This weekend we did a BBQ in a park with like 6 other churches.  It was an awesome time.  We had a couple bands singing, lots of food going, and Preach-off with all the Youth leaders.  It was just really neat to hang out with everybody in a public place and eat, play, and praise god.    I think people tend to lock their faith into whatever building they worship in, and that’s kinda sad.  People should be free to express themselves where ever they are, and people should allow others to express themselves, even if they disagree.  That’s really what being an American is all about I think.
