Oh yeah, and can't produce all of them when confronted by the FBI. ( urlLink Link to AP story )    Good luck knowing about this if you read Tuesday's  NY Times . Somehow  urlLink their article  about the matter, authored by Mark Glassman, neglects to mention his association with Kerry, his attempt to conceal his removal of the documents -- why else would he have placed them in his clothing instead of with the rest of the documents he was carrying -- or, by his own admission, the fact that all the documents were returned. In fact, rather than omit the matter entirely, Glassman uses Sandy Berger's lawyer's comments to spin an impression that all the documents were indeed returned:   Mr. Berger returned all of the documents and notes to the archives in October, within a week of his learning they were missing, his lawyers said. Odd...Sandy Berger himself doesn't even make that claim. From the AP account by John Solomon:    "When I was informed by the Archives that there were documents missing, I immediately returned everything I had except for a few documents that I apparently had accidently discarded," he said.   Whew, sure glad he's on the ball when it comes to national security!    So, is this a new low for the  NY Times , or just par for the course?
