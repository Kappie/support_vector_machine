Last year around this time, I moved out of my apartment at Alexan thinking I was on my way to the greener pastures of Northern VA. I moved my stuff from my apartment into a moving truck and drove it down to Reston where I was promptly jerked back by my boss' boss. That was a good $800 lost, but more importantly it turned my whole life on its end. Most importantly, I had to scramble for a new place to live. I finally settled into a room where I had no AC in oft scoffed Central Islip. I was in a small bedroom in a run down house with nothing but my TV (with no Cable), my computer (with no Internet), and my clothes. That had to be the worst three months of existing of my short life. Things were so backwards that I started changing other things in my life. I started shopping at different grocery stores. I parked on the other side of the building at work. Why not change every last detail of my life?
 
 Well now, a year later, I find my life equally, if not even more upside down than last time. Now, not only am I changing residences, I'm also changing my job location, I'm changing my job responsibilities, I'm hanging out with different people, I'm buying a house, and my Grandfather's getting remarried. Yeah, that's right. My Grandfather's getting remarried. I'll tell you about that a little later. To the point, nothing is the same in my life as it was just two short weeks ago. And that's okay. I have to go through this chaos to get what I want -- a nice, relaxed life in the great Commonwealth of Virginia. And you'd better believe I'm going to enjoy it after the dust settles. Wouldn't you?
