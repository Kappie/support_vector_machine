We spent it at Gifford Pinchot State Park, which it turns out has mutant sized carpenter bees, and is within the "blast radius" of Three Mile Island.  ROCK!  The place was wonderful.  It was green, it was warm, and I got to poke a fire with a stick.  What more can a guy ask for.  We also had a great group of people.  The Millers met us from Ohio and brought Jabe, he is still officially the cutest little boy on earth.  Also in attendance were Beauchamp and Danielle, Fico and Betsy,  Jordan and Kate, Heather and Chuck, and BItta.  Unfortunatly Caitlin had to bail last minute.  BOO!  We had a blast doing things like : Bocce.  Kickball.  Touch Football.  Hiking. Finding Dead Fish. (pictures to follow when i get a copy).  Poking a fire with a stick.  Sleeping.   Beer.  Seriously you dont know how much you miss nature and the smell of the woods and its noises until you go back into them and wonder why you live in the city at all.   GREAT weekend.  Pics to follow sometime.
