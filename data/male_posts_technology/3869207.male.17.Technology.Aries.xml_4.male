Its been really cool up here in Storm Lake so far, the kids I'm here with are  really  cool, and we've been having a good time. We do stuff like go classes about leadership, do team building activities, and yesterday we even went to boji bay together. I'm really enjoying it here, but it'll be good to get back too, so until then, peace!
