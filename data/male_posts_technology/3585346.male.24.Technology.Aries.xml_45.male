Trying to learn something for nothing or learn something to do something when I have yet to settle with what I really want to do.  It may sound stupid but I remember i got this customer that tell me you never know what you will end up doing and bring your success nearer to you. Just hang in there and think of something. Hanging in there doing nothing will not help any further.  I mean at least I did do something today but it does not seems enough to me at all.  Lost is the word? I am asking.
