I'm a 27 year old computer geek working at the University of Arkansas. (Please hold all "Arkansas has  computers ?!?" comments.) Once upon a time, I was a US Army communications specialist, which, combined with a healthy love for video gaming, helped me become the geek I am today. Since leaving the Army, my views on politics and things like that have shifted very far left. I don't have any political affiliations, but if I had to pick a party, it would be Libertarian. I would be very happy to see the current 2 party system crumble. I think it's a waste of time. We should be evaluating the  candidate  not the party, because in the end, it's not the party doing pre-emptive strikes on other nations, is it? Anyway, stick around for political rants and general nastiness.    Check back in a few days, and if I haven't posted anything,  urlLink tell me .
