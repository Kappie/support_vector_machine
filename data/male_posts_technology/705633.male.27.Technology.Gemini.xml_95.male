We hadn't been seeing each other long, about two months.. but I was really happy with the time we spent together and I am gutted now it's over.  I have used this site for funny jpg's and jokes but it was originally intented as a kind of 'online journal'. I don't know who would care to read about the events in my life (apart from the people that know me maybe) but people have been reading, which is kinda cool.  The older I get (and hopefully a little bit wiser too) the more I believe that people come into your life and leave for a reason.  You can't hold too tight to somebody or something, because it's never really yours. You're born alone and you will die alone, it's sad but true.  Maybe I worried too much about the future and didn't enjoy the present moment as much as I could have.  Thanks to Baity  Custard for being great buddies and getting me drunk at the weekend to drown my sorrows.  I'm going to sign off now, before this sounds anymore like Jerry Springer's Final Thought.
