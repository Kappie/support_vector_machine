Its not that Hellboy is a bad movie its just that its not the movie it could have been. While Del torro has done a decent job of characterizing the main protagonist the other characters unfortunately do not get the same treatment, which doesn’t leave us with many hooks to attach ourselves to the characters or the movie.  Did I enjoy the movie though? Sure, whats not to like? There’s a big red demon with a stone hand and snappy one-liners, a human fish with ESP, a pretty lady who bursts into flames, a whole bunch of nice Fx and some decent monsters.  The villans though just didn’t come out as dangerous enough and the final battle simply wasn’t apocalyptic enough. Something you sort of expect in a comic book movie.  All in all it’s a fun movie with just a little less bang than I would have hoped for.
