The President of the United States of America is a moron. I am totally convinced the reason they cart him about in a car with blacked out windows is because if they didn't, the people of America would see their most powerful man either licking the window with a glazed look in his eyes or reading his Calvin and Hobbes comic book.  I wonder how someone with his mental prowess managed to get so powerful, maybe when he was younger he applied for the post of village idiot but filled in the wrong form and ended up as a senator. At least the British Leader has an iota of sense in his inflated head. In this age of increasing strife and melting pot politics isn't it reassuring to read the supposed 'most powerful man alive' say at a meeting "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful - and so are we, they never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people - and neither do we"  you think that was a one off? We all makes gaffes from time to time, but this man really takes the biscuit (or should that be pretzel). Look up "bushisms" in google, go on, right now I can wait a minute....      done it?      can you BELIEVE some of that stuff? I wouldn't let this guy open a tin of beans for me, nevermind run a country. Do you see many hits for blairisms or *insert random head of state here*  isms? No, whys that do you think? Its because normally when people vote for people they choose fully functional human beings with the ability to rule a nation and hopefully string a coherent sentence together.      That "I know something you don't know" smirk irritates me too. So what mister bigshot, so you know the truth behind area 51 and are privy to all manner of juicy intelligence. At least we can count to 51, at least we know what the hell privy means and above all else, we HAVE intelligence, well some of us do anyway.       I read the other day that a lot of Americans actually find these kind of qualities endearing. It makes him "normal". Since when have leaders been normal, you look around on a bus on the way to work, that's a group of normal people, see that guy reading the paper with the bits of tissue stuck to his chin, that's normal, but would you want him running your country? No, me neither.       I am sorry if I have offended any Americans out there by dissing your number one man, but lets be honest, the guy is a schmuck.
