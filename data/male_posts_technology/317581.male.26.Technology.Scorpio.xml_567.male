I think that there's probably a lot of money out there to be made off singles that are so socially awkward they're paying a website to help them find a match. (OK, OK, I have done the eharmony stuff in the past)  I don't know what I'm saying, maybe that there's lots of single folks out there and if they were out having fun, they might meet each other, instead of sitting at home in front of their computers... But really I'm just full of shit... Peace- T
