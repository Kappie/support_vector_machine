Somebody save me Let your warm hands break right through Somebody save me I don't care how you do it Just stay (stay with me) Stay C'mon, I've been waiting for you  I see the world as folded in your heart I feel the waves crash down inside And they pull me under I will give you anything you want, oh You are all I wanted All my dreams have fallen down Crawling around...  Somebody save me Let your warm hands break right through Somebody save me I don't care how you do it Just stay (stay with me) Stay C'mon, I've been waiting for you  All my dreams are on the ground Crawling around...  Somebody save me Let your warm hands break right through Somebody save me I don't care how you do it Just stay with me (stay with me) I made this whole world shine for you Just stay Stay C'mon, I'm still waiting for you  - Remy Zero, Smallville Theme Song -
