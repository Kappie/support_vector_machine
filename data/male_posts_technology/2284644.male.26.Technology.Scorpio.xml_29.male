I work for IBM again (since march) I am going to upload all of my paintings here, as well as other cool stuff I encounter along the way.  I found a listing in the austin chronicle about a vintage flea market on Sunday. I am oh so there.   quote of the day: It's not about being liberal, it is about recognizing the obvious.
