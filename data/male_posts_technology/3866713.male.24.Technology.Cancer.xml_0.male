One of our main clients is openning a new store on Mexico City, so they are rushing us to the neurons so they can start operations with advanced new software.          The first application runs on  Windows CE  in a  Symbol MC-9000G Portable Terminal . At the moment, Symbol's device has been a headache. It's WinCe personalized OS is really a mess. There`s no notepad nor .net Compact Framwork available neither ActiveSync.          The second aplication is a members management application which collects members general information and generates ID cards (like the ones in Sams Club) storing all information in a  SQL Server 2000 database .          Well folks, Im gonna return to my .net debugger for a few more hours (and a few more lines) of happy coding!
