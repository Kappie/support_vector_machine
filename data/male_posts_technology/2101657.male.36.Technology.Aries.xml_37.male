Cars weigh in @ 5.0 oz's, just what we want to have them at.   now all we have to do is wait until it's Thursday, then it'll be time to try them out and see how they do!     We have a half-hr weigh in period to get all our Scouts through. They have to put their car in a wood "box", to make sure it's not over 7inches long, and no wider then 1 lane, so it doesn't interfere with the other car in it's own lane.  Then we'll put the car on our new digital scale, to make sure it weighs no more then 5.0 ounces.  Then the car can get it's official race day number, and then be put on the table, until it's time for that scout to race.  We'll start off with all our awards to give out, and we have alot to give a way.  After about 10-15 minutes we should be done, and then it'll be time to start racing!  We have about 24 scouts, and we'll be doing a double elimination.  Last year our oldest son went undefeated and took 1st place for his first time.  He went to district but didn't end up winning. Great experience though!  Also, tomorrow, I start my 2nd class, which will be Philosophy and the family. So that'll be 2hrs more of classes on Monday/Thursdays..those days are going to be long ones, I can see that already.  Still, I'm pumped, I love Pinewood derby, it's our funnest meeting of the whole year in my opinion.  Will post how the boys do! Wish them luck!
