They threatened to treat the captive as U.S. troops treated Iraqi detainees, a reference to the month-old abuse controversy at Abu Ghraib prison.  This is really good news!  Johnson only has to worry about being posed naked or wearing panties on his head, and those that do it will then be courtmartialed by their leadership.  If he once attended college, especially if he was in a fraternity, he should be able to weather that easily.  Meanwhile, back in reality, I know I'm preaching to the choir when I say that the death of Nick Berg illustrates the absurdity of that statement.
