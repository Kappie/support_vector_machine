The thread was against yaoi and also a petition to add a fanfiction subforum, supposedly no one understood what I was saying. So they bashed me and I decided to leave the forum...  No Way.  I still like gaia and every anime fan I know is Involved in it, so i just used my other account that is set up before for fun called OnlyOneShinobi.  I was gonna move my stuff In the first place. But I knew I shouldn't have given up...but there were just so many gay fanfiction writers it was scary. Once I left there were more ppl there defending me...  I guess things work, when I'm not there.   Well anyways (I don't know whats wrong with a fanfic subforum)  I'm gonna make a new banner, supposedly because the ppl in the forum didn't like mine because it had Sai in it and they claimed him as gay. My forum wasn't about bashing gay ppl. It was about moving the threads to a "fanfic forum" They had been very popular topics and we're annoying.  Alt code of the day  Alt-02020=Ã¤
