I was reminded of this fact when I pulled up Blogger.com on the screen and saw that one of the last 10 updated blogs was something-us somethingelse-us. Perhaps people are better able to express themselves in Latin than in English. Maybe the whole blog is in Latin, or about Latin. Dunno.  I'm still getting over the basketball marathon of yesterday. I'm probably still dehydrated.  We drove all over town today, trying to find a house. There's got to be something in our price range that isn't a) dirty; b) in a slum; or c) on a super busy street. I'm not complaining, but we're working to find something that fits. Haven't found it yet. I can list for you four things (out of the 100 or so) that every real estate agent says about the house they're wanting you to buy from their client:  1. Great neighborhood 2. Good schools 3. Great Kitchen 4. You won't be disappointed!  I won't be disappointed! I won't be disappointed! I won't be disappointed! I won't be disappointed! I won't be disappointed! I won't be disappointed! I'll just keep saying that to myself until it's true, and I'm ready to commit 30 years of income I haven't earned yet to the purchase of something that might just fall apart next thursday. So far, I'm still skittish.
