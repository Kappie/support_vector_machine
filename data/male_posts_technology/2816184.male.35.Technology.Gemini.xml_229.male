"Damn rental car....I couldn't take it....all this feast stuff was driving me nuts.  I thought you might need a hand so I got a car and came up.  Ran into this one on the way...he'd rolled into the ditch."  Zara looks at Tom shocked.  Tom's still looking strangely at Zara.  "Um, yeah.  I got this phone call and as I was getting off the line, some animal jumped out in front of the car....I was lucky I just went in the ditch...."
