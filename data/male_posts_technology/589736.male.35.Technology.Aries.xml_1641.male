I wondered how you spent your Tuesday nights when I wasn't around...and that would explain the smell of blood in the house...  I liked dating about 56% of the time when I was dating...I really loved the newness when it was good...I hated the awkwardness when it was bad.  Glad I met my soulmate when I did, because I was biologically getting really tired of field playing.  Nesting instincts starting to kick in and all that...
