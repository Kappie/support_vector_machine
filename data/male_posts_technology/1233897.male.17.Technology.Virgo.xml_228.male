I joined him shortly (lol) and he gave me a pair of gay, see-through, Santa Claus boxers (LOL). Andrew arrived with his Xbox and TV around 7 that night and we set about setting the three consoles up, interconnected via my home network. We did random stuff including watching several movies until Andrew and I finally bedded down close to 6am (Cam had taken shelter and fallen asleep in our large unfinished basement / storage area adjacent to my room back at 3am.  Cam woke up at 8 and finally got me up at 10:30. We both then dragged Andrew out of the storage area, into my room where he refused to actually get up till past 11 (lol). Ddee, Kristy, and Brady got to my house just past noon and we all waited with baited breath (…er, no) for everyone else to arrive at 1:30. In all, the attendees were Cam, Andrew, Brady, Kristy, Ddee, Vlad, both Katies, Kelli, Steven, Brandon, Josh, Jennifer, Adri, Melissa, Kat, Becky, Mandy, Danie, Lisa, Young Hee, my family and me. We did so many random things over the course of the afternoon that I can barely remember specifics. When my parents finally got home (a couple hours late) with the pizzas etc, we started planning how we were going to get over to Zoo Lights. Eventually, everyone who was coming had a ride figured out, and it ended up that Steven, Adri and I were all riding with Brady.   We had fun at Zoo Lights. We rode the train, admired the lights shining through the mist (… fog… whatever), group hugged random people dressed up as animals… you know, same ol’, same ol’. Most of us stopped for Coffee at Starbucks on the way back… Adri and Steven got into some type of signing war, er, I don’t know what was going on (lol). Anyway, once we got back home, almost everyone had left, save Steven and Brady (who were staying the night) and Adri, Melissa and Katie. Adri stayed a while after even after Katie and Melissa left – that was cool, we all talked for a while. Right after she left (past 12) we went down to Steven’s house and grabbed his computer paraphernalia. Later, Steven Brady and I pulled one of the servers out of the garage, and worked for a few hours, but got almost nothing accomplished except for downloading a few drivers onto my computer. We went to sleep close to 3:30 (or at least I did…)  [Um… It’s like what? 1:22am, and Brent just called me and asked if I had my car. I’m like “Nooo… why?”, and he’s all “Ok, talk to you later then, bye”. … strange kid (LOL)]  … Anyway, We woke up the next morning somewhere between 10am and 1pm (don’t remember) and spent all the time working on the server and copying files back and for between Steven’s and my computer. We called and told Adri that we’d be at her part like an hour and a half early, but we sorta lagged behind and got there within 15 minutes of 5, the official start. We brought my Xbox but didn’t set it up until an hour later when Brady, Steven and I went back to my house and grabbed a TV. Later, Melissa and I went out to exchange the dvd that Adri had rented (the Ring) because it was horribly scratched. That was annoying because they didn’t have another dvd edition in stock, so we had to settle for a vhs. I heard that Brady kinda made a fool out of himself while I was gone, and I kinda noticed it a bit when I got back too. He just gets too… [Insert lengthy, complete silence as all who know, contemplate how to describe it] ...in a big group of people. Whatever…Oh, incidentally, Gwen was there and brought Richard, who I finally got to meet (well… ‘see’ is the more appropriate word… there was no ‘meeting’ involved). Once they left, I was like, holy crap, now I can act normal again.  Steven stayed the next night again and came with us to a dinner at Madison House, a division of Good Samaritan ministries. We found a ton of Linux stuff on the fourth floor and a collection of something like a thousand Star Trek movies (and episodes on tape) in a movie room on the first floor.
