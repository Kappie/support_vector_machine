He also offered to give me a lift the MRT in the morning, thats nice of him. I was thinking to myself that it was going to be a good day. Little did I know...that the worst thing that could happen ,has happen. I went to look for the user to carry on with her problem. When I tried to resolve it, I realised something amiss...and it turns out that her system is a complete mess. I managed to solve her initial problem, but now it has recreated a whole new of problems. It was so bad that she demand to look for a senior engineer to assist her. I had no choice but to inform my site lead about the matter. That incident was enough to ruined my entire day. I was feeling so so low..being a newbie at the job and caused so much problem for my site lead...Plus, I was not going to meet my dear after work, which I felt that I really needed her. And then, a miracle happen. My dear called, and ask me for dinner!! My spirits were lifted greatly. We met for dinner at Maina Square and had a very delicious dinner.And again, my dear paid for it. Next time, it will be my turn, okie?? We took the train and went home... wanted so much for her to come to my place and spend more time, but...is okie. I got my wish came true, meeting her when I needed her the most...
