I've tried a couple of these over the years but always seem to run into the same roadblock - I run into a slow period, don't write anything in a long while, then come back and don't feel like writing a huge "why I didn't update in so long" update.  With luck this won't happen this time around, but who the hell knows.  Let's start out with who the hell I am in the first place.   The story so far...  I'm a 35 year old (turn 36 in July...wonderful) geekboy, born in New York, now living in The Middle Of Fucking Nowhere, Florida.  Actually the town's called Oviedo and its not a bad place to live if you like the semi-quiet life...which I do, I had enough noise growing up on (and moving back to) Long Island.  Seems I've bounced between NY and FL all my life, though I think I feel like sticking around this time.  I currently live with my roommate and good friend Michelle (gasp! a female roommate! and you're not fucking her? (no)) and her daughter Elizabeth who is 15 going on 8.  I've been divorced for about ten years now; it was a very short marriage once I realized what a mistake it was, although it did leave me with an awesome 11 year old daughter named Rachel who lives in upstate NY with her mom, stepdad and numerous brothers and sisters and whom I don't talk to nearly as much as I'd like, even though she loves me to death.  I also have a fat-assed orange cat named "Cat" or "Kitty" (hey, it's what he responds to) that is alternately my friend or my nemesis depending on mood.  I'm very close with my family and a small circle of friends, but other than them I mainly stick to my own devices; I'm always either reading, screwing around with computers or playing computer/video games (which I feel is the entertainment medium that holds the most promise for the future).  I've had good times and I've had bad times but for the most part things are pretty uneventful - mostly by design.   Current Events  At the end of March I lost my job of almost three years with a startup Net-based home security company.  This would normally be a horrible thing but the bonuses I received for sticking it out until the end afforded me a great opportunity: to try my hand at running my own business, home-based computer support and service.  Not only has this allowed me to get out of a corporate environment that I've never truly been able to fit into (thanks to my Dad, I've got a blue-collar mindset with my white-collar talents) but it allows me to build off almost 20 years experience with messing about with these silly little boxes full of noisy bits.  It's a huge step for me so I'm sure it'll come up now and again in my writings...especially considering how I have no idea what to expect.  I'm very confident in my abilities to both fix anything that comes my way and deal with customers in a way that'll make them feel good about the experience though, so hopefully I won't have to retitle this thing to "Drek's Sinking Feelings".   The future...  Who the hell knows?  I'll probably write about it here regardless.  Oh yeah, I figured out a way to throw comments on this thing.  Feel free to advise, cheer and/or mock me as you see fit.
