It's difficult to find Southern African blogs that don't swing heavily to one side or another, so James' blog is a rare find.  Continuing with the whole ZA/terrorism thing:   urlLink Wayne  makes a poignant observation. The failure with trying to understand Islamic terrorism is trying to fathom the  why . Simply put - sometimes there is no why, sometimes there is no logic. Sometimes religion-fueled psychosis is just that.   urlLink Vaz  also has something to add.
