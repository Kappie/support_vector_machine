I am the worse speller in the family. 2. I do not know enlish, I know redneck speak. 3. I do not have the cleanest mouth. 4. I am damn honest in what i write. 5. I did not capitalize the I in the above! 6. My profile is called mikey humor!  so take it with a shot of tequila!  If I make you upset with my blog, remmber whos it is!  If you want to say something about my english usages, send all complaints to goergebushisanidot@whitehouse.gov! I talk as good as our beloved president! (but i have a bigger ______  so I am better off)  Mikey!
