Do we really need to be manipulated into accepting someone else's view as our own? Can we no-longer decide for ourselves based on the presentation of simple facts?   Of course, I'm refering to the new documentary style made popular by Michael Moore and others. I have no problem with Mr Moore having an opinion, or even publishing that opinion, but please don't call your films documentaries.   Let me just state up-front here that I haven't seen his film but that I have watched the television series "The Awful Truth", and read his book, "Stupid White Men", but I'd really rather find out what motivates people to act the way they do - not just look at the way they act.   Surely we learn more from finding out "why" rather than "how".   I doubt Mr Moore has had much effect on corporate America. For instance, do insurance companies make their insurance policies clearer, or give money to people who aren't covered by their policy? I doubt it - but Moore covered this extensively in his television series.   So what is wrong with what he does? Nothing. But it has no lasting effect. I'd rather know why an insurance broker denies a policy - what corporate governance is lacking - how we can fix the problem.   It's the same with his attack on Bush. Justified as it is - it achieves nothing. Sure, Bush may go at the next election, but there are hundreds of him out there. One will surely follow another. Instead, solve the problem. Anyone can be a genius with hindsight - but brilliance requires the ability to see tomorrow's solution today. There will be more Iraq's and Afghanistans until we can find a way to prevent them.   I don't claim to be a political strategist - and as such I cannot provide the answers. But perhaps Michael Moore's next movie can be about how to stop acts of terror. John Pilger does it, although admittedly in a negtive fashion. Perhaps Moore can collaborate with him to come up with a documentary that really tells the truth - but entertains people at the same time - and doesn't alienate those people who really need to see it.     Now there is a real challenge for him.
