At the same time, I wonder if I am doing right or wrong. Giving them money so that they can eat or allowing them to remain in drudgery. There is a Chinese proverb: Give a man a fish to eat; he'll not be hungry for a day. But teach him to fish, he'll never be hungry in his life This has always been a problem when I think of giving alms. So I usually avoid giving money. Instead, I try to give them clothes or other materials, rather than money. I am waiting to hear of anyone has faced such a dilemma.
