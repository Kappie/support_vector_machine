It's good to be back in socal for a day or two to sleep and enjoy the spectacular weather. I'm gonna milk this day for all that it's worth, I'va already got a lacma trip planned, and maybe I'll even swing by the getty. I've still got a brutal cough from my travels down under, but the heat and a fatburger should cure what ails me.  Oh yeah, and check my  urlLink moblog  for a few random pics from my trip, including the Cafe deWheels chilli dog.
