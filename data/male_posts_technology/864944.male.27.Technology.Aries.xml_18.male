It was lovely :) *and the pats won! yay*  Christmas is fast approaching, work has remaind rather busy, and I really havent taken the time to update this site.  It may be that that will more of the norm, so to those of you who do come by regularly, I apologize.  ---  A book I have been reading lately called Cryptnomicon by Neal Stephenson.  I like Neal alot, and this book has not dissappointed.  If you are at all technical, or interested in cryptology, i highly reccommend it.  ---  Star Wars Episode II on my local Imax theatre was simply phenominal.  Sure seeing the blemishes on Ewan McGregor's forehead could have been skipped, but the hum of the lightsares in such resounding base that it vibrates my clothing was something i very much enjoyed.  The sound systems in those theatres are nothing short of breathtaking.   I would like to go back soon and see the IMAX movie shot on the space station.  Though I doubt chris will come.  She gets motion sickness sitting still on the couch, I doubt watching larger than life shots of zero G scienists will be much good for her :)  ---  Metroid Prime for the Gamecube is phenominal.  For that matter so is Asherons Call 2 for the PC.  I havent been able to spend as much time as I would like playing games recently, but when I have had time, it is generally going to those two games.  Metroid is similar enough to the original metroid in its feel, that is brings waves of nostalgia.   Though it is also different enough to make it cutting edge.   urlLink AC2  is an MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role playing game..and thats the last time i write that)   it is graphically stunning, and the gameplay is well thought out and actually fun.  I also play on a  Kingdom vs. Kingdom server, which adds a whole new dynamic.  The nice thing about AC2 is that is has a good story.  The world of Dereth was overrun during the finale of Asherons Call 1, and now.. a hundred years later, the players play the roles of the inhabitants emerging from underground shelters to find their planet rather demolished.  All the cities are in ruin.. and monsters have overrun several sections of the planet.  Our job is to rebuild the world, and restore order.  PLayers can choose to join one of four kingdoms to create a grander scope to the game.  The kingdoms war with each other as they all try to rebuild portions of the world, and retain control over them.  All fun stuff :)  ---  My xmas shopping is mostly done.  ONly a few more presents to get.  This year I felt rushed.. mainy because so much of my time is chalked up to one thing or another.   I should be able to squeeze in the last bit of shopping sometime this weekend or next.  *yay crowds*.  ---  And finally.. as i have helped contribute to FastFoodFever.com  I though i would proudly annonce that it has made Yahoos directory.. and it got on some yahoo featured site email.. and now we have had over 15,000 people hit the site today.   Very cool..  Congrats to Jay on it.  Its his baby :)  urlLink http://picks.yahoo.com/picks/i/20021212.html
