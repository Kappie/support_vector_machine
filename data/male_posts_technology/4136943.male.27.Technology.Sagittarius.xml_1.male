Keeping up with Slashdot means that I have a really good idea of what is going on in the world of tech.  New software, computer security, new devices and parts, and other important stuff (video games) are all covered on Slashdot. I usually read it several times a day.  Slashdot is one of the original blogs, from before blogs were called blogs. I have been reading Slashdot regularly for at least 5 years. Thanks to  urlLink Myers/Icepick  for originally steering me to Slashdot.
