And I think that I can be content with how things are now, 'other people-wise', and very happy continuing on, although things didn't end up going my way. Life will leave you with your head in your hands all too often. But to dwell on the worst for so long is long enough, and it's most definitely time for me to move on and see what else is out there, even if it means giving up one of the used-to-be greatest things I had.  I won't be online often, I'm surprised I found the time to update.  I extend my thanks to a few people:  Justin Christine Cate And myself, for putting everything into perspective and into the back of my head for a while, so I can enjoy what I do have. I suppose that, more than anything, I'm happy I'm not bound into something that would eventually ruin me anyways.  I sincerely hope the happiest for you and your newfound happiness.   They call me Mr. Marlboro.     It will all work out in the end, for me, at least.
