About a hundred years ago or so (give or take a few decades), in Victorian England, the Bobbies would walk around at night, and every hour they'd intone something like "Twelve O Clock, and all's well". Even though All was  not  in fact, well. He'd walk past a house bellowing that all was right with the world, and a few short feet away, behind some brickwork, some 'gentlemen' would be beating his wife or molesting his kids or something. One thing I've noticed regarding humanity. Most of us believe that ignorance is bliss. That if we hear and see no evil, then there must be no evil. Some would say that humanity is inherently good and that real, true evil does not exist, merely that some people have 'issues', or 'problems'. Nuts to that, I say. Real evil exists. Oh yes. I know it for a  fact . I know it exists,  because I can feel it in me sometimes - I choose not to ignore it, I choose to see it, to hear it. It's there, in me, struggling to escape and wreak havoc upon the world. I wonder what it would be like to pick up a knife and start hunting people like cattle. I can almost smell and taste the excitement of being feared, the exhiliration of seeing my alias in the papers, the glee of knowing that society both loves and fears this monster it has created. I wonder what it would be like to live a life as a serial killer, and I understand  why  serial killers exist. Many people do not, they blind themselves to the inner desire for a power over others - not some stupid, useless pseudo-power like, say, being someone's boss, but rather the true power of being willing to remorselessly take a life merely for the sake of it. And then I realise the sheer insanity of it, and that insanity  is  evil, not merely a 'condition'. It is pure, distilled hate, anger, malice, call it what you will. But it's not right, and it does not deserve to exist. It's for this reason that I advocate that people getting off murder charges on pleas of insanity, should not be getting free medical help and a 5 year sentence. They need to be put down, like a rabid dog. Because like a rabid dog, once a person realises he can do something that's just plain wrong   and get away with it , he  will  do it again. I am fortunate that I can see what's on the other side of the line, many choose not to. I am also fortunate that I can SEE the line itself, and choose not to cross it. I doubt I ever will, but I know, now, that if I ever do, someone would have to take me the fuck out, because I know, if I ever give into the rage, if I ever blissfully sink into it, I will never truly surface from again.
