All of you bastards should do this.  BTW I know that some of you may be critical of the fact that seem never to spend the time to hyperlink the links I put in my text, and well you can go to hell.  Furthermore you are the lazy bastards that I am targeting in my support of Bike to Work Week.  On that note I am hereby dedicate the 17th thru the 21st Don't Be a Lazy Bitch and Copy and Paste the Link if You Really Care That Much Week.  Yeah, and fuck you and your car.  Some kids pointed at me and laughed as I biked my way home yesterday, probally because of my shorts.  I don't wear the bike shorts (God-Help-Me!) but I was wearing my favorite Addidas soccer shorts, and for some reason, shorts just seem to illicit laughter in my direction. Perhaps school children are just incited to giggle at the sight of my shapely legs.  But no matter, they were waiting for a city bus.  Haha!  You have to ride a stinky bus, and take home a progress report for your mom to sign, and eat rectangular shaped pizza!  I almost gave them the finger, but then I thought better of giving 4th graders the finger so I quickly morphed my gesture into an ambivalent thumbs up.  I didn't want those kids to know they'd gotten inside my head.
