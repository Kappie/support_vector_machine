It's intruiging to try and filter to see what other people think about missions and how their church defines it.  I think much of it starts with the church's mission statement and then filters down into what they are doing about it.  Anyway,  urlLink this  page is kind of cool, they call it a mission incubator - whose goal is "to mobilize every member to become involved in ministry or mission."  I like it, its crisp.  Got it from the blog of  urlLink Dave  and the church he works for.
