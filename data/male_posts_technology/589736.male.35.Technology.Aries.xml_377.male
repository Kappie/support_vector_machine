And the way I look at it, I need some alternative methods to make cash when things are slow for a day or two. Plus, there's actually advantages to having this type of work - when the time's up, you're done - unlike articles and interviews, which mean more cash but drag on for days and weeks. The one bonus of this, I think, is getting the work over and done with - eating dinner at 6 o'clock with a clear mind, knowing that everything's done and a check is going out of Friday.   But I won't even go into the hassle I face getting paid on time. Suffice to day, I just got a check for an article I work the beginning of June. Little pain in the arse work can be beneficial, if it brings a little, but steady, paycheck to help carry you through other times.   Anyway, back to more corporal tunnel syndrome-inducing labor.
