And here is one small story on gifting which i would like to share with u .......... ****************************************************  Hatim Tai had a great reputation among the Arabs of old for the lavishness of his gifts and alms.   “Have you ever met anyone more excellent than yourself?” his friends once asked him.   “Yes,” replied Hatim Tai.   “Who was he?”   “One day I had forty camels sacrificed and I offered a feast to whoever would like to come and share in it. Then I set out with several chiefs to invite guests from far and wide. On the way we came across a woodcutter who had just cut a bundle of thorns. This was the way he earned his livelihood. Seeing that he was poor, I asked him why he did not go to the many feasts given by Hatim Tai. `Those who earn their living,' he answered me, `have no need of the bounty of Hatim Tai.' “   Why then did Hatim Tai declare that the woodcutter was a better man than himself?   It was because he thought it nobler to work and to provide for oneself than to give others gifts which cost no effort or sacrifice and which, moreover, discourage them from being self-reliant.   Of course it is quite natural that friends should give presents to their friends; it is good that strong arms should come to the help of the poor and the needy; but an able-bodied man should work with his hands, not hold them out for alms. Of course this implies no reflection on those who consecrate themselves entirely to the contemplative life and the search for wisdom.   ************************************************* will be back with a tale on Vasantahabba -a festival of spring celebrated @b'lore to which i had been this weekend.
