Hmm... how to get drunk tim not to post... this will be the trick I think... Personally I think he likes to post, he feels that he'll say what I won't say... weird drunk tim...  In other news, I think we could say we have different selves for different people we're around, but also reoccuring themes running throughout each self. IE, in all my selves I believe in God and respect my elders. But in some selves I'm more respectful of women and strangers than I am as other selves. When I write on blog, I think that's one self, but it's also whichever self I am at the time. Does this make any sense? Does anyone understand me?
