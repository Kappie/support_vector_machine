Well this is an explanation that is far past due so here we go.  The Inc. in compendium is a collection of heroes that fight respective adversaries in all our lives, whether it be depression, anger, slothfulness, rage, etc. and works to better our lives through teamwork  spirit building. Comprising of over 200 different heroes, Superhero Inc. seeks to fight evil works wherever they may surface. All these forces, good  evil come together in my world to face off against each other daily, the good forces being led by the daunting champion Onijah Rowen whose strength  determination always lead the way. Erstwhile forces are headed by a three-headed conglomerate called the Dark Trinity. So you see...you have to stay tuned to the journal because you neva know how the forces of good  evil will manifest themselves in my life!  Now that that is done... Me  Nicole had the most wonderful conversation yesterday! :o) We didn't fuss, argue, gripe, complain...we just talked! We talked like we used to, sharing our creative thought  musings, reminiscing on our short past  speaking about things to come. It made me want to cry for real!! Whole thing about that, earlier in the day, we were going at it again. She left a lengthy trail of offline messages on yahoo telling me how she felt about our altercation and...without going into detail, she was p'oed. Arguments like those....it makes me wonder about the strength of our relationship...the ties that bond...the glue that holds us kindred... She constantly says that things I say upset her/ come off sounding rude/ take your pick...but if that was my true intent, what would be the basis? Why intentionally hurt the one you LOVE? *sigh* I've never had discussions like these with anyone else...not to this extent. We argue over things that deserve no breath, that should never be an issue. Everyday I rack my brain to figure out how to make things right between us yet the same thing she tends to be offended/ insulted by in me I see the same in her!! Let me say this also, we are two different people, mind you. Two completely different upcomings  outlooks on life. Our respective environments are crazy different, so much of what we clash on I try to put into perspective. Some of the goals I had are in essence goals she's still climbing to reach...Let me clarify. I graduated from college already, she's finishing next year...I'm a virtually free spirit  have the freedom to do whatever  go wherever I want...Nicole...not so much. Arite please don't get me wrong, there's NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT!!! Nothing at all. These factors, among others not listed but mildly related, tend to make us clash on several issues  viewpoints and that ust shouldn't be! Once you understand your woman and your woman understands you, there should be a mutual braintrust established that recognizes status quo  safeguards against breaches in that emotional dwelling...  *SIGH* There is so much more to the story...don't have time to tell it all. I didn't mean to write all of this...and I know i'll hear about it later which is fine. All I know is there is something that keeps us coming back from every argument, every obstacle, every situation...but no verbal makeup can compete with actually spending time. If I had to choose, I would want my baby in the same town as me or close as possible so I wouldn't have to drive across states to come see her.  Beautiful you are, Nicole, and wonderful together we someday shall be. I love you...anyhow :o).
