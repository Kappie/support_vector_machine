It has been a habit for me to write diary (which I've been doing for ages), but of late I've been quite irregular to that,(may be I'm not too comfortable with my Current abode but my lethargicness is also another reason).   My relationship with my girl is like a beautiful bubble now a days,u get close to it , thats it , it bursts.   I miss her a lot and she misses me too, then what is the problem ?   I like her to the core and admire her also to the core, She likes and loves me to the core but don't want to commit.   Dunno when can I've a breakthrough, but I know I'll someday and If I'm marrying anyone that is she !   Think this is o.k for today, will post more on the forecoming days.
