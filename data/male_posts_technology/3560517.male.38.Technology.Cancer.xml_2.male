I guess if your candidate can't pull ahead on his own, it makes sense to stack the poll to make it look like he is winning.  Kevin   Generally speaking, do you usually consider yourself a Republican, a Democrat, an Independent, or what?  Republican = 29% Democrat = 35% Independent/Don't Know = 36%   Over the last month, Bush has gained ground in all major polls except Wash Post.  Somehow, while other polls show Bush gaining, their poll shows Kerry surging.  I wonder how much they over sampled Dems in their poll???    Poll Dates Net Gain   CBS News  CBS/NYT 5/20-23 vs 6/23-27 Bush +7  Fox News/OpDyn 5/18-19 vs 6/22-23 Bush + 6  CNN/Gallup/USAT 5/21-23 vs. 6/21-23 Bush +3  WaPo/ABC News 5/20-23 vs 6/17-6/20 Kerry + 6  Rasmussen and Battleground polls also showed Bush gaining ground in the last month.
