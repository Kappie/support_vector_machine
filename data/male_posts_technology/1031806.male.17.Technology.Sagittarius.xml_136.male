But now, through my own realization that God is in control of my life, coupled with the support of friends, I'm fine again.   This is a poem that  urlLink Laurie  wrote and emailed to me yesterday after reading my Mon Jul 21, 11:40:00 AM post. Thanks, Laurie, that meant alot to me:   I bled for you    Everything is fading away Everything but my pain There's nothing left in me I think I'm going insane  Truth or lie I feel like I'm falling away I'd rather die Than feel this way  Where is the love you promised Where is the peace you share Where is the golden rainbow Or do you even care?  My eyes are hollow holes I'm drowning in my hurt I reach out, reach up I'm falling to the dirt  There's a cavity inside me I'm falling down into the pit It has no bottom, I'm forever falling Something doused the candle that was lit  I'm falling, falling Falling away from you Something's pulling me down Holding onto me like glue  Tears keep falling down my face I am powerless to stop them This is my only release Until I hit rock bottom  I want to die Why am I alive The question echoes through me Cutting through me like a knife  I look at my heart Bloody, stained, broken Then my heart echoes With words softly spoken  "Did you know I bled for you?" The thought pierces my soul My God, my God, have you forsaken me? "No, my heart is full."  "I bled too, my son I know how you feel" You couldn't! I yell "But I have, it is the seal."  "My heart bleeds even now At your pain that seems so endless" Tears flow faster down my cheeks, At the memories of bliss  "Cry my son, Cry for the love Cry for the loss Cry for the blood."    © Laurie, 2003
