(Eyeing receipt) But I can only give you $4.99 back [cost $5.99], because you used a $1 coupon.   M: Wha? But then if I pick up the same priced item and go through the line, they'll charge me $5.99, right?  G: Um, yeah. I can do an exchange, if you want.    I didn't bother pointing out the searing fact that we had already effectively given the store $5.99 for the product, BECAUSE THE STORE GETS A DOLLAR FROM THE MANUFACTURER FOR THE COUPON! I thought this was common knowledge in the retail sector; maybe that's just my opinion based on the years of grocery store work under my belt. Also, I'm sure this girl has to put up with enough idiots (after all, I  was  in Springfield).  EVERYTHING I KNOW I LEARNED WORKING IN A GROCERY STORE  1. Any customer service job makes you appreciate common sense, and loathe the lack thereof. At least it would, if there was any common sense on display.   2. It sure is nice when everything is arranged in rows, but sometimes you can't get everything to fit in the row space you have. This forces you to get creative.   3. Old people are lousy at finding the olives (they're in aisle 3, ma'am).   4. A well trained power jack operator  can  unload a semi truck full of cereal and canned vegetables in under 5 minutes, with or without a hangover.   5. The most difficult food to clean off a tile floor is pancake syrup. The smelliest food to clean off a tile floor is a mixture of oyster sauce and rice wine vinegar.   More grocery store musings to come; maybe a separate post. I bet you're thrilled.
