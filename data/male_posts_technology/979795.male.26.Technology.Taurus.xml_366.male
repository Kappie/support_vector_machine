Had 1 hr break, took another class, had 1 meeting right after, took a quick lunch, had a nother meeting, break another hr, took 2 classes after that. So tired now, need some Aikido to clear my mind. Hope I won't be too blur tonight. Luckily tomorrow is Sports' Day. I get to wear casual and I may/may not have a halfday. But I'm considering staying later to finish up some work. If I do leave early, I may go grab a haircut instead. But I'm trying to delay it till next Tues instead.  I'm starting to recognise some girls from the classes I'm taking. First was the little one who grabbed my hand in the library. I was walking past her seat and she grabbed my hand to try and ask me a question. Another is from a different class. ALways running around or irritating the friends next to her. Noticed that basically both just want attention. The former doesn't distract others while the latter does.   OK I have to take note lah, can't let the former just happy happy grab my hand or something. Teacher is still teacher lor. Need to maintain some kind of discipline in class.  I'm thinking more on how to 'teach' the latter. I may have to try some 'ignoring' tactics on her. Maybe isolate her by making her seat far away and alone from anyone. She gets really happy when she notices people gettting affected by her actions. Sit with her legs on the chair, places her feet on her friend's seat. Runs around pressing other people's keyboard.  In fact, there are quite a few students who seem particularly slow with the PC. It's either they do not have much contact with a PC, they can't hear my instructions, or they choose not to hear my instructions. Just some that I need to keep an eye out for. May actually have to try shifting them out of their old seats to somewhere where they can see what I'm showing the class.  OK time to go Aikido. WOOHOO!!
