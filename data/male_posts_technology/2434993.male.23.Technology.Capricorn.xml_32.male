We are doing one thing only to arrive at something else. The result is more important than our regard for what we are actually doing.  We seldom do anything for its own sake. Our action is not direct and present. It follows an ulterior motivation and a looking to the future. Our action works through time, which is the past and the future, and the denial of the present that is awareness.  Action that seeks a result, therefore, creates bondage to time. It attaches us to the stream of causation, in which we ourselves, becoming part of the process, can be moved, influenced and mani-pulated according to that which we seek. Matter, time, space and causation are ultimately the same. We see matter,- an inert or raw material to be used, according to our seeking of results.  To seek results is to create matter, to turn things into manipulatable objects. For example, if I desire to become a political leader, I must learn how to use the masses of people in order to give me power and influence. I must turn them into a tool and mould them like clay according to my ambition, which is exactly what most of our leaders attempt. In that seeking of results, I turn living human beings into mere instruments for arriving at what I want. Were I not seeking anything, I could look at people directly as human beings. When we see others as human beings, as ourselves, we cannot manipulate them. A future based upon the past - the past being our desire and the future its fulfilment - binds us to a mentality of absence and want. Turning the world (which is also our inner-most self) into an object lienates us and creates division in space. The seeking of results binds us to time, space and karma, not as some metaphysical theory but as a psychological fact. It creates our false world-idea based upon the ego, the work of sorrow and confusion or samsara that is the denial of our true self and being.  From the ego, which is the central focus of the ignorant, the original fissure in consciousness between self and other, comes our entire bondage to time, space and causation. Apart from the seeking of results, all life is spiritual, sacred or nirvanic - a pure and inviolable existence. Knowledge and ignorance are opposites - they are contrary to each other. Dwelling in the midst of ignorance, thinking themselves to be wise, the foolish totter like the blindfolded led by the blindfolded. The higher goal does not appeal to these heedless children, deluded by the material world, says the Katha Upanishad.  The Creator opened the gates of the senses to look without, not to see the inner Self.  Only a rare sage with his eye turned within, desiring immortality, sees the inner self. The childish follow after outer desires and enter into the noose extended by death. Once results cease to matter and ignorance is replaced by knowledge, the inner self becomes evident, and all bondage ceases. There is only a pure transformation, free of ego. Action is no longer predicated on the result; action becomes direct and present - it is no longer restrictive.
