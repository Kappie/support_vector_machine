But look at what some clever person has invented to solve his own kayak towing problems:  The Kayak Tow... Version 4.0     Now, you can't see it from this pic.  But that little bad boy is a home brew solution.  I noticed a couple wheels on an axle.  Then i noticed lots of what looked like egg crate material (like bedding) and an ample supply of duct tape.   Innnteresting.  His solution looks nicer, but I bet it was more work.
