I have a company but that doesn't deal in electronics, so I'm not using that. I get so frustrated waiting to get the price of some components that's no listed in the normal pricelist. Guess I'll have to use used parts. I've learnt about BEAM, and thought I'd give that a try, because that's just a couple of inverters, transistors, resistors and some caps. I wonder what made Mark Tilden think of this in the first place. Friday today, and I'm not quite sure what the night will escalate to. A few beers with some friends, and maybe a trip to the golfcourse. Spent 4 hours there last night. Didn't leave until 12:15am. Getting up at 7:30am to go to work, wasn't a joy. Maybe see what I can get a hold of in used appliances, and take off some components. Need a walkman, or a small tape-player, because the motors in those are better than the ones I got now. I'll have to check a local "used things" store. There's a fleamarket tomorrow, maybe I'll find something there. I found the schematics for an EdgeBOT, I don't have a link right here, and I don't remember the name of the author. Perhaps I'll try to build that during the weekend. We'll see.
