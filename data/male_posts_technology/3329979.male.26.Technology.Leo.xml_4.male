My dear lil' sis SN, was pissed off with a reseller that she answered him : "Well, imagine that you buy a Beemer and you don't drive it. So, what the heck did you buy it in the first place ? To display it ?" She had an indignant kinda voice saying those words and the office erupted in laughter. Edgy  feisty little girl :p  Also, another colleague's blog made me ponder about the future. As my contract will be ending on 30th June 2005, what the heck are my plans ? To start work immediately after that ? Or to go on a long long break before looking for a job ? Hmm .... To me, i would prefer to take aholiday (not those 1 or 2 weeks vacation .... hallo, minimum 1 month lar)somewhere far far away (all of a sudden, Middle Earth sounds like a good place to be). Planning now with my best friend to go backpacking in South America next July. Was initially planning for a trip to Europe but the Euros will definitely burn a hole in our pockets when we get back .... Sigh .... Money, money, money ....  A quote which i found interesting today : Not all men are fools -- some are bachelors.  It kinda echoes my thoughts :p  And a joke to end today's post : A married man was having an affair with his secretary.One day, their passions overcame them and they took off for her house,where they made passionate love all afternoon. Exhausted from the wild sex,they fell asleep, awakening around 8:00 p.m. As the man threw on his clothes, he told the woman to take his shoes outside and rub them through the grass and dirt. Mystified, she nonetheless complied. He slipped into his shoes and drove home. "Where have you been?" demanded his wife when he entered the house. "Darling, I can't lie to you. I've been having an affair with my secretary and we've been having sex all afternoon. I fell asleep and didn'twake up until eight o'clock." The wife glanced down at his shoes and said,"You lying bastard! You've been playing golf!".  Savvy ;)
