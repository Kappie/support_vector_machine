We still haven't gotten it at home because of laziness and stuff. But my consoles are there to bring me goodness.  Harrison got a  urlLink Blog  He one a while ago but he abandoned it like every other thing he has done.  Anyways I slammed my finger in a car door, played Unreal Tourney, watched techtv and procrastinated with playing .hack//infection because my level is too low (7).  I will edit my sidebar now. Once Steven's Xanga is good enough to show to the public I will link him, but for now, just Harrison.  I am so behind with my internet duties...
