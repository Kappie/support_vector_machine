Some people more than others, but it is the existence of these things that keep us human. Things like falling over, stubbing toes, spilling things, dropping things.. and getting things wrong... today I was amazed that I'd uploaded 44.5gig via my 256k dsl connection... it transpired to be 44.5mb  yes, I did feel pretty damned silly right about the time that was pointed out.. and yes, I had egg on my face.. BUT I stopped moments before asking a group of people that would've laughed eternally AND stopped before I rang xtra to bitch about it.. this sort of 'save' is a damned good thing. I revell in the chance to do something monumentally stupid, while no one is around. It's like you used up part of your quota, without losing face. I love it. I recall one time, immediately after setting up a webcam in the lounge of our balmoral flat that such a thing happened... I'll retell the story now.. for your ammusement. I have a big old armchair, its horrid, the fabric .. or the fabric that is left, is tatty, dated and generally non existent, exposing the wood and springs that make the chair.. if you've seen What Becomes of the Broken Hearted - its the same as jake heke's furniture in his flat.. anyway, I digress.. its a gorgeously comfortable chair and I keep talking about reducing it to pieces, to copy it, and make other furniture that is just as comfortable.. this chair is gorgeous it has arms that are wide enough to comfortably sit on, or put a plate on without it being balanced precariously etc. Anyway.. in an effort to make it look a bit tidier, I had a black sheet over it, so that it matched the other black furniture in the flat at the time. Awesome. anyway, this one day I decide to straighten up the sheet, and put my coke on the arm of the chair, then sat down, which pulled the sheet in toward the middle, launching the coke into my lap and my god, coke from the freezer is very bloody cold now, I dont want to get the chair wet, because foam etc take a long time to dry, so I lift up my crotch, carefully so as to not spill the contents of my groin  *invisage groin thrust* and lifting with my arms, I spider out of the chair, to the lounge floor and dribble onto the landlords carpet. All the while giggling because everyone is watching live on webcam. Except, they werent.. I was out of frame for the whole fucken thing. Gutted! Even tho I retold this at the time, its not the same without the video footage. Oooh incidently my keyboard is back together, all 1001 bits of it, and as a BONUS I have spare parts left over.. they cant've been important. I havent plugged the transmitter back in yet, to see if it still works, but I'm kinda putting it off on account of I dont think it will. I'll keep you posted. Have fun, and enjoy falling down in private, each time you do remember youve' used it up, so that it is less likely to get you in public. Woohoo. Life is good :D
