The object of these games is to find a date with a girl and with your simulation game skillz, make correct choices to be rewarded with a movie at the end of each section of the game.  Sounds strange right!?  Well actually there are a few games like that in the us, like leisure suit larry, even thought it seems like a joke...  I played my first one today. It was a spoof off of love hina in shockwave. I only played it for 3 minutes but it was kind of fun, I would rather have it on a portable rather then on the computer...Some how it is hard for me to play rpg's on the computer.   urlLink Should dating sims come to the states?
