Afterwards I made dinner and subsequently felt extremely tired.  She ran off to a few group meetings and it was time for me to study for the rest of the night.  The combination of the weather, working out, taking a walk and a full meal wore me out, so I decided to make some coffee.  I haven't had large amounts of caffeine since I gave it up at the beginning of this year.  I drank half a pot in about an hour and a half.  

Let's just say that was a horrible idea.  I started to get pretty wired an hour in, but I figured that would be the only symptom.  I was so wrong.  My concentration started to wane, I was getting dizzy and then it got worse.  Eventually, I just wanted to either run around the room or puke.  I had to dry heave for a good five minutes until I could stand up again.  I got probably a good half an hour of work done between midnight and 3:30 AM when I finally fell asleep.
