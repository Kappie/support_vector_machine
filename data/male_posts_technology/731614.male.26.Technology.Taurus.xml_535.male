Would love some of those massive square acrylic ones that the hoochie mammas have, in bright red or gold or something. Tried getting false nails once, they fell of a few days later, it would seem that i have nails that are too narrow to support the falsie blah blah.. i can tell youre all enthralled! Mebbe i could get  a massage, or body wrap? lets make a real world spa.. ooh! ooh! (patent pending!) If youre interested in seeing more of me, visit  urlLink my blog  to get a nice picture of my pus... kitty!
