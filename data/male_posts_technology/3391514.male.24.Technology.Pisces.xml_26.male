I've been having some new ideas for my potentially upcoming  Mage: The Ascension  game... my original idea was too similar to my older  GURPS: Supers  game.  The new idea has a workable backstory, but nothing to really go on.  I also need to do some more work on the  World of Darkness  game... it's slated to end in a few weeks and the ending(s) aren't actually finalised...  Whoops.  Have I ever mentioned  urlLink Amiga Remix ?  It's a marvellous site that contains remixes of great Amiga tunes.  I recommend most of the  Turrican  ones... they're ace.
