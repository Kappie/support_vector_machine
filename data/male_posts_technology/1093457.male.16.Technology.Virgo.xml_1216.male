I admit some of the songs were good. Even got my feet tapping away but now I'm totally against it all mainly because of the way its been handled. I wouldn't mind Joe putting his CD's on if he asked everyone first 'Does anyone mind if I change the CD?' or if he waited for the actual CD to finish but he doesn't. He just goes and turns it off whenever he pleases, like its HIS stereo and it isn't. Its everyones. I know poeple have different tastes, lok at my CD collection. I own a bit of everything. Pop, Rock, RnB, Soundtracks, Jazz atc... I don't mind what we listen to I just wish it was dealt with in a better way. But I agree, the best solutionis simply no stereo at all. When they took it away for a week the common room was so much better. You could hear yourself think, you could have conversation with people without shouting and no one got wound up for people changing the CD or radio station. Yes, I vote too,  Get rid of the CD player . If people want to listen to stuff they can bring in their own personal stereos.  I saw the drama plays last night. WOW. I am so proud of everyone who was in them :) Only thing that annoyed me slightly was that they decided to tell me as we were all leaving that I was invited to Pizza Express with them as the drama group were going. Grrr. Tell me a few days before and I can get money. Tell me five minutes before and gah. Ah well. That doesn't matter anyway, the plays were sooo good and I would say more but I have to go to work so byeee.
