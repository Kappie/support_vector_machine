You called us all liars when we said that the shrub tax cuts were helping the rich at the expense of the middle class and the poor.  Well you know what this article above is from a document released by the Congressional Budget Office, that's right the Congress, its a  bi-partisan  report.  What does it say you ask?    "The report said the top 1 percent, with incomes averaging $1.2 million per year, will receive an average $78,460 tax cut this year, and have seen their share of the total tax burden fall roughly 2 percentage points to 20.1 percent, according to The New York Times."  "Taxpayers whose incomes range from $51,500 to about $75,600 saw their share of federal tax payments increase, according to CBO figures cited by The Washington Post." EAT IT!  Explain your way out of that one!    Bush LIE:   ..."by far the vast majority of the help[tax cut] goes to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder."  urlLink FAIR MEDIA ADVISORY: Are All Candidates' Exaggerations Considered Equal?
