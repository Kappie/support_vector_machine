Actually I have been really busy of late, going away on holidays, going away on more holidays and lots and lots of roleplay organizing!!! Life is too short.  So anyway all is good with me at the moment asides from having the back problem from hell! But hopefully it is on the mend and I may even get out this weekend to do some moshing. Speaking of moshing, anyone want to go to the Splash on Saturday??? I think Kirk said he was up for it when I last saw him.  I went to see Van Helsing the other day and I thought it was alright, good use of classic Whampyre traits, good action, and tits tits tits! The plot is a little like 'Um ok' but generally an entertainer.  Right I can't say too much after such an absence so I'll be off now. Oh, one last thing... Great new layout Toaster!  Baity signing off.....  'Into Glory Ride'
