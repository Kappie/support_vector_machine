I am also developing the list of characters that are in my head, to try to nail down the negative self-talk problems.  I will post it, even though it will be quite long.  I was real down last night, although I can't put my finger on why specifically.  I think sometimes I just get emotionally tired, not necessarily sad or angry or depressed.  I know it's just a symptom, but sometimes I have no energy or desire to do anything.  I wanted to leave the house for a while last night and just be by myself, but Anne was going to her quilt class.  She offered to take Nikki with her, so Dan and I were at home.  He left me alone for part of the time, but wanted to play later, so I did.  I forced myself to play a game with him (I like to play with him) but I really didn't want to .  I went to bed as soon as Anne got home, while she stayed up late (as usual).  I am feeling sick.  My migraine is back, the stuffy nose and allegies have been after me for a month now, and I just feel worn out.  Sleep helps, but not much.  My stomach is upset, and I think I will go home.  Great timing:  Nikki's birthday party and sleepover is this weekend.  It will be interesting - 5 or 6 little girls running around and screaming all weekend.  I don't mind, as long as she enjoys herself.  Bye Bye, bloggers, see ya Monday.
