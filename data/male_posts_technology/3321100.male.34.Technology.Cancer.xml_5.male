Waiting a baby... Waiting again... Obsession of my wife... To make love only to have a baby...Why we havn't try soon... Doctor, after doctor, Hospital, In-Vitro process, and finally, the reason is... A rare disease inside my wife .... Very funny no ???? You ask Why ??? Simply cause I'm pr√©sident of an association who help people who have rare disease, like my mother, and now, My wife as a rare disease ! If I trust in God, I will explain him one or two things.Stupid guy... So no baby, Ok... Try adoption ? 4 years of problem and you wand I insist ??? Why you don't try to adopt? Only because our life is not so perfect now... My wife have had a period where making love have no sense. Why making love if we couldn't make baby ??? And me ? Afraid by the disease, I forgot I had a wife, and I looking for a new life. A virtual life with only good things... we have had a verry hard moment. Separation, appartment, and finally after so many discussions, I come back. So ok, no baby, the disease sleep, well... Trying to made a lot of things, it's so good. Our life is not perfect, but we are happy, the only thing, is ... Nothing will change in the futur, tomorow will be like today, no surprise, no adventure, no children to learn him the name of the the star in the night. Nothing at all, just trying to think it will be more hard. But sometimes, I dream about another live, with another woman who don't know me so well, I would like surprise in my life, I would like the sun, the beach, a lot of smile, and two children runing around me...  Ok life is life, I'm not perfect, And I'm the only personn who can judge me. Like hippo has wrote "Buy you a mirror befor judge me".
