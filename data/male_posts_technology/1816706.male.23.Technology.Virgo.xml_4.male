Me and a couple people from the hostel are going to a cool snorkeling place tomorrow, and then hike Diamond Head again Friday.  Got some new funny pictures up of some of the people I live with.  I have been pretty fortunate with room mates, some shitty ones here and there, but so many cool ones that have taught me so much and given me great ideas, educated me, taught be cool games, it’s great.  Biggest partiers, Kiwis.  Hardest to understand, Scottish, but very friendly and cool still.  Biggest surfers, Aussies.  Funniest, Irish.  Maybe Asians are the hardest to understand.  They love to try and talk with you, and don’t speak a lick of English.  Slept on the beach one night, that was so nice… esp. if I would have had a tent.  Got sand everywhere, nose, eyes, ears, mouth, it was sweet.  Huge waves today at the beach, stepped on a bee.  Hoping things are going to turn into the “beyond?” part of the title of this blog, looking that way too.  Hope everyone is doing ok.  I leave to Maui in a week and will be there for 2 weeks, then off to Kauai for 2 weeks, then back to Oahu.  Should get some cool pics on  Maui and Kauai.
