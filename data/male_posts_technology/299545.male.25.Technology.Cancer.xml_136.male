They'd have to be taking some steroids, I think, in order to let that happen.   urlLink This  is really interesting. I agree that there is little to no chance of this ever happening, but it certainly would make the race more interesting. I remember being very intrigued by John McCain during his NH run 4 years ago while I was in Hanover.
