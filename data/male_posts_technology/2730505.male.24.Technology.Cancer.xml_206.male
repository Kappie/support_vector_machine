Oh I do recall one, Saturday I was able to get  urlLink 5000  Kills and 500 over my deaths.  Yep, what else but Rainbow Six 3 baby.  I played videogames over the weekend yes, it prevents me from spending way too much at the bar and then risking driving drunk as well.  I just buy my booze and then nerd it up.  Yeayuh!  Oh and I was setup with a date with Emily,  urlLink t=0=1=3=1=driftkillz">DriftKillz  girlfriend's friend.  More on that later.  Sunday was a different story though.  I mean what a busy ass day.  See Sunday was the company picnic and Bryce and Jenny were supposed to be there with me to hangout.  Well, the fickle little -BITCH- decided that she wanted to spend that weekend, that was planned a month and a half ago, with her "new" best friend.  whatever, let's not get into that shit.  Anyways, I invited Vicki Thursday after finding out that Jenny wasn't going to make it but she said no too because she had a final this Tuesday (today I guess) and she wanted to study.  Anyways to make it short, I got a call around 10:45 AM - 11:00 AM from Vicki and she was wondering if I was still going to the company picnic.  Well it's a good thing that she did because I was about to sleep till fucking 2 and that's when the game started.  So I just took a shower, bought a shirt on my way to her house because I realized I was wearing a ratty ass shirt and didn't want to look like a bum next to Vicki at the ballgame as well as for my blind date later that evening.  Damn Vicki was looking good.  Short shorts and a nice little baby blue top that was perfect for getting some sun.  Hmm, yeah, she was looking fine.  She just got a cat and that damn cat was like a dog.  I would bring back his toy wagging his tail a freakin' dog.  Left her place and started to drive out to Geneva for the picnic and the ball game.  Good times indeed.  Ate some burgers and a salad and waited for the end of the first inning for some brew.  Surprisingly, one of the head honchos already got beer before the game even started.  Everyone quickly followed suit.  It was hot as hell so the beer was going down smooth and good.  I was sweating my fucking ass off.  So were were just chilling eating and drinking some beer and two people, who will remain unnamed, checked Vicki out like it was going out of style right in front of her.  It was crazy, the boobs got more eye contact her her eyes hehe.  Who can blame them?  I surely can't.  I am guilty of peeking a look here and there.  I couldn't, wouldn't, won't, can't help it.  Oh and there was also this fucking hot tub that was full of old wrinkly people, ugh!  After the game we went over to a co-worker's house and had a little get together.  It was fun.  Goof troop as Vicki put it.  Millet Lite and Bud Lite were at hand as well as some burgers and brats.  Threw baseball around with Vicki as well as the Frisbee (that was actually a plate).  Wrestling was fun as well.  Hehe, even if I lost I still won "per se"  Let's see, who was there, Dave, Tom, John, Suzette, Natalie, Jim, Derek and a couple who I don't know.  Good times.  Here's the only pic my phone took at Dave's house.
