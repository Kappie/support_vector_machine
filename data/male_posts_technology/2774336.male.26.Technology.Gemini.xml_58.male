       Subway Wrap 

       Subway Wrap 

    

    

       Major electric pain in intestines after changing position on chair, only lasted one second. 

    

     

 

 

 I didn't eat anything all day, so I was able to train tonight.  After training I had half a Subway wrap.  About an hour after that I changed my position in my chair, bringing my feet up onto the chair and my knees close to my chest, and I had an extreme pain in my abdomen just below belly button level on my right side.  It felt like electricity being jolted through my intestines, but only for a second (I've been electrocuted before, I know what it feels like).  Then it was gone.  With the feeling came overwhelming nausea but it left with the pain.  I did not vomit.  The pain has not come back. 

 I just now thought about my apendix.  If my appendix had ruptured I would expect a great deal of pain to continue afterwards, and none has.  Perhaps its my imagination, but I feel a light gurgling in my abdomen and it seems to be concentrated in the area of the earlier pain.  That worries me. 

 I had the other half of the Subway wrap at midnight.
