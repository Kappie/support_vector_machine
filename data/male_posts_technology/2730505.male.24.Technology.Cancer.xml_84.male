Here is the email that was composed by the two conspirators as well as critiqued by a third party.  I was contacted earlier today by Gonzo's parents in Chicago. Early Wednesday morning, Gonzo was part of a street race on I-294 outside of Chicago. He lost control of his car, hit the median and his car was totaled.  Currently he is at the University of Chicago Hospital, and preliminary x-rays indicate severe neck trauma. He is currently listed as critical/stable. He is conscious and responding to people.   Erika and I plan on going to Chicago to visit Gonzo this weekend. Anyone wanting to join us please let us know. We will leave Saturday morning. Call us at XXX XXX-XXXX. Gonzo's parents said anyone coming is free to stay with them. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, call me if you have any questions.   Ted  Not too bad.  Almost believable except for the fact that if they did belive it they would immideately call the damn hospital to see if there's a patient that they could transfer me to.  I haven't heard from Ted yet on wether people actually called him although there was an interesting response from Heidi about Chicago.  She said "Chicago, isn't that where Mark and Jessica had their baby? :-)"  Yes, I was found out.  That reply just indicated that she remember's the last time some form of big news was delivered to all around April 1st.  Damn you Mark Pulver Damn you for destroying April Fool's.  You see the reason why April Fool's day will forever be a challenge to pull off from now on is because last year, our great dear friend Mark Pulver decided to really put a big one on everyone.  I wasn't paying attention to the date, all I saw was that Mark and Jessica were having a baby.  The email had something to the effect that Jess is pregnant please pray for us or some shit like that.  Now me, being a father and all, was naturally happy for them and excited.  So I replied back wishing them a good pregnancy and all that shit.  Well it turns out that it was just one big joke.  Well I was duped.  Oh well.  I think a lot of people were duped but eventually caught on.  I, on the other hand, just completely fell on my face with that one.  -------------------------------------------------------------------  Wel North Beach was again the destination last night.  I don't know why, I thought we were going to try out Rip Rocks.  That place is ghetto though.  Yeah, I would rather stick to North Beach even if it turns into more of a sausage fest every damn week.  Last night there was a ration of 1:5 hot/cute vs not hot/alright.  I was appaled to see that no one was dancing.  The place is usually packed with people who -CAN- dance.  Although, there were these two little girls making out on the dance floor.  That had a certain novelty about it that quickly wore off after watching for 30 seconds.  Oh, there was also the really big girl dancing.  She had some moves and a John Deere trucker cap.  Let's see, the volleyball girls were back, didn't watch them enough.  We were trying out lines again.  The line of the night was "Excuse me, do you have a band aid." (no, why?) "Because I scraped my knee when I fell for you."  That really didn't get used that often since the girls were just not present.  The waitresses were saying hi and so were the beer girls and shot girls.  It's kinda sad to know that these people know you because you go there enough but I guess as long as they're cuties, it's all good.  Now at work  wishing it was four  party later  drinking  laughing  talking  friends  time to go yet?
