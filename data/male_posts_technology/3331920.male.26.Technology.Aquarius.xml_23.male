It's been nice weather all weekend, which has really lifted my spirits. Today i also started up a grid computing client on my computer.  Grid computing is a distributed network that allows multiple people's computers all over the world to work together to solve complex equations or problems. The client software on my PC is helping the University of Oxford with Cancer Research. It's a small contribution to be sure, but it's a nice feeling to be able to offer some assistance.  Two completely unrelated notes:  Angel is now collecting Bellydance instruction/workout videos.  Yum!  And, Michael Turner, my favourite comic artist (which isn't saying much, since i'm not a comics fan or collector) is releasing 2 new series this summer, soulfire and ekos.  You can check them out at his new company website,  urlLink Aspen Comics MLT.   I'm out.
