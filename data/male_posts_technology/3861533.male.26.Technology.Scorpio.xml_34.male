It's the British version starring  urlLink Kate Beckinsale , not the  urlLink American one  with  urlLink Gwyneth Paltrow .  As I have read the book and watched the American version at least three times each, I find it hard to see this one from the perspective of someone new to the story. All I can say is that I like it even more than the American version. I've liked  urlLink Kate Beckinsale  ever since I first saw her in  urlLink Much Ado About Nothing  and here she is lovely as ever. Another plus is the fair  urlLink Olivia Williams  in one of her earlier roles. -->
