Well, that's fine, but I knocked out almost immediately at 11+. Took me awhile to hear the phone ring and answer it. Turns out it was my S3 (he's my Major to  urlLink you non-military people   ) calling up for something. Anyway, today must be the day I purposely skipped my Jap class just to nap at home (notwithstanding last Sun coz of the marathon) and I'm aware that I'll have to skip coming Sun's class for the grading too. That means I have only one lesson left. Doubt I'll continue the class coz I want to finish my ePrep online courses for the next 3 mths before I do anything. Think it's a good time for me to attempt to fix in some volunteer work at the SPCA as well. Will see how things goes.  About coming grading. I don't feel prepared. I probably know the syllabus, but I think I need some more refresher on them this week.  And this Thurs... ORD loh! Haha... Got to remember to go get some food to treat the guys when I go back.  Just got a message on Friendster from someone in camp who's in a different unit from me. He's gay and I'm a bit uncomfortable of being told that I'm 'cute'. But I've seen the guy before in camp and he seems friendly+harmless enough. How did I deduce his 'gayness'? His profile lor, he says he is 'Gay + Dull + Stubborn + Persistent + Sensitive + Introverted + Friendly + Loving' and in the 'Who I Want to Meet' section was, 'Non homophobic people'. So I messaged back saying I don't want to sound presumptous but whether he was one. He said yea and he's kinda trying to hit on me. Don't mean to make this sound like a joke but I think he's just being friendly. Hmmm ... my first 'gay' contact online. Think the first time I actually came across gay was my first day of NS in Nee Soon. Do  urlLink you  remember? The 2 storemen issuing out equipment were all 302s (military classification for gays). Anyway, told him I'm probably ok talking to one but I'm totally straight. Hope that's the end of it.
