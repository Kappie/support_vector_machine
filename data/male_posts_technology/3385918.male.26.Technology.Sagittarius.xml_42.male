           
      Well, another WWE PPV is coming up. This time it's RAW's Bad Blood, which will be playing on Sunday. Here are my thoughts on the current card.  We have seven matches, instead of the usual eight. This is actually a good thing. I've noticed recently that most PPVs try to go for the bigger is better approach. The result is that we get all these five to eight minute matches that don't satisfy. They seem rushed and poorly paced. I think that the key here is time management. We have the main events that need time to work out an interesting match, so everything else must be shorten or rushed. This is not a wise idea, given that you also have all those silly back stage segments that you add to give the show a little more entertainment value (not to mention give the talent and crew time to prepare for the next match).   The fewer the matches, the more time they have to develop. The more time to develop, the better the match. The better the match, the better the participants of the match look. This is something the WWE needs. The roster at RAW is currently stacked with young talent that has a lot of potential. The WWE needs to showcase this talent.  Smackdown used to be a real showcase for young stars. The cruserweight division there has a lot of talent, plus it was a means to introduce these talented wrestlers to the masses. Currently they have been pushed aside and forgotten. The division a joke. The show has moved from a solid wrestling show to a mediocre sports entertainment show (something that was really hurting RAW a while back before the final roster changes).  RAW has improved greatly and this PPV is an example of it.  I don't know how the card is going to be distributed. I will just place the matches as I see them listed in the  urlLink Bad Blood official page .   Eugene vs. Jonathan Coachman   I really doubt this is going to start the PPV. This has the potential of being a fun and, most likely, funny match. Still, it's an entertainment only match. Sure, some wrestling moves and some drama will probably be mixed in, but it is not a good way to get your crowd interested in the show. You need something to build on a crowd to make them rowdy and loud. A hot crowd is always a plus in a PPV and the only way to achieve this is to get them emotionally involved in the show. A good opening act is crucial for this, not a filler match played for fun.  I expect this one to be light and funny, given that the "Coach" plays his heel character in a tongue in cheek manner. He needs to be like this cause he isn't really a wrestler, even taught he looks a little more buff than usual and it's apparent that he is getting some sort of training behind the scenes.   The Eugene gimmick has worked out really well. The crowd loves it (or at least it seems like they love it). This gimmick had disaster written all over it and, remarkably, it has worked out really well. Mostly because this guy is really talented. Not in wrestling, even taught it is clear that he is very comfortable in the ring and has his share of cool old school moves. He is very good at playing the crowd, which I think is why his character is getting big pops and raves. Having a lot of funny segments that hit the mark on RAW have helped.   Heck, that's how the team of GoldDust and Booker T had its start. A while back they had these great, solid comedy moments. The crowd loved them. They were fully behind their tag team, but the WWE dropped the ball and missed a solid opportunity to push these guys to the top and keep them their. Their tag team reign should have lasted at least half a year or so. It was that damn good. They had chemistry together. Not many tag teams have that in the WWE.   Anyway, I expect Coachman to cheat and maybe win, even taught the only way I see this happening is if William Regal turns on Eugene, which I feel is not going to happen anytime soon. Expect Garrison Cade to get involved. Maybe even Johnny Nitro, since he lost to Eugene last Monday's RAW and should be looking to get some revenge. Now, what I would really love in this match is that Regal gets involved and starts kicking ass. Hey, I like the guy.   Also... maybe... Al Snow could make an appearance. Why not? Would make the match special, given that he is supposed to be Coachman's best buddy and commentating partner on Heat. That would be cool.  I guess, the logical thing is that Eugene wins. It's a bad gimmick that is turning out really well. This is weird, even for the WWE that has ruined sure fire gimmicks. A loss here, might put the gimmick in jeopardy. I'd say that it's in their best interest to keep the gimmick going and maybe put Eugene to feud with Garrison Cade, there by giving this guy some exposure. It's been a while since I've seen him on RAW.   Winner: Eugene   LA RESISTANCE vs CHRIS BENOIT  EDGE for the World Tag-Team Titles  Many people are guessing this one to be the opening match on the card. Benoit is wrestling twice this night, so why not get this first match over with and have him rest for his next match against Kain later. Expect Edge to be on fire since he is going to have to carry this match. The WWE will not want to have Benoit tiered for the main event. It's only logical that Edge will be the one with the most time in the ring. Benoit will probably get a hot tag here and nothing else.   Rob Conway of La Resistance is a pretty good wrestler. I know he will do his best in this match. His partner, Sylvian Greneir, is...well... green. Still, has potential. A match like this, especially against oponents like Edge and Benoit, will give him an opportunity to shine if he plays his cards right. This is an important match for La Resistance.   Expect La Resistance to retain. Possibly because of an incident between Edge and Benoit that will further fuel a feud between these two (or at least that's what the WWE is hinting that they want to do). A feud between Edge and Benoit could be gold if handled correctly. Edge VS Benoit for the  World Heavy Weight Title would be a great match at the SummerSlam PPV.   A win for the team of Benoit and Edge would mean shit, since these two are better off on their own and not saddled as a tag team. Plus, it will do them good not to win (again, taking into account their possible feud). So, you can bet that La Resistance will get the win here.   Winner: La Resistance   Tyson Tomko vs. Chris Jericho   This would be my guess as an opening match, even taught that the WWE probably isn't going to risk it since Tomko hasn't wrestled a formal match in a ring yet. If they go with this one and Tomko doesn't work out, that will only make the crowd cold and getting that energy back will be an up hill battle. On the other hand, you have Jericho which guarantees that this match will be pretty intense. At least on his part.  I see Tonko winning cause this feud just started and they really want to make Tomko look like a real menace (think Brock and Batista). Heck, last Monday you had a segment where he actually stood up to Kain, before Trish pulled them apart. So, if the WWE believes that this guy has potential, this will open the PPV.   The pressure here is on Tomko. He has to deliver. This is the match, his first actually, that will put him on the map or put him on the road to the Heat program.   Since Tomko is starting out, don't expect a clean win. Expect Trish or even an injured Christian to pop up and help out.   Winner: Tyson Tomko   Victoria vs. Gail vs. Trish vs. Lita   Victoria has had her reputation shot since she started silly dancing and loosing to Gail Kim. This would have been a great match between Gail and Victoria. Heck, they were building Gail Kim for the match. On the other hand, they forgot to develop Victoria, which was a very bad minus for feud. Then, this week on RAW, Gail looses to Lita and everything goes to shit. Trish and Lita are involved in other story lines that may or may not benefit from a title win here. Trish is a long shot. Being added to this match seemed more like an after thought. Her story like with Tomko, Jericho and Christian doesn't give her room to be a women's champion. Heck, since Tomko is most likely going to win thanks to her involvement, then it is logical that she won't win this match.  Lita might benefit a win in her storyline if Kain beats Benoit for the World HeavyWeight Title. This Monday's RAW, we learned that Kain was instrumental in getting Lita involved in this match. He told her that he wanted them both to win titles at Bad Blood. How romantic, huh? Anyway, Lita might win and Kain might loose to Benoit or maybe Lita wins and Kain looses. Maybe they both loose. Who cares? This is a dumb storyline that isn't going anywhere. I just feel sorry for Matt Hardy for being involved in it. Anyway, I hope the WWE has enough sense to keep the title away from Lita, even thought it looks like she could actually win because of this pathetic storyline.   Gail Kim should win. She has improved and has added several neat and flexible submition moves to her arsenal. She has been well developed as a heel in the past weeks. Why stop there? Have her feud against Victoria, Lita and Nidia (what happened to her, anyway?). Why not bring in Ivory to fight with her? Heck, have Molly turn on her and try to take the title from her? Same with Jazz and Trish. They would also like a shot at that title. What's the key word here? FRESH !!! Kim just got back from an injury. Trish and Lita have fought everyone and their mother. Victoria is a great female wrestler, but all that dancing and smiling hurt her character. I'd have Victoria loose and turn psycho again. That would be cool.  Oh, and no more three or four way women's matches, please. It hurts the credibility of the title. Just a clean, one on one match. I have a feeling that they are saving Victoria VS Gail Kim for SummerSlam. What's the problem? Gail Kim lost cleanly to Lita on RAW this week. So, how will this all fit in. It's not about being unpredictable. It's just that it's such a big mess.   Anyway, let's have Gail Kim win and feud with crazy, bitch Victoria (Not dancing fool Victoria). Damn, this whole new gimmick of Victoria dancing is like when Mick Foley became Dude Love. Just not right.  Winner: Gail Kim (even thought Lita will probably win the title so that Kain, when he looses to Benoit, can mess around a while longer in their stupid storyline)        Shelton Benjamin vs. Randy Orton    this match has potential to be a star making match. These two guys are just inches away from the spot light. They both have shown that they can do decent to excellent wrestling matches. The old guys, in their own way, have passed the torch to them. What's missing? A four star match. Can they do it here? I'm pretty sure they can. Why? They are young, fast, energetic... No really big injury to stop them from cutting loose. Hell, they already enough wrestling experience between OVW and their work in RAW to prove that they aren't amateurs in the ring.   Sheltom Benjamin made a name for himself at Smackdown participating in the tag team aptly called "The World's Greatest Tag Team" (formally "Team Angle"). This was one hell of a tag team. Too bad they were split up too quickly. Still, Shelton can now enjoy a single wrestler's career. A career which has been given one hell of a boost since moving to RAW. It's a blessing to be able to say that you've beaten HHH several times.   Randy Orton is such an arrogant bastard. Perfect !!! An excellent heel. People hate him. Heck, my mom wants to kill him every time he watches wrestling on Spike TV. He has the look of a champion and the attitude to boot. When he first came in, he was forced fed to the fans. This hurt him as a face, but gave way to a sudden heel turn after his shoulder injury. Having him involved as a member of the Evolution stable helps. And he has milked it and done as much to keep from being displaced by Evolution's two real main starts: HHH and the great Ric Flair. Batista, on the other hand, wasn't as lucky, even taught it was mostly because he suffered several injuries that have kept him from the Evolution stable and being brutish and dangerously clumsy in the ring is never a good thing.  (Note: Batista has improved and is looking pretty good, but he has to work on that clumsiness. What's my proof? Anyone has seen Tajiri since their match on RAW?)  Another thing that has helped Randy Orton was his last match with Mick Foley, who put him over like he did a while back for HHH. That's one hell of a rub and Randy Orton ran with it, showing that he had the guts and balls (taking tacks on a bare back has to take some deal of balls, no?).  If all goes well and the WWE gives them it's blessing, then this will be their night.  Who will win? That is a real toss up. Depends on what the WWE has planed for them and the InterContinental title. I have a feeling that Shelton Benjamin will be feuding with Batista after this match (or at least after Randy Orton moves onto another opponent). So, I'm going to say that Shelton wins.   I'm guessing the WWE will want these two to continue their feud until Edge finishes his planned feud with Benoit and maybe have Shelton continue to feud with Batista or Kain.   I was just thinking that the main event scene is looking pretty good on RAW. Benoit, Edge, HHH, HBK, Kain (I have faith that the WWE is going to wise up and start using this guy correctly... yeah, right!)... Plus we have on the wings Randy Orton, Batista and Shelton Benjamin.   After this match, Shelton Benjamin and Randy Orton move into the main event scene. Which is good, cause HHH and HBK might take some well earn vacation time (and I have a feeling that after their Hell in a Cell match, they are going to need it).   Winner: Shelton Benjamin     Chris Benoit vs. Kane   The build up for this match was bizarre, given that more attention was placed on the Kain - Lita - Matt Hardy storyline. Then Kain turns against Eugene for a Benoit save that might have done more harm than good to Kain's reputation as a monster. The only interesting moments in this feud where in the beginning when Kain won the battle royal that gave him a contender shot at the title (even thought I've said that his winning the battle royal while being involved in another storyline was absurd... Actually, I still say it).   Benoit could pull off a main event match in his sleep. This guy is a wrestling machine. Kain used to be great until he was humiliated and crushed under HHH political grasps. This match could actually give Kain a second chance to prove himself worthy.   Heck, if the WWE decides to give Kain a win and have Benoit keep feuding with him all summer, it wouldn't be a bad thing. Only two things. Kain has to give 100% and prove he can be a wrestling monster in the ring and his story line with Lita and Matt must end. If not, have Benoit keep the title and let Kain feud with Matt (or, possibly, a returning Jeff Hardy).  Since Benoit will probably loose his first match of the night against La Resistance, given way to a rumored feud with Edge, then it's logical that he will keep the title.   Winner: Benoit   Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H   What can I say? I expect nothing short of a bloodbath. This is the match that will make or break this PPV. Giving these guy's track record, this might end up being one for the books. Also, these too seem to have an ego problem. That is one thing that will keep these two from underperforming this night. Also, supposedly, these guys are not going to be available for RAW after this match, which means that they have to really fuck each other up badly to explain their absence from RAW.  This will most definitely be HELL. The cell is just a bonus.  Winner: Hopefully, a very bloody and bruised HBK.    Well, that's the card. Looks pretty good... on paper. Usually, one thinks that there is no way the WWE can't fuck up something this "good" (sure, could be better, but for a Bad Blood PPV, this is a pretty good card). That doesn't mean they won't try. There is one match that has the potential to be entertaining (Eugene vs. Jonathan Coachman), two to be excellent (Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H and Shelton Benjamin vs. Randy Orton), one to be really good (LA RESISTANCE vs CHRIS BENOIT  EDGE), two that are up in the hair (Benoit vs Kain and Tyson Tomko vs. Chris Jericho) and one filler match (*sigh* Victoria vs. Gail vs. Trish vs. Lita). This is much better than last month's judgment Day and, by the looks of it, it's going to be better than Smackdown's next PPV ("The Great American Bash").   I rarely buy PPVs, especially WWE PPVs. I usually wait for them on DVD. It's been months since I bought a WWE PPV DVD. Why? Cause they suck. They've been sucking for a long while now. Had expected to buy the WMXX dvd, but decided against it. I usually find other...erm... alternative ways to watch the matches that interest me. Nothing usually calls out "buy the WWE" anymore (except for the excellent Ric Flair and Mick Foley DVDs which I did buy and greatly enjoy). This PPV has "buy the DVD" written all over it. This Sunday I will read the results of the Bad Blood PPV and tell you if I am still interested in buying this DVD when it comes out on sale.   See you then !!!   urlLink Sailor Ecchi
