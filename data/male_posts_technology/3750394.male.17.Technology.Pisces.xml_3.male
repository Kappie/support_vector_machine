I had to babysit my Aunt's dog, who is cute, but a PAIN IN THE ASS! to take care of, what high needs :P.  Phil came over later, played 'XIII', which actually is a surprisingly good game with a great story line to it.  As for tomorrow?!, we'll see how the day unfolds, my bro and dad are going golfing with the principal from my dad's school, and my moms @ work, so we'll see what I'll find to do.  Nite all!
