Then, I slept through first period, studied through second, grabbed a bite to eat at break, sped through third period, floundered through fourth.  I rethought the meaning of life, and God's purpose for humanity as a whole, while staring at Gwen during lunch.  I breezed through sixth period (lunch counts as fifth), died during seventh, and slept through eighth.  I then spaced out on the bus, daydreamed in one of Farzad's 57 (yes, I am so freaking serious - 57!) cars (a Black VW Beatle) on the way home, and dozed through my piano lesson.    Once I was home for good, I studied the Bible for about 45 minutes, and laid down on my bed for ½ an hour, contemplating cleaning my room.  Finding little to no pleasure in that, I started to do random work on my computer, and that's about where I am now.  Tomorrow I plan to walk down to Andy’s house, and spend the day with him and Gwen (well, the day, up until 3:30).  Then, I will possibly drop by Bwitty’s house, and say hi to her and Jamie.  After which, at about 7:00 everyone from my growth group is coming over for a Bible study.
