Last week I met with one of the program coordinators, Jackie Perhach, at a new charter school in Pittsburgh named  urlLink City High . They have a mentorship and internship program for technology and education. The school is focus on educating children using technology; all of the kids have a laptop and are exposed to more technology than at the average high school. She introduced me to three children interested in the internship. I suggested that I meet with the children and their parents this week toward the end of our internship meeting. They came and I discussed what I was up to and what I would expect from the children and the parents (as far as being involved with their child's progress during the internship). They all seem pretty excited about the opportunity for their children to learn this technology. This should be an interesting experience considering that these kids know very little so far... I'm getting down to the line with some of the things I need to finish and it's going to be a time commitment to teach them what they need to know.  sigh    Right after the meeting, I found out that my friend Gregg was going to be downtown checking out the Young Republicans (YR). We talked about going together... I was planning to go to the Ben Folds 5 concert downtown but the weather was really questionable, so I decided to go to the YR meeting instead.   I am still registered as an independent, but that's about to change... Over the last two years or so I've been working on getting rid of the many grey areas in my life. Through my investigation and all my politically oriented conversations, I just can't understand why anyone would want to be a democrat. My perception is that often people that consider themselves to be democrats really have a very soft platform of beliefs in that they usually say what they don't believe in or what they disagree with, but never really what they stand for. They seem to futily grasp for it in a pretty disappointing way. On the other hand, it is very clear to me what most Republicans stand for. It makes much more sense to me.   In addition, Pittsburgh really sucks lately; there's not many young people here, there's mostly an old boring REALLY REALLY conservative BORING... old population. Allegheny county has the second highest elderly population in the US out of all counties. uugh. While the city could be a good place to live and there are lots of fun things to do here, most visitors would never know; they're going to look downtown when they come and they'll see a dead city... all of the action usually occurs on the edge of the city - on the south side, in the strip district, and in Oakland... and the city transforms during the summer when the students are on break... and the city is bankrupt and corruption abounds. We need a new generation of politics and we need to get some republicans up in here ' cause... well, Pittsburgh has been run completely by democrats for a very very very long time and this it's no longer a city filled with smoot and unionized steel factory workers. It now all about technology, research, and entrepreneurship. The democrats are killing the economy of the Pittsburgh, uugh. It's just not working. So... I'm gonna get involved with Gregg and others and see what kind of difference I can make.   We all met at Bossa Nova downtown. I thought Gregg would be there already, but he wasn't. Most of the people that were already there were clicky and not very social right off, but I ended up making a lot of friends after all and my friend, Pat Doheny, who is a lawyer happened to be there too. I was surprised that he was a republican - most lawyers in Pittsburgh are democrats ... or say that they are.   We all went up to the office that they had in the same building at about 7:30 PM. I joined up. They had lots of (good) pizza, beer, and other beverages (and some pretty good cookies). It was also pretty social. I actually had a great time! We listened in on a conference call with Laura Bush and George W. actually got on to toward the end of the conversation...   After our time up there, a bunch of went back down to Bossa Nova and had some conversation and fun:   urlLink       urlLink    urlLink    Jon Cho came down and joined us... and then Alan did, too. I was trying to get Jenica and her friend to come down but they decided to take it easy.   urlLink    urlLink     Cho, Me, and Alan   urlLink     then... Guess where we went? hehe ... DejaVu of course! I got there first since Cho forgot to pay his bill and had to go back to Bossa Nova. It was a special night since the Playboy Playmates were there or something. I must have missed that, but I found my friend Courtney Lidell and danced and little. Jon joined me when he got there. Jon wants to change the name of our nascent party-throwing group from Old School Productions to Liquid Means... sounds good to me, we'll see what everyone else thinks soon I guess.    urlLink     Jon came back with a VERY strong drink - a manhattan. I guess the newbartender didn't know exactly what she's doing yet. When I went to get Jon a drink a little later, she did it again; when she was done filling the drink it wasn't near full and of course I said something... she filled the rest of the way with Maker's Mark, haha. I do have to congratulate DejaVu on hiring what has to be the hottest bartender I have ever seen... wow. Her name is Coral rarrrr:    urlLink    I saw Chef James eating some ravioli and they smelled SOOO good... I spoke with him and he hooked Jon and I up with a deal on the same plate. YUMMMM!   urlLink    ...Alan was up there, too... and later Jeff Bagley, Scott, and Chris showed up to hang, too. After googling over Coral for a little we headed downstairs. Jon, Alan, and I hung out with Lacey and Daniel... man their crazy. I dated Lacey for like... a week a couple of months ago, but now we're just friends. They're pretty... Uninhibited, haha and a lot of fun.   Me, Lacy, Alan, and Daniel   urlLink    Here are the pics I decided were tame enough to post, haha...   urlLink    urlLink    And I made some new friends.I met this girl named Caroline, a fresh young professional. If I remember correctly she's graphic designer for a firm in the city.   urlLink    urlLink    Yeah... I'm sorry, but they forced me tograb her ass during this picture... I didn't want to... yeah, right.   urlLink    ...we left DejaVu at close and re-grouped at Primanti Bros. Restaurant there in the strip district. I was pretty darn tired... I really hadn't slept well the night before, uugh. Hahaha, I remember Scott and I keeping each other company on the way home. He had initially called me because he saw Coral coming out of DejaVu when she left work and was driving behind her... and just wanted to share. Fun conversation.
