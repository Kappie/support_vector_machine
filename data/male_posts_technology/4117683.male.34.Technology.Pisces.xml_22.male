Lets start this thing...  as of right now I am a 34 year old, depressed, separated from a cheating slut, recovering heroin addict addict (thanks to the slut!), and once again living with my parents. Oh yea and a stranger in a strangeland... I moved from Los Angeles, Ca to East Haven, CT! I don't know anyone, and the one person that I did met is also on methadone, too far in to Nine Ince nails, dresses like a a wanna be punk-industrial high schooler(I think she is between 25-30ish I have no idea), nothing I want to get involved with.  I am a computer geek, i have been playing with computers since 1983! I started on a Atari 400. and I got my first computer in 1984 which was a Atarti 6ooxl, and within one year I upgraded to a 8ooxl, and then I started fone PHreaking, Hacking and Pirating Warez. I stopped hacking and PHreaking on June 18th 1988 a week or so before I went in to the navy, soon after I found out what N.A.V.Y. Stands for...Never Again volunteer Yourself! More about Navy stuff later....  Well, lets talk a bit about the Psycho-Slut ok?  Back in 1994 I was running my BBs called 22, AcaciA Avenue on PCBoard, and I have this User with the name of "Dude From Calabases", well later I found out that He lived in Reseda, Ca, but he also ran a Porn BBs, and after he came over to hang out and trade Warez I found out that also ran a party line called  urlLink KFONE  well he wanted to set me up with a free account, since I have had little to no luck with women for a while back then... But I said no, come-one man I wouldn't be caught dead on something like that! So about 6 months later he came back to my pad, and then he tricked me! He asked me for a 4 digit number... I said, "1234" that was taken, so then I tried 4321. and then he asked for a phone number. so I gave him my old BBs number at my parents house when I was a teen-ager. Ok Joe, you now have a account on KFONE! Well 6 months later I was stoned and very bored, so I called... Then I ended up chatting with 2 girls named Gina, and Erin. Before I left fucking around they were trying to convince me that they loved me.... I ingnored them. So I started chatting with this girl named Marie... Well I found out that she was still 17, and at this time I was 24! Can we say Jailbait! Well needless to say I also started chatting with that weirdo Erin... So she found out that I liked Nine Inch Nails, so We get to know each other and in April '95 I asked Erin and Marie if they wanted to see Rocky Horror at the Newart in Santa Monica. So I made arrangement to pick up Erin the Friday before, and I did. When I met her, it was like Love at first sight. Up until that point I thought it was bullshit. But it happened to me. Within the first 10 minutes we were finishing off others sentences! It was really fucking scary. Well in may 4 of that year I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend.. and in about a month she moved out of her mothers house and in to my Apartment.  Ok Lets jump!  We got married on May 4th 1998, 3 years to the day That I asked her to be my girlfriend.... That Oct. She found someone who did heroin, and she wanted to buy some! I was very much against it! I told her not to, but she never listened to me.... Famous last words, "I do not see any good coming out of this!" Boy was I right... After 2 months of her pressuring me in to try it... Oh its a good high, You don't have to main line it.. I'll shoot it in you butt. So I finally gave in in like late Nov. and her best friend April was there. So she shot in my ass, and boy it was good.... There aint no high like heroin!... Well Erin, Ape and I had a bucked up 3-some... cos when I touched Aprils tit Erin started going off on me.... Well Needless to say I got addicted to heroin also. I almost lost my job... But in April 1999 I went through what is called ambulatory(sp) Detox. Basically they gave some meds (nothing good) I got Motrin, and something to sleep, something for my tummy, and a heart med, which they also use to heroin detox... Well I cleaned up, and Erin failed.. Surprised? Nope!  Well, over the next year and a half she is still using and shooting up my whole paycheck , and then asking daddy for money for the bills, and I caught hell cos it looked like I could not be a man and pay the bills. But in truth I had a job where I was making $23.00/hr, and she would go though it within a week! I remember one time I bought myself a check computer, and boy she she pitch a fit, cos I spent money, and she couldn't! After the whole weekend of her yelling at me, calling ME worthless (ok Mrs. Junky) I ended up returning it, and I'll give you one guess what happened to that money... For Bills? For cat food? For human food? Nope right in to her fucking vein!!! So about Nov 2000 I had a mirgrine, and I was getting really depressed often (this was before I was diagnosed with depression, actually I think with was the starting cause), so I asked Erin to fix me.... Well needless guess what happened... I got addicted... I ended up losing my good job, I lost my apt, cos I filled out a check for Erin to get it to the office, which was 200 ft fro our door, and sher didn't do in until the 18th at that point they told us that they were not going to accept it, and they were gonna kick us out! So I lost my job, I lost my home, I ended up moving in with my mother-in-law, and then to my father-in-law cos Erin cousin Jeff started a fight with me... and I am lucky Erin stopped it cos I would of lost bad! And I got on Methadone replacement!  In April 2004 I was still unemployed, on methadone, and finally getting treated for depression. One day in that April she walked in to room and told me that she has been cheating on me with this kid (21) named Mark! I stayed suppressing calm! So on the weekend of the 16th I went to my Sisters house for the day, and I ended staying there until Sunday afternoon. When I got back to the house she wasn't there so I gathered a few of my things cos I was gonna leave her.... So I decided if Erin comes in the house yelling at me I wans gonna leave... Well guess what, she did, but there was a twist... She had her brother shaun there, 19 years old, about 6'1" and could kick my ass... So when she started yelling I said Ok, I am gonna leave you! Bye, well she lost it... She started hitting me and saying that I owe HER money, actually I owe her parents, not her. Well I took a few things and left. I called my brother in the valley and they were o their way... So on my way to the meeting place Erin showed up trying to beg me to came back, and I did not. I walked away. I finally stood up to her. and now I was free of her! So I thought!  I ended up moving out to my parents house in East Haven, CT but I has a return ticket cos My baby sister was gonna get married!, well at 530 on July 2 my brother Kevin told my dad that Dena, my sister, was hit by a car on her motorcycle, and she was going in to brain surgery now! By 900am they were on a plane back to LA, and I was in this house alone. Not good for my depression! Well I sent Erin a list of things that I would like her to gather for me cos I was gonna be out there.... So I finally get out there.. and then the Sunday before I was gonna go back to CT, Kevin, Christie (kev's wife), and My dad went with me to Erin's. Originally it was suppose to me just Kevin and I. Well Erin had her usual hissy fit, and I found out that she didn't do shit for me. All the shit that I did for her, she couldn't do this simple thing for me! While I was there she told me that she has been sleeping with all these guys... Before we meet she told me that she wanted to be a slut, and I was her first, and her last. Well I guess now she is living out her slutty dreams! FUCK THAT BITCH! I hope you see this blog too bitch! BTW: I want my shit!  Well I need to sleep. I will do my best to add stuff to this.. I have poems, and songs, and other things I plan on adding to this.. so keep a look out, and if you do read this please let me know!  Thank you, Your Host,  Joe M.
