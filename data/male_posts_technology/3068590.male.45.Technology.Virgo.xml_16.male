(Click on the title to be taken to the old site)  I wanted to add that in Canada we have a historical site called "head smashed in Buffalo jump." The site documents the native method of herding the Buffalo over cliffs.  I was thinking that there may also be a strong analogy between the Buffalo (again) and the energy industry (again). The fact that the commodity prices have risen so substantially has created a new operating environment for oil and gas companies. However, it is also just as remarkable that the companies have not changed any of their thinking regarding the approach to oil and gas.
