That was the message delivered by the catholic church, as exposed by BBC's Panorama tonight.  In an excellent piece of reporting following up on last years revelations that "condoms have holes in which allow HIV to pass thru and infect people", not only did the BBC debunk this myth, they showed the true level of hypocrisy and ignorance in one of the worlds biggest religious institutions.  When it comes to people dying from HIV, the church doesn't care.  When asked "Is is possible you are making a mistake?", the bishop said "yes".  The reporter asked the bishop:  	 "Are you saying it would be better to die that to use a condom?" 	"Yes" 	"Isn't that doctrine a little harsh?" 	"Christ's teachings were never easy."  As an organisation, the catholic church speak the words of love for your neighbour, but the perform the actions of hatred, death and damnation.  Christ said, "for the tree is known by his fruit" (Matthew 12:33) - like the fundamentalist pharisees of whom Jesus was speaking, the catholic church is filled with hypocrites who say one thing and do another.  The fruit of this tree is maggot-ridden, moudly and poisonous.  I cannot put into words how such a position reviles me.  It goes against every fibre of my being: to continue to teach something which will, without doubt, kill people who need not die is murder as surely as it is murder to plunge a knife into someone's heart.  Many Baptist and Anglican Christians, many of whom are close, dear friends, say, "but that's the Catholic Church, we're different.  Don't tar us with the same brush."  I know these friends believe that the position espoused by the catholic bishops is extreme and wouldn't go so far as to say that death is better than using a condom, but they cannot in outright condemn the position either.  They support the position that sex outside of marriage (and marriage is a holy institution between a man and a woman, lest you forget it) is sinful.  They would agree with the bishops position that there must be something wrong with someone who cannot say no to sex.  Many of them agree that abstinence is the way forward.  It's a position of denial.  The deny that people might have sex.  They deny that poverty and social circumstances increases the amount of "promiscuity".  They deny the very existence of gays.  People who believe this ignore reality.  Ignorance is not a lack of knowledge; it's having the knowledge and choosing to ignore it in favour of a more acceptable position.  And boy are these people choosing to be ignorant.  The concept of "natural law" is another example of deliberate ignorance.  "Dog's don't use condoms" said another ignorant catholic bishop.  He's quite right of course, dog's tend not to use contraception.  Equally, dog's tend not to be around to look after the puppies later on.  A dog's commitment at the stage of the fuck isn't to 20 years of upbringing and the social economic strains that places on an individual.  The dog isn't even too concerned about prevent HIV, gonnorhoea, herpes or any of the other free gifts you can get when you go skinny dipping.  "Natural law" is an entirely artificial construct.  It's a promotion of all that is perceived to support the doctrine in question, and deliberately ignoring anything which might hinder "the truth".  Remarkably like the concept of "family values".  Equally arbitrary, equally vague and equally ridiculous.  We live in a society which accepts  ignorance-by-choice and promotion of murder in the name of religious freedom.  I don't personally see how we match our values of human rights with these murderous hypocrites.  Perhaps it's time we re-evaluated what is more important to us: freedom to hate or freedom to live.
