BTW here is some which will not bring any copyright issues for sure...'coz this was written by me....he he he..." ok then c u all in my next blog...       It's between a dawn and a dusk, My head on my desk, Dead are my mind, But the work I should mind... Though I tend to work, My lids tend to sleep.  A girl in my dream, One from the cream. A dream that's so rare, which wasn't a nightmare.  She passed by me, And made my self freeze, Had no doubt in me, She was a passing breeze.  She looked at me, I looked at her, Stunned at once, seeing each other.  Its that moment, when she passed by me, Its her face That went into my heart's base.  With a will in my day, I walked through the bend On her way till the bay, to see a face... that's filled with gay.  As I rushed so fast, I left her go my past. In a dream not so bright, Amidst the dim dull light, When I turned to my right, It was the same face so bright.  The moment I cherished, When my dream now got perished. In my damn dumb terminal, Again a day full of work. Let me wait for a dusk, till my head is again on my desk.... to see that girl in my dream who's one from the cream...
