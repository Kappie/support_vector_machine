Overall it still seemed as though I wasn't getting many cards.  When I looked it over in PokerTracker I had only played 11% of the flops and that kind of proved what I was thinking.  Anyway, I was able to make what I did get pay off and thought I maximized hands fairly well.  One thing much different today was that when I needed to push all in and I had a good hand, generally they stood up.  Much different than yesterday.   Anyway, I was able to post a positive day.  It wasn't huge by any means, but if I can continue chipping away then soon I'll be back on track.  Until tomorrow :)
