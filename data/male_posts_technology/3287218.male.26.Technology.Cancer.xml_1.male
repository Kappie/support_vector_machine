Well this morning at sometime (I will still half asleep) it was making clicking noises. So I shut it off and went back to bed.  Well, I got up this morning around 8:30ish. I didn't feel like dealing with it.  I was going to go help my dad sell flowers at Messiah College's graduation.  But when I call him at 8:45 the flowers werent there.  So I didnt go.  I am sitting inmy apartment in the cool of the AC and I give a try to boot up this computer.  It turns on, no noise.  And it seems to be booting ok and I think its completely booted up.  Well....I have another program to connect to the server and see the screen...and that wont connect.  So I hooked up a monitor to it and during the loading of Windows 2000 it doesnt even begin to load.  It stops and of course my keyboard is dead so I cant reinstall.  Oh well....tough crap.  Off to Circuit City to buy a new keyboard.
