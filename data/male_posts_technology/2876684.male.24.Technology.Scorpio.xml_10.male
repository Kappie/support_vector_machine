(Yes, that included walking, train, AND bus. All I need to do now is take the ferry everyday and get the most out of my weekly travelpass.)   I was getting pretty annoyed because I received a phone call from Melbourne just after I got to Westfield, asking where everything was in relation to the Iraqi project and everything - obviously in the back of my mind I'm thinking, "Well, if someone had just bought my ticket as agreed I would have been there 2 weeks ago and sorted whatever needed sorting and everyone wouldn't have to go through this. AGAIN."  Anyways we stopped by a videogame store and Jenni (AKA Buffy Freak) spotted a Buffy game for PS2. Naturally, she wanted to buy it, despite the fact that she's leaving for HK in two days time and our protests...  "Buy it in HK! It'll be cheaper!"  "Don't buy it now! You won't even play it before you go!"  which were obviously were in vain, since she ended up buying the darn thing anyway. Damn Buffy Freak. Well, she did buy this "EyeToy"  , which I won't go into detail about because I don't want to leave any incriminating evidence that I actually used the thing. Haha! :P  Got to the dojo early today to help Shihan out with the front desk - he had sent Big John and Sensei Jon off to Rose Bay for the night just to have a change. He (Shihan) was still feeling a bit crook from something he ate on the weekend, apparently he was throwing up and stuff on Monday... never a good thing. However, Shihan being Shihan, his classes are always hard and I felt absolutely wrecked after training.  He was a bit upset with John though, because the front desk was in a bit of a mess and I realised it too after going through stuff - things weren't where they were supposed to be and we had run out of insurance forms (which every member MUST sign if they are to be included in our insurance policy). So yea, while it was nothing that major, it was enough to be of concern. I told Shihan I'd be coming in earlier to training just to sort out stuff like that. Poor John is always wrecked from training being an Uchi Deshi so he doesn't get much time in the day just to relax, so I understand how he feels.
