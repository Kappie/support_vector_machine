Read it if you dare, but remember, if you get a pain in the front center of your head, similar to the pain experienced while eating ice cream too fast (brain freeze), slow down, read a comic strip and then come back to it.   For you advanced readers out there, try reading it out loud in Tele-Evangelist style. It's a "hoot".   TO: Michael/or Software Interpretor     From: Bonnie   Automated Report section looks impressive however the scope of it and the sequential clickings in order to establish one single context of a desired objective is not clear to me.   I have somewhat rummaged around, however I find I do not prefer bouncing around from screen to screen without a direction.  How does one obtain GUIDANCE ?  Does modem maddness offer this? or is this Internet teacher time?   In any event I would like Solar Power emails and any form from Lily Dale Assembly OFFICE so as to be able to communicate with them for convenience.  My email to them for the first time was blocked.  It was indicated that a form was suppose to emerge enabling me entry.  That had not resulted.  In any event the rest of the SPAM entries can be deleted.     I clicked on release for Solar Power and Forms thinking they would show up in the INBOX of my email.  Obviously it is not that simplified.  So obviously I am missing some steps here in order to retrieve desired mail.   Do you have a vocabulary - dictionary of interpretations of words used in automated report enabling me direction in choice selections, that I can print out and refer to for future encounters?   Irregular use of software programs does not permit ready recall plus aging, so I am requesting any supportive feedback to make this as painless as possible while not having to write email to tech support for mutual benefit.   Many thanks! EOM   I'm glad I have a 6-pack of beer waiting for me at home, especially after getting emails like hers. OY!
