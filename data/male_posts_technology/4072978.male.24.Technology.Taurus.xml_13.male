So, there is this place  urlLink Gmail Swap , that lets you post what you will trade for a gmail invite. Well I've posted SEVERAL times, the first time I offered to help with computer problems(no responses), second a six digit ICQ# I own (some responses no takers), third the ICQ# again just so I can see if I could get someone to bite (nope, just responses again but people are to afraid of being hussled), and lastly.... a promise to send them a copy of The Ultimate Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Dogulas Adams. Gold Dirt! Who can say no to that? So far I have had two offers  Update: I had a total of four takers
