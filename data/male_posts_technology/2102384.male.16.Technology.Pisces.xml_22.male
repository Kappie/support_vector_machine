I can get the newest CSI espisode recorded from an HDTV in an hour or two via bittorrent.  I use  urlLink SharpReader  to see when my favorite (blogs  news sites  torrent site  other RSS-supported sites) are updated.  I just click on the links to the shows in SharpReader and the torrent opens right up.  I use  urlLink Torrents.co.uk  and  urlLink #TVTORRENTS  to find torrents.  #TVTORRENTS also has an IRC room on news://irc.efnet.org.  The instructions for the IRC chat are at  urlLink IronFish.org .   I can't wait for the summer.
