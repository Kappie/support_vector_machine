    
       Another 20 minutes to go and I'm ready to finish work, another week out of the way working for the UK Government.  Tonight I'll be mostly watching 'Troy', having secured two tickets to the opening night in Leicester Square, London. This is Day 3 of my movie fest having already watched 'Kill Bill Vol 2', 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' and 'Van Helsing'. I still want to watch 'Bus 174' and 'Monster' but I'm also desperate to get back to my web development of  urlLink Project TPR .  Having got blitzed last weekend, spending Â£350 over 3 nights at Tiger Tiger its taken me most of the week to recover. The first two days were spent topping up with water. The next three starving myself as the bathroom scales strained under the added duress of excessive partying.
