Dominant in the Honda for the past 4 years, Rossi chose to leave to take up his bitter rivals drive of a Yamaha. Although a competitive offering, the budget and scope of Yamaha was sizeably smaller then Honda's effort. Rossi's rivals stated that if they had the Honda they would also win, so Rossi obliged them.  To take the pole was a surprise.  To win consecutive races on different machines has never been done.   To win consecutive championships on different machines has never been done, and only done on different machines in a career once before.  This is what a true champion thinks and does. The otherwise impossible.  Michael Schumacher is nowhere close to attaining any of the respect that he claims with Rossi now in the picture. Schumacher should have long ago swapped rides with either Mika Hakkinen or Jacques Villinueve, or even join them at the same team.   As the prior blog entry reflects, Rossi's championship makeup is established. It is time for Schumacher to begin to better manage his career before he becomes a brief anomaly in the history books.
