In the meantime, well, now you know why I haven't answered your messages (if you've sent any).  O Mr. Leonard:  How did you see my draft post?   I  can't find it myself.  I printed your message and plan to read it to the Smiths this weekend.  Nobody pick on Kristen next week.  Nobody tire her out.  Everybody make her week the easiest ever.  Everybody.
