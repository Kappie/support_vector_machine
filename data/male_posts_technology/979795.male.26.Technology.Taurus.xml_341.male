I mentioned "Is it me or do the standard of people taking the grading seem to be lowering these days?" Well first of all I see myself having been stagnant and even backsliding a bit to a certain extent for a period. Second, certain gradings just don't seem as intense as the one(s) I had seen before. However, I also realised that every batch of students will be different. Some improve fast and some slow, while some others don't. The 'standard' of improvement is also on an individual level too. Let's say for example some dude did just OK during his 6th kyu test, but suddenly he did better than normal during his 5th kyu test. Such improvement(s) is relative and varied in different ways. It may be philosophical, technical, even personal (attitude, habits, etc). What we see during a grading is not the whole picture. To be specific, I've always felt that Soh was a pretty stiff uke whenever I paired up with him few years back. But he has seriously improved a lot since then and that difference really impresses me (though I'd still prefer another uke instead. Guess I'm still standing on the same point instead of moving on and 'improving' this attitude :P ). Something along the 'some horses run slow first then pickup speed, while some run fast at first and get's punctured later on' theory. Also, I'm trying to remember that such things can't be 'compared' with others. I mean what's the point right? So long as there's personal improvement, it really doesn't matter how much. Just as long as you're happy with how much you've grown. If you're not, well that's where you work towards it I suppose.  What (I think) I really want to say is that, despite being bad at what you do now, don't mean you can't be good / improve later. Maybe the problem will be how much we really want to improve and actually committing ourselves into it to do it. Whether achieving it or not, well I guess there'll still be no regrets with the results. But what about in cases where you can't afford to fail? Hmm, gimme some time to dwell on that. Haven't thought out a moderated thought on this yet.  All this thinking of my career kinda made me visit the SPF website once again. Just noted that as of this year, salary stated on site will be reduced by 15%. Well, still not a big deal to me considering I didn't want this because of the money. But I'm considering applying to CNB too. Actually given a choice, I would've wanted to do uniform service in the early years (4-6), try out 1-2 years of UN peacekeeping, and then maybe opt for a transfer to somewhere eg. CNB, CID, etc, depending on what I've learned in the force. Haiz, just hope I can be shortlisted someday. Pity I can't just waltzed in and sign on.
