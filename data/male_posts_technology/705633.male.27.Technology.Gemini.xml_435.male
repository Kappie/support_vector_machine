They are in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings.  The teacher asks the States Member if he would like to lead the class in the discussion of the word, “tragedy." So the States Member asks the class for an example of a "tragedy." One little boy stands up and offers, "If a project which cost the people of Jersey lots of money was finished like a hole to keep Storm water in, only to find it didn’t work, that would be a tragedy."  "No," says The States Member, "that would be an ACCIDENT." A little girl raises her hand: "If a promise to reduce the cost of housing, making property purchases more available to young people. Maybe by building first time buyers flats on the waterfront was taken back once they discovered the flats were worth too much money and had to be sold on the private market for hundreds of thousands of pounds, that would be a tragedy."  "I'm afraid not," explains The States Member.  "That's what we would call a GREAT LOSS." The room goes silent.  No other children volunteer.  The States Member searches the room.  "Isn't there somebody here who can give me an example of a tragedy?" Finally, way in the back of the room, a small boy raises his hand.  In a quiet voice he says, "If Chamber of Commerce building seating all the states members, were struck by a missile and blown to smithereens, by a terrorist like Osama bin Laden, that would be a tragedy." "Fantastic!" exclaims The States Member, "That's right.  And now can you tell me WHY that would be a tragedy?" "Well," says the boy, "because it wouldn't be an accident, and it certainly wouldn't be a great loss."
