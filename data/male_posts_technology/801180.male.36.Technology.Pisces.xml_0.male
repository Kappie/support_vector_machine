Yesterday I spent most of the morning adding a main switch into the electrics so that I don't have to keep pulling the fuse to work on the new consumer unit.  The house needs so much electrical work doing on it, I thought it best to try and make the task as safe as possible in future.  Problem is, all the wires you aren't legally allowed to change, were too short!  Never mind got round it in the end!  Spent most of the day in the garden, trimming the tree, continuing the never ending shed base foundations, taking up the old garden path, all whilst watching the kids!  Evern got time to wash the car.  What a difference a bit of sunshine makes!  Temperature must be about 13 degrees, which in the scheme of things is really quite warm, giving that it has been frosty for the last few weeks.  Anyway I have just kind of realised that blogging, potentially is a flawed medium - by this I mean that if I have a different take on a situation, whether it be world news or my mates barbeque - then if I pour out my thoughts in a blog and others don't like it, then it can cause problems.  So blogs are never going to be out pouring of the heart, unless you are very secure in the knowledge that you are not going to annoy someone close to you.
