Feel kinda bad cos she did spend like half an hour talking to me yesterday to try and persuade me. Damm my raging hormones, next time I should just say no immediately.  Yesterday I went to the general office in NTU to look for Simon's office and I went into the office , the woman at the desk told me no students were allowed in the room. When I told her that I was a staff there , she was pretty surprised and said that I was looked young and handsome to be a staff there. Ok so she didn't really say the yong and handsome part , but thats what she thought cos I could see the lustful look in her eyes, and I know it cos I have seen that same look in so many middle-aged women that I have met. Then she started following me around using the pretense that she wanted to help me find the office, but I thankfully Appie called me and told me to get back to the lab. Damm it's so hard being the stallion sometimes.
