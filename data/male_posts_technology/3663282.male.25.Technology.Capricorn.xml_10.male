A colleague of mine actually fell asleep in the meeting room. Me, I asked questions. That was the only way I could think of to keep myself from falling asleep. And it worked, for a while. After that, I started feeling sleepy. Luckily for me, another colleague of mine passed me a note, although we were sitting side by side. Hehehe. So that perked me up quite a bit. After the note passing, we managed to chat with each other without actually using our voices. Isn't that amazing! Hehehe. A few minutes after that, the discussion ended. Much to our delight. Hehehe...
