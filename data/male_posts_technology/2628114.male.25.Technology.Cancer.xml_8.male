Shin splints suck just as much.  Running inside is about 800 times hotter than running outside.  I was 10 times more distracted indoors than out.  Motivation was down drastically because of running indoors and not feeling like getting anywhere.  I've been having really annoying cramps in my legs since the run even though I thoroughly stretched before and after.  I'm officially committed to the Pig after signing up today for the run and my chip (>$90)  Yada yada yada
