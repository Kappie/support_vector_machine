Right now, my family is coping with my Grandma (She who begat vador) who is in late stages of cancer....she has days to live.  My father, who never gave a shit about me or my relationship with his mother is now all concered that i'll miss her funeral.  He wouldn't fly me out there to see her before she moves on, but by golly he stands by her hospital bed (for her benifit i guess?) and makes fucken funeral arrangements and graciously offers to fly me out so that I can see them put her into the ground.  Now I know I've used this venue to bitch about my sperm doner in the past, and I don't want you all to think i'm trying to cop some free therapy...but man i just have to say......  Little billy.....you're a fucken drama queen, and your priorities are all fucked up!
