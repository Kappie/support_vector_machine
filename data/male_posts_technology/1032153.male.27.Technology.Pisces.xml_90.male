" Families are great, says Social Development Minister Steve Maharey, but sole-mother families are just as good as the traditional "nuclear family" of mum, dad and kids. "   "I know of no social science that says a nuclear family is more successful than other kinds. It's whether you have a loving, nurturing family."   "A sole-parent family isn't inadequate, it's the result that matters, so we are not going to reinforce any particular kind of family structure."    Mr Maharey. You are a fool. You are deceitful, and you are talking codswallop. Your words are blatantly untrue, and you speak rebellion against the Lord God Almighty. It is He that has instituted the family. He says what is right; not you or your evil scheming friends. All children need a father and a mother who are committed to each other in marriage fullstop amen, end of story.   Sole-Parent "families" are not ok, and should not be seen as just as good. They are not. Economically and emotionally they are inferior to God's standard. Economically, because the tax payer very often has to compensate for the lack of the father. Emotionally, because all children need a dad to be a role-model of masculinity.  God save us from these idiots.
