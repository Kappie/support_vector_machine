Am I some obviously sympathetic type or what?    I mean, obviously he misses his father, but I'm a total stranger!  I know he needs support and help and all that stuff, but do I really have to spend a half an hour telling him what a great guy his dad was dispite the fact that I don't know either of them from Adam?  *sheesh*  On more important matters....She gave me a present.  I got a crystal from her...a green calcite.  It wasn't anything I was expecting, and I think it was so sweet of her to think of me like that.  It made me happy, and still does....  Also, been playing with my new Past Lives Tarot deck...interesting stuff.  But it's getting late...more on that later....  Love life?  Let's give it a 7 for now....  :-)
