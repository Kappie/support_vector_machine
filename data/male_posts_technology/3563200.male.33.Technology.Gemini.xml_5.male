Someone actually got sued over cell-phone ringtones? Geeesh...give me a break.  If you haven't read the speech yet, go back and read it. Now continue.  In my opinion, DRM isn't ever going to matter to anyone except the lawyers who make money arguing over it, and the companies who make money developing the technology (that will always be easily broken in short order). Once you ship the bits to the world, your DRM doesn't matter, at least to the parties the lawyers perceive are the threat to the IP.  Where are the philosophers when we need them? There is a line of philosophy that deals with what is called Categorical Imperative. It states that in order to determine if something is 'right' or 'wrong', you simply posit that doing such a thing were 'required'. For example: Is telling lies right or wrong? Well, what if it were 'required' that everything I said were a lie? Doesn't that seem wrong? In essence, you can establish a moral base on this thinking.  For me, I'm simply going to apply this philosophy to my use of media. And quite frankly, I don't really care what anyone does with DRM. Because ulitimately I'm going to do what I want to do with the property I pay for and use my own moral judgement if my usage is good or bad.  And yes, I have a DVR, and yes, I fast-forward thru ads. And yes, I rip CDs to MP3, burn them to CDR and play them in my car. I have over 600 CDs worth of songs on a couple of of CDRs in my cars sun-visor. And yes, I rip DVDs to my hard drive on occasion because I'm not carrying them around with me when I travel and risk losing or scratching them. And yes, I have a custom hosts file that redirects me to MY computer for 99% of urls for advertisements. And yes, I right-click in Firefox and click "block images from x" whenever I see an ad. And yes, SO DOES ANYONE WITH HALF A BRAIN! So sue us! Maybe Shakespeare was right about the lawyers...except for this one cool I know in Texas who became a software developer :) .
