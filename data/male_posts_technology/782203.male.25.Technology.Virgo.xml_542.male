Man it's really much tougher than it looks on television, I spent most of my time picking up balls instead of hitting the ball with my racket. But it was a really good workout, in fact my biceps seem bigger now after all that swinging. Gonna be doing this on a regular basis in an effort to lose some weight.  Audrey came back home with me to see my sister's kid after tennis and after she left my mom asked me if that was my girlfriend. For her any gal I bring back home automatically has to my girlfriend. Then when I said no, she started saying stuff like whether if it was ok if she looked for a girl for me. My response to that is too inappropriate to post here.
