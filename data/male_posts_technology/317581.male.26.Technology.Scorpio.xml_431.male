I know he was looking forward to working till June and they couldn't find work for him through the winter.  Matrix 2 showed up today. So I'm going to watch that with Cliff tomorrow. I can already tell that I'm going to have trouble staying focused on music and cleaning my house and getting a job. Especially since cliff is off:)  C'est la vie... See you around, space cowboy-
