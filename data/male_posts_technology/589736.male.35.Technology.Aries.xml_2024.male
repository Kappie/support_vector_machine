Ma"cheese"mo - I think some guys are insecure and this is a way for them to be alpha of someone somewhere.  Also, in some cultures, like the Latino culture, it is almost bred into them to be gay haters.  And since that particular culture tends to be heavily Catholic....but we aren't going the religion route.  Comfort - If you are raised to believe that *all* dogs are mean killers.  You live 50 years of your life thinking that every dog you ever see is mean, and wants to kill you (versus nice and wants to kill you ;-p ).  Then, it is going to be very hard to accept a dog in your life when you turn 51.  Same with gay marriage.  If you believe that it is "wrong" simply because that is what has been told to you since birth, then it will be hard to accept.
