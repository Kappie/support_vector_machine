Ok I accept that there is some randomness that is provided by this nature. But its just a factor that should be neglected and not reinforced before or after your activities..   Luck and Fate is part of the nature.. As is drought and flood..   Whenever people say it as a luck.. I go out of loop and start seriously thinking for some time whether they mean it correctly or not..
