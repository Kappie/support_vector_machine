What fucking right does the US have to not allow countries that didn't support the invasion of Iraq to help in the reconstruction effort.  Sorry for the profanity...I'm very angry today.   grrrr!  Okay...on to happy things...I'm coming home on the 17th and I'm bringing Nick with me!  Unfortunately, I have to stay and Nick gets to go back to England.  I been here for nearly 6 months, so I've got stay in the US for a while.  Stupid England.  Wait...that makes me angry again.  grrr!  Damn this bipolar disorder.
