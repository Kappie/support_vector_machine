The foyer is dark, with two faux stone columns on either side mounted with electric flames, and the soundracks play; cryptic writings on the wall; special events with a "real wizard" and the opportunity to attend dressed as your favorite Harry Potter character.  How wonderful that some children have a rich fantasy to look forward to.  Reminds me of Star Wars days, when I was so excited to dress as Threepio for Halloween.
