Maybe it's her money.  One week from now I'll be driving with Vito and Mlufkin to far northern Vermont for the final Phish shows. I think I'm as much (if not more) excited about the trip and the experience than I am about the actual concerts.  Anyone catch the final Ashlee Simpson show last night? I missed it.  Anyone see the Village?  I"m looking forward to seeing Open Water. Looks right in my wheelhouse. I won't swim in the Ocean - so the movie will not affect my habits. I know JJ and BF Carroll can respect that. I heard they used real sharks in the filming of Open Water as well.
