I got home from work, booted up, sent a quick note to my Spanish teacher that I wouldnt be in for class, and then went to bed and slept for 14hrs.  Had a fever slightly over 100, and today I still have the fever, but went into work because I had things that had to get done.  I'm home for a half-day for not feeling well.  I'm on-call, hopefully the CME   we're going to get hit with from the sun in a few hrs doesn't effect my cell phone too much as I'm on-call.  The solar flare is going to cause distruption they figure for 12-18hrs.   Sounds like we're all headed out of town to work on our trailer that we rent out.  Oh boy oh joy.  Fixing a ceiling fan thats brand new and shouldn't have issues but apprently does, plumbing, racking up rocks that our EX tenant put all over the yard, that she never asked about.   So now I get to rack up and get rid of how knows how many pounds or river rock due that @#$@# we had living there.  Being a landlord sucks.
