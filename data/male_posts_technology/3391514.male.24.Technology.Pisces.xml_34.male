I also picked up a number of  GURPS  books, along with a miscellaneous  d20  product entitled "Vigilance" (to assist with the development of  Heroland  if necessary).  Almost got the  Transformers  PS2 game, as it was in a  "Buy anything else and get this cheap"  offer, but I couldn't find anything else worth getting.  Ah well, where there's one GAME, there are two others nearby...
