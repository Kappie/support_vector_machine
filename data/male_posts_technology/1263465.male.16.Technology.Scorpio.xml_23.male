The site has a XML backend, making all the text dynamically updateable.  I'd love to  urlLink  hear what you think .  peace out  On a side note, I think I'm getting sick of this layout.  And, I really wanna add some sort of a shout box-type thing.  Maybe a real cool flash/php-driven chalkboard... that'd be slick...  anyways, lemme know if you find any bugs...
