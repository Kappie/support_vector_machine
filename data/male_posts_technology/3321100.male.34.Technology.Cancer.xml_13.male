For those who haven't ride a motorbike, let me give you the number one rule to ride it; motorbike will go where you look at. You doesn't need to turn the handlebars. If you look at right, you will go on your right (Caution! it works with the left too).  I can say it was like in the life, we need to look at in front of us to progress. When you had a problem on your motorcycle, for example two big trucks take all the road (yes it was a problem, be sure of this), there is two solutions for us, the first one is to watch the trucks and to say "Ohhh my god, I had a BIG problem". 5 seconds after you really have a problem, cause you go where you look at, and you look at the truck. The other solution (the good one) is to look at the little space between the two trucks, after this you will be able to thanks god. I know that someone think to the third solution who is to look at the sky and to pray. Trust me, only E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial can fly with a bike by looking at the sky, and I'm not sure it works with a motorbike who is more heavy. Another thing who doesn't work when you ride a motorbike is to look at behind you. Does I need to explain that when you look at behind you, you can't see where you go or who you could meet (trucks or love)? You must keep in mind this, the past is the past, you can only choose witch road you will take on the next cross-roads. So we have look at in front, in back, up, we can now watch on the side. Because you are not alone on this world, there is always someone at your side. When we are on the border of the road, with a mechanical problem, there is always someone who ride on your left (English people who ride in the bad way must translate themselves) and who can help you if you ask them. If you haven't problem, think to watch on your right (English bla bla bla...) if someone need your help, if there is someone who is stop on the emergency way, think to help us, motorcyclist always do that. Have a nice trip my friends and look at the road ;)
