When I dropped it off, the technician sait it would be ready this afternoon.  Around 2 PM, he called to tell me that he couldn't fix it, couldn't find a replacement and had to send it out to be fixed.  He had no ETA as to when it would be back, so he said to come pick up the car.  Well, I have the car, but  urlLink no radio or CD player !
