The initial reviews of the book are enthusiastic: "Chock full of juicy rumors, detailed reporting and a brutal look at Oracle's past and present business practices, every Oracle customer-or competitor-should read this book." The reviews of Ellison and his management team at Oracle, though, are much harsher: "Oracle has moved from a team of B players led by A players to a team of C players led by B players." Other problems facing Oracle: alienated customers and a "conflict-ridden culture that sucks energy into the black hole of corporate politics." http://www.corante.com/ebusiness/redir/30974.html
