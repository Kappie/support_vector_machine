Update for 4/20/04 I took off on a run that lasted a little over 30 minutes tonight.  I went down the very familiar path of winding through the streets of East Walnut Hills, down Madison, but tonight I decided to conquer the hills of Taft after hearing good reports from Lisa.  I turned right down Torrence, went to the bottom, turned right on Taft, and ultimately turned left on McMillan (which was no better for hills).  The run was eerie to say the least.  I ran around 11p.m. and at that time, there's nobody out in the areas in which I ran.  Torrence was probably the eeriest place to go since it was surrounded on both sides by dark, wooded areas.  It was cool though.  My body felt fine and the run was good except for the La-La Land feeling I had the entire run.  My head just felt like it was in the clouds for most of the run except near the end when the hills got pretty tough.  I didn't have to stop at all throughout the run and it was a great way to get a good night's sleep since my body was tired after that.    Update for 4/22/04 With the threat of torrential rain, I wimped out tonight and went to the Fieldhouse (FH) at UC.  My original intent was to run a little and do some Yasso 800's and the FH provided a good place to do it.  The workout was spectacular and highly encouraging.  Anyone who would argue that I haven't gained speed should compare my times from last night to the first time I did Y800s.  My times last night were 3:28, 3:27, 3:23, 3:22, and 3:13 in that order with an average time of 3:22.6 for 800 meters.  At that rate, the Y800 theory estimates that I could run a 3:22.6 marathon in my current physical condition.  That's hard to believe but it's awesome to me to think I was sustaining a 7 min/mile (or better) pace for the Y800s last night.  I started and finished the night with a mile run at about 9 min/mile so all totaled, I completed 5 miles with running, Y800s, and walking.  My body felt great and I could have done 5 more Y800s but I had to stop to stick to my wind-down period for training (and CSI was coming on!).  The only thing I have noticed thus far is a little tenderness in my left knee.  It's a little concerning but could have been caused by a little less stretching that I did last night or my body just responding to speedwork.
