Sure there were times when it would get fun for a while but ultimately the place has changed.  It went from being a happy go lucky place to a place trying to be "downtown."  Shit!  Give it up.  There is no way in the world that a place in the suburbs will ever be able to have a "downtown" feel.  Just face it, it's never going to happen.  Besides that, there was a lot of people who continue to bring their baggage into the bar.  I mean really, these guys and girls just waltz in with thier attitudes larger than thier heads and think that they own the place.  Eh, the place has changed, the servers have changed, the bartenders have changed and the overall appeal and attitude of the place is just gone down the tubes.  The place wasn't even packed last night.  I have never seen that place that bad before.  Heck, even the Thursday after St. Patrick's Day still had a descent number of people present.  More than last nights.  Eh, that's my current thought on North Beach.
