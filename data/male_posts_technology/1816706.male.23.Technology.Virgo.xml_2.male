Simply put, they are indescribable.  The pictures I take from hikes, or of sunsets don’t do the actual views any justice.  The sunsets light up the entire beach, most of the time around here there are some clouds and the sun hides through the clouds a little bit and show rays going above and below the clouds.  It’s a great sunset every night.  I woke up early one morning and hiked Diamond Head and watched the sunrise at about 5am.  When it comes up it shines across the ocean so bright that you can see some of the other islands, Maui, and I’m not sure what the other one is, off in the distance.  Just driving down the road here, around every turn on the beach you see gorgeous coast lines, mountains, everything too much for words, but absolutely breathtaking. Another great thing about Hawaii is the way your body changes.  Several of you that I have talked to already have commented on my tan.  Well, if you spend every day in the sun, on the beach, or doing hikes, you would be tan too.  The hair on my arms and legs is turning blonde, my hair on my head (past the receding hairline) is more blonde now, and my skin is a lot more dry.  Also, you get rid of your “city feet”.  When I lived in Florida it was called city feet.  If you touch your feet right now, most of you have nice, soft, fluffy feet or your soles, but out here you walk around everywhere barefoot, or with sandals on, frequently burning your feet on the sand and before you know it, your feet are nice and hard.  It’s great.  Sometimes you think that you are growing sand out your body you have it everywhere, but it’s a price you pay for living in paradise.  ;-)
