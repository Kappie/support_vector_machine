On their way they get sidetracked and meet strange people in strange situations.  Actor-wise this movie has a great potential to be funny. It stars  urlLink John Cho  who is absolutely hilarious in the now defunct  urlLink Off Centre  TV series. The other main character is played by  urlLink Kal Penn  who was very funny in the movie  urlLink Van Wilder .  It also stars  urlLink Eddie Kaye Thomas  (from  urlLink Off Centre ),  urlLink Ryan Reynolds  (from  urlLink Van Wilder ) and  urlLink Neil Patrick Harris  as himself,   horny and high on ecstasy!    Despite all this, it is unfortunately only okay. There are some really fun moments, but they are too few to make it a really good movie. -->
