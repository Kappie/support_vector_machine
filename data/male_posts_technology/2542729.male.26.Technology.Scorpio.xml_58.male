God knows i've done enough emotional damage to peeps these past few weeks, and I know that many of my friends  fam read these postings. But one day I hope to return to expressing myself in my more familiar view, but differently. As time goes on, I have to adjust to the changing world, times, people  events as all men do, and i'm sure my future writing will reflect those changes.  Well on to the latest...  Fantasia Burrino was a guest on The View this morning, she also brought her daughter on stage with her. They look so mch alike! I wasn't a true fan of hers at first...at least, not over Latoya London who in my opinion would have made an equally prominent AI champ. But Fantasia is infectious, has a really gleeful, upbeat, sassy yet classy persona about her. Granted, she has nothing on my girl Tamyra Gray from season 1!!! Then again, i'm biased cause she's the hottest thing since Whitney first came out... I was supposed to go to Columbia Tuesday on a two fold mission: take a family friend back to BC for summer school  meet up with an old music professor friend before he goes off for the summer to teach abroad...but all that fell thru. This previous weekend, after the headlight smashing incident (which I may or may not have posted) on his mothers' Bonneville, they possibly think differently of me now. Estimates on the replacement, even for a used part is around $125. Yeay me...  Speaking of Tuesday, the church went to Royston, Ga. to join the saints at the sister church there in fellowship week. The choir went  our deacons led service, which I guess went well. Wouldn't know 'cause I didn't end up going...so what was supposed to be a bustling Tuesday ended up a bust. They haven't even started showing reruns of Smallville season 3 yet. Guess they're wait until...actually, I don't know what they're waiting on.   I just called Dr. High  he was on his way out so i'm getting back to my long awaited game of City of Heroes. Nyghtrage is level 11 now. Hopefully I can make him 12 within the next 2 hrs!! Peace out  God bless!!!
