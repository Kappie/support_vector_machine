If you dont like the rules, go the fsck away. That's what i'm doing. I have no problem with it. Homework is fucking pointless. The ONLY homework that is remotely plausable is studying. That is good. IF YOU CANT GET THE POINT ACROSS IN AN HOUR, WHY BOTHER. Give us tests, i say.Weekly tests. Tests are good. HW is bad. This isnt because i'm lazy, because i'm really not. I just completely disagree with the whole homework thing. And i'm  not saying that I purposely dont do homework, either. I'm not doing it because "it's a belief thing". I just cant do it...again, i dont know why. Homework and I just dont get along.
