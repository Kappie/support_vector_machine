I've worked 7 of the last 8 days, and along with my commitments to movie-vault.com I haven't had a chance to get on here and talk about whats going on.   So, I'm up to three reviews, soon to be five, at the site.  I'm liking the gig, and I have my first theatrical release coming up, where I'll be reviewing "The Ladykillers" starring Tom Hanks.  Am I the only one who thinks this movie is gonna be any good?  What is that?  Good to see that we're in 76th place now for anyone who needs to see the most on brett card favre master.  How that makes sense, I don't know, but Brokun Minds is #1 on google if you search for coastal slazer.  Yeah, we should do a horror/comedy... something with a viable plot... we don't need a working screenplay, but even just a plot would be nice.  I think the lines could be ad libbed, much like "Something about Nothing", the Grade 9 masterpiece which, quite believably, had me, you, Francois Bletiere and Dustin Webb as the most feared Street Gang this side of The Warriors or The Outsiders.  Hey, Wes, the city offers up screenwriting classes.  I want to go, but like a chick going to the can, I don't wanna go alone.  Let's do this!  At the very least, it gives us shit to do, and at least when we write in screenplay format, we'll understand what the Hell we're trying to get across.
