We have moved a bunch of our crap over to my friend Marty's basement in an effort to make the house look bigger.  House selling has officially become no fun.  I'm still somewhat torn between trying to move soon to take advantage of favorable interest rates and staying put and socking money away.   I guess if we sell the house, we'll move and if we don't, we won't.    I have been half dieting for about 3 months now.  Not surprisingly I have lost no weight.  I started out on the South Beach Diet and decided it was way too hard and switched to a more Atkinsesque low card high fat type of thing and decided that was too hard and switched to my half diet.  I have the willpower of a  urlLink ficus .
