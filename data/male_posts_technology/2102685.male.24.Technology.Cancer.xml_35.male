But even more important is the new Linux Driver, that  finally  enables TV-OUT! I could probably not be more excited than I am just now! (okei, so maybe I could if say  urlLink Elisha Cuthbert  was sitting on my lap just now)  So now I might be able to actually run Linux on my desktop computer! *rejoice* Go ATi! :)
