I'm slipping out of the office early today to hopefully beat the traffic off of the island.  May I make one recommendation?  Never, ever, never ever ever live somewhere where you have to regularly cross a bridge.  Bridges suck, and you can't help but cross them when you live on an island and you want to get off.  Unless that island is Hawaii.  Then you have to fly.  But who would want to leave, anyway?  I wish I lived in Hawaii.  With no job.
