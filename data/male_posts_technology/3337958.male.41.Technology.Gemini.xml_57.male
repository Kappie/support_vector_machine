How times have changed.  Today, the world is a much more peaceful place.  And nobody would ever dream of putting a Texan in Washington.  But if you think that I sent this letter to pay tribute to fearless leaders of  Daddy during Dip , then think again.  This is a tribute to the concept "daddy", and your having decided several times over to contribute to it.  ...and Happy Fathers´ Day to Gock ´n´ Dew as well, and any of those fellas at Homeland, who, when they´re not looking for potiential clients, remember that they have children as well.  Davidly yours.
