In response to the website, for us, the USA, to think that space will remain unmilitarized forever is naive.  Especially since out good buddies in the Peoples Republic of China are rapidly developing their own space program, and I believe have announced plans for a moon mission (though my memory is vague on that).  They see us as a threat, rightly or wrongly, and we must be prepared.  Someone told me that space exploration is alot like having kids; if you wait until you are ready, it will never happen.  I can see his point.  We, the human species, have been trying to solve some of these pressing social problems (poverty, injustice) for about 3000 years now.  Sometimes with good effects (Roman and Greek rule was pretty good) and sometimes with bad (medieval Europe).  If we wait until the social problems are solved, then I don't think we will ever do it.
