Nary a workday goes by where I don't spend my break time (or possibly a little more time) reading blogs. Most of them are the high profile one's in everyone's history (for example - Lileks's TibetanYarnNoodles.com, Everyonehaveahappyspoonsexperience.com, bludgeoningIMAO.us) but I've found myself bouncing around people's blogrolls and looking at little personal blogs (like this one.) Today I thought, "Why?" I don't like people, people often annoy me - why do I care what they scrawl on a post or two? Maybe I'm intrigued by those of us who can do this, and impessed by those who do this well. After all, not everyone writing a blog gets on the elevator with me and tries to make small talk for no reason at all.  'Uuuuggghh, only Tuesday, huh?'  I half-smile and hope they'll go away.
