I still think Michael Moore is left wing nut job, but that 2.5 is a very good score coming from a guy that really dislikes mikeys' political agenda.  To begin, he started with the view of the election being stolen from Gore. Its an interesting theory, but what it comes down to, is that he won a political battle with political tactics.  The rest of the first half of the movie was actaully quite good.  He detailed the Bush families political and financial ties with the middle east.   Some of the thigns he talked about were distirbing, but of coarse, he was only giving one side.   THe movie was chock full of democratic naysayers and lots of negative jabs at BUSH.  I will say this movie got bad when he showed the family of a soldier, who was killed in IRAQ.  The mother crying, begging for her son to be back. Its Horribel to watch someone go throuhg that kind of pain, but Michael Moore is not doing this because he cares about that woman or the soldier, he is doing it to get an emotional reaction from the crowd.  Overall this is a democratic movie that has some very harsh realities about how goverment and buisness are closely intwined, maybe too close.    I will still vote for BUSH in 2004. (The reasons for that will come later..) I think anyone that had a bad opinion about Bush going into this movie, will have an even worse one leaving. So, this movie is nothing but 110 minute election commercial.
