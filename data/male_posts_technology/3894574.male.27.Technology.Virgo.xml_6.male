There she saw a woman  pushing an overfilled cart while holding a stack of DVD's. You'd think this would be frustrating enough, but she also had 5 children running about, misbehaving. Apparently distracted by the children, she mistakenly had gotten in one of the  U-Scan  self checkout lanes. Immediately everyone behind her let out a unison sigh of disgust. Then she proceeded to check out in the "12 items or less" lane, completely oblivious of her offense. My wife quickly jumped into another lane and was out in a flash but couldn't help but notice the lady's struggle. If you've ever used a  U-scan , you know how sensitive the scale can be, resulting in you being asked to "Please remove the last item and scan it." then "place the item back in the bag." Her kids were running around and messing with everything in sight so the problem compounded. She had to stop what she was doing every 5 seconds to yell at the kids, making her take even longer. As far as we know, that lady might still be there.
