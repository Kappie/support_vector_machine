The EU believes in growing up together.. trade barriers are very flexible... travel regulations are tourist-friendly... once u get to some European country, travelling to other European countries is very easy.. remember, sindhuja has already visited Scotland and Wales.. so tourism improves and adds to the economic kitty and now-a-days the EU (except Britain) trades with the same currency too...   But in the case of India, the dependency on the developed economies is so large that we seldom get to call the shots... further, the ASEAN exists just for the sake of existing... there is immense unrest between the neighboring ASEAN countries... and most delegate meets are spent languishing over the political instability...  While EU has very relaxed and cooperative trade norms... the Asian "giants" China and India are considered to be competitors... in this age, growth is only possible with a cooperative and liberal sharing of selective core competency.. that is the whole raison d'etre of the concept called ECR (Efficient Consumer Response) which is still taking roots..   George Fernandes asked in the '70s, "Why do we need a Unilever to make such measly things as a toothpaste".. Unilever did enter India.. and the rest is history... Georgian socialsm has no place in this era.. the "feel-good factor" in the economy is just a fog veiled over the election atmosphere...  India has a long way to go before it could become a force to reckon with... and it would require a revolutionary political re-think..
