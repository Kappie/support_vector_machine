Anyway I have had a real good past week.  It was very busy weekend.  It started with a very quick day at work.  I had to pack up my stuff all week for our big office move to the third floor.  We are moving to the third floor while they rearrange the cubes and lay down new carpet.  Well, after work I came home and picked up and  urlLink Ann  and we were off to Louisville.  We got into town about 6:15ish and headed straight to the fish fry at St. Albert's.  I think Ann wasimpressed with the size of the event.  It is pretty impressive.  There we met up with Colin and Matt.  After dinner we went home and played a rousing game of Cranium.  Saturday Ann went shopping with my mom and aunt Julie.  I played X-box with Shane and Brandon too.  later that evening I went to my grandfather's wedding.  It was nice.  Kind of creepy, but I guess that is just something I will have to get used to.  I played do you remember their name game with Ann. The reception was nice except the keyboardist was playing very slow slow songs.  Finally he kicked it up a notch and put in a 70's dance music tape and we had a blast.  Sunday we went to mass and then had lunch at kristin's.  You can read all about it at Kristin's blog (linked above).  It was really good although Ann was sad that we forgot to eat the rice krispee treats.  I think Kristin should come visit and bring them up. (wink, wink)...  This weekend I am goin to go with Ann up to Oberlein (sp?) College to visit her friend  urlLink Susie.   She works at a bowling alley and i you know me and you know you do...I love bowling!  Okay I thkn that is all I have for now...
