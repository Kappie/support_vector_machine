           
      Back again with another review. I will try to keep this one as short as possible and not try to change the subject as I always end up doing.  We start up with Kain confronting Eric and "asking":  for another shot at Benoit. Trouble is that there is already another number one contender for Benoit's title. This leads to Kain getting medieval with Eric's office. Nothing says beast or monster like beating on a coach, a TV and some plants.   Btw, it must suck being furniture in Mr. Bischoff's office. Last week, it was totaled by a fight between HBK and HHH. I recall it's not the first time the office has been rearranged by some out of control fight.  J.R. is in the ring and he asks HHH and HBK to come down, shake hands and end their feud once and for all. They do and are "about" to do so, when Eric interrupts and runs in the ring. Kain runs in after Eric and beats on Shawn Michaels.  There is this sick moment where apparently Kain used a chair to crush Shawn Michaels throat (or something like that). Shawn Michaels starts spurting blood from his mouth and he is rushed to the hospital. Scary stuff, even taught it was all clearly scripted. My mom became nervous and called me up. She watches the show at her house, but that disturbed her. She felt she almost had a heart attack. I had to explain to her that HBK needed some time off to be with his family, which is why they did that injury angle. She calmed down, but was still a little nervous. It was pretty violent, especially for basic cable. Don't know how stuff like that will help the overall image of the WWE.   Anyway, first match of the night is Lita and Matt Hardy vs. Trish and Tyson Tomko. Now, do you recall that I mentioned that the Bad Blood PPV was crucial for Tomko cause he had not fought in a ring up to that moment? Well, this would be his second match in the WWE, right? Actually, since this is live TV, that would make it his first on national television. Where am I going with this? Well, for starters, he has to try to look good. Blown spots don't make you look good. They make you look sloppy and silly.   Matt Hardy jumps from the top rope and Tomko catches him... and they both fall awkwardly to the mat. You fucked up! You fucked up!   Surprisingly, the crowd let this one pass. Just a few noticeable groans from the crowd.   Lita and Matt Hardy defeat Trish Stratus and Tyson Tomko, which does shit for the women's title and Tomko, who I believe (after two losses and an unimpressive debut as a wrestler) should go back to OVW for some additional training.  Hey, now that I am thinking about stuff that Tomko has done, I recall that when he first appeared in the WWE, he gave a boot to the head to Jericho and fell over. Damn, it's only a matter of time before this guy goes poof. Maybe that's why he lost this last match. Since he is a problem solver and he isn't solving any problems, then the WWE probably will have him loose to justify Trish firing him. Hey, I would do the same.  Another off topic thought related indirectly to Tomko. Remember Jon Heidenreich? Yeah, me either. Actually, I recall him popping up in RAW several times before being dropped to the Heat program. He was pretty big and strong, but extremely clumsy. I think he once almost killed Steve Richards with a poorly executed move of his. I've checked the WWE page and he is still in the roster. Probably still in Heat. This guy was impressive, but terribly green, which made him dangerous in the ring.   I recall also that Jon had a kid or some person he was protecting that was a big secrete. They never said who the kid was. Maybe it was Eugene? Anyway, the storyline fell apart and disappeared after people started complaining that the guy would eventually kill someone in the ring. I guess well never know who it really was.  Next, we have La Resistance def. The Hurricane and Rosey in Flag Match. Okay, you can start rolling your eyes now. How many times have these guys fought? Yep, hundredth of times. Why? Cause they are the only tag teams on RAW right now. The tag titles are shit. Might as well have the team of Gail Kim and Molly Holly take on La Resistance. At least they are a credible team. Hurricane and Rosey (SHIT)? Please! Send Hurricane to the cruserweight division on Smackdown, where he belongs. It's only the right thing to do. Also, please give Rosey another gimmick.  On the subject of total stupidity... Lita might be pregnant and what I am thinking is that the WWE will probably hint that the child is... Kain's.   !!! Okay... I won't comment on this, except to say that if I recall, hinting that Lita "did something" with Kain to protect Matt Hardy was a new or recent storyline. Man, that must have been one hell of a fuck!   With that, we go to Gail Kim and Molly Holly vs. Nidia (Wow, she it still alive) and Stacy Keibler. Actually, the match was better than I expected. Even taught not by much. Stacy is not a wrestler. Just some really basic moves. Nidia has too much breast to be a wrestler. No kidding. They seem to...erm...get in the way. It was a very bad idea to have then done. ON the other hand, Gail Kim is impressive. So is Molly. These two are the real champs of the division right now.  Victoria used to be a contender, but then she started silly dancing (or spasms, as other people in the net refer to her moves) and her credibility was shot down. Look, WWE, it's not that she can't be a face. It's just that you have to put meat on that idea. Develop it. Now, there is no way around it. Make her heel. Make her the crazy bitch she was once before. That's the Victoria we have grown to love. That will also balance out the division. We have the good guys (Lita, Nidia, Stacy, Ivory and Trish) and the bad guys (Victoria, Jazz, Gail Kim and Molly Holly). Wait a sec... Something's wrong? Okay, Stacy isn't a wrestler. Nidia isn't over with the fans and is not a credible face yet. Lita is in a storyline where she is now pregnant. Ivory has been gone from RAW for a while now (and is currently doing the WWE Expirience show). And Trish, probably the best known and loved women's wrestler, is a heel. Fuck !!! The women division is a mess. Who is left, Victoria and her spasms! WWE, quick, develop her into a credible face. Dancing and going down to the ring to smile and hug children is not developing her personality or character. Do something quick or you will be backing yourself into an embarrassing corner.   Anyway, Gail and Molly win.  Eric tells HHH that he will have the number one contenders position if he takes out Eugene next week. HHH smiles. Uncle Eric is evil... hahaha  Next we have Eugene in Jericho's Highlight Reel. Interesting segment with Evolution coming down to give presents to Eugene and try to trick him. All this seems so wrong, but the way the WWE is handling it, it seems entertaining. Makes you wonder what's going to happen next week.   Nick Dinsmore really plays this character well.   HHH indirectly threatens William Regal and Regal looks pissed. I am liking this very much. I've always liked William Regal. Not only is he funny, but he is a very good mat wrestler. Probably one of the best. Heck, he should be. He's been wrestling since he was 15 years old. This guy is the real think. Tonight he looked slender and stronger. Must be really working out. Can't wait to see him in the ring. Especially against someone like Ric Flair.  Anyway, the ending of this segment hints at a possible Jericho feud with HHH later on. Even taught I have a feeling that the next RAW PPV, Vengence, will be headlined by Benoit vs HHH (which would mean that the rumored Benoit vs. Edge might happen on SummerSlam).   Final match of the night was an elimination tag match, which surprised me cause it is odd that the WWE and Spike TV would allow this type of match to happen at the end of a program. It's odd cause elimination matches tend to take a long while (except if it's a cruserweight battle royal... *sigh*). Not surprisingly, the segment clearly went over the over run time period. We actually had at least 15 minutes extra of wrestling. That in itself should boost the show's grade average.   Chris Benoit/Chris Jericho/Edge defeated Randy Orton/Ric Flair/Batista in an excellent match. Started off slow, moved into the normal range for a RAW match, then, in the final 10 minutes of the match, exploded into an intense back and forth match that had people cheering and gasping at every turn. I must say that everyone looked great here. Especially Ric Flair. The man was on tonight. I swear, this guy must be immortal. There was a moment where Flair and Benoit started exchanging blows at the end that looked very painful, violent and angry. Ric really put a lot of himself here. And he kept himself toe to toe with the young guys. Solid work. So much so, that after he was eliminated, his chest was read and bleeding and he looked extremely tiered and week. A man his age shouldn't force himself like he did last night, but it was a hell of a showing. I still can't believe Ric Flair still has the right stuff in him. I've always been a fan of him, but it's not until the last year or so (maybe after the great match with HHH he had around a year ago) that I've seen Flair step up several notches in his game. It's like he's gotten a new lease in life.   All in all, the show was okay. A lot of sports entertainment. The beginning of the show and the ending were very good. The middle part is where it all came crashing down. Some good stuff, some bad. I'd say this show gets a B+ (mostly due to the great long match at the end). Oh, and Ric Flair rules.  Well, that's it for me. See ya next Tuesday with another review.   urlLink Sailor Ecchi
