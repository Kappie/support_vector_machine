On top of always pairing Daphne and I together just because we lunch often and work in the Labs, they were a but more thick skinned than usual yesterday.  After lunch I entered the lab to find Laura (a Mandarin teacher) with her class. They were typing words in Mandarin inside Winword. So I just hung around coz I had nowhere better else to go. As the lesson ended, some girls approached me saying there was something wrong with their elearning account so I tried to settle it for them asap. As the other students were making their way out of the class, some girl shouted to Laura in Mandarin "Huang lao4 shi1! XXXX (god knows who) likes Mr Tan!!" The other girls giggled here and there and Laura also found it amusing. I would probably eng siu them a bit by some kind of boliao reply if I wasn't in the midst of settling the elearning accounts on the spot. I basically ignored them, didn't even bothered giving them a look. I vaguely heard Laura saying something to me, and though I didn't mean to, I ignored her comment as well. (Oops, hope she wasn't speaking to me directly or directing a question at me then.) Anyway I heard someone saying "Ahhhhaha, Mr Tan paiseh lah." And I still ignored everyone else in class (except the 2-3 students waiting for me to settle their accounts). After I finished my task on the PC, I looked up to realise only 2 students were waiting. The other girls with account problems had already left. Idiots ... what did they expect me to do when they haven't given me enough details. Anyway I didn't manage to solve everyone's problem then and they deserve it too. I'm not their servant where you just tell me to do it and you walk off like that.  At this time I also just realised that Laura and the rest of the class had left sometime ago. Oh well, like I said, if I'm concentrating real hard, I can be dead to the world and just ignore everything else. Just hope Laura didn't think I was brushing off her comments/questions then, that's all.  Ar ... got a birthday present from Juliana and Asuka from Birmingham. Quite touched. It was a shirt and knowing how expensive things are in UK, I think the shirt easily cost them S$80-100+, and that's excluding mailing the whole thing over. Geez ... gotta send them my thanks.  Will be quite a busy week ahead. But I promised myself to work on the courseware which I need to submit back to my company on 30th Apr. To make it worse, I need to finish up my mthly report, wkly report, and misc shitz as well. Fish lah... tomorrow still need to get a new phone coz my line is under my sis's name and she is free only tomorrow afternoon. Oh boy. Think I'll have a hard time breathing. Only silver lining is that my parents will be leaving dunno which day for a tour in China or Korea, I also can't remember. Woohoo! Bo Zeng Hu (no governing authority) for 10 days.
