But findings published today in the May issue of the  journal SLEEP indicate that there might be a better way to stay awake for long  periods. According to the report, low doses of caffeine administered at regular  intervals may provide improved pick-me-up benefits.             James Wyatt of the Rush  University Medical Center and his colleagues studied 16 men for 29 days while  they stayed in private windowless suites free of time cues from the outside  world. The researchers scheduled 42.85-hour days for the subjects, simulating  the amount of time many doctors, truckers and emergency services personnel must  stay awake. By disrupting the men's circadian rhythms, which promote sleepiness  in a cyclical fashion, the scientists instead focused on the homeostatic push  for sleep, which becomes stronger the longer someone is awake. Previous analyses  of caffeine's ability to energize have shown that when people consume a large  amount of caffeine in one sitting, the levels of the compound in their  bloodstream will peak and then fall as the day goes on. "Unfortunately, the  physiological process they need to counteract is not a major player until the  latter half of the day," Wyatt explains. .......
