Those that don't blog often have a tendency to see blogging, not as a social forum or peoples random opinions,as something that is time consuming that has little to no reward in the here and now world of the day to day.  I have often become a non blogger for months at a time, but I have always kept this site up. Occasionally I update it, but only when I have no/little social opportunities with my friends. I reach out to my blog and post in the realization that no one is reading it. Until they got the profiles where you can search for people with blogs with similar interests. I've now had 3 people leave messages in the past 4 weeks.  It's an odd feeling to be found on the internet. Besides my friends, I'm sure no one had really read it until a few months ago.  It seems maybe that I should filter it and look through and delete any posts that I have grown through or out of, but that would be faking my past. I would hate that.  Anyway, here's to random people stopping by my website and new friends. I hope you like what you see! Peace- T
