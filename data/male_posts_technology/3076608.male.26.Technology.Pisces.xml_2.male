All I know is that even though I still have pain and scars from the last relationship I attempted, still I have more hope than I did. So I will start off my entries with a question.       How do you tell a person that you are interested without scaring them off?      I have the worst luck with confessing my feelings and being rejected. Most people are not interested in getting to know me or being close. Mainly they are more concerned about what they can get out of me. Sounds harsh? Unfortunately it is the truth. I have not figured out exactly why girls use me the way that they do but I can only blame most of it on my kindess. This time I refuse to put myself through going through the same thing I have been through time and time again. I am torn between being me, nice guy, and getting hurt and being the guy I want to be, the jerk, and getting what I want. Sounds like an easy decision, doesnt it? But its not. I have always wanted to be myself and no one else without being judged or rejected. Now is the time for me to be myself, but the scars and pain that I have been subjected to throw up walls that keep me from coming out of my shell. I am not done healing enough to feel comfortable giving my all, but I dont want anyone to think I am something that I am not. So the beginning starts with me. Plain and simple. Take it or leave it. I am not going to be the pushover that everyone obviously thinks that I am. I am going to be the man I have been raised to be and worked so hard to become. I am going to be me and hope that one day someone will want exactly who I am.       Tonight is a test. A test to see if being myself can truly pay off in any way. I am going to be 100% honest and express my feelings without worry or concerns about the affects of what I say. I am not going to push myself on anyone or my feelings for that matter. I am simply going to do what feels right. If something negative comes of it, I will not blame myself for the negative reaction. If nothing comes of it, then nothing was meant to happen. If something positive comes from it, then I am sure it will make me much happier than I have been in quite some time.      One thing is for certain. I am starting at the beginning but I am already tired of being alone in this world with no one to care for or care for me. We will see how things go. I can only hope that it all works out.
