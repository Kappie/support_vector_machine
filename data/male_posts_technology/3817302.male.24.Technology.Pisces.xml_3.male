If you see anything that's not on the list, comment and I'll add it to the list when I get around to it.       Here we go, in no particular order: Sets of Galimar Thugs, lightly to moderately armed and armored(4pcs.) Orcs, assorted, falchions and/or shortswords Evil Wizard guy Various Barbarians in league with Evil Wizard Guy Barbarian Twins, Galimar's bodyguards(grr....) Galimar (hardest... end boss... ever!) Chaos Beast  Ettins Pirates Attacking army at Gondor (Yes, siege of Gondor, heh heh) w/ Ballistae or Catapults (can't remember) Mole thing, lots of little mole thing babies Small Hydra   COMMENT and add to the list!
