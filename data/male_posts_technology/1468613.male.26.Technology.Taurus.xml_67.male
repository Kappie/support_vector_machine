As you may or may not know, the clyde river is a little similar to the Yarra in terms of it's color and willingness of people to actually be in it. So I'm joggin along, past the parks, the industrial estates. I make it past the stench of the sewerage farm - I try to run faster to get past the smell but I only end up breathing harder and breathing in more of the smell. So I make it past the built up area and from what I can see there's only grasslands near the river and I come to the estates where I can see the towering commission housing flats. As I make it past a small bush I come a cross a burnt-out wreck of a car. Don't know how long it's been there - I'm not really one for forensic science. So I'm thinking, interesting area, don't know if I'd really like to live here. So I decide to keep on going and I get to a point where I can see the huge Rangers stadium. The path actually goes down and to the left there is a large corrigated iron fence separating what looked like scrub and the path. As I'm jogging a bit further I come across a lane-way going away from the river and there's another burnt out reck, but this one I guessed was pretty recent because it was still smouldering. And I'm thninking, I really don't want to be here now and make very good progress back home.  After that experience, I think I"ll just go to the gym after all.
