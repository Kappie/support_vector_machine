She then told me that   SFW   cut her hair off.  Of course I heard   SFW   in the background saying tell your daddy why I cut your hair off and Karissa would reply no I can't tell him.  Well apparently what happened was that   SFW   gave Karissa some scissors in her room to cut paper and then left to get Karissa some breakfast (now a responsible person might ask is it wise to leave a 4YO unattended with scissors) and while she was gone Karissa decided to work on her skills as a hair stylist using her own hair.    After   SFW   explained this to me Karissa got on the phone and said "sorry daddy"  I simply said there is nothing to be sorry about honey your hair will grow back.  Daddy is not upset or mad at you. Can you do daddy a favor though and not do it again?  She gave me a resounding yes.    SFW   said that she gave Karissa the scissors to use in her room   1. because Karissa's pediatrician said they should allow Karissa to have scissors in her room (not sure how a conversation like this would even come up at the pediatricians office)  2.  They were kids scissors and were not supposed to be able to cut.  I had 2 thoughts that I voiced to   SFW    1.  I am wondering what the phychological qualifications of the pediatrician are and why they would advise that it is Ok to leave a 4YO unattended with scissors? 2.  If they are supposed to cut paper then what would make one think they would not cut anything else?  Now I am a reasonable person and understand that a child will experiment with cutting their hair that is understandable, Hell I did it!  But I question the logic behind the lack of supervision with regard to sharp instruments!  Anyway Karissa and I talked some more about other stuff that was going on that day and then she started watching Dora on TV so of course the TV became the baby sitter.    While Karissa was watching Dora   SFW   and I talked again.  She advised me that she wanted Karissa back by the 31st of July (I can only assume she knows of the upcoming legal maneuver and as a result wants to pick Karissa up at the same time she is here for court.  Of course she is assuming she is going to walk out of the court room a victor) I said that I would agree to letting her pick Karissa up by then if she would agree to my not paying her Child Support from 15 July to 31 July.      SFW   basically said I am not sure I can do that I need that money to buy Karissa's bus ticket and I have a car payment due.  I then took the opportunity to advise her that child support is intended for the support of the child not the support of the childs mommy's car!  So I was not sympathetic to her need to make a car payment.  I stated that since she would not be supporting the child then I did not see a reason to pay her child support.  I told her that I basically choose between food or gas for the car with the money I have left after paying her.  In addition she has Karissa all the time I only have her when it is convenient so let me at least have the money so I can support Karissa and do fun stuff while she is here.     SFW   said she would let me know tomorrow.  I told her I wanted it in writing as I would not trust any verbal agreement with her!  Karissa then got back on the phone and said "Thank you daddy!"  I said what for honey and she then stated "Thank you daddy for the bear"   urlLink (See her bear here)  I said oh did you get your bear and crayons and she said in a very happy, excited voice Yes!  She asked me why I sent her crayons and I said because you kept saying you could not find any crayons so I sent you some.  Karissa opened the box and said let me see if I can find pink.  The phone was silent for a minute and then she yelled I found pink daddy (She should have had no trouble there as it was the big box of crayola crayons).  So basically the call ended from there Karissa gave me hugs and kisses and then hung up on me.  Although the hanging up on people still bugs me I did not mind so much today.
