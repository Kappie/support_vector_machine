But I don't agree with this step taken by the FDA. I mean... it'll be a logistical nightmare to collect all the Dairy Milk chocolates from every nook and cranny of Mumbai, won't it?!  The FDA should've made a public announcement that went somewhat like... " People in Mumbai are hereby instructed to consume Cadbury's Dairy Milk chocolates only with Pepsi or Coke. The pesticides in the colas will be put to good use by using them to kill off the worms found in the Dairy milk chocolates!! "
