When the snow comes down it makes no sound but the sound  of an angel's sighing.  Can you say this isn't real?  It's not a dream that I'm seeing here.  It would be a dream if I could live  inside that moment,  and run along side the shining unicorn.  But instead I watch as the sun  melts her color into green.  -thoris
