Matt Werner, the author of the aforementioned blog, is similar to Will Hunting in that he is sitting on a winning ticket of intelligence, and he's too much of a sissy to cash it in. If he's still writing this blog from a sales job in 20 years, coming over to my house to watch Patriots games...I'll kill him. Actually he can watch games with measdf. Honestly though, a sale is made on every blog - whatever that means. Sell yourself on your future, its the RIP of a LIFETIME!" - Gianni Moltisanti
