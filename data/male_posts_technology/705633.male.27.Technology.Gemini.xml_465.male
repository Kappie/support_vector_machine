In between all my work I managed to find the 5 eggs and submitted my email address not expecting to hear any more about it...  To my surprise this morning I got an email:  To: Scott Wickenden From: iwantoneofthose.com Subject: You're a Winner!  Congratulations Scott, you're a winner! You're one of the 5 lucky winners of our Easter Egg Hunt and we have a £100.00 waiting to be emailed to you.    How lucky can one man be, really I mean it. If you are reading this and sometimes feel like you have very little luck in this world I think I could be to blame  This year already I have got an amazing deal on a car. Have had my wages increased more that anyone in the island so far. bought a house for half the price it should have been. had my marrage proposal accepted by the lovely Kate. The list goes on and on, Time to get that lottery ticket one thinks!!  I'll stop bragging now and will say a big thank you to Maria Constantinou at  urlLink http://www.iwantoneofthose.com  for organising the competition. Keep up the good work!!! I have ordered a plot of land on the moon and a whole lot more. I will let you know all about it when I get it down.
