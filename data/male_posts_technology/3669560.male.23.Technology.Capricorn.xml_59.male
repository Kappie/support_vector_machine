"  Oh Holy SHIT  ," he screamed. Everyone laughed at this, I think because it rang true with all of us. The youth of the world are thirsting for a return to a time when the Dark Knight was actually dark--and didn't suck.  I thought  urlLink Frank Miller and Darren Aronofsky  finally got around to adapting Miller's kickass  urlLink Batman: Year One .   urlLink They havent . That is annoying. Still,  urlLink Christopher Nolan  is as good as anyone else I can think of to adapt the story and direct it (anyone besides Miller and Aronofsky).   urlLink Aronofsky  is doing two other graphic novels instead it seems. An adaptation of Alan Moore's  urlLink Watchmen  (a favorite of my friend  urlLink Ben , I've never read it) and something called  urlLink Lone Wolf and Cub , which I've never heard of.  IMDB.com though says Watchmen is slated for 2005 and I haven't heard a thing about it, Lone Wolf is even sooner and nothing at all about it either. Strange.  I'm no insider, but 2004 is running down and the movie doesn't even have a website.  Anyway, this is good news for fans of good comic books, though I   really   don't like the looks of this:       Nolan has some 'splaining to do.  And who the hell is  urlLink this guy ? Writing Dark City isn't resume enough to be given a batman screenplay, esp. when that resume also includes  urlLink Demonic Toys . Though he did the three Blades. He's essentially an unknown quantity.
