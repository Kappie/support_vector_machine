Dec. 18 = Moulin Rouge hits DVD, You know I HAVE to own this movie. Especially since I DO consider it one of the greatest films ever. Dec. 19 = LORD OF THE RINGS hits theatres nationwide.  These will be my 2 favorite movie days I believe. Also, I think maybe they'll do a midnight showing of LOTR at Cinerama and you know I'm all over that, if I can get tickets. I mean it's fuckin' LOTR.   Oh so my yesterday... I went to church in the morning with Big A and Cliff and Hannah. Then we went to Thai food afterward. mmmm... Thai food. (items ordered: vegi Red Curry***, something fire**, cashew chicken***, and Pud Thai Chicken**:)) Then we went and saw Monsters, Inc at Oaktree. It was fun, and we got to see the Episode 2 teaser. Then we came back here and I got a headache, so I was in bed from 6pm till 7:15 this morning.  hmm.... my birthday is on saturday, in case anyone was curious:)  Have a good day everyone...
