Well, all I can say is that men and women percieve things differently, so naturally, they disagree on what is an overreaction and what is not. And I know that some girls are worse at "overreacting" than others, just as some are more emotional and flighty than others, and some are more emotionally balanced. But please don't say that women lack rational reasoning. It's just that sometimes their rational reasoning is overrided by their emotions.... like Captain Kirk.....
