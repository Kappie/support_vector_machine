I haven't ever actually beaten any of them, but I've watched my bud Cory play through some of 'em.  So I decided to put an end to that and play the Legacy of Kain / Soul Reaver series out.  I'm currently on Blood Omen 2 and really really liking it.  Game play is good, but you do it for the story -- oh, and for the stealth kills.  Seriously, I've spent like 10 minutes leading a victim around until I could get a stealth kill off on 'em, they're that fun, or I'm that lame -- take your pick.  After the events in Blood Omen 2, Soul Reaver 1  2 occur, then finally Blood Omen 3 / Soul Reaver 3.  I put the slash there as both games are the same game.  It's called Legacy of Kain: Defiance (and as such is technically Blood Omen 3), however in the game you play through as both Kain  and  Rahziel, and it effectively ties up both series', so there.  What else, oh, Magic.  Leagued with Jess -- there's probably a law against how much shit one individual can rip of another’s, and if so I had to have broken it.  I'm talking shotgun to the steak and taters level of fucked up here.  But  I don't gloat, it's unbecoming.  I was off on Tuesday and Wednesday, and boy howdy did I abuse those days.  I woke up at 15:30 or so on Tuesday, after having gone to slumber at 02:30ish that morn.  Yes that is right I slept 13 hours, and it felt flipping wonderful.  I started playing Blood Omen 2 at about 16:00, and finally decided I should go to bed when I noticed the sun was going to be actually rising.  There were occasional breaks of, you know, bodily functions and stuff.  I believe I may have even consumed some sort of foodstuff, maybe.  Wednesday, after a short six hour nap I arose at the halfway mark between noon and one.  I spent most of the time between then and about 15:30 reading the  urlLink SRD  and updating my DnD character to 3.5, which is especially cumbersome because he's a Psychic Warrior, and with the release of the Expanded Psionics Handbook (Psionics 3.5) they've  totally revamped.  Maybe I'll post 'em here, who knows.  But then, I traveled into the outside world, to the land of Rave (our local movie-hut) and purchased 4 tickets for Spiderman 2, which I enjoyed immenenemin, immensismas, ememinims -- a whole lot.  I won't post any spoilers, although I do want to take a moment to talk about one thing in particular.  So if you don't want to hear anything about the movie because you haven't seen it yet, do not read the rest of this paragraph, or poke your eyes out, whichever you prefer.  I'll give you a moment.  Hmm.  Hmmm hmmm.  Now that that business is concluded lets continue: the Octavius hospital scene.  When you see the movie, see if you'll agree with my sentiments here.  The Octavius hospital scene seemed out of place.  It wasn't bad, or in bad taste, to me at least.  Just that the way the filmed it, stylistically, seemed out of sorts with the way they presented the rest of the film.  I'm wondering if it was intentional, and if so was it meant to cause evocation of certain emotion?  Which emotion?  That’s all I got to say about that.  I think I'm going to start a trend in my posts and announce where the post title for that post came from.  If you read the other posts, their post titles are often non-sensical, unrelated.  This is by design, usually, and by chaos mostly.  To kick it off, this posts title of  Monorail!  stems from Simpson’s episode:  urlLink Marge vs. the Monorail , a musical number where a song about a Monorail happens.
