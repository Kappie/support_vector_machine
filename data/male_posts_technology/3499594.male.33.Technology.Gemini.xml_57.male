I stood in line for nearly an hour to go through security. It was held in the Fort Smith Convention Center. Cheyney was a bit late arriving and spoke for about 35-40 minutes. I was able to tape nearly all of the speech and of course taking as many digital pics as possible. I am posting one of the better ones of him. I was able to shake his and his wifes hand. I am grateful to have a good job to enable me to be able to escape for such things. Of course I will put in that same time if not more but I cannot gripe. I figured this would be the only chance to actually see him in person.  He spoke very clear and was very articulated. I was very impressed with his speech.   Per request, I found the speech on the Bush Cheyney Website. It is here..  urlLink http://georgewbush.com/News/Read.aspx?ID=3164
