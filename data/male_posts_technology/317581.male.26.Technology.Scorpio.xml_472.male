Turning off love is hard though. As a Scorpio, I often get jealous over future boyfriends which is ridiculous. I think mostly I am sad that I cannot be with her anymore. I won't be able to enjoy the journey anymore. I feel like I'm getting left behind. But even as I write that, I think of how I have my own journey to take up.  I'm a bit torn. I don't want to give her up, but I also want to move on and start up the next relationship. Mainly I want to fill up the hole in my heart. But I don't want to just have a girlfriend that is a patch. No rebounds. I don't want a rebound. I just want an open honest relationship with no baggage.  Then there's the point of, is she easily replaceable? Hell NO! But is there a salve that won't hurt anyone? No. There's the life of the monk, but then she'll feel guilty. There's the life of the party-er, but then I and she will only despise me as a slut. (*would it be easier if I were secretly a jerk that only cared about 1 thing?*)  Anyway, I wish God hadn't made women so irresistible :) But I'm glad he did. I'm going to leave you on an up note today, while I try and sleep earlier tonight.  So check out this link which is a hilarious account of the  urlLink End of the world .
