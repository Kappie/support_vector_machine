Ppl at my old workplace kept on hankering for me to be with her. But ( a big but!!!), I respect her privacy. Maybe she doesn't satisfied with her carefree life yet. Added to  that her burden have been increased due to those filthy, $#@*@### albabs who takes only one call per day? Pah! If they wanted that, just replace me here...I'm happily to go back there and get my hands dirty....  One sad note, my dearest bro (he's adopted by my father  coincidencely he is my sis bf) met with near fatal accident last week (midnite on 13th to be precise)! He's okay right now but considering the wrecked saga, I wondered that it was a miracle that he survived. Granted that he had a punctured right lung  cracked hip bones but he survived nonetheless!!! And I wouldn't have it any other way! Alhamdulillah!!!  Hopes that the coming week are not as bad as this one. For now I shall end my post in a muslim's way that I have neglected far too long...  All that are/were good came from Allah... All that are/were bad came from my own self... Wassalam
