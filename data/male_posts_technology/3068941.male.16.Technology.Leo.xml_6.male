It's a 12 hour drive there and 11 hours back luckily I had my lovely I-Pod to entertain me, Once there I got to fly a Cessna and it was AWESOME I CAN FLY, actually I cant but when I get my license I will. Oh and I got my hair cut this weekend, It looks like a Lamas Ass, actually it's not that bad, But IT MUST BE CHANGED so I shall dye it blue and call it FLUFFY and it shall be my pet.   Also I finally an going to see The Rocky Horror Picture show, whose soundtrack has been stuck in my head for weeks and well not that it's a bad soundtrack cause If it where I wouldn't have it stuck in my head but the fact that I have random urges to sing Sweet Transvestite during school scare me because I can barely resist the urge.
