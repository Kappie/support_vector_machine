Assuming it is what I think it is, that age old British sporting tradition of tying two people together and letting them kick seven shades out of each other's shins - but in the nuddie, then I think it would be a great way to solve the Group B qualification problem where England draw 0-0 with Croatia tonight and the Swiss beat France 4-0. Forget play-offs/penalty shoot outs/away goals/goals against etc and just tie Wayne Rooney to Thierry Henry and let them kick sh!t out of each other. My money's on Wayne.   Edit:  Link fixed and SFW
