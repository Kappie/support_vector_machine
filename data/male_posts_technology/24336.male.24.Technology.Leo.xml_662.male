I will be flying into Detroit just so I can turn around and drive to Chicago (don't ask) for New Year's Eve.  After the festivities, I will be driving back to Detroit to see family and friends for a few days before flying back to Seattle.  A week later, I will be flying out to Detroit for a long weekend to attend the  urlLink auto show .  Here are the details:
