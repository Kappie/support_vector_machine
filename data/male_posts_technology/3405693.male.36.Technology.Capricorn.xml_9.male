Other than the fact that I found out the job I thought I would get with Bell was filled by someone else, and that my backup plan at the same company, a Mat leave fill in for a year or so, is gonna be filled internally.  Which kinda put me in a pisser.  This whole getting my career back on track thing really is starting to feel like swimming through peanut butter, but without the yummy fat and the peanut buttery taste.  I decided to check out the website of a wireless company that will be launching in Canada soon, but they have no Canadian site yet.  So that's on the back burner.  Do I make a move to Calgary for a job?  I don't really want to, but I may have to.  I have some contacts, and Calgary is where all the action is happening these days.  But man...winter...yech.  I mean I dig winter, but only if I can drive away from it at the end of the day.  And prairie dry air.  Goodbye perfectly coiffed hair (HAH! Like that ever actually happens).  Goodbye sparkling singing voice.   The other downer about moving to alberta would be the end of the band...not that we're going anywhere quickly, but it is the one consistent bit of joy I get in my somewhat stressful life of late.    So I guess it's time to actually start weighing all these cons with the pros and start sending rezzies to Calgary companies anyways.  I guess if I get a job offer I can always make the move decision then...
