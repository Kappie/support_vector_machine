And makes The Evan's Twins DD done by me and JaQ look  fashionable.  Ok, so it doesn't have random dancing elmos, or ducks...but its still awful.   Maybe something blue-ish, with white or purple. Or blue with white. Or white with blue. Or blue light blue and dark blue! YEAH!  And thus the end of the rant of design.  ~Teh Karine~   "Because nautical colours make the world go 'round"
