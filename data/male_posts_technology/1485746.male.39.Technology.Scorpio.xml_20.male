I have finished all but the last two sections of the Kudos World Series (KWS), so I have only Extreme and Ultimate remaining.  Most of them I just ran through on Steel level, but I am gradually going through and re-running them on Silver level.  Currently, I have four sections on Silver.  My long-term goal is to complete them all on Silver so that I can unlock the Porsche 911 GT1.  More updates as I progress.
