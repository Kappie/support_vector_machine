In fact, I cannot summon the words necessary to adequately describe the outrageous carnage this film leaves in its wake.  Uma Thurman -- not my favorite actress -- can play a pretty mean woman with a vendetta.  But then again, wouldn't you be pissed if you were beaten senseless and shot in the head by your good friends on your wedding day?  Yeah, I thought you would.  Somehow she survives the ordeal, losing her baby in the process (yes, she was pregnant) and upon waking from a coma, decides to kill every one of her former death squad comrades.  All quite logical.
 
 Tarrentino somehow manages to throw in a little art here and there.  Actually, the movie itself makes for more entertainment than what the movie is actually about, if that makes sense.  The visuals, sets, fight scenes and music are all amazing.  This movie, as you might expect from Tarrentino, manages to include Kung Fu, Japanese anime, cool music, stylish clothes, and time play into a montage of blood and guts.  The fight scene between Thurman and uber-cute-in-a-domineering-sort-of-way Lucy Liu was particularly dramatic for its stark contrast between the serenity of a Japanese garden covered in newly fallen snow and the ultra-violence which transpires within it.
 
 In short, if you can stand a heavy dose of maiming and killing mixed in with large amounts of spurting guts and blood, I highly recommend the film.  If you are easily disturbed at the sight of people losing limbs, stay away.  Thank you, I'm here all week.
