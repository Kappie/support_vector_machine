The worst is at my left ball of my foot.  That is where I get my gout.  I think I also rolled my right ankle trying to drive the lane against someone a foot taller than me.  I have some sort of limp when I walked today.  I shot the ball terribly.  I only reached double digits in the game of 21 once (and we played way more than one).  I need the practice.  I also need to regain my dribbling.  Oh yeah, and smoking is bad for you.  Definitely bad.  Although I was able to play for a couple of hours, I did have to take a break to catch my breath.  Smoking is definitely bad.  We might play again today, we'll see.  I'm also not sure about going out tonight since my gout foot is acting up.  I'de rather not chance it since I am going on vacation in a month.  That's about it.  I wish I wasn't at work.  Need to heal.
