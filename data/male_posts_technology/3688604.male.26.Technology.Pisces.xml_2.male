Most of the die hards from Lincoln hung back after a fairly short time.  I keep hearing that GBV isn't what they used to be; that they are practically dead; that they lack energy, etc.  It really makes me wish I had even heard of them when they were supposedly in their heyday.  The show was completely fucking awesome.  Robert Pollard's personality pours off of him in waves hard enough to knock you the fuck over.  He really has quite a tremendous ability to get this across to the audience.  His band in general DOES kind of lack energy - the show felt most like Robert Pollard WITH Guided By Voices in that they were less a cohesive unit and more just a bunch of guys trying to follow a musical behemoth but not completely being able to keep up.  I'm just glad I got to see him with his band once before they're gone - I don't care what ANYONE else says, this was a damn great show.  On another subject entirely, I do have to say that that scottish gum on that Extra commercial PISSES ME THE FUCK OFF.  If you haven't seen this thing, it is a fucking piece of chewing gum with a three dimensional face who wanders about like he owns the place and talks with an intensely irritating Scottish accent.  Now don't get me wrong, I have no problem with Scotland, the home of my most favorite beverage, but JESUS CHRIST I SWEAR I am going to stomp on god damn Angus McGum with cletes on and then wipe him on a bike rack next to the golf course he likes to hang out at.  I'M THE TASTY CHEW THAT CAN OUTLAST YOU!  Outlast THIS you chewy little piece of SHIT!!  Anyway, on the latest commercial, I was praying Angus would drown in the water hazard but he's all like YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO STOP ME?! and he was JUST FINE.  Arrogant little bastard, he's like a cockroach during nuclear winter.  So at any rate, to sum up, FUCK YOU ANGUS.  Next time Extra uses him in a commercial it seems likely that I will suffer a stress induced heart attack.  It was nice knowing you.  Well that wraps this shitstorm up.  THE BARON HAS SPOKEN.
