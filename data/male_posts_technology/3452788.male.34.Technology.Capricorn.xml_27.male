I totally see everthing that they are talking about in my problems with the kids, especially Nikki.  My past mistakes are the major source of her anger, and in part why she acts the way she does toward me and others sometimes.  She has learned how to be angry from me.  I feel horrible for this, but I will not beat myself up about it.  I am not the same person I was six months ago.    What I will do is take action, starting TONIGHT, by explaining as best as she can understand what this means and how I will work to make sure I do not do any more damage.  She is only 7, but a very smart 7, and she has very little problem putting her feelings into words, even when she knows they are hurtful to herself or others.  Instead of trying to control her, I need to convince her to be a partner with me, to help establish reasonable limits, and to make sure she doesn't blame herself for my problems and actions.  Finally, I just need to shower her with love instead of anger.  I love my little girl so much it hurts.  She has such potential and freedom and creativity inside, and if I can learn how not to stifle her growth, she will be a spectacular person.  (Not to overlook my son, I love him just as much, but in a different way.)  I have been given so much, it's time for me to appreciate it and make sure I don't miss out on feeling happy for and proud of my kids.
