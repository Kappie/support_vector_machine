Have to put this into note...that the next job ain't would be shift based...cause although in the first week....it sucks... But then ...i have a family here in KL....friends ...that seems like family...probably i could conduct my own visitation ...hmm...whats more with Wai Nyan most probably moving into his new house...i can probably volunteer.. Me heret typing angrily over something i must get over with it as soon as possible. Haaa....(sigh) ...i have to leave it to Jesus...Praise God i have free day off at Christmas and New Year,...but the hope of getting leave for Chinese NEw year is dashed...especially with the company excuse of probation....is ridiculous.. What does probation gotta do with Chinese most important time of the year.s....  Something to pray about and get over with...
