Bush! -Love Ubersoft! -Update Virus Info!  So, that's why Blogger is *so* much better than LiveJournal. Oh, and blogger has higher uptime and is much faster, and the parent company is  urlLink Pyra Labs  which is owned by  urlLink Google.  Didya know that searching for "kjell jackso"  on Google will result in 200 OK being the first result? Nifty. Anyways, I leave you with a quote from Agent 47: "SPAS 12 gauge...Handy." (the SPAS 12 is a SWAT shotgun.)  [Music:] Bob Gerig, It Never Gets Easier (ChoiceRadio Indie Rock Channel at 100Kbps)  Current Clipboard Contents: I am so outta here. See you,  (Used as a template for when I signed off last night.)
