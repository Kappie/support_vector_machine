Thanks for blogging everyone. Your really keeping up the point of a group blog. I'm going to now invite some random people to join this so tough if you don't like them or whatever, its not as if anyone has given any suggestions. I'm going to invite:  Dave T (give him a re-try), Paul, Andy See how they work with this and then maybe some more depending how many people actually blog.  For now; I had a good time in Barcelona. Not that anyone has really asked. Except Paul. Then again I did see him yesterday. Or Matt. He asked. Thats about it really.
