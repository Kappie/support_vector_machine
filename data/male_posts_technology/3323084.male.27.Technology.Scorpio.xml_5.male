I would also like to let you know that if you find any errors in my post that I am not good at writing, spelling, and I am not good at expressing my self in words.  I hope to improve though, through this blog. I've always believed practice make perfect.  With that said, I would like for my blog to be about subjects that really matter to me, and to be my soapbox for political  evens. Any comments are welcome, and I hope to post about once or twice a week.  That's all for now.
