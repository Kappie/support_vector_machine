If the last couple months are any indication, this will guarantee not only mediocrity, but perhaps more ineptitude as time goes by. This promises to be a rewarding way to spend five or six hours a week (or more).  Can you feel the frustration? Well, it's more like a resignation to a given course of action, since I really do want to become good at golf, and so I am going to practice more. But it's so clear that it hurts sometimes. I went and played a couple holes of golf today, thinking I might get some practice, and I did. The problem was, I could have done the same thing in half the time by not even bothering to go out on the course. But playing the official course is always a temptation.  This post isn't very interesting.
