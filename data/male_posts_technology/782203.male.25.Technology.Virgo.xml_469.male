So much so that I decided that I am gonna use the word 'toxic' as a substitute for the the word 'cool' from now on.  This is how you use the word in your everyday conversations.  "That was such a toxic performance." "Dude that gal is so toxic I bet she has a burning sensation when she pisses!" "That guy is like totally greenpeace! Loser!"   Spread the word people. Cos if you don't you are like totally greenpeace !!
