I think the entire populace of India would be better off if we abstained from voting.  I mean look at the farcical affair whose results we were treated to today. Does the average office going middle class person give a hoot either way whether it’s the corrupt BJP buggers or the corrupt Congress buggers ruining this country?   The net result is ruination whether its forced down our throats by ‘the lotus’ or ‘the hand‘ is a piffling triviality which is scarily inconsequential. Which of course brings us back to my initial suggestion of the entire country abstaining. Maybe the sound of wind whistling through empty poll stations will be heard more clearly than our cries.  Surprisingly, as stirring that rather weighty prologue might have been it does not even begin to touch upon the topic which moved me to write. Fortunately or unfortunately we seem (at least in my opinion) to be on our way to welcoming an Ex Italian lady as our next prime minister.  Now you must realize that I have absolutely nothing against Italy or its people I just find it remarkable that at the end of the day the Indian voter is ‘smart’ or ‘stupid’ enough to actually elect a naturalized citizen as the wielder of ‘Supreme Executive Power’ in the country.  I find this amazing fact rather disturbing at best because try as I might to associate this outcome to the glorious magnanimity and wisdom of the average Indian I know that the true reason resides in our own stupidity.  Which, brings me back to my original rant wouldn’t it have been better to simply not vote.  My countrymen still baffle me……   or maybe I baffle my countrymen……
