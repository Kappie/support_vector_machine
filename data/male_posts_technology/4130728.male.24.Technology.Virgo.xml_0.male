After a while they look up from the pizza to find that the others have pizza on their nose, so all of them burst out in laughter. After a while, one of them stops laughing when he understands that he also has pizza on his nose. How did he know? (All three are assumed to be good in logic). As you usual select area below for answer.   Answer: -----------  I'm not very sure of this anwser though:  Lets call them A, B  C. Since each mathematician can see the other two,each at the begining thinks that he himself is laughing seeing the other two guys have pizza on their nose and he also thinks that the other two guys are laughing at each other without being aware that they had pizza on their nose. This is their initial reasoning but once laughter continues for a while, they'll see that their initial reasoning is flawed, since the situation of all three of them laughing for a prolonged period when only two have pizza on their nose is not possible when thinking of it logically.  For instance, when looking at it from A's point of view: B  C have pizza on their nose and so A laughs. He sees B  C also laughing and thinks... "B is luaghing seeing C have pizza on his nose, B doesn't get alarmed that he has pizza on his own nose because he thinks that I am also laughing at the pizza in C's nose. At the same time C is laughing because he sees pizza at B's nose and thinks that I'm also laughing with him at the pizza on B's nose". So from A's point of view He sees perfect reason in the fact that all three of them are laughing and B, C get a similar line of thought and see reason in the fact that all three are laughing. Now after a while, A will realize that he has pizza on his nose too, because his reasoning would go as follows:  (You need to bear this in mind while seeing A's reasoning: he assumed in his initial theory for laughter: Only B and C have pizza on their nose):  he'd now put himself at B's place and think of what B would have thought. According to B only C has pizza on his nose. So as soon as he sees C having pizza on his nose, he'd laugh and think that A is laughing for the same reason, but the very moment C started laughing, B must have realized that he had pizza on his nose too (remember A is thinking that he has no pizza on his nose) and immediately stopped. The samething must have happened to C as well. But since they continued laughing, A will realize that the only reasoning possible is that each of them is assuming the same thing, which means that he has pizza on his nose too and therefore stops.    IOW,  Think of A's reasoning....      once he realizes both C continues to laugh eventhough B laughs...
