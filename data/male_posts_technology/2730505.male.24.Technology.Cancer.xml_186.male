That's pretty cool.  I like how themes and shit can be installed and all that crap.  I'm sure it's secure and all that shit.  It's just a fucking hassle to switch broswers to do windows updates and then use IE to listen to launchcast internet radio.  What the fuck?  another issue that I got is that I can't use Firefox to control my virtual machines.  Maybe I gotta install the right plugin/extensions and what not.  I'm still using it for when I do my bullshit browsing but for work stuff I have to stick with IE for VMWare stuff, Oracle stuff and of course, Launchcast radio -IS- work.  yep it's a damn boring day at work today.  I hope that it stays like this for the rest of the day (it's 12:50 PM and I hope that the next 4.5 hours will fly by like it was nothing.  I need a nap.  Northbeach was lame last night.  I was the only one dancing, again.  I was too tired though.  Tonight I think I will most likely be staying in and playing more video games.  I'm just too tired to go anywhere.  Tomorrow is the supposed party at Jerry's cousin's apt.  I don't know if I want to go.  I am feeling a bit under the weather lately.  I think it's the lack of sleep and the long fucking days man.  I dunno.  2 weeks and I turn 24.  Wow I am getting old.  In two weeks, 30 is only going to be 6 years away.  I just want to leave work right now, buy a 12 pack, take a nap, eat dinner, fuck some people up by shooting them in the face in RS3.  Yeah...I'm a loser but whatever, I'm fucking tired.
