Luckily all my team turned up and were healthy so I didn't have to run :D Watched a film in English which was ok. Going to be playing Planetside tonight hopefully. I'll get some screenshots to make a better signature for Vasquez (my character's name).  What I've Been Playing:  Planetside. Lead a platoon last night. We resecured Amerish after a few hours and I got a few Command Experience Points. We were going to play a king of the hill game at a tower on the test server but it was just crap so we didn't bother.  In the News:  Saddam Hussein had his first court appearance today. He mocked the court and said he was still president. He refused to sign his legal papers and called the court a "theatre".  Construction of the barrier the Israeli military is constructing on the West Bank has been halted by an Israeli court. They say although the wall is legal, some sections cause too much disruption to the lives of Palestinians and must be re-routed.  Other Stuff:  Sony are working on a new Walkman model. It'll be a digital music player (an MP3 player that...Dosn't play... MP3s... lol, all will be explained) instead of an antique tape player. It is set to be Â£55 cheaper and with considerably more space than the top iPod model (which it is settot rival). However, there is a catch. It will only play music in sony's own special format - so u have to buy your music digitally from the sonyonlinee music store. However I'm sure some genius will make a program to convert MP3s to theSonyy format.  Can't wait until Saturday when I can see Kirsty!
