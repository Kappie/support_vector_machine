I had a lot of fun, but I didn't get anything done. I had planned on getting caught up on my laundry as I was down to one towel. I also had plans to finish my research on President Bush. Finally, I wanted to join a gym that I had found about two blocks from work. It wasn't much to do, but once again, I allowed life to run me around in circles. I didn't get one thing done. So this week, I am going to buckle down and get things accomplished. Tank's dad is going through a divorce. It is heartbreaking to see. Divorce is... I hope I never  ever  have to go through one. My mom has been divorced three times. I have seen first hand what kind of damage happens. The people that go through them are never the same. I'm going through withdrawal symptoms. I haven't read a book in about two weeks. I haven't even had time to go to the bookstore and look at them. I also haven't been to a movie since seeing Spiderman. I promised I would write something about food this week, and since I didn't get to research Bush, I figure I can at least write about food. A really good friend of mine, Popeye, called me yesterday about 11am. I hadn't went to sleep yet so I hopped up and answered it. Anyway, I ended up having lunch with him. We went to urlLink Uno's Chicago Grill in Teays. Our waitress was fairly attractive and I was running late to meet Popeye, so when she asked my what I wanted, I told her to order me her favorite. She brought me a dish called RattlesnakePasta. It's sauteed chicken and penne in a creamy cheddar-jalapeno sauce with a dash oftabasco.Anywho, it was one of the better dishes I have had from there. She said it was supposed to be spicy, but other than the couple of jalapeno's, it wasn't hot at all. I ended up talking more than eating. But, this just left me with some leftovers to put in my refrigerator. Well, with all the talk of food, I am now hungry. I'll post as soon as I can, but until my sister gets married, I won't have much time.
