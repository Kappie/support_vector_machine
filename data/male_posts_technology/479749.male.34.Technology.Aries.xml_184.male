I couldn't remember her name but she was a big help in that she would give me a countdown as I closed in on the end of the set.  Had another strange dream about my Mom which left me not exactly ready to face the day. Plus I was sore from not stretching after softball last night.  Workout 5 min stationary bike Stretch Bench squat 20 no weight 15 crunches  urlLink Bent over delta rises  12 Bench Squat 15 no weight 15 crunches  urlLink Bent over delta rises  12  urlLink Supine leg curls  12 Knee lifts 10 Supine leg curls 10 Knee lifts 8 Pull down 12 Seated Row 12  10:00 min stationary bike	   Post Workout notes: The Supine leg curls just flat out kill....again. I did better with keeping the ball under control but man it is not fun.  I caught a burst of energy midwork out but half way into the bike my heart was pumping so hard I thought I was going to drop. So I backed off and took a long shower in the handicap shower that has a seat in it till I was able to bring my heart rate down to a dull roar. I'm feeling better over all but the weight is still not moving which is a downer.
