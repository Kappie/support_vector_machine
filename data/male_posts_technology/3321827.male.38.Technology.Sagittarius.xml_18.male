'He had absolutely no ego, and he was very comfortable in his own skin; therefore, he didn't feel he ever had to prove anything to anyone."  Truer words could not be said about the greatest President in my lifetime and likely one of the best of all time.  If we could only find another leader like Reagan, our country could be great again.  I'm truly sad today.
