The Handmaid's Tale, decent, kind of like 1984, but much more feministic, sometimes it creeps me out.  Snow Falling on Cedars, Haven't started yet, sounds boring.  And the Scarlet Letter, lot of hype around this book, but I still don't want to read it.  I don't like to read unless it's on my own terms and this most definitely is not.  I have a hard time reading inside, to get any real reading done I go outside to a high place, in this case on top of my old tree house, sitting in a lawn chair and just go at it and knock down like 50-80 pages.  I would enjoy the book if I read it on my own time, but I only have like 4 more days till school starts and I'm really sweating getting this done.  I wouldn't normally, but the entire reason I'm doing this is for a girl who probably will never go out with me, but what the hell I gotta try.  I'm writing this at like 2 in the morning and I am wide awake.
