I had felt the same voices which have saved me from difficult times and telling me not to give up, I have felt the same voice when I saved many lives in a bus accident years ago, I felt the same voice congratulating me when I won my first award and I have felt it when I am always alone and telling me that somebody is there to take care of me. Who is this? Why is it following me? What good does it get when it helps me, encourages me, Warns me of danger, loves me, protects me and takes care of me 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days in a year.  Could somebody tell me what is happening to me?   STOP...I really know who it is? Do you also want to know or share the same excitement that I am going through.? Its none other than the warrior inside you...the ultimate war machine which nobody except god can stop it.   Every person has a warrior within waiting to be called, waiting to be kindled, waiting to give it control to destroy the negative forces that overpower you and harm you. Everybody has a hero inside which can save many lives, everybody has a child inside that cares and everybody has warrior inside who is highly trained, only that you have to call it, seek help and give it the control.   What happens to a person who is in deep trouble. He has no way out and he has nobody to take care and nobody to take help from. What is last thread of existence, who will you rely on? ....YOU....ITS ALWAYS YOURSELF  who you can rely on, trust and seek guidance. Just be silent for sometime and hear the voices inside you...hear the warrior telling you something....hear him and merge with the warrior to fight back and show the world who you are.   Its all a matter of listening to yourself. When you decide something the inner voice will help you to make the perfect decision because the warrior knows, the warrior has already laid plans for you to be a success...All you have to do is listen closely, attentively and with full sincerity. What pushes you to save people when you witness a disaster. Even if you are a young guy, old guy or a coward you will suddenly feel the rush of power within you, the urge to save people. Who gives you that power. It is GOD who is giving you the power in the form of a warrior inside you. GOD has implanted a hero in everybody just in case you turn out to be a chicken.    Warriors within do not wake when you cry to yourself and plead it to come out. It does not like cowards. The only way to awaken the warrior is to convince it that you really want to acheive something you desire no matter what, no matter how difficult it is and no matter who you should confront to acheive it. Only then the War machine wakes up and surprises people with the new found ablility, the sudden rise of power that comes within you, the feeling you get when the warrior wakes up.    GO AHEAD...LISTEN TO THE WARRIOR AND GIVE THE WARRIOR A CHANCE WHO IS WAITING TO HELP YOU. GOOD LUCK.
