I hesitantly agreed to go along to see it at Showcase Cinema in Newcastle. I was pleasantly surprised when David Fincher's name came up and it turned out to be an awesome film. Even though I loved Se7en and 12 Monkeys I still thought Pitt was a pretty boy, after Fight Club I changed my opinion and I no longer avoided Pitt films. This has been a bit of a bad move since as I have sat through Legends Of The Fall, Spy Game, Interview With A Vampire, Troy and Meet Joe Black and have found pretty much fluff. The Mexican was vaguely acceptable and Oceans Eleven was enjoyable though. I did however re-watch Kalifornia and Pitt is pretty awesome in what is a pretty shite film. Thanks to Brad Pitt I will watch pretty much anything. If you have seen any other good or bad Pitt films let me know.
