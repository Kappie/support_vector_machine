I'm cancelling my contract with them. Will probably move to Sky for TV - we only had cable TV for internet access but they force you to take a cable TV package in order to get internet access. I believe that unless there is a change of management in this company (at least in the Cancun area) they will be out of business very soon as there are good alternatives:  urlLink Sky  and  urlLink Prodigy/Infinitum .
