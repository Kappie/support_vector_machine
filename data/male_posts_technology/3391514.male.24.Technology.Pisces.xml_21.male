I can only hope they'll be as good.  It transpires that my  Armour  (or Armor) novel has turned up, but no-one was around to answer the phone call from Ottakars.  So I'll be getting it tomorrow.  Or today, depending on your time zone.  Did I mention I got the soundtrack from  The Day After Tomorrow ?  Well, if not, its excellent.  Very nice, although the order of the songs is a little strange.  Did I also mention I have a persistent cough?  It only really affects me on nights, so it stops me from going to sleep, and when I eventually drift off, I wake up late the next day.  Its really irritating.  My beard has also gone, and I can feel air on my chin again... which is simply odd.  This is in response to upcoming pre-ops and my finally getting a haircut.  I'm also very cross.  It seems  Mongoose Publishing , a group of OGL whores, have released  Lone Wolf  (by Joe Dever) as a roleplying game.  This is a bad thing, as this means it's  d20 .  For the uneducated, d20 is a system of roleplaying rules that promotes fighting, min-maxing and not roleplaying at all.  It works for  Dungeons  Dragons  excellently, but not for anything else.  I have some respect for Mongoose, as they are UK-based, which is a good thing, as the UK is not well known for roleplaying games anymore.  However, they do tend to convert everything I love from books and media to the godawful d20 system.  Like  Babylon 5 .  Why can't they make up their own system, or use a better one?  Like  GURPS ?  For the uneducated, GURPS is not a popular system.  I love it, as it encompasses everything I want from a system, character generation is detailed, has lots of rules covering everything, and its also mildly realistic.  Everyone else says it's too complicated to play, too difficult to make characters for, and even combat-centric!  I can accept the third point.  Next time...  Rifts .
