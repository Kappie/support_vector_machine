All my stocks except EMA are down.  Some day it will all turn around and I'll be up again.  Until then I'll just keep regretting not selling when I had the chance.    I'm waiting for a positive profitable quarter and possible merger and acquisition news from ECGI.  I'm waiting for news of funding (independent of further stock dilution) and news of contracts and/or profits from RCO.  Those are my two biggest holdings.    I'm of course tempted to buy more of both RCO and ECGI, with the scant money I have left, but deep down I think may retreat further.
