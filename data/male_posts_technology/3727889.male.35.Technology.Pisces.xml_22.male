I then played a tiny bit less aggressive, which probably fits my style better, and won $95. So I ended up about $30, just peeking over $700. I also won 3rd place in a tourney. Could have won 2nd, but me and the 2nd place guy both went all in against 1st place, and lost. Oh well. I was happy to have played well enough to get to the end. My tourney game as been kinda weak lately, and I wanted to improve on it.  I played "The Hammer" tonight, just for the hell of it. Hit a straight on the river. Was slow playing my crap hand so I only made $5, but Go Hammer! I remember playing it because, it was .50, and hey, it's "THE HAMMER". ACEYOU22 is the jackass that is dissing my play. Here is the hand. Oh wait, I had nothing. Guess the Hammer scared people away. The river must have been another hand. Oh well, I told you they folded when I had a flush on the board:  ***** Hand History for Game 770156413 *****1/2 TexasHT GameTable (Limit) - Tue Jul 20 23:55:20 EDT 2004Table Table 12704  (6 max)  (Real Money) -- Seat 3 is the button Total number of players : 6 Seat 1: metsfanmo ( $34.75) Seat 2: sheldon47 ( $61.75) Seat 3: jsmcgruver ( $62.50) Seat 4: SirFWALGMan ( $80.98) Seat 5: reddogrs ( $6.50) Seat 6: ACEYOU22 ( $11.75) SirFWALGMan posts small blind (0.50) reddogrs posts big blind (1) ** Dealing down cards ** Dealt to SirFWALGMan [ 2h, 7s ]  ACEYOU22 folds. acemetsfanmo folds. sheldon47 folds. jsmcgruver calls (1) SirFWALGMan calls (0.50) SirFWALGMan: thanksreddogrs  checks.** Dealing Flop ** : [ 4s, 3c, 9s ]  SirFWALGMan: thanks for letting me check to the river too, heh.

He was calling me an XXXXXXX because I went in on 7-5 suited and caught a straight on the flop. In 6 handed play, I am in for almost any flush draw. I should be raising, but I am too passive for that. If I make 4 to my flush, then I am calling/raising to the river if I have 2-3 people in. This has made me some HUGE pots. It got so that people knew I played any flush, and if they saw a flush possability they would immediatly fold to any bet I made. It was nice. Anyway, I kind of get pissed off when people tell me that I am playing badly. I know it should not bother me, but I like the way I play. Hell, I was up $95 for the night, I must have been doing something right! I recently have read alot about being aggresive on draw hands when there are enough people in to make pot odds. Maybe this is an advanced concept for the people I play with? Why can they not understand this? Well.. more money for me.  One other thing about this guy, he said that I make poker less fun for other people. HELLO! I hope I do make it less fun. I hope I kick you butt so bad you go home crying to mommy. Jackass. Like it is my job to play badly like him so that he will have "Fun" playing. Jesus!
