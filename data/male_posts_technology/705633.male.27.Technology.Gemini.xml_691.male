Oh what a night (late September back in....) I suppose I better stop that now.  We better cross The New Rajah off our list of nights out until they start up a Karaoke night.  Strangely enough my friend was in the Viceroy last night for a Curry and they had a stag party in there who never once raised there voice.    Big thank you to Damien for last night as he treated the crew to dinner.  (If his accountant is watching then our board meeting was very productive and worth the tax write off)    As you know I have not been on a toaster night out in quiet a while and I'm glad to have been there last night, although you guys have softened up and not one of you were in liquid until closing which is a bit poor. I think the two moments of the evening were Toaster and Speedy dancing 06's styley with the girls in Chicago.  Well thats enought from me for now..  Danger out.
