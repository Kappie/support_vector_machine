Please speak out (or type out), and do it today!  I sent the following to quite a few Senators.  Focus on Sens. BLanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Gordon Smith of Oregon, and Norm Coleman of Minnesota.  Also send to your state's Senators.  Feel free to use it, or something similar, if you oppose drilling in ANWR.  ~~~ Please do not vote to open ANWR to oil drilling.  I lived in Alaska for 21 years, and while I know there are Alaskans that feel it should be opened, I know there are many that do not believe it should be opened.  Now I am a resident of Illinois, and my feelings haven't changed.  I believe the risks of being wrong about the potential dangers of drilling outweigh the benefits of the oil that we may find.  I do not feel that there is actual overwhelming support for opening ANWR.  And even if there was overwhelming support I believe that the desires of the population as they stand today do not warrant always being satisfied.  People just have to change sometimes, and it is up to the elected leaders to help manage that change.  I hope you will vote against this issue, and encourage your colleagues to vote against it as well. ~~~
