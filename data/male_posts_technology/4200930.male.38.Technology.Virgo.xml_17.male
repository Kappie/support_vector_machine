It got me thinking 'do I really want to stay in this country, I'd rather be a foreigner in a strange country than my own!'. It made me feel quite upset.  Then the other day on Channel 4 I saw a programme made by a black journalist about militant Asians in Birmingham; it hurt when they said that they would drive the 'whites' out and make the Middlelands into Pakistan. Would they allow people in their own Islamic countries to be militant Christians, I think not.  I don't wish this to come across as a racist rant, 'cause thats not the intention. I just wanted to vent some feelings - each to their own, I feel a line has been crossed but not sure where or even by who.  Why do I feel so guilty about feeling this way, should we all practice more tolerance or has that got us in this mess in the first place! I feel this could be the subject of a good book!  Peace  love
