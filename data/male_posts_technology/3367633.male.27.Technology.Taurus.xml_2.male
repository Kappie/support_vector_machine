Oh well advil is on its way to help out. That and they give us nice chairs for work here.   got good news for my friend Alec yesterday. DeeDee the hr lady says that they are going to call him in for a interview soon. Yah good news. If he can get a job then his life would be happier and making my friends happy is all good for me.   still waiting for the posting to come up on the Huntington job.
