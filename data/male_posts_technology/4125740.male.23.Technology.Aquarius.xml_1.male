It was good to get up with people whom I hadn't seen in a long time, VIP was hot, and the bottles were poppin'!  Which leads me to todays thoughts.  If you see me with a drink in my hand, PLEASE TAKE MY CELL PHONE AWAY FROM ME!!!  Its become a terrible habit that when somewhat intoxicated I will call any and everybody for no good reason at all.  I just checked my call log and I called about 50 people last night.  I left my man Rick a voicemail and didn't remember doing it.  And I actually made a date with a female and would've never known about it if I didn't get a call asking what time we were getting up.  Now all of these are miniscule in comparison to the last thing that occured.  Don't you just hate the feeling when you get someone you care for pissed off at you and you know its your fault?  Well apparantly that's what I did last night while drunk.  Didn't even realize I did it until I had what I'd call an extremely unpleasant phone conversation this morning.  I swear if I wasn't such the charming, witty, loveable individual that I am, I'd have a lot more enemies due to my sometimes pedomorphic behavior while drinking.  Anyway, time to focus my thoughts on getting back on this persons good side...I'll holla.    ~FIN~
