I guess I am in a blah mood today, but not really the wet gray blanket I have felt so much lately.  Not every day can be happy and bright.  Just slightly above blah is OK for me right now, I can't handle too much contentment at once.  I think that I am starting to believe that I can change my thought processes just a little bit, enough to be more in a healthy controlled state rather than the violent mood swings or hopeless, panicky depression.  It turns out that the medication maybe does 20% of the work, but I have to do the rest.  I think that I need to mourn for a lost childhood, lost opportunities, and a lost father.  I need to direct my anger at its cause (the Old Bitch).  This will allow me to not be angry at the people around me or myself.  I need to remind myself constantly that I don't need to be paranoid about people and that I don't have to trust them with everything to be friendly with them.  I can't control others' actions, I can only control my reactions.  I am not defined by my job or my appearance or my history.  I will be defined by my actions and my thoughts today and every day in the future.  OK, one day at a time.  Small steps, small goals, enjoy small successes.  (This sounds really dopey, but it makes sense to me, really, I swear.)
