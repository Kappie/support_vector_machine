Friday I got off school at 3:30pmand straight to work until 10 PM, went straight home to go to sleep then got up at 6AM for work in Nanaimo and got back at 10pm then straight to sleep I went again then got up again at 6AM to work at the Pacific National Exhibition lottery home until 5:15 then went for a workout at the gym and crammed 5 hours of homework in for a chapter test in maththe next morning.  Things have been quite busy over the summer and I was planning on visiting old freinds and doing outdoor activities more than i have been but work and education get in the way of playtime which kinda sucks but it should pay off in the longrun. I have also changed my dieting program to eat more nutritious foods such as tuna, salmon, and chicken which i prepare in mass amounts to make it convienient to eat every 2-3 hourssince i need a minimum intake of 130 grams of protein a day and still take supplements to improve my gains in the gym.  **Sorry this post had to be so quick but i really just dont have the time at this moment in time to constantly update my blog. Gunna prepare some foodfor the next few daysand go to sleep to cram geometry the next morning so this is good bye for now. GOOD BYE!**
