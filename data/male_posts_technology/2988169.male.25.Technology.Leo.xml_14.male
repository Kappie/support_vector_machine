I am sure more is still to come.  Some of the features have really made me think...how come?  Some of the notable features many are listed below...  - Keyboard shortcuts - Multiple select of check boxes using the shift + Click. Even Windows app can't do it, forget Web app - Cascading mails that have replies and re-replies. - Super fast - Ads according to the mail content. It's still looks safe tho' - Search Mails - Address prompt like in Thunderbird / Outlook - Ofcourse, the widely known 1000 MB space  Yahoo has given 100 MB space by default to all users in an effort towards customer retention. This is indeed interesting battle here. Ultimately, customers benefit from the whole thing.  Actually curious as to what will Hotmail do now. It's still at 1MB I guess. Hmmm...
