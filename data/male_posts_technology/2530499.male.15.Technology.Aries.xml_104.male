Also, today, Frey chewed me out because I accidentaly had Offspring's "Americana" song on the last day CD. He got SO FUCKING MAD, AND HE THINKS I DID IT ON PURPOSE! IT WAS TEN FUCKING THIRTY ON A WEDNESDAY! Staring at the sun...  Anyways, I just realized how much your friends really mean to you. I don't want to just wake up one day, and say, "Oh, how about that. My first love, asbestos friend and sex pickle just up and left."  Also...I'm rather closer to getting that IT job at Allnutt. If that don't work, then I be working at the Papa John's or something...I want some fucking IT, DAMMIT!  -beej
