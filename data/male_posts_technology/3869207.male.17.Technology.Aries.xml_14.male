Then I headed into town to talk to Carlson so he could give me the email address of this weasel I've been trying to track down.  The guy I'm trying to find hired me about a month back to take pictures for a basketball camp in FD.  He promised to pay me $75 bucks a session, and since I went twice, there should have been 150 in green coming my way.  Unfortuantly after I left for my last vacation the *#$@!%% guy vanished off the face of the earth.  Anyway, hopefully I'll finally track him down...  So in other news, I somehow got stuck working today on what was suposed to be my day off.  That was cool, but I could probably use the money anyway becuase I havn't been around much recently. However...I did kinda wanted to go see that new movie King Arthur with the boys tonight.
