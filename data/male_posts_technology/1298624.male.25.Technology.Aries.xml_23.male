I'm confused really as to what each of them do. Apparently, one of them is for massaging and the other for "washing" yourself. I know...I'm still confused. They both spurt out water...so I guess it's just more coverage.   I think if we worked at different places, it would be alright...because by that time, we will be together. Have fun tomorrow at Santa Barbara!!! Love you.
