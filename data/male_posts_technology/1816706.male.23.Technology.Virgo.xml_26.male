Hope you all have a great day, eat lots of turkey, maybe watch a movie or two, spend some time with the family.  This is my first Thanksgiving away from home I'm sad to say, but we're making the best of it here.  Many other people here are in the same boat, and a few of us are going skydiving tomorrow morning, and then maybe grill some fish on the beach afterwards, and yes, the hostel is even making some turkey too.  A regular old holiday feast over here, plus Jack in the Box is open next door in case we get too hungry.  I'll post an update on the skydive when I get a chance.  Car and everything else is back in order.  They are showing movie on the beach all week long this week in case anyone wants to go.  Turkey for me and turkey for you, let's eat the turkey in a big brown shoe.
