This is usually a warning that I will be asked to do or say something from which there is no graceful escape.  She then says that she thinks she knows what my answer will be, but she wants to ask anyway.  Now I really am nervous, because it must be something I've already expressed apprehension about but she wants me to do what she wants regardless.  Finally, she gets to the point: she wants another child.  I suspect she actually wants a specific child, a 1-yr old in foster care with her mom.  This was not entirely a surprise, because she mentioned it about a year ago, and similar discussion occurred then as now:    We already talked about this a few years ago, that was why I got spaid or neutered 4 years ago.  We didn't want any more kids then, what has changed?  Kids are inconvenient, messy, and for a period of several years their sole purpose is to turn your life to shit.  (Going to dinner last night, for example.) They take what would ordinarily be an easy relaxing task, chew it up, and to replace it they hand you a load of shit, which may include whining, screaming, tantrums, trips to Disneyland, puberty, and multiplying credit card bills.   I love my kids dearly because they are mostly done with the stage where you have to do everything for them, and they can perform many tasks with minimal supervision.  There is no way in hell I want to ever change another diaper or get shit on or peed on or puked on ever again.  Two is enough, I can't possibly stand any more.  I especially don't want to go through the process again for someone else's child.  I am so emotionally fucked up right now that I don't need any more stress at all.  I have a hard time dealing with life right now.  If another child was added, I would snap.    I told her that I felt like I was in a no-win situation because if I say what I said, she would be angry and resentful toward me.  If I let her do what she wants, I would be resentful towards her and the child, and our kids would probably have some negativity as well (Nikki in particular - she would be unmanageably angry and hurt).  I said that we make comments about people who decide to bring a new child into a less-than-stable home situation, and I think my emotional state would qualify as unstable right now.  So am I a selfish bastard?  Am I heartless and uncaring about the plight of foster children and my wife's desires?  Or am I making a reasoned, logical, wise decision?  I am second-guessing myself, but I think I did the right thing.  Please insult me if I am wrong; be specific and verbose.
