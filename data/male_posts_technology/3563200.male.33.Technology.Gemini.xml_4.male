But does anyone REALLY(tm) think Microsoft gives a rat's ass about innovating a technology that ultimately makes them no money? Oh yeah, I forgot about the XBox...well at least that has potential.  Not that I care, I don't use IE any more, having long since pushed my entire set of family and friends towards  urlLink FireFox  simply to lessen the issues created by ActiveX-based spyware and viri.  Someone wake me up when IE doesn't enable my wife to trash my laptop by clicking "OK" on the popup that asks her if whe wants to install some stupid POS mouse cursor software that does who knows what and I don't even realize it's there until it hangs up my debugger while I'm doing some unrelated activity 2 weeks later. Geesh. Hello?!?!  Wake up people!
