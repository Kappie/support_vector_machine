That was a lesson for me. I am happy to announce Manny @ this moment that I had successfuly closed the id vsriprasath_chat@yahoo.com to avoid any more future problems. So no troubles, no worries! Manny!  I saw Boys 3 times due to technical features involved in that film. I admire Shankar's ideas, thoughts and his love towards film career. Shankar struggled in the tamil film industry for 11 years, Vickram 14 years, A.R.Rahman 7 years to get a break through!  Don't think I am advocating these people.  These are generic lessons we should learn. The best way to reach people is media, films, TV ads.   Ok no boring again!  You may face tougher time with ur Superiors/Boss. I have Translation Software for you people.  Suppose your Superior/Boss says "I totally agree with you"  means " I totally disagree with you"  "You are Right! But... " means "Even if you agree! I don't care"  "I didn't have time to go through your mail and I can't understand what u said"  means  "I don't  know to access the e-mail software"  "We have an opportunity"  means "You have a problem"  "Convince your client for this deal" means "Hell with your Client"  Ok guys and gals!  Meet u again!  Sri Prasath Venkateswaran
