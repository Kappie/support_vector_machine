So we loaded up a picnic basket and headed to the park where we played and did hide  seek and stuff.  On the way from the park Mommy called on the cell so I let Karissa have the phone and I kept peddling.  Karissa was in the bike trailer and I was peddling.  Of course Karissa's mommy wanted to talk to me so I had to pull over.    She grilled me about I thought you were at the park and all that.  I told her we were I am riding a bike and Karissa was in the trailer. Her response.....Oh  Well Karissa and I came home and ran a couple of errands and since she was good she got a sucker at wal-mart.  I came home and Karissa helped me do yard work.  She even helped me push the mower.  She stood in front of me and pushed the mower while daddy helped ;)  Then she helped me pick up the grass and throw it away.  For that I took her to 2 for 1 pizza roll night.  We got a dozen of them for about 6 bux and they are about as long as bread sticks from Olive garden and full of cheese and pepperoni.   Afterwards we went to the park and she played with Brad's boys Garrett and Ryan.  She had a really good time.  She got really dirty and despite having a bath this morning she needed another when we got home.    I was reading her a book when she asked if Mommy was going to pick her up.  I asked her if that is what she wanted and she said no.  Then Karissa said if she picks me up then I will miss you  That was very hard to hear.  I told her that no matter what she will be with someone she loves because I love her lots and lots and so does Mommy.  I also told her that I knew this was hard on her and I was sorry that mommy and daddy could not be together anymore but no matter what she was a good girl and she did not do anything wrong!    I gave her a big hug and told her to not be sad because it makes daddy sad when she is sad :) Then I got her a stuffed animal and had to leave.  I hate my ex!  This is so wrong our baby should not go through this she should not have to wonder why the pictures of her family are not on daddy's walls (since she asked me yesterday and seemed hurt when she went through the house looking for them), she should not have to worry that she misses one parent more then the other.  It is just wrong!  But how would I know that after all   SFW   said in her deposition how she understood kids from her extensive training in parenting class!  Bleccchh!
