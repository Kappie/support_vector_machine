It's difficult for us to appreciate historical figures for who they really were, instead of for who the texts make them out to be.  For instance, we love the prophets and hate the Pharisees.  What could be more intuitive than that?  Most likely though, if we were alive in the day of Elijah or John the Baptist and weren't experiencing the story through the intrepretation of an author we'd feel a little different.  We'd be quite inclined to join up with the Pharisees, conservative, traditional-values sorts that they were.  And hearing the prophets speak would be quite a shock for our Victorian sensibilities.  Not to mention that they'd be attacking us, most likely.    This is why we build the tombs of the prophets whom our ancestors killed and then say "If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have taken part with them in the shedding of the blood of the prophets".
