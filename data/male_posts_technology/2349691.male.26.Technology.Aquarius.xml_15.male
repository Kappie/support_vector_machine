It took a while to arrange everything. As usual Mootta was in the forefront arranging things.    We had completed the  urlLink Kemmannagundi Trip  just a few days back. Even then, everybody was looking forward to this one as a sort of New Year Celebration. Naushad had come down from Bombay to visit us. The final head count came to 21. Thankfully we were able to muster enough bikes to go with.    Though the place was only about 60 km from Bangalore, we started early. The 11 bike parade was really a thing to see.    When we reached Ramanagara, Warri came fast on the Shogun and reported that Naushad (riding the Shaolin) had fallen behind and we should stop. Warri went back to investigate. The Shaolin had seized and Naushad was pushing it to a nearby workshop.    We were waiting in a shade when Warri and Naushad came back. The rest of the way was covered in 10 bikes, with the Shogun carrying 3 people.    We reached Kanva Dam soon. The place was not worth the effort. There was no place where we could wade into the water. It was a real and proper small dam.     Some of us took our bikes beyond the dam, to get a glimpse of the rural life around. We came back soon.    During the ride back we stopped somewhere between Channapatna and Ramanagara, and slept for sometime under a tree.
