Haiz, like I said, paiseh lah. First blog and all that. Was hoping to build it up quite a fair bit first before letting people know about it.  Anyway, it's quite heartening these pass few days regarding Aikido. Well, first off I'm glad I help introduce Aikido to David, my housemate. He's really happy doing it now. Last 2 people I introduced kinda lost interest after 5 mins. I just felt that they only wanted some kinda company and that they weren't really interested in learning at all. I don't mean to be rude, but some people in my Singapore dojo gives me that kind of feeling as well. David would always be asking about stuff and pondering over the things he learnt. I must admit, that by going to the dojo instead of the University class, he gets more personalised attention from Sensei Pauline. That also helps him to pick things up a bit faster than most of the beginners I've seen in University. Problem with most people in University is that, they come and go very fast and Sensei rarely has a student that stays with her for long. I feel sad sometimes when I think about it. But University students tend to have academic workloads and it's hard for them to turn up consistently as well, even if they are really interested. I get the feeling that Sensei is well aware of this point and she just hopes that she can make them have a good start so that wherever they go when they leave, they'll be able to go along nicely and comfortably from there in their Aikido practice.  Tuesday's Aikido class was quite alright. A little dis-orienting for me because I've not been 'revising' what I was taught properly. Been thinking a bit about school work and all that, you see. Maybe I'll plan a few mins daily just to 'revise' my ikkyo, sankyo thru rokyo. Either next wk or the week after we should be working on nikyo. A bit excited and apprehensive at the same time. Coz I know I need the practice, but I also know it's gonna hurt quite a bit haha.  Wednesday's Aikido class was alright. Sensei made a single comment that my ukemi was much better than before. I'm glad I'm actually learning something. I really really pray that I can remember to apply them from now, even if I don't do the same exercises wherever I'll be going. I do agree my ukemi seems to have improved a little. Obvious because I don't seem to hurt myself as much as before. But of cause there's a whole other room for improvement and I'm really hoping to pick up some more about this area.  I just borrower a video from Sensei Pauline on O-Sensei. It shows a bit of history and a little of his techniques. Truly remarkable. Problem is that because they were originally from 8mm footages, the quality are not very good. It's also quite funny to see the many senior Sensei's of Aikido when they were young. Some of them really looked quite different. I really couldn't tell which was Tamura Sensei. But I was able to pick out Saito and Kisshomaru Senseis.  Recently I also found a new club in Singapore, Ban Sen Juku, from a Belgium website. The most interesting thing to me is that they offered Iai training, one of my greatest interest. From my really limited understanding and knowledge, I just feel that Iai training can be (or is) a really integral part in Aikido training too. The relation in posture, movement, technique, stance and even balance just feels so close to each other. Prior to my return to UK, I found out that Ah Hee Sensei is actually a certified teacher for Goshindo (long and short sword), and I was thinking of approaching him to learn from him when I return to Singapore. I hope to drop by BSJ S'pore to find out more about their classes and syllabus too. It's great to have so many options available. To think that a few months back, I was just lamenting that anyone interested in swordwork could only pick up Kendo. But that, to me, is another different aspect of swordwork and one that I'm really not too keen to learn. After about a day however, I got an email saying that the club wasn't established in Singapore. It was a mistake on the Belgium site. Nevermind, I can always ask Ah Hee Sensei about this.  Sometimes I really wonder what is my interest in all these martial arts. Am I really interested in learning them. And how long I can keep it up with pressures such as, family life, girlfriend, future job pressure, work schedules etc. But I think I maybe thinking abit too much about it. All these details aren't stopping me from learning yet. But I'm really trying to avoid being put into a spot where I have to prioritise or choose one of them someday. I really want a balance and I hope that the people around me will be able to accomodate and understand that. Like I said, it's way too early now. So I'll just take things as they come.  Been contemplating my last few months here in the UK too, like what I plan to do and all that. If I can finish my project before easter holiday, I hope to go on a 3-4 days trekking trip. Think that should be quite fun but really is highly dependent on the progress of my project.  After that will be my exams. If God wills it, I really want my last paper to end before the last weekend of May. Sensei Pauline has mentioned there's a 1 wk summer camp being organised up at Bangor University in North Wales (Chiba Sensei will be there!). I'm really hoping I can go for it, but again, it depends on when's my final paper.  After exams, I probably need to spare 2 wks on a tour with my girlfriend (Corrine!!). I'm hoping to visit a poly classmate and his wife in Sweden, who is a Navy regular and was posted there for sub-marine training.  After that really depends on when my parents are coming before my convocation. If they come over early, naturally I need to spend time with them and just pay a visit to some places here. If they're gonna save some money by coming only for my convocation, hopefully I can find and join some uchi deshi programme here in UK. Currently I've only managed to find 2 dojos online. Of course I'll be consulting my Sensei on this as she may have a better recommendation or suggestion but whatever the case I will only go if she gives her approval for it.  All the plans I have are really dependent on how much money I have left when the time comes. I estimate that to go for all of these I may need at least 500+ pounds. Of course if I sacrifice some of these ideas the required budget will be less. Since I don't intend to tax my parents by asking them for more money, I think my budget will be a tremendous consideration when the time comes. Sigh, sometimes just wish money can drop from they sky when I need them. I don't need a lot, just enough to fulfil my plans. (But I guess if they did, I'd only make plans for trips to Hombu dojo, Japan and the likes hahaha. Moore's law truly applies as well in my case.)
