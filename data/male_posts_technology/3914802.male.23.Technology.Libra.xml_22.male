I just think that if they are going to use all of these police then they are going to scare more people from coming to DC than actually stopping anything. The presence of the police probably does stop something from happening, but what? I haven't heard about many terrorist criminals being caught. They caught terrorists that were overseas and they caught some that were around in "sleeper cells" a while back but not many recently. Are we supposed to be scared? I don't want to be scared of the terrorists who supposedly have an ever-looming sphere of influence to infiltrate and assault our people. I don't want it to happen. Terrorist attacks are scary! But, then again, it seems like they are winning against the American people if we are acting so freaked out all the time. Who am I to say what is best for the American people? I don't know. I know that I walk down the street by the senate buildings every day and I know that they don't check my bookbag or anything. I wouldn't do anything bad though. I am a nice guy... not a terrorist. Plus, I am sure the cameras are always watching all of the people that walk by there for extra super orange level security. I sure am glad of the freedom of the press though. You see, our country is great. Just because some presidents make mistakes once in a while, * urlLink ahem * and we as the American public are allowed to call them out on it! (that is... without government smackdown) Although with the  urlLink Patriot   urlLink Act , which no-one read, who knows nowadays. I tried reading some of it... whooo big snoozer, but with important impacts on everyday life nevertheless.  I also forgot my cell phone at home today. I didn't even realize it until after I got most of the way to work. I guess that just proves how much I really need it. They are convenient and all. It is just that I don't need one to live. It does have an awesome bowling game on it though, and the rockin' Peanuts theme on it (it is called "Linus and Lucy" I believe) for the ringer.
