I already quite enjoy it, and am looking forward to increased dynamism and core strength in addition to comfort and such, because I sit at the desk for hours at a time.   talk about a lovely gift. The kind of thing that I'll use all the time, every day, and wouldn't have thought to get by myself.   happy.
