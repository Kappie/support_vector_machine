And 40 isn't exactly correct either, more like 39 and 8 or 9 months would be more accurate but that doesn't have as nice a ring to it and lets face it, everything we know in life is now packaged and marketed so well that....Life Began at 40 seems to be a more solid name.    Brief History  I am the youngest of five kids from a middle class family brought up in a middle class neighborhood in a middle class home. Being the youngest of the five, typically I was the one everyone picked on. Now I am not trying to evoke any sympathy, I'm merelyjust expressing how I interpret my youth.    I was always a fat kid growing up. I wasn't particularly active,I didn't do much ofanything, other than cooking...And eating, oh and watching TV. I excelled at pop culture even as a tot. Some of my fondest memories of my childhood are Friday nights on ABC-TV:  The Brady Bunch ,  The Partridge Family  (a particular favorite, I still listen to their records with relish and reverence),  Room 222 ,  The Odd Couple  and lastly  Love American Style . These shows (and many others), as well as films molded me into who I am today. Not sure if I should be proud or seek an attorney to file a civil suit.    I have vivid memory of my parents taking me and my sister toMorris Plains' drive in during the summer of 1973. The feature attraction? Twentieth Century-Fox's box office bonanza  The Poseidon Adventure . I can't remember the date, but the film was released in December of 1972, so I estimate it was probably July of 1973. I was so psyched to see this, the commercials on TV demanded my attention everytime I caught them. For months I had wanted to seethis movie. Now I was born in June of 1964 so I was only 9 when I saw this movie.....During thefilm my mother asked, to know one in particular, or perhaps to me;I can't be sure (referring to the actress portraying Susan Shelby, the teenager who had a serious case of the hots for leading man Gene Hackman, "Isn't she the one who's on that show  The Partridge Family ?"    From the backseat of the Buick I chimed in, "No mother, Susan Dey portrays  Laurie Partridge , this actress is named Pamela Sue Martin." Ok, I may be embellishing slightly, but I swear I have that memory. My father interrupted however with a "Would you shut up! I'm trying to watch this!"    I truly missed my calling, perhaps for some reason I felt I could make a living at memorizingand retaining film credits, actors and production peoples names and their filmographies. To this day I can recall with a fairly alarming rapidity an actor's, or crew person's body of work.I also found a pattern in that Twentieth Century-Fox always (at that time, anyway) produced and/or released afairly high volume of projects that I was drawn to:  Planet of the Apes ,  Poseidon Adventure ,  Towering Inferno ( co-produced by Warner Brothers, which at the time was a record breaking deal; no studios at that time had ever combined to produce a joint production ) ,  Lost in Space , etc etc.    Ok back to my being a fat kid. I was fat. Fat. Fat. Fat. Yes it hurt when kids would make fun of me but I always seemed to have some endless supply of self respect (I realize gentle reader that its somewhat of a contradiction; being really fatwould not seem as though one has self respect), so to use the proverbial playground sentiment: sticks and stones...... I would choose to simply ignore them. Junior high school years were particularly rough, after 6 years of familiarity with the kids at my gradeschool, 7th grade brought about many changes. A whole new set of kids to meet and to be teased by. Good times. High school was not much different.Rather then drag out this first entry with25-30 year old annecdotes, which truthfully future entries in this blogwill probably be peppered withthem so it's best I don't blow my wad now; let it suffice to say growing up wasn't fun.....but who does have a "normal" growing upyears?    Anyway in my sophmore year of high school, early in the year, we had a visit to the school nurse.The accumulated fat in my brainmust have clouded myintuition for I had no idea what was to come next. Apparantly she called my home and because of my obesity (I think I was tipping the scale either at or near 350 pounds) shesuggested to my parents that I be in our family doctor's care. So off to Dr.Huster I went, and began monthly visits. Immediately I was put on a diet that my parents (unsuccesfully) tried to enforce. Up until that time I had free reign to eat whatever(and probably whenever) I chose. Now portions were cut drastically back, Ifelt like a prisoner. I cheated every opportunityI could. You know the saying"desperate times call for desperate measures"? Well possibly a few months into these visits I was put on a drug called Tenuate Dospan, if memory serves. It's an appetitie suppressant drug but it also has side effects. I developed heart palpitations every once in a while. Suddenly I would feel my heart pounding in my chest with such a vengeance; the first time I was convinced I was dying right then and there. These "attacks" would hit anytime.....I could be lying down reading a book and suddenly the beating of a bass drum was happening inside my chest. I quickly learned to take a deep breath, I imagined my lungs filling to capacity pressing up against my heart to stop it from its irregular beat and slowly exhaling. Usually that would do the trick. That routine was pureinstinct but ironically years later I readaboutdoingsomething like that in thatkind of situation.    I would have to say about six months into this "program" I became closer friends with my next door neighbor; she had just lost her father (who used to unintentionally intimidate the hell out of me). We started to hang out more and I found myself doing stuff. Not much, but just being out of my house and not near food seemed to be a key in myweight loss. Suddenly I started dropping weight. Cathyand I and acouple other friends of hers would go intoNYC; walking around the city burned calories (duh) and the weight started flying off me. I went from 350 (my highest recorded weight and a size 54" waist)down to (if memory serves) 180 and a 34" waist. Just in time for the end of myjunior high year. I lost 170 pounds.That's something. I wasn't anorexic I was just suddenly doing shit instead of sitting in front of my beloved television. I gained some weght back initially over the next few years, but I think that was normal...some people thought I looked emaciated at 180. But naturally it was such a drastic swing from one weight to the other.    I had friends now, it was the summer before my senior year; got mydrivers license, got a part time job at a local department store but I wasn't happy. I knew something was still not quite right....I think I knewwhat that something was, I just certainly wasn't prepared to deal with it and truthfully even if Iwas ready to deal with it I wouldn't haveknown how  to deal with it. I am talking about my sexuality. Yes I amqueer. Gay. HOMOSEXUAL!!!! My first experiences with being gay was thinking Robin the Boy Wonder was cute. And getting certain feelings whenever he and Batman werecaught in some bizarre trap set by one of the Super Arch Criminals (played with gusto by a  fabulous  guest cast). But again, this first entry is merely to set the stage for the present, I don't wish to relive my past, though again, you can expect future entries to have quite a few anecdotes of the past.    Over the next several years I went to college, was employed here and there and in general takinglife one day at a time (I hope I am not using too many cliches for your taste).    In 1988 my parents retired and put their house on the market. It was obvious I was not going to be considered a fixture of the house so I had to move. My parent's plan was to move toUpstate New York, outside of Syracuse. I know that sounds strange, who retires to a colder climate? But my dad who worked his ass off for years to raise 5 kids loved to fish and had recently discovered the joys and thrills of salmon fishing, combined that with the simple fact that the area they intended to live to was a cheaper place to live.....well off they went. I had to move out and be on my own.    By this point I ws frequenting a gay bar on the weekends known as  The Yacht Club. It was a fairly relaxed atmosphere even though the place was something of a dive. The bathrooms leaked, the roof leaked, the very largeroom on the side of the mainbar areawas never opened even though some nights the place was packed beyond my wildest dreams. There I made a friend name Duane, but he went by Jessie (ya gotta love gay men). We met because I started dating a friend of his, jeez - I can't even remember this guy's name....let's call him Michael. I seemed to be always dating someone namedMichael, which was cool since I always liked that name. Anyway Michael dumped me for someone else and Jessie (Duane) felt bad for me so we became friends. He was living at home and when I told him one night I was looking to find my own place he suggested we move in together. So we did. Can two homosexuals share an apartment without driving each other crazy? Well apparantly they can, but it does take a lot of work.....you have to turn a blind eye on things that you find really irritating.    Sometime in 1989 I had a reason to go to the doctor....I mention this because my recorded weight was around 239. So I had gained probably 30-40 pounds in about 7 years. Certainly not a horrible thing. not good either....    In 1991 Jessie and I parted ways as he had met the man of his dreams and was moving in with him, I couldn't afford the rent on our two bedroom apartment onmy own so I had to find alternate housing. Despite the fact that 1991 was a cool year at the box office for me personally (Thelma  Louise, Terminator 2, Soapdish etc) I entered my low years. I moved into a one room apt (it was all I could afford) and became pretty apathetic. I stayed for about 2 and a half years, it took that long till I could afford to move into a tradtional 4 room apartment.    So from 1989 until this year I managed to pack on surprising amount ofweight. Around February of 2004 Irecognized that I had to do something. I mean, what gay man wants to date a fatty fat? I had to do something tochange myself around. Food was so important to me....not as a fuel but more as entertainment. I love to have people for dinner (by that I mean I cook for them and they dine with me, I am not a cannibal), I religously watched the Food Network and wouldemulate what I saw on various programs over the years. But something had to change. I didn't own a scale though my waist size balloned up to 54" again so I knew approximately what I weighed in at, from previous experience. So it was February when I decided I had to take action, but - crap - Easter was coming up, baked ham, asparagus, chocolate bunnies and robins malted milk eggs.....I couldn't pass that up. I mean I am only human.....aren't I? Consulting a calendar I surmised that April 19th, 2004would be the ideal time for me to start some kind of life changing plan. That was a Monday, one full week after Easter.....any leftovers would surely be gone by then. In the meantime every meal was like a condemned man's last meal. Eat up today, for tomorrow you won't be......    A very good friend of mine from work told me about the South Beach Diet and from what he was telling me about it I thought, maybe this is the plan I should try. I bought the book and started reading it the week of Easter....as I was reading it Dr Agatston, the author of the book as well as a well known cardioligist in......Miami, of course; explained the mechanisims of eating and how insulin affects the blood sugar. How the blood sugar spikes after you eat, insulin is released and brings the blood sugar level down and it started to make sense. I thoughtI should invest the minimum time in this plan, two weeks and just see what happens. The first two weeks is designated as Phase 1 and you completely cut out all processed carbs. No sugar, no flour, no rice, potatoes or pasta, no bread, not even fruit. So what's left? Lot's of vegetables andample amounts of lean protein.    Right before I started I bought a scale on Ebay. Sad to say I couldn't go into a Bed Bath and Beyond and buy any regular scale because most scales only go to 300 - 330 pounds tops. I suspected I was closer to 350 like I had been about24-25 years ago. So I bought a super scale, it goes up to 400 pounds. When it arrived I mustered up the courage and stepped on. My heart sank. I seriously thought there was no way this was right. How could it be? How the fuck could I have let myself get to be 390 pounds (as if the extra 40 pounds really made all that much difference). Oh I should probably point out that sometime around 1998I started to smoking pot after an absence of many years.....those munchies are really a killer.    Well after getting over the hysterics of being 390 pounds I resolved all the more to be bound and determined to follow the South Beach Plan to the letter and just see what would happen after two weeks.    So on April 18th I ate my last full fat, high carbmeal, but to tell you thetruth for weeks I wasactually feeling rather sick....sluggish, in a horrible rut eating horrible horrible foods.    On April 19th I started my routine of eating breakfast:    1 glass of V8  1 hard boiled egg  coffee with artifical sweetener and skim milk    Now I never used to eat breakfast before so it wasdifficult to get used to eating in the morning.    Lunchconsists of asalad with either grilled chicken or tuna salad atop dressed greens.    Dinner is composed of lean protein and lots of vegetables. In the firstweeks I basically ate salads. Lots and lots of salads.    By the end of the firsttwo weeks I had dropped 20 pounds and was already actually feelingbetter. I had a lot more energy and felt, well......vivacious! As Dr Agatston promises, if you stay on the plan during Phase 1 your body actually stops craving thebad carbs, i.e. sugar, bread pasta, etc. Damned if he wasn't right. 20 pounds is fairly substantial and I was thrilled. I wasn't hungry all the time, I was feeling better, and itwas just easy to lose that weight. Of course, it was only 20 pounds against the, conservative estimate of 140 pounds I was shooting for, but still....    Which brings us to the present. Today is July 17th and as of this morning Iam down a total of (approximately, I mean, who can read thescaleaccurately?) 65 pounds.Not too shabby....    I did an amazing thing last week too....I signed up with a personal trainer. Sometime aroundmy epiphany in February/March I thought"How cool would itbe ifI could become muscular?" So that is my goal.....I want to be a hottie. I want to looklike the kind of guy I amattracted toso thatI could possibly attract one for myself. I know,I know, this may allsoundrather shallow....but truthfully my health is not my priority, but its nice to know that's its benefiting from this sudden surge of wanting to be hot.    Today ended the second week with the trainer and while I don't feel any different, he has commented that my stamina is improved. That makes me feel good. Jose, my trainer issuch an inspiration to me. He doesn't make me feel like I can't do something, he doesn't overlypush me either, I think in the first couple days he was afraid I might keel over and have a heart attack, even though he would be absolved of any liability since I did sign a waiver. He told me today however that next week we will begin to target specific body parts.    Wherever I go from here I invite you to take thejourney with me. Through my fears,depression, anxiety,frustration andultimately success.I do aploigize for the overlength for this first post, but I truly felt the history was important.    Not allfuture posts will deal with my (tocoin Madonna's latest tour) Re-Invention, but rather celebrate life as we only have one life to celebrate - that is, unless I meet a really niceIndianmanwho converts me to Hinduism :-)
