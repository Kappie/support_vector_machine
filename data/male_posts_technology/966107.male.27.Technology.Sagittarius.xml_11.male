This follows closely on the heels of its starting a new outsourcing branch targeting the US market.  Not surprisinly enough, the average annual salaries of an average Chinese programmer is anywhere between $5248 to $9000, way below what an average Indian programmer earns in an year (average $10000), the report says.  Although China has come up into global market as a force to reckon with, its main business area still remains manufacturing, where there is minimum interaction with the West  the language is not a problem. But for a white collared job where frequent interactions are required with the client, I think China will have serious problems. After all, no one would want their software  the supporting documentation to be developed in Chinese.  Secondly, a single company cannot be called as an industry  a threat to the established Indian Software industry. It will take a long time for China to catch up with India in the Software export race.
