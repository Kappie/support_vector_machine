These are the few things I remember of these two years (chronological) :  Anand and Srinath have a boring 1 month of training  A and S celebrate their first month salary at Gongura (with a full meals ;-))!!  When life was getting boring, with just two of us, the modellers joined us and we never felt the need for more people again.  Honestly, not much of challenging work in the two years. But was succesful in making my managers happy with my work and Anand did become a dependable team member.  Thinking back, office would have been boring without the tons of hours spent theorizing, agonizing, celebrating, philosophising about stock markets !! And of course, making some money too !!  Anand wants to try something different. He had dreamt from kiddo days of attending corporate meetings in a suit and strategising. Decides to go to B-School. Just hoping for some romance in life.   Taking CAT was painful. The postponement of CAT was a blessing. His theories on fate/destiny get some more confirmation. B-School would have not been possible with the cancelled CAT. The final CAT on Feb 25 2004, was the best CAT paper he wrote and rest is history. Somehow, he never had the full heart to do well in CAT, although he wanted to get into a B-School.  And the future ?  Kolkata beckons !! I have no idea what will Anand be in 2006.                            Somehow I have really enjoyed the brutal (Im looking for an equivalent word for surprisingly surprising) turns in life when I had not expected them.  So, what he wants to do now is make tons of money or atleast be in the middle of money !! Not only for himself, but for others who still have no idea how to make money. He wants to make India a land of money makers.  Ahh, come on shut up Anand, remember people who create history, have no hope of a personal destiny !!  ( How was that for an ending ? Of course, I stole that line from somewhere !! )
