Saturday I went to the grocery and then talked to both of my parents.  Saturday night I jsut hung out and watched tv with Tom.  Sunday I played my game.  It went a little better.  We lost 9-7.  I went 2-3 with a rbi double and a single.  It was close, but our defense killed us, again.  I caught the whole game and threw a guy out stealing.  Tom came and had the sentiments.  we play at the nice field next Saturday.  It has a grass infield (I can't believe that there are so many baseball fields with out grass infields...I would kill to play another game on a PRP like field).
