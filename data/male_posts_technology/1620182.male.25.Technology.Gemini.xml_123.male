It is truly becoming my temple, even if the act itself is less pius and more aggressive than most people of the spiritual persuasion would approve.  Yesterday was another me and my Nunu experience, laden with high speed cornering and plenty of climbs.  
 
 Cathedral Pines is the "beginner's" trail on the island, which is the reason why I practice there.  I'm less likely to kill myself at "CP" than I would just up the road on the significantly more challenging Rocky Point trail.  You can gauge the level of difficulty by the names of the black diamond portions of the trail.  Deer Path versus The Dragon.  Boundary Line versus Rattlesnake.
 
 It turns out that Deer Path is aptly named as I happened to scare up a doe as I ripped through one section.  This is nothing compared to when Dan and I had to slam on our breaks at Rocky Point to avoid running over a man who was leading a baby fawn away from the road.  The fawn stopped at each of our bikes in turn to sniff our legs as it followed the man like a puppy.  I hope it made it.
