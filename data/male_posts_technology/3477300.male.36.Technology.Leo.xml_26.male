My  scumbot-channel  has staggered from the primordial goop to prove that malware across the planet can reliably (if slowly) "phone home".    I managed to find the   diveboy@hotmail.com   signature.  Alas, I had to modify the search a little!  I had to prefix with a  %20%3f , which was text I prefixed the email address with, for no reason other than giving it a certain random error look! I guess it's something to do with the way google tokenizes the keywords in their database.    Anyway, with a google search I found two guest books that were hosting my 'scumbot semaphore':          Chinmoy's Portal     and         Air of Authority - A History of the RAF Organization       Sure enough, I hit the link from google and I could search the retrieved guestbook page for my message. Ah, the joys of genious ... now all I need to do is take over the world.    So I think it took about a week for the guest-book entries to get into Googles database. Which isn't too bad. If you were planning to launch a DDoS you could reasonably expect to plan your attack a week ahead of any major world event.     Next Step   Obviously, the next step would be to automate a the whole thing:       Search Web Using Google to find "Sign Guest Book"     Randomly retrieve the HTML for 10-20 of the hits          Parse the HTML of the page into some kind of DOM      Traverse the page's DOM to find the                     Create a HTTP response with the  textarea  full of scum-bot semaphore          To be honest posting the semaphore doesn't really need to be automated, as it's done as a one-off by the scumbot master. Could be done manually. On the other hand, the zombie/virus/worm/malware needs to be automated to do the following:          Search Google for  %20%3fdiveboy@hotmail.com  once per day         Retrieve all/any matching pages         Parse the HTML into some kind of DOM         Traverse the elements looking for the semaphore pre-amble ( %20%3f )             Extract the scumbot-semaphore             Decrypt/unpack the message              Anyway, someone else can do the donkey work. As we system architects say,  the rest is just software...               Oh, I suppose I should call it something other than a scumbot channel, as  Scummy  has already developed his own little bot that he calls a  urlLink scumbot . But in his case, it's not half as nafarious as mine, it's just a useful little IRC bot.            c@malware
