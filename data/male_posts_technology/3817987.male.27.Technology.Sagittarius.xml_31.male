The music is a bit hard to describe; a bit baroque and a bit poppy.  Probably the only rock ben ever than can aptly be called Dickesian. Their first album  Castaways and Cut-outs  is one of the best debute albums ever.  And last year's  Her Majesty, the Decemeberists  is pretty cool too.  Their song "Angel, Won't You Call Me?" is now one of my all-time favorites,  Colin Meloy   is   the new Andy Partridge.
