My upcoming divorce boils down to money.  How much are our marital assets worth?  The house, stocks, my retirement savings, her retirement savings, furniture, our "savings" account, and what money we owe on the heloc and the car.  Hopefully, at most, we split everything 50-50 and walk away from our relationship.  Then we just have to deal with the complications of custody and the kids, and I have to figure how I can pay for everything with just my salary, while she in turn pays for everything of hers with just her salary.  Housing in our area has skyrocketed, so I decided (with the advice of others, of course), that it would be best if I stayed in the house.  That will also mean less of an impact on the kids, which I think is important.  I mean, Ivy freaked out when I was simply moving furniture around in my bedroom.  Although I gotta say that the new layout is great,with the bed under the window, so I get fresh evening breezes -- only the ceiling fan is not lined up right -- I hardly feel it now -- maybe it's time for a free-standing fan.  So anyway, I have to figure out how I can keep paying my monster mortgage plus, the bills, and the new car.  And since she'll only be taking a portion of her share of the marital assets, I'll have to figure out a payment plan to ensure she gets the rest of it.  I'll use the HELOC to get more immediate access to funds needed so that she can move out.  But in the end, it's all just money.  I have to keep telling myself that.  I have to change my 401(k) contributions so that I'll get more money in my paycheck so that I can pay all the bills I have to pay.  The next question is, how should I pay for the matrix?  Should I tap the heloc (2.99% interest rate for the first 90 days!), should I sell stocks for a loss, or should I finance it through other means?
