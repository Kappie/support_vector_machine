He gave me the requirements for the grad degree, and suggested I just start taking classes. There's nothing in the system keeping me from taking grad classes, and if there ever is, he'll override it. Whichever list I finish first (undergrad or grad) is the degree I'll get. I then spoke to Fin Aid, and they said as long as I take 6 hours a semester, I can continue to receive my finaid (since it's just a loan). If I were to enroll as a grad student, however, I'll be eligible for another $3000 a year in subsidized load money. I basically have until the end of the month to decide what enrollment status I want for 2004-2005. If I decide to stay an undergrad, Michelle has to send a copy of my degree plan to fin aid. If I decide to enroll as a grad student, I just need to apply to the grad program before June.
