    
       Good evening. That was my brother lost in the rubble. That was my sister lost in the crush. That was our mothers, those were our children. That was our fathers, that was each of us.  Today was a normal day, for me. Not for others. Poor Jo wasn't a happy bunny this morning, so she went home, and I can't blame her really, the poor thing, being cold and tired isn't nice. I am sure she is nice and warm tucked up in bed fast asleep. Lisa hasn't had the best day as some of you know, but I won't go into detail on here. But, not to worry, because tomorrow is Friday, and also as Mrs Crouch reminded me, we are ever getting closer to February!  I really don't know what to say, so if I haven't got anything to say, I might as well just go.
