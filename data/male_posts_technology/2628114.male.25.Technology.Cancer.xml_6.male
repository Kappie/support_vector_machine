On a whim, I decided to go to the UC rec center to try these magical elliptical machines.  Justin was already going so I met him there.    My knee had been acting up all day and it was to the point of feeling like it had an air bubble in there or something (very annoying).  I was aggravated from last night and this air bubble feeling annoyed me even more.  Either way, I was still anxious to see how these ellipticals would work out.  When I got there, I found out when the rest of UC students workout since virtually every machine was taken.  I began my stretches and saw some people I knew.  I was so anxious to make up for missing last night that, though I did stretch, I didn't completely stretch.  I headed downstairs to the machines.  I sucked up my pride and took the last available elliptical since every other machine was taken by girls (this isn't a bad thing girls, but it looks a little odd when you are one guy among 10 girls working out).    I began the workout and had already decided that in order to work out both sides of my legs, I would go forward and backward.  I went forward for 5 minutes then backward for 2.  It took me a solid 3 minutes to figure out the stupid controls on the machine but I still used my watch for timing.  The magic came for me when I was able to break a sweat, work out my legs, and not further injure my knee.    I can actually say that after my 30+ minute workout, where I traveled approximately 3 miles (according to that stupid computer control), my knee felt great.  No pain.  I am certain I will be sore after how hard I worked my legs, but I would rather be sore than injured.  I will monitor it very closely tomorrow, but I can initially say that my knee pain has subsided.  I am confident those machines will help to strengthen my legs so I can return to running.
