Your worst nightmares have been realized...the house has added yet another member and i'm a real bitch to live with. I snore, I sleep late, I cuss like a sailor and pee with the door open.  I flirt with all the boys and, lately, pretty much all of the girls, too. so watch out.  either that, or this will be my first and last post...cuz i'm also a little flakey (okay, maybe a  lot , but who asked you?) but can i just say: i freaking love blogger for making this so easy! i just get to log in once and choose a blog. you're going to be sorry...cuz my motto is: if it's easy i do it (also if he/she is easy i do him/her...) whatever. bring me some vanilla cappucino. and if my husband calls--  i'm not here!!       Edit    If Lisa's husband calls,  I'm not here either  - boz
