It is one of my favourite games of all time.  I just completed it again, but this time on Medium.  The game is damn hard.  I've started it again on Insane... and it lives up to its title.   Ballerburg  continues to amuse once you figure on the quick way to win...  (1) Build up economy (2) Disable enemy economy and firepower (3) Bombard  Pretty obvious really.  Got round to watching  Macross - Clash of the Bionoids  this afternoon.  The translation was a little stilted, and the quality was not fantastic.  The story was a little confusing - it seems there was a lot of unexplained backstory.  Also, owing to the content, I'm surprised it made a PG.  Macross II is better by comparison, and Macross Plus trumps them all.  They're all Manga by the way, and are invariably love stories set against a backdrop of war between aliens and humans using giant transforming mechs.  Today's events didn't disappoint... my long suffering GURPS campaign didn't run  again , as the players were no-show  again .  Some days I don't know why I bother.  My cat is off to the vet early tomorrow morning... I pray he makes it through his operation.
