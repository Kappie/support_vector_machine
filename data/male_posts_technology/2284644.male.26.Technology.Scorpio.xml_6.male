I talk really, fast, and start revealing information that I shouldn't reveal. They asked questions like, "How many hours do you work a week?"."Do you ever work from home?"  Call me paranoid, but that shit makes me nervous. I think getting laid off does that to you.  I am forever scarred psychologically, yet I am only 26 years old.   In other news, maybe I will start looking for a new job.........
