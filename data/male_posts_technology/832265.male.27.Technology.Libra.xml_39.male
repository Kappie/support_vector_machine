More importantly they're also serving up a bunch of videos including the 10 minute one for  urlLink Perfect Kiss .  Basically, they all stand around and look really bored while rocking out for Jonathan Demme.  And Gillian tries really hard to look pretty.  
Oh but there's more.  On January 21, 24 Hour Party People is getting  urlLink released  on DVD with 2 commentary tracks and some other business.  It's an exciting time if you're into that sort of thing.
