I always used to joke about being crap, but it has gone from being a joke to plain honest to God plain fact. Hell, i play in a clan dedicated to 'unl337n3ss', but at least 90% of said clan members are average to above average in their game of choice, whether that be Counterstrike or Tribes2 or whatever... I'll tell you why I am the worst kind of crap gamer. I am one who does not learn. One who does not get  better  with experience. I merely stay the same. It's pretty liberating to realise it. for example, on USEAST last night, Out of , I dunno, around 9 games, I lost 8. (1v1's). Against other guys with rating 2 or 3 (which is maybe just higher than 'pond-scum') I also pretty much cost me and my ally AL]Varlet the 5 or so 2V2's we played, either by showing up too late to assist, or doing dumb strategies, etc. I think we won one, but the sheer number of losses has resulted in me remembering almost nowt of that game. I vaguely remember building quite a few Crypt Fiends though.  I am so bad it's rare. Virtually  every  gamer gets better at a game the more they play. It's basic human nature to adapt to something. Not me. It's like I operate at 46.9%  all the time , no matter what. Like I said in yesterdays blog, I used to be pretty good at Quake2 - but I never got  better , I was always merely 'good', no matter how much I played and practiced. I guess I could blame many things - the fact that I wear glasses could be a contributing factor (they tend to induce a kind of tunnel vision impairing your peripheral sight which is vital in WC3...), the fact that I had to switch from playing pilot-style mouse to 'proper-style' mouse when I bought Ultima 9 (you couldn't invert the mouse in U9, and I had to adapt to playing 'real' style - ever since my performance in FPS games has suffered dramatically) could also be blamed. But in the end, I can only blame myself and my inflexibility. It sucks though, because I  want  to be good at a game again - I miss the days of Quake2 where people around town (other gamers) would occasionally utter things like 'kHayne is a whore with the SuperShotgun'. I don't get that no more. I try not to let it bother me too much, but it nonetheless does.  I quote the inestimable Linkin Park in closing : "I tried so hard, and got so far. In the end, it doesn't even matter"
