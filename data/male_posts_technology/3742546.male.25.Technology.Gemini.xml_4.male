The most promising things I have going for me right now seem to be the 2 temp agencies that I'm registered with.  I got a call yesterday from one of them; something about a job with the government.  I don't think I'm bound to be too picky about it though.  I've called back twice and left a voicemail.  It's 4:58PM and still no response.  I'll try back tomorrow if I hear nothing more.  The good news is that Joan is coming to visit today.  One of her friends is getting ordained.  She'll be here soon I think.  I should get my scanner working again sometime soon.  I'll have to take a look at it.  It's probably just a driver issue.  I bet I'll need to reinstall it.  See ya 'round.   urlLink    Stone   urlLink    Stump
