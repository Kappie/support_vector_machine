A soldier took his sword in hand,  Then pointed it at me:  He said "You there, prepare to die.  That cross is meant for thee."  I quickly fell upon my knees,  For mercy did I cry;  As strong hands grabbed my hands and feet,  I shouted "Why, oh why?"  And then a voice both soft and sweet  Was heard above the din;  "Let this one go, take me instead.  I'll pay his price for sin."   With his body torn and bleeding  And thornmarks round his head;  With bruises where they beat him,  He stepped into my stead.  Then Jesus laid upon the cross,  His life did freely give,  That all my sins be washed away  And through his death, I'd live.  He stretched his arms out open wide,  No struggle did he make.  As they prepared to nail him there  His life they meant to take.  They drove the spikes in hands and feet,  And slammed the cross in place.  His bones were shaken out of joint,  And blood ran down his face.  "Forgive them, Father," was his cry,  They know not what they do  God must have wept when he realized  He sacrificed his only Son for you.   When I awoke, the night had passed  And Sunshine flooded in;  I cried "Dear Lord, forgive me please,  And cleanse me of my sin.  For you sent down your only son,  A ransom for the lost:  And I see you included me,  When counting out the cost.  Yes I dreamt I stood at Calvary  And saw those crosses three;  Yet no longer do I need to fear  Knowing Jesus died for me.
