       Actually I think I slept through dawn, by about 5 hours. I woke slowly today, thinking of this web log and what I would post for my first 'real' blogging day.  

 I've decided to embed XML into each post, but hide it in comments instead of making it accessable to the browser. The reason for this is that I plan to write a file sweeper that will go through all of the archived posts on the server and compile one large XML file for reporting. That way I can write down my symptoms when they happen but have an easily readable report at any time, of any time. We'll see how it works.  

 This morning I woke with the usual gurgling in my mid abdomen. I would say its in my small intestine but that is a guess. I immediately started writing this after rising from bed and had a handfull of peanut  urlLink MM's . Yes, I know that isn't the healthiest thing to eat when you have digestive problems, but I have powerful cravings for sugar and chocolate. Sugar cravings are another sign of parasitic infection, but my tests of last week were negative for parasites...not that the tests are 100% acurate but they were my second set in one year.  

 I think that I'll really have to be 'on the ball' when writing this log. I need to pay attention not just to my accute symptoms, but the obtuse ones as well. With that in mind, I'll add here that I did some of my usual excersize last Monday which should not have been very strenuous for me but my body is still aching from it 4 days later. My muscles are sore like I had done serious weight training. My body deffinately doesn't heal at all as quickly as before.  

 The few MM's are making me belch a little, and the gurgling continues in my gut. I'm sure that intestinal gas will escape as soon as I start moving around. This is a typical morning for me lately, so I don't think I can blame the candies.  

 I'm off to shower.  (*wild cheering from the crowd - who have been holding their noses*)
