I am not sure how this works but I heard about this from someone and it seemed like something new to do.  So lets give it a whirl here.  Let's call this Story 1.0  It was fall of 2002, the leaves were falling and it was getting colder.  People were getting ready to go off to college and so was Ethan.  He is a shy guy.  He's not the person who would normally go walk up to a girl and start talking to them.  He had a hard time striking up a conversation with just about anyone.  Probably because he had a huge hairy mole in the middle of his forehead.  This mole was huge.  It was about the side of a baseball covered with short pube-like hair that was wavy (not curly but wavy).  The mole itself wasn't hard at all.  It was somewhat moldable.  Imagine those eyeballs that you can get at the vending machine for a quarter.  It was all soft and gooey kinda?  Yeah the mole was like that.  It was a baseball size mole covered with pubes that was soft.  The mole has always been there since he was born.  They've tried and tried to take if off with laser surgery, with a scalpel, with anything but it just keeps growing back!  They have found it wasn't anything that would be cancerous, it's just a bizarre skin condition that keeps growing back.   So how's that for starters.  I guess we'll see if people will continue the story and make something out of it.
