Of course, this initiative is sponsored with our tax dollars.  The safe injection sites we have now are a waste of money as it is, but at least it can be argued that clean needles are pretty useful to heroine addicts.  I am not the most sympathetic person when it comes to helping people that choose to destroy themselves, and this crack house idea is really making me angry.  The current safe injection site is costing us one million dollars per year.  That money would be much better spent in the school system to help children become useful members of society instead of useless junkies and criminals.  "It would seem logical." to assist crackheads getting high according to the Health Authority.  Logical?  What is logical about helping crackheads smoke crack?  If we want to help them smoke crack, we should teach them how to break into houses and cars more effectively so they can rob hard-working useful people of their possessions to feed their crack habit.  I have a really good solution for all of the crackheads and needle junkies.  But I think I will keep it to myself for now.  If we do buy the crackheads a place to smoke, I may suggest it.
