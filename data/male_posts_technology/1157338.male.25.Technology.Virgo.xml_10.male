I dropped my daytime class (which I really really hated) and I'm keeping my nighttime course, which I only kinda hate.  Over the summer I will be doing nothing but working at my job and on that game, and then during the Fall semester I'll take another nighttime course. we'll see what happens from there.  Some might say "there are only 3 weeks left in teh semster, why would you drop the course?" to which I say "cause it sucks".  I wasn't doing so well as it was, but it was just getting to be ridiculous.  How about some homework, some tests, and some massive programming projects still left in the semester for BOTH my classes.  OS2's projects are immense, and frankly, I got better ways to use my time now. :D  So for those who care to know more, I'll be working at a place here in stillwater called "SST Software". they do GIS systems for agriculture.  I'll be learning to write .NET applications, which I have mixed emotions about, but I"ll be doing it for a good salary, of which the only emotion I have is elation :).  Anyways, I hope everyone else who is unemployed gets to go back into the workforce. My only problem now is whether or not I'm still qualified to watch the cartoons at oddtodd.com  Out.
