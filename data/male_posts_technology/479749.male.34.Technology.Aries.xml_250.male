My  attempts so far to get her to move off of this position have been about as  successful as my recruitment of softball players for corporate  challenge.              She hates  politics so getting her to read or watch anything on the convention is  pointless.               So I'm,  livingThe Boondockscartoon from Sunday except she's leaning Bush.  http://www.ucomics.com/boondocks/2004/07/25/               Sigh..  this isn't making me feel better           David Leslie Software Quality Analysis Cooperative  Discovery Test Management Section Online Computer Library Center, Inc.  http://cweb.oclc.org/~leslied  (intranet only)  "It is  the greatest truth of our age: information is not knowledge..." -Caleb  Carr          -----Original Message-----  From:  Zimmer,Tom   Sent:     Thursday, July 29, 2004 4:40 PM  To:  Babich,Helene; Dishong,Jane;    Kim,Sharon; Leslie,David; McDaniel,Vanessa; Prasse,Mike; Satia,Germaine;    Seelbach,Thom  Subject:  Priceless              by      kos       Thu Jul 29th, 2004 at    16:07:56 GMT   The new Bush     jobs plan    :       A campaign worker for President Bush said    on Thursday American workers unhappy with low-quality jobs should find new    ones -- or pop a Prozac to make themselves feel better.       "Why don't they get new jobs if they're unhappy -- or go on    Prozac?" said Susan Sheybani, an assistant to Bush campaign spokesman Terry    Holt.    Now we need universal health care so the    unemployed can afford that prozac.
