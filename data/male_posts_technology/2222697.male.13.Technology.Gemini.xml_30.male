I have found some cool sites that you may want to check out.  http://www.romanm.ch/english/ascii-movies.htm That is a site where they have taken scenes from movies and made them into text frames. Its hard to explain just look at it. http://gothicsamurai3.proboards26.com That is my message board if you dont already know. I have been updating pages to my site so i havent had much time to play with blog. http://www.angelfire.com/droid/samuraipanda5/bio.html that is my autobiography i am making chapters and is one of the many projects on my list. I hope you check it out.  I just moved my comp into my room and it is very cozy in here. I have placed a plushie of luigi, an action figure of Payne and a hippo on top of my monitor. I am content with my life. I have just listened to my friend's cousin's band. They are really good. Not really my type but i dont know why these people arent famous. if you like screaming death music etc. Their name is Anybody's Fault. I dont know if they have a website or not. I also have downloaded Kazaa Lite wich is a hacked version of KMD but they ripped all of the spyware and ads out and i can download stuff while im gone and not have 400 popups wich has happened before. I hope your happy with the post because i have had a lot of work to do my blog is always a lower priority. There are more things to come if you are interested with my crazy finds on the net and my sites (look forward to the change)
