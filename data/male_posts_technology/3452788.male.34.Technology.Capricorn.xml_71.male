One night I was reading a book called One Tiny Turtle.  Then my dad came home, then I went outside to write.  Then my mom, dad, and brother were talking too much and I could not think, so I could not write because I could not think.   One night I was having fun with music until my dad took over the music.  Then I started to cry.  So from this day on I will not put on music when my dad is with me.
