My point here is not that, the leak of CAT question papers springs a surprise.. In fact, it does not..!! For, such things have been the order for a lot of prestigiuous degrees... But what is surprising is what I read in  urlLink The Hindu  this morning...    Besides the CBI investigation, the Union Human Resource Development Minister, Murli Manohar Joshi, has decided to constitute a separate inquiry into paper leakage. It was only last week that the Ministry had indicated a likelihood of asking IIMs to restructure the CAT process by doing away with group discussions and interviews to make it more transparent.    I wonder why people are trying to infuse politics into education at the levels of IIMs and IITs which have  earned worldwide acclaim for the quality of students it produces. Was he thinking that he could enable people to "sell" themselves to the IIMs by scrapping the GD/interview in the name of "transparency"...?? Its better for the students and the country as long as politicians don't interfere with the affairs and procedures of such premier institutes of the country and leave it to the persons who really "know" what they are doing...
