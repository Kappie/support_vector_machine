I'm cooking a lump of corned silverside (corned beef/brisket) slowly, in the crockpot.. crock pots are great like that, bung it in in the morning, whenever you feel like eating that night, its ready, hot, and tender as. But it did occur to me, a conversation I once had with charlotte about how my corned beef was better than her mums.. in that she at least -liked- mine, now.. she could've just been being nice, but she actually -ate- it, so I'm guessing she was being honest. I cant remember what I added to the meat that time, but I do remember ringing 'mum' and effectively getting her recipe, even then, it didnt quite turn out 'like mum used to make' which made me wonder what it is that give women of that generation a knack to make good solid food - other than being chained to the oven, I mean, my mum worked fulltime most of her life, so she was hardly the 'athomebitch'. As society pushes forward and we strive to squeeze what we can out of the little time we have left after working, things like good traditional home cooked meals are slowly dissapearing, My freezer now has a greater proportion of mass produced patties and fillets and things, rather than good old fashioned butcher meat. These new things cook well straight from frozen, take about 20 minutes, and end up costing about $2 a lump. That's pretty hard to argue with. My train of thought about this, caught me the other day, and sent me to a butcher, a good one, in rotorua, and I got a rolled chicken roast, stuffed with honey and macadamia nuts. mmm gorgeous... well should've been. I tried to roast some potatoes up all crispy to go with it.. and ask someone who knows, I'm a pretty good cook, but everything went wrong.. slicing the cooked chicken it completely fell apart. no real worries still tastes the same.. the thing shrunk like a motherfucker, again, still enough, no worries. The electric frypan I was crisping up the potatoes in kept tripping the power cut out, unbeknown to me, so I'd set them sizzling, tend to something else, turn back.. oil cold. FUCK. reset it, seet them sizling.. etc etc What a pain in the arse. Slightly flowery potatoes, chicken that needed reheating, and soggy vege. Dont -ever- waste time doing things the long 'old fashioned' way, My point for the day is that, if the old fashioned way was worth it, we'd still all be doing it the old fashioned way, new things, might not taste quite so good, but are a decent substitute considering the lack of effort needed, and relative cost. That said, I'm ignoring that, and soldiering on, trying to make corned silverside just like mum used to make.. I'll let you know tomorrow, or later tonight, just how I fucked it up. Wish me luck :D Ciao
