I have written several things in the past for myself or in letters to people that, upon reflection, I thought came out really well.  A personal "greatest hits", if you will.  Since I am new to blogging, I wanted to put out a bunch of stuff quickly that shows different things about myself.  I will not overload on this, I have to keep you guessing for a while, right??  Thanks for reading, I'll be here all week.  BTW, I have 15 minutes on France and Ice that killed at a dinner party last week.
