Although we don't have jack shit for content yet, we will, and when we do it will be the boomba.  Check out and see if you can guess which cat is I.  If your curious about the music (since we don't have any up at this point), we do original hard rock...two guitars, bass, drums.  Our influences are vast and many, seeing as we're all dudes in our mid thirties.  I don't know that you could come up with a sound reference; at times we are mellowish southern rock kinda sound and at other times we are hardcore heavy like tool.  We like to experiment with sounds and alternative structures etc, but through it all we strive to maintain a good song structure that will get the people up on the dance floor shaking their booties.  So check it out, but don't expect a lot yet.  The second is my King's of Chaos army recruiting page.  KoC is an online turn based game that I play just to kill time sometimes.  Check it out, join my army and kill bad guys.  This game requires absolutely no effort, except to go to the site and spend the money you've earned and attack people if you want to.  You don't actually do anything except tell it to attack the player you chose, and it's all text based.  So if you need a way to kill a minute or more, sign up and go.  I'll add more relevant links as they come up.
