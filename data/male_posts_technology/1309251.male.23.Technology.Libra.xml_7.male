On friday,as usual,I was browsing the web for study materials(this is what I do to  kill time).I got a call from my company,that ,a company called IBP 19 KM from Gurgaon,Haryana has a problem where a user cannot open his Outlook Express.As usual ,I had assumed that ,the computer would have software problems or it would have been due to patch updation.  The company called IBP was in Manesar ,another village near Gurgaon.On reaching the company,I found that there were many problems apart from which my group manager had warned me about.I just sat in front of a computer and tried to dial-up the remote server from a remote location(rather ironic isn' t it).I just tried using the hopeless connection for nearly three hours.It was 7.30PM when I decided to call it quits and phoned every guy connected with this site that there was some problem with the connection and was not able to connect to the server,due their own problems. When I got out ,it was very dark with a glimmer of light a few distance away.We usually have a public transport or few TATA sumos gathering people for a flat rate.They are actually people who may have a driver's license or drive this vechile for companies. By the time reached the bustop where I could get a direct bus to my place,it was 8.30PM.I boarded the bus which was supposed to reach my place,this was the time I felt that it is nearly 28KMs from my place and I travel everyday. I reached home at 10.00PM and started cooking for dinner.It was as usual salad and I don't have time for cooking anything . The most lousy part was that my CMS manager asked me to open the CPU and take out the MODEM.Since ,I operate alone he should have given me a toolkit.The toolkit was my right.He even asked me to come to the company to get the toolkit.  saturday. I went to the bank.I met a guy who had a badge on his breast pocket,which read"ask me how to reduce and gain weight".He introduced himself and said that he works for a company which sells herbal solutions for individuals with weight problems.He gave me his number and the people I have to call to be a member of the company. I reached CMS at 12.30 PM.I asked Monica(whom I was asked to contact for a toolkit) for a toolkit.Shesaid "did not the manager tell you something else?" call Rahul(manager)on his mobile.When I called him he started to get aggressive saying that I should have come earlier.I told him that ,he never said anything about  attending calls .He went onto another topic that I should never make Monica wait for me.I just told him that the bank opens at only 10.00AM and hence I was late. The lousy girl ,Monica,gave me two addresses to which I had to attend to.One of them had a faulty Floppy drive and in another I had to take the inventory details. I reached IGL(the place with a faulty floppy drive) and found out that ,they never had a faulty floppy drive and no one complained about it.I just got a little bit cross with Monica over  the phone. Next address was to sify ltd.I reached that place  after a long walk and found that another CMS guy had already done the inventory.My whole butt was aching by the long walks.I even met a guy whom I asked for instructions,after much talking he gave me his card,which said that he is a real estate guy. I reached home and had my dinner of youghurt and rice with ripe mangoes,lithchis and melons.I got a call from the neighbours in my hometown.They insisted that I go and meet them.They can't understand the fact that ,I had travelled the whole day,the day before.I was nearly forced to go and meet them,they are old people who just want to see and talk with people of their own language. I was as tired on sunday evening as I was on  saturday.They had come to be with their son a 41 year bacheolor. The whole fo the week was spent with the company of food and old people.I hope to find a better job,which required less movement and more of brain power. Every thing that happend this week was  my fault ,should have done the Siemens interview right.
