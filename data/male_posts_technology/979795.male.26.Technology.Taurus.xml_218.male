A fully packed week due to my final year project, slow progress, my 5th kyu grading on Wed, worrying for my coming jap test in 2 weeks, my project demo in 2 weeks, possibility of goin on a 5 day 4 night trek on the 1st weekend of the Easter holidays, project documentation due in 4 wk's time, 1 jap test when school reopens and studying 1 year's worth of sch work in 4 wks while juggling the above mentioned stuff. ARGHGHGHGHGH!!!! OK lemme blog a bit to calm myself 1st.  Tues's Aikido was ok. I recorded the class and had them digitised. If anyone's interested, I can send over via ICQ. Also digitised the 1st AFS grading. Well, left a bit of the 2nd kyu grading lah, basically only the tachiwaza not digitised. We went through the 5th kyu syllabus and I was kind of just going through the motions in training. My heart and mind just wasn't there. At the end of class, when we did a revision of the whole night, there were some techniques I just couldn't remember. Shitz how do you remember everything anyway. Until now I always have this problem. Maybe it's because I'm not concentrating fully lah. Well, when class ended, we were told that grading will be next Tues. I was still thinking that I had the weekend to find my senior and clarify some stuff.  Wed came. Just before class Sensei asked if I received the 5th kyu grading syllabus which she had emailed me that very evening just a few hrs ago. I replied I had not because I had left the house early this evening. The 1st hour with the beginners was ok. Sensei made us do some techniques which were actually part of 5th kyu grading. Being the fool I am, I didn't notice. Like I said, I just went throught the motion of class again. We did quite a few times of ai hamni nikkyo but somehow it always registered in my brain as an ikkyo. The 2nd hr came, and again I just followed blindly. We did a lot of techniques. If felt like a blur to me because I wasn't really thinking much. Basically just using my eyes and not my brain. I probably saw a lot of stuff but never really understood them. Haiz... We started off with hanmi hantachi kaitennage. My partner, Yanni / Yarni (Greek), couldn't be nage because he has a bad knee. So while waiting for a chance to ask Sensei if he can do the tachi waza version, we just carried on 1st (problem was Sensei was concentrating rather hard and long with the beginners so we actually did quite awhile of hanmi hantachi). Wah, wat a killer. I started off ok. But quite possibly because I was already half tired out from the 1st hr, I lost my stamina after mabbe 6x of the technique. My knees were so knackered out. Until ultimately I felt off balanced and out of breath. When permission was given for Yanni to proceed with the tachi waza variations, the reprieve didn't help me much. Because he was good, his turn always finished really fast and soon I would be nage again. Techniques carried on and all I wanted to do was to finish so that I can go home for a rest. As uke, most techniques that night were forward rolls and I also burned myself out over these.  In the last 15 mins, we were told to line up. Thinking it was the end of class, I was quite thankful and hopped quickly to the end of class. However, instead of ending, she asked Angelo (also grading for 5th kyu) and me out. Next she wanted 2 ukes. The beginners were told to get comfortable (but some of them, not knowing what was really going on, just kept on kneeling for the remaining 15 mins). We were told to do a variety of techniques; katatedori gyaku and ai hamni shihonage, ai hamni iriminage (jodan and chudan variations), ikkyo and nikkyo and some others I can't remember at this point. Nikkyo was the one that caught me. Like I mentioned, I kinda thought they were some weird looking ikkyo variation so I took awhile to remember what I needed to do. I was simply horrible. There was a few rounds of gyaku hamni tenchinage (2 variations). Next was kokyu ho (standing) and kokyunage. Randori was quite ok I suppose. She asked us if we still recalled the sankyo, yonkyo, gokyo, rokyo which we did for a straight 2-3 wks sometime ago. I think both of us could only remember certain variations but not all of them. I basically did 1 sankyo, 2 yonkyo and 2 nikkyo. As usual my nikkyo suxed. I think this was Sensei's way of giving me a 2nd chance for my nikkyo. Haiz ... I dunno lah. We ended grading by taking ukemi. It was a whole lot easier to me than asking me to be nage. At least I had more time to clear my head. Taking a few rolls here and there helped a lot.  Well, both of us passed. Angelo did considerably better than me - "nice strong techniques, but need more work on ukemi". My comments were "techniques were nice and technically good, but lacked 'fire and life'. There were a lot of stuff in the head, but not enough was coming out in action". Come to think of it, I wasn't even really like applying my techniques properly, it was more like trying to get the actions 'right'. That's my problem I guess, my Aikido never works because I never really use the technique on my uke seriously. She ended by saying she wants to see me work on this area for my 4th kyu. (Despite, knowing that I'll be graduating this year.) At the end of it, I'm happy I passed. But I wasn't happy with my performance at all. Quite sad really. I had wanted to do a lot better actually. Well, that just leaves me with a lot of areas I should be looking out for then.  This grading made me realise a bit more about myself. My non-aggressiveness during Aikido is not really the right attitude. I think like omote and ura versions of a technique, there are times I should be stepping in instead of stepping back. Causing a bit of pain to my uke is acceptable (so long as I don't make it really excruciating for them lah). Think my attitude during class needs a lot of work also. My mind drifts a bit sometimes.  Thursday I woke up to find my knees and elbows were a bit bruised and one had a small cut on it too. Think something on the mat caused the cut when I took ukemi for ikkyo. There were 2 marks on both wrists but I don't remember being yonkyo-ed the night before. Went school for a few hours in the morning and went back home. Had to prepare dinner for the house on Thursday. Very sian lah when it came to feeding them sometimes. I admit that I'm not the best cook in the house, neither do I put in a lot of effort cooking my dishes. They have to be practical, easy to cook and edible. But 2 of the guys were making a bit of noise that my cooking lacked effort. What the heck?! Cook for you guys also need to listen to this kind of crap. So I just 'jokingly' commented that at the most I can always pull out of the cooking arrangement and make my own meals instead of sharing. Whether they can tell that I wasn't exactly in a good mood I do not know, but the atmosphere sure didn't get out of hand. Later on that night, I had supper and again we came back to the topic about my attitude to food. Having calmed my mood down a bit I was able to jokingly point out that one of my housemate is too picky with food. I don't have an answer to this lah, maybe I'm imposing my taste on them, but I think they are putting me in a similar spot by imposing their taste on me too. Anyway, I'll see how things go. I do enjoy their cooking but if I have to tax myself every week (even though it's just once a week), I really just can't be bothered at all.  Sorry if I sound like I'm complaining but I think I need to spend a bit of time outside of my house and alone. My housemates are all nice people but I'm sorry to say that the chances of staying in contact with each other will be almost impossible when I go back to Singapore. There are just some things we can't stand about each other and I don't see me being the type to stay in constant contact with them when we aren't really that close. The few bonding sessions we have had while in UK really doesn't make us that much more closer. It only exposes us to what habits the other person has but that does not mean we can accept it. I occasionally need to remind myself that there must be a ton of things that people can't stand about me and they're just keeping quiet only. That helps me to tahan their different lifestyle. Sad lifestyle lah in UK. Can't expect too much, just live with it and go home after that. Don't be mistaken that I'm really having a miserable time in UK. I would still recommend anyone to try staying abroad for a period. There's a lot of things you will expose yourself to rather than cacoon yourself in Singapore. I think I just have too much stuff on my mind and I hope things get better this Easter holiday.  I went back home for dinner just now but a part of me didnt really want to stay home and listen to crap from people. So I decided to come to Uni to do some work and blog out my unhappines and grievances for the past few days. Heh :P
