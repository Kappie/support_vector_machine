BTW are you working on Solaris platform, heard it was a wonderful piece of OS.   Good to hear that you are also working on Windows installations. As a SME in that area, I can help you in any doubts in that arena. Feel free to ask.  reg. the layout, consider the issue closed for now. I will rake up the matter when I make any changes to the layout. (which will be sometime around two weeks from now)  I am hoping to hear from our NRI's about I-Day in their localities.
