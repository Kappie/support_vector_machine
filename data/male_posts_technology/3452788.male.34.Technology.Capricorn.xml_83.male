Instead of an ant trail, I found the Bayshore Freeway, 10 lanes of ants, toll booths, highway patrol, two ants trying to run an insurance scam, and prostitue ants on the exit ramps.  I was fascinated for about 7.2 seconds, then the carnage began.    I think ants freak out when they find other dead ants.  I have noticed that the smell of dead piss ants is a deterrant to use of the trail. In our old house I had killed an ant, and left the carcass on the trail as a warning to the others.  One ant found the body and started freaking out.  I thought he was going to eat his buddy, but instead he did a little st. vitus dance, spun around a few times, and rolled over in agony.  He stopped moving a few minutes later.  Very fascinating.  I wonder if the ants have some sort of collective consciousness, and actually have "sympathy" for the dead?  Here we go, anthromorphizing again.
