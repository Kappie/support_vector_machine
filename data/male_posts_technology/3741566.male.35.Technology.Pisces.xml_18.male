I'm not talking about looking through someone's words or actions and seeing jealousy or anger, I'm talking about seeing deeper. What is it that they say to themselves that creates the actions that they do?  There is a guy at work, that before I ever arrived at this new position, had a negative view of me. I have gone out of my way to help him out since I arrived and tried to "kill him with kindness", but he still goes about the company on a regular basis and speaks poorly of me. Although he can't give specific instances of something I did, he uses generalities to describe me to others that don't know me.  I can look at it from an intelligent common sense manner and understand that he is more than likely jealous that I came from outside the company to a higher position in the company and that he might feel the it is unjust that I have achieved this in far less years in the industry than he has.   That is the easy part. What I want to know is what is it that he says to himself that would cause him to open up his mouth and spew garbage about me that he obviously knows isn't true? I am completely incapable of doing something like this and although I certainly have some wonderful moments of destructive self-talk, that self talk never turns to being malicious. So what is it that people say to themselves that causes them to do mean spirited things? What is it that a lover says to themselves that makes them be cruel to one they profess to love? One is it they someone says to themselves that would make them be cruel to their children or pet? I'm sure I'll never know.  Even though I know this person has tried to be destructive to my career, I hold no ill will. To me, dwelling on it too long or creating my own self talk about how he wronged me, or how unjust it all is, only hurts me. Why would I want to be thinking such negative thoughts? I prefer to hope that over time he'll come to know that I am no threat to his career and only wish the best things for him and everyone else I work with.   Life is so much easier when you are at least attempting to see the positives in others actions and in them as a whole. I can think of many relationships I've been in that people wondered why I was with my partner because they were unable to look past the rough exterior of the person and see the positives within. My wife is an excellent example. If I had chosen to see only the negative inputs she contributed to the relationship, our marriage would have never made it to year two. She struggled for years with negative self destructive behavior that threatened to destroy our marriage. I stuck with it even when that destructive behavior became malicious towards me. Why? Because even through the worst of times, my attitude inside always remained positive. I thought that if I could somehow help her help herself, then the person I saw buried inside her could and would be set free. I was correct. My wife is now a very well adjusted happy person. It was the smarted thing I've ever done.  Wendy seems to be another example, although her self destructive behavior manifests it self in very different ways that Scottee's ever did. I think it might be because her destructive behavior has gone on for so much longer. Scottee was around a positive influence at an early age. Someone to lead by example. I use this term loosely since back then I was much less successful and maintaining peace within myself as I am now and currently I would guess that I am only 75% successful. Still, I think I was able to help her see that there are other ways of viewing herself and others. With Wendy, she hasn't had those types of influences and at 35 years old it has to be much harder to go through this self discovery process.   Looking back in her past, I can see that the people she surrounded herself with certainly haven't helped. When you are in a bad place internally yourself the worst thing for you is surround yourself with other people with similar problems. It ends up being a constant open sore with no one understand the dynamics. Self hate in one person has the tendency to rub off on others if the other person isn't very self aware of self-talk. Wendy's issues with herself aren't all that uncommon though. Although she sees herself as unique, it hardly make it so.   The self doubt she feels is exasperated by her being over 30. To her, she should have been out on her own by now, she should have been more successful by now in her job and relationships and because she is not, that confirms her own negative feeling of herself. She gives herself proof that she is unworthy.   The cycle of negative thinking is very hard to break because it feeds on itself through self fulfilling prophecies and through the reinforcement of negative ideals. Let me give examples.  The career cycle:  1. Wendy had dreams of being a successful writer. Here is the initial goal. 2. She set that goal and then went about trying to achieve it. She knew that the first step was a good education, but due to circumstances beyond her immediate control she was unable to attend more than a year at the prestigious school that she started out at. This is the trigger event for the negativity. The self talk probably went something like this. I am a failure because a didn't succeed at my primary goal of getting my degree from this institution. The problem is that "failure" is a negative and you cannot prove a negative. A positive outlook would have shown that she had indeed been successful at that school and proved her academic worth just by being there. Having financial circumstances that prevented completion is not failure in the least. It was the unreasonable expectation that life would go smoothly and that if it didn't she was a failure and that would be awful that set her up on a self destructive path. 3. By this time Wendy is early in the cycle of negative self-talk. She pulls out of it somewhat and figures out a way to get her degree. Although it wasn't where she wanted, it was still a degree. At this time the real world hits her hard and she is forced to use this degree to get a job that can financially support her, instead of focusing all her attention on becoming a writer. Because she has already labeled herself a failure she immediately uses this setback as proof of that label. She reinforces it with self-talk that probably went like this. "Yep I can't do anything right. First I fail at the one school and now I'm failing at my dream. I should have reached my goals by this time in my life. If I don't do something with my life, it will be meaningless." This negative self talk led and leads to feeling of depression and hopelessness and it is complete hogwash. Without that unreasonable expectation that life is going to go smoothly she would have had a more positive outlook. She would have said to herself: " so I can't devote all my time to writing. What new writers can? Most write at night and submit their work for years without success. If I work these jobs I'll just try harder at night and on weekends. I'm a damn good writer and I know sooner or later someone will see that." Instead the negative self-talk led to depression and more negative self-talk. Since I have to work, I'll have no time to write and that means I have failed in my life and I am a failure." That led to her never actually writing because she convinced herself that she was a failure. As a failure there is no motivation to prove yourself wrong. If she never writes she can never be rejected like she was sure she would be. Can we see the cycle? That was only one cycle, the other were with her person relationships.  What all this comes down to is that it buried all the wonderful qualities about her. She doubts her own work now (which I have seen and know is wonderful)and is so full of self loathing that she can't see the positives in herself even when the are staring her in the face. I've spent many a nights thinking what it waste it is. I wish I had a tenth of her talent at writing. I wish I had a tenth of her artistic abilities as a whole. Relationship wise she has a lot to offer any man or woman. Inside there is a caring, nice, beautiful woman that she won't believe in enough to let out.   I doubt I've helped much lately. I have to realize that I can't help her. I can only lead by example and hope that she figures things out on her own. I've tried to show her the negativity that has taken over her life, but I keep forgetting that there isn't any way to show someone that when they are in the midst of it. It only then feeds the fire. They use it as proof that they are a "bad" person because of past mistakes. They get caught up in being "right and wrong" and can't understand that it isn't about that. The whole idea of being "right" or being "wrong" is actually part of the problem. I want nothing more in life than for her to understand that she isn't a bad person, in fact, that she is quite the opposite and has every opportunity to lead a happy healthy life if she'll only give herself a chance.   In the mean time, it hurts to see, most of all because I've been there and know it is easy to escape once you understand the problem and believe that you are always your own worst enemy.
