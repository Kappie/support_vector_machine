Kelly, why is it SO STRANGE and FUNNY that I'm making you a PC? It's an older one, and it's literally in a cardboard box, but it's pretty leet and whatnot. Blake came over today, then Jeremy, and then we went up to Rolland Moore to airsoft each other. TJ and Kel couldn't come. =[ Also, I need to get with the Allnutt thing...whoopsies. Since, y'know, I plan on buying the O'Reily book "Hardware Hacks" and a new sidearm and new PC parts...dood...I need to really get going. Anyways, it was nice to see you all again.
