Not that it would make any difference to the number who turn up but at least we'd feel less rejected.  By the way, if anyone is reading this, mmChronic will be the one sitting next to the three good looking blokes.   Wassup with Halo?   As Halo is down I'll just post my comments here... Had a thought...we won't be alone on Friday night. There will be Mossad agents, suicide bombers, RIAA lawyers, FBI...
