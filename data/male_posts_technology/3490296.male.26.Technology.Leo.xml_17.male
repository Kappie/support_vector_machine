Judith was gorgeous! Ya, she always  is anyway.       Had a couple of drinks with Liau and we chatted about work and nothing  but work. Everything else seems so vague and pointless to talk about.  Both of us are disillusion with relationships. So, we decided that its  for our best, not to discuss it. If Shawn stayed longer, he would have  agree with us. For a moment, i was thinking, where is my charm?! The  next moment, i thought, since when did i have it? *LOL* Ya, i don't and  have since see the cross over from talking a lot of crap to working  things out @ work. If i had put this effort in my studies earlier, i  could have been more successful than present. But, its never too late  to realise these, thus i worked harder with knowledge and pray for  favours.       Woke up feeling a great sense of disappointment. Why? Coz' of Mandy.. I  felt that i have come to a dead end already. She continues to avoid any  issues that i have raise. I managed to work around with myself and not  indulge in relationships. In some ways, you could say that i'm becoming  more feelingless. Ya, more machine-like even though i still remember  and knows how to romance a lady. Things are very different now.  Romancing a lady used to be a passion to me.    I hate it when she apologise.. coz it made me feel worse.. Getting  rejected is worse enough for me, and if she apologise, it doesn't make  me feel better. Why? Saying sorry for rejecting me make it seems like,  sorry is the only thing she can say to me.       Its getting more and more difficult for me to feel for another person,  despite in a female working environment now. Why? I think very  differently from the rest of the people. Got to sleep... Nite, hap.
