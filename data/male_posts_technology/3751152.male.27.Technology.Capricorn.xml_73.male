Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).   1993...Hmm, 13 years old. What did I do..Hmm. OH, here's a good one.  Ever year, schools from around BC have a kind of math championship. It's a source of great pride in a school to have people their. It's essentially like a jeopardy competition. But first, everyone has to write a test that will rank them 1-10 for the final competition. We do the test, a room full of kids ages 12-14, and I finish first...Mostly because I hate taking tests with a passion and want to get them over as soon as possible. After I finish the test, I sit around and wait for the guy sitting next to me to finish (as he's got a gameboy and the game he was playing looked neat..C'mon, I was a kid :)) He finishes, and we're sitting there playing gameboy and waiting for the rest of the people to finish the test.   Eventually, everyone finishes and we're told to go have lunch or some such nonsense while the tests are marked and we're given our rankings for the competition. We all troddle back inside and sit down and we're given our competitors for the final round. It turns out I was first seed (Yippy skippy) and will be playing against some chick who looks 2 years older then I do. We are seated in our chairs, with Jeopardy buzzers sitting in front of us linked to an alarm system with a light (So you know for sure who hit first). The puzzle goes up on the screen in front of you, and you've given 3 minutes, a pad of paper and a pencil to figure out the problem. I may not like tests, but I love competition so I get right down to it. I scribble out a couple calculations, slap my head with the OBVIOUSNESS of the problem, and with a big smile, put my hand up...while the girl next to me takes an extra second and hits the buzzer.  FUCK ME!  At any rate, I got kicked out first round, and the rest of the questions were pretty easy...*sigh*   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?   Virtual. Completely and utter tripe. The closest thing we have to accessible virtual reality are those games you play in arcades. Y'know, with light guns or the big headsets that go over your head and you stand in the middle shooting at people. I like games like that (especially the boxing one, an excellent work out). I'm also very appreciative of those lightgun games that require you to duck and dodge and move. It's funny, video games would be an excellent way to make kids get off their lazy fat asses and do something (Look at the asians and Dyason with their Dance Dance Revolution!)   What is the most honest thing you have done?  Told someone I didn't love them and we should just be friends. I burst out laughing afterwards at just the clicheness of it. From then on, I vowed to break up with women the old fashioned way. Be a complete and utter misogynist pig, slap them around, drink a lot and sleep around! WOot!   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?  Read, browse, snuggle. The first two I can do on the internet, the second requires Christine. I like snuggling :(   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?  TELUS management. I don't think they realize how many awesome people they have working for them, and the fact that they spend so much money doing stupid things like nightclubs instead of giving these people RAISES to keep them working hard just makes me want to start my own company up that treats all of its employees like gold, and kicks the ass of the big companies who haven't a clue how to remain a good company to work for.   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?  In the event of a world war, I'd be the first in line to sign up as a volunteer for my country. There's just something so valiant about feeling so strongly for a cause that you'd be willing to die to protect it. My grandparents all served in WW2, but none of my uncles or aunts did anything relating to Vietnam or Korea. I think it's my duty to have served in some way, shape or form.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?  'OOPS', because I'll probably die in some hideously hilarious fashion that people for years will look back and shake their head at. Like, say, sneezing really hard and hitting my head on my desk, knocking myself unconcious and swallowing my tongue.   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?  TV, whassat?   What was your first job?   I delivered papers for about a week before I learned I have no respect for old people, nor am I very sure-footed on icy surfaces. I was delivering papers across the valley here in Fruitvale and I was a little too rambunctious.. I jumped down onto someones walkway, slipped and did a nice flying faceplant onto the ground. I hate flying faceplants :(   Finish the sentence: “I have never…”  ...posted something on the TCZ blog that's less then 1000 letters and I dont think I'm going to start now :) HAH!
