It was actually better than expected, i thought it was gonna be a really boring film but it wasnt ! I have already got myself a tan, but i can always improve it and it will be better if i have a tan b4 i go to majorca cause that way i will come back looking fine! (hopefully with some boys numbers) Hehe In fact i cant wait for my holiday, which is not that long away now ! Woooohooooo But first i have the boring task of revising for my GCSE's and then the task of actually doing them. eek well enough of my boring chit chat ill be off now to leave u in some peace.
