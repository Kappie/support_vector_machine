Some things that are related to the msitmmb group should be posted there. Things that are informative to the blog must be posted here. It should be the reverse. Dei, Ganja, you are into marketing, that too at CP, you should know segmentation and niche markets.   Great to hear from Valli again. Valli, I invited Kathu to the blog, she has not respoded yet. Sangeeis also not responding.  Manny, no news from you, send the address of Ajayan and Bala for inclusion.
