This is all well and good except for a counseling appointment that my mom had made a while back (without telling me) for 4:00 tomorrow. When she brought it to my attention, I immediately knew that it was going to need to cancel it since it simply would not fit into the schedule for tomorrow, but when I asked her to do it (since she made the appointment herself) she wouldn't hear of it. So, I did the responsible thing and called my counselor and canceled the appointment myself. We were both fine with it but... about half an hour ago, mom asked me if I'd skewed my schedule to make room for the appointment yet, and I was about to lie to her just to get out of having to explain it all over to her, but I didn't and told her that I'd canceled it myself. She was furious and decided to punish me by giving me FOUR F***ING HOURS OF HOMEWORK to do before I go tomorrow morning... AFTER SHE SAID THAT NO MATTER WHAT, I WOULD GET ALL DAY OFF TOMORROW!  Oh my gosh, she's sooo....  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!.....  *restrains himself from blowing up or shooting something*  But wait, there's more... She originally wanted me to meet her at Costco tomorrow morning at 10 to pick up my glasses then go with her to the library to get some books for my English term paper (why she has to be there for me to do that, I don't know...), but then we decided that I would just park my car at the grocery store across from Steven's house so we wouldn't have to take both vehicles all over... I'm realizing that that's a very bad thing now because she's now going to try to check my work to make sure it's done, and won't let me go if it's not...  As I said to Steven moments ago: "well, one way I get literally no sleep, another way we start out at like, 3pm instead of 11am (and Adri has to be back home by 5), and another way, the day goes fine, 'cept for my parents harassing me by calling me constantly, and I wouldn't but it past them to come to the zoo since they already know I'm going to be there... then life'll be hell for a while at home... LOL Screw my mom and her stupid control issues."
