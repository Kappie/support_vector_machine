But dont make data redundant coz we (11) belong to that 45 also.... hence we dont want to see  get bored with the same messgs. also v wont abuse u saying u r not bloging at all...  Frankly saying, no one is forced to blog / post mesggs in grp.., if u can, u make it, else no probs, whoever makes it, u enjoy....  By way, whoever is making should not expect that others should make it.....  (2 Kicha...., Jax ur words slightly modified) according to my opinion.....  Then regarding that Link JAX.... u can download the package (Claroline 1.4.2 If I am Right) and u can upload those in free websites like geocities..... and start ur own web course....  thatz what they mean...   U try in the demo version, if u like it, or if u want some modification, download the PHP scripts, make changes upload in your own site... start providing webcourse,  I agree that its is a tedious process, if u can find time, Try it out... Pl. feel free to contact me for any help.... I will be very free to refuse also (ha ha ha heeeeheeeheee)  Maadi is kannada for tamil (Pannnunga....)
