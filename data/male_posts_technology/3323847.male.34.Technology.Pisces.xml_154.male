Just like this article, this particular viewpoint always seems to based in the (apparent) inherent greed of the companies selling their wares (whether it be software or music or movies or whatever).  I'm not saying companies  aren't  greedy, because some obviously are.  What I'm saying is that I highly doubt this is the primary motivating factor for the pricing of their products.  There are R costs, marketing costs, building costs, tool costs, etc.  (BTW: The movie analogy given in the comments section of that article is way off base if for any other reason than the fact that the market for movie-goers is MUCH larger than video-gamers.)  Are video games over-priced?  Part of me says "yes".  $50 is quite a bit of money to dish out for entertainment, especially after dumping hundreds of $ on a system (whether it be a PC or a console).  Then again, the popular games these days  are  big blockbusters with huge R budgets.  There's also the minor point that if people weren't willing to pony up the $, they wouldn't, so that tells me the games are priced at what people are willing to pay.  At the end of the day, what gets my goat about these types or arguments is this: They appear to simply be weak justifications to STEAL what you want instead of paying for it.  Yes, no matter how I examine this topic, piracy is STEALING, period.  Just because I can't afford what I want it doesn't make it right to just steal it.  Trying to justify piracy is, to me, a textbook case of self-delusion.  Don't crap on my shoes and tell me it's shoe polish. :)   p.s. No, I'm no angel when it comes to piracy, but I'm not going to try to convince you whatever I've pirated has been anything but stealing.  Also, I will NEVER use the "Two wrongs make a right" argument to justify it and/or assuage my guilt.  I've realized the "eye for an eye" mantra usually just results in two blind people instead of one, and what good is that? ;)
