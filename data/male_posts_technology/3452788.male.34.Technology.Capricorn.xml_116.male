I am trying to listen to the Inner Critic, hearing the constant litany of crap channeled through my conscious thoughts...  Then suddenly a  very large BOOM  shook the ground, the air, my car!  In a town of 30,000, you hear loud noises occasionally, but this was very large, like a bomb or an explosion.  I drove in a loop around downtown, but no one seemed very concerned, no sirens, police cruising sedately down Broadway, and so on.  When I got back to the office, several people heard it and felt it.  I was over a mile from the office, so it must have been something large.  Maybe we are under attack.  Maybe Al-queda needs redwood trees for something so they are here to kick our ass.  Oh well, as long as the terrorists don't ask me how I am feeling today.  The next person that asks me "how ya doin?" will get punished, I'm quite sure.
