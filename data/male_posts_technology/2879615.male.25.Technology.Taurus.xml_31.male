And, I am never looking up warning signs of alcoholism again...  "Have you had more than two or three memory lapses (called blackouts) in the past 90 days?   After an evening or other period of drinking, have you forgotten where you left your car?  Or how you got home?  Have you had to call someone the next day to fill you in on what you were doing the night before?   Have you tried skipping certain nights of the week, or hours of the day, when you wouldn't drink at all?   Are you drinking more often that you used to, or greater quantities when you do drink?  Are you able to drink more without getting drunk?  Do you sometimes have the shakes or other discomfort the next morning, and does a pick-me-up drink help make you feel better?"  Damn it.  Stupid tests.  They should have one for college students.  This shit is normal.
