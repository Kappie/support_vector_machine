I feel like shit however I do have a arrogant bastard to cheer me up. I wish I could share the problems that led up to this break up with my millions of readers however I don't think it would be appropriate. I wish things could have worked out. Oh well at least now I'm free to live my prepubescent fantasies. Unfortunately I don't think that's going to happen damn why can't life be more like porno films. I'm just rambling now I should get back to my arrogant bastard and then I found a stone which from the same place that should help to drown my sorrows.
