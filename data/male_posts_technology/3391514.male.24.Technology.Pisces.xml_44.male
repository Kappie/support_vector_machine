So I'll not be driving / reading properly until at least August.  And on 8 drops a day until then.  More  Fallout 2  fun... it seems one can get a lot further with a high Intelligence and Speech skill... still having trouble with a particular quest though.  Also went to the town, and my watch works again, which is nice.  It's not been an exciting day really.
