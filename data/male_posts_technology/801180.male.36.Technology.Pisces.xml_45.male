So I was woken up by them breaking up hardcore - really wasn't expecting them - but pleased to see them anyway.  This means that the slab will probably be laid sometime next week, so things really are moving on apace.  The weather was extraordinarily nice today - really warm and sunny, so the only sensible thing is to have a barbeque later - lovely!  Probably go over to Jo's sisters place as we haven't been there for a while.  At least it seems like the summer is starting to show it's face - what are the odds of the weather being like last year - pretty remote I should think - but I am not going to be negative, the summer has hardly had a chance to start yet!
