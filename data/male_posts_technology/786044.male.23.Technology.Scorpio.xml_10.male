Today I had to turn in my final project for a class and it was nice when I left, but when I was coming back a short time later the skies just opened up and started pouring. It was almost as ferocious as an Illinois rain. But not quite. Sorry, Oregon. You'll have to do better than that.   Wool Hat   That's twice now. Three times really, I think. I almost forgot my hat. Almost left it behind. Can't do that. I mean, I'm gonna need it. It's as cold as cold gets in Chicago, if you don't mind my saying so. Of course, I can't really believe that I've managed to hang onto this one for so long. That's not a metaphor for a girl or anything. I'm seriously talking about my wool hat. It's not as important as a girl - her name is Valerie - cause it only took five dollars and ninety-nine cents to leave TJ's with it; and we can say for certain that human life is irreplaceable. Love is inimitable. And tacit for that matter. I would argue that it is non-substitutable, but I'm sure you could make an argument either way on that one; but I'm not gonna touch that with a ten foot pole. Another topic that could invite argument is whether one can love a piece of clothing. If so, I damn sure love my wool hat. Perhaps it's because of the warm weather that it keeps trying to leave me. Or maybe I have just set my expectations too high - expecting it to jump up and back into my backpack. "It's old hat." So what about teaching an old hat new tricks? I think old Wooly is going to need some new tricks under his cap. Cause it really is as cold as cold gets in Chicago. You've got Alaska, and Siberia, and the Antarctic and all that, but for a boy who spent sixteen of the first seventeen years of his life in Portland, Oregon (where'd it go?), Chicago is cold. Portland doesn't have any "river" affect flurries. I could easily be convinced the City of Portland doesn't even _own_ a snow plow. They're like "Put on your wool hats and it'll be gone in a couple days." So I was going to write a Thank You letter to my wool hat, just to say thanks for sticking around so long, because my umbrellas never do. I guess at twelve ninety-nine, they're too upscale for me. I bet they'll be regretting it when I'm going business casual downtown with all the cool cats. But I'll be walking in there with my multi-crap bin wool hat and Circuit City grand opening giveaway umbrella. That's how I'll be rolling off the El. My red and white Circuit City spirit umbrella weighs a few stone more than the titanium alloy fashion understatement I got at Herrod's, but I'll bet dollars to doughnuts it holds up as well in the Illinois showers as well as anything. Cause it rains in Illinois. I mean, _rains_. Sure it rains in Oregon - yeah, all the time - but it's mostly just what we Oregonians call "spitting" or "drizzling." That precipitation that occurs in Illinois goes under the classification of "torrential downpour." It doesn't matter if it lasts only ten or twenty minutes; because if you're out there without protection you're soaked. Not like in Oregon where most of the time I could walk around with my black nineteen ninety-nine Old Navy jacket and be fine for days on end. To withstand the downpour of an Illinois showerstorm you need a jacket made out of material that will fight with the water. Like bio-engineered Goretex or something. Something that says "Water, if you fucking come near me, I'm going to kick your ass to the curb. Literally." You learn quick that "water resistant" means the fabric is all about being French when it's time to fight the Germans. "Waterproof" is closer to being British. I'm still looking for something that will come in like the United States and be like "Were you guys even trying to fight before I got here?" And if I can find that, I'll love it maybe almost as much as I love my wool hat, which is still not even on the same order of magnitude as the amount with which I love my girl. Her name is Valerie. Just in case you'd forgotten. Cause I almost forgot my hat.  --  Fan P walking...
