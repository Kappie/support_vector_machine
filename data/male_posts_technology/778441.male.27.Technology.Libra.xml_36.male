And tomorrow, I'll be going to Pune to spend the weekend there and see all the famous Ganpatis in Pune  (Pune is really famous for its Ganeshotsav celebrations) . So, in effect, I'll be  Ganpati-hopping , as  urlLink Amrita  puts it!  *LOL*   I'll be checking out the  Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati  and the  Kasba Peth Ganpati , both of which are very famous. I'll take a few snaps and get them scanned after I'm back to Mumbai  Ok, its Friday the 13th today and since I'm not a  friggatriskaidekaphobe , I'm not afraid of it!! In fact,  13  is my lucky number. Most of the good things that have happened to me, have happened either on the 13th or 26th.  heh heh!!   So, who among you all is a  friggatriskaidekaphobe ? ... or a  paraskevidekatriaphobe  for that matter?  *LOL*   Well then, good bye folks... have a fab weekend! ... au revoir!!   cheers!
