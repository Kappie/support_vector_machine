The timelines of a woman's life, her film roles, and japanese history are all interwoven in such a powerful way that you will be in awe.  *end trailer-voice*  I love this film, it makes me want to see Kon's other film Perfect Blue.  I'm really on a japanese animation kick these days, and i never really had an interest before.  I credit Miyazaki films for bringing me around.  I'm out.
