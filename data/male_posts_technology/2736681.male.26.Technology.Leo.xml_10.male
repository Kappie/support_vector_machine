This is one of the reasons why I chose Europe to do my PhD - there is just much more going on here academically with respect to MDA than in Australia. (That, and the cheese is much better here, too).  This would not be considered academically prestigious, and some of my career-advising supervisors might advise against submitting/attending, but Dave Akehurst knows his stuff, and it should attract some interesting sorts. The publication outcome is less important than the intellectual stimulus that might be gained by attending.
