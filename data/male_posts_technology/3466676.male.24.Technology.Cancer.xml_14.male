Obviously it is a major setback to lose something so important.  Less than an hour after my wallet went missing, a lovely young couple showed up at my door with smiling faces and a wallet.  I tried to get their phone number and address so that I could reward them as a token of my gratitude, but they would have none of that.  They simply told me to return the next wallet I found to its rightful owner.  I obviously agreed to that deal.  They said to me "Happy Sunday!" and drove off.  The nameless couple could have dropped my wallet off in the nearest mailbox or turned it in to the gas station attendant where they found it, but they chose to drive across town and make sure it got to me safe and as soon as possible.  They are the kind of people that try to make this world a better place, and to thank them I ask all of my faithful readers to do a little something nice for someone next time you get the chance.  I know I will.
