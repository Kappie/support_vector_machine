I picked up my car from there and went home to freshen up.  Now, we thought the fireworks were supposed to start at 10 PM, but they were scheduled for 9:30 PM.  I find this out from my neighbor Betty at about 9:15 PM...uugh.  So I rush up to Mount Washington see the fireworks and get caught in tons of trafic.  That's what I get, I guess.   Mount Washington is my favorite place to see the firewaorks from because the view is amazing.  The trick is to go all the way down to the west end of Grandview Ave, a little ways down from Monterey Bay resturaunt.  From there, one can see the city skyline, the fireworks downtown, and the fireworks in the neighboring communities.  It's very cool.  Unfortunately, we were all late and didn;t get to see the fireworks together - I only saw the tail end of them myself. Oh well.  In my hustles to get to a good place to take pictures and look around for people I know, I lost the little pouch I keep my camera in.  Oh well... I'll get a new one.  After the fireworks, Chris and Scott picked me up to go to some parties we knew of.  They followed me while I parked my car and we hit a local gas station so Chris could get some smokes.  Chris sell and promotes wines and liquors so he happened to have some new Malibu Pineapple in the trunk and some plastic shot glasses - which I used to catch up since they already had a bunch to drink, hehe.   Warming up with Chris...  urlLink      We went to meet our friend Danielle at a party her friends' Dan and Eliza were having. They had food and drinks there - we had fun!     Me and Eiliza  urlLink     Queen Danielle  urlLink       Outside with Dan  urlLink     Danielle and Renee  urlLink        We went to another party, but it had already fizzled out so we went back to the first one and had more fun.  I have lots of fun video from that night... I'll have to figure out how to stream it into this blog.  When we tried leaving we couldn't find my keys because they were in Chris' car.  On the way to my car we saw Chef James from DejaVu and hung out for a few minutes on the street.  Everyone was a little happy, hehe.

We were pretty tired from the long day and didn;t stay too long but I got my dancing fix with some girl I met there. It was a nice, full day.    Chris and Scott at After-hours  urlLink     Me and Nick (the owner)  urlLink       ...as you can see, I had my fill.  I was pretty tired and went home and crashed.  My head hurts pretty bad, uugh. I think I'll be taking it easy today... though my phone's been ringing off the hook...   -Ryan Riehle
