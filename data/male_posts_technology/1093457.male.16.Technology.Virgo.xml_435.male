Well is it only me or are the peeps coming in my limo slightly pissed off? I think it is rude that we are not gonna get dropped off at our houses it means that our parents have to come and pick us up ! But anyway im looking forward to seeing you all at the ball your all gonna look fab. Make sure you look ur best for tmors photos.
