He's just a "money-grabbing, multi-national chancer". And for once I'm not bothered by the tabloids favourite sport - England manager assassination. He may be after the money (aren't they all?) but he's still a good football coach and he's shagged Ulrika. What's the problem? Errm? We didn't win Euro 2004. Errm? What's unusual about that? We wiz robbed. Again. Sack the manager.
