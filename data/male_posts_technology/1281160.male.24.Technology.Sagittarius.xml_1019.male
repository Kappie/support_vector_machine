It sometimes feels a nuisance to do a lot of homework for a seemingly trivial task.. but in the long run when XYZ needs to work on something that was done a few years back.. such standardization is going to be a boon to that guy...   Such models do not just provide an organized way of working but also a sustainably efficient process that aid in optimized usage of time and reduction in cost...
