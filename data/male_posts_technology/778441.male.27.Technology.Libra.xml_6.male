Oh yes... the second cricket Test between India and England starts today at Trentbridge. I hope Indians perform well in this test match. Thats because my moods move with the fortunes of the Indian team. Which is why you'll find me sullen and grumpy most of the time!! ;-)  (blame the Indian cricket team for that! *LOL*). So, if there's anyone in the world who wants me to be happy, then pray that the Indian team does well ... hahahaha!! :-P ok ... so more later in the day! cheers!! :-)
