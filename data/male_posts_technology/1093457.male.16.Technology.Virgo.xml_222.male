Only  thing i was a annoyed about is the bit where Angela's boyfriends Simon walked out cause Darren woz flirting with Angela ! Also we were stuck down the slightly boringer end of the table so we couldnt get in to the convosation as much... After the meal woz good as well cause we managed to get into the Bowling and arcade bit, we had a few goes on the arcade then most people left. Me and Darren couldnt leave until half 11 because that was when the Taxi was booked for, so we wne tinto the bar and ordered some alcoholic drinks ! Somehow we managed to get served even though not one of us looked over 18 !! It was just me, darre, emma, helen, penny left by this time ! We all look the youngest so im really surprised we got served. Unfortuantly it didnt last for long and a bouncer came over and told us to get out of the bar and to leave our drinks becasue we couldnt prove we were over 18 ! We didnt mind though cause we were oging to leave in bout 5 minutes anyway. I think that is the best night out i have ever had, but i suppose thats cause i dont go out very often ! Lol, what a sad life i lead !  Anyway today woz fun !!! NOT i went to croydon with Goff and Darren, David was meant to come but in the end he didnt so it was a bit of a nightmare ! Goff was looking for shoes for the ball which she found but only after 4 hours and it was in a shop we visitied when we first got into Croydon ! Arghhhh. She was quite funny at times though, like when we were going to the bus stop we saw out bus was at the stop bso me and darren started to run to catch it, but Goff said she couldnt run so i said well walk quickly then so she speeded up by  about 2mm per second! Luckily we got the bus cause there were lots of people geting on it so it didnt pull away. What was more funny was when we were actually on the bus it started to move before Goff had sat down and she neally fell over !!!!!!!! I had to grab her hand and pull her to a seat. I nearly wet myself laughing ! And in the entire shopping trip i didnt buy one thing ! Anyway thats enogugh of me for one day so bye bye see ya Monday
