I guess the other template was a little boring so something new was needed.  again I just wanted to say thanks to  urlLink NYOKIGLITTER  pretty cool stuff.  So now it's time to go to Jerry's and play some XBOX.  North Beach is next with drinking, darts and dancing.  Hmmm, Triple D's, alrighty.  I need a beer.  I can't look at code that long.  Yeah I am retarded.
