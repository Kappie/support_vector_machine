I unhooked the old one and set the new one in place, attached the power cord from the old one (same plugin to the printer) just like on the back of most monitors and computers. Turned it on, it did it's startup self test, all seemed fine, I was about to load the paper when I heard a pop and smoke started to come out of the vents. I quickly turned it off. After tracing the old power cable I discovered that it was hooked into a transformer that steped up the voltage to 220!! I decided to check and see how bad things were by pluging it back into a proper 120 V outlet. Everything seems fine. The printer functions, it's self test works and even prints properly from windows. Just not sure how long it will last.
