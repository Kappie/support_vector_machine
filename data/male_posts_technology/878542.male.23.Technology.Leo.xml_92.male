I have seen great cities, unknown, rising from the plain growing new before my eyes. Towers and spires, none the same telling a tale of lives I cannot follow.  I have woken to dawn, fading visions into memories I curse, hating them for hints of loss. Wanting to wake again, back back where loss is memory.  There are no roads back no paths to follow only failing memory. Only fading hopes.  I have lived great triumphs, victories without war, friends I never lose. My influence spread gently, designs and ideas accepted, my plans writ large upon the world.  Plans and triumphs that grow live, dance, and change. Giving me great surprise, children grown beyond intent. Joy and Satisfaction.  I have seen my plans of triumph fade obsoleted, grown past. My memories of them poisoned by new eyes, seeking every flaw. Nothing left but hints marking old mistakes.  These things I remember  like glances of stories too fast and light to hold them, only scents of their meaning left.  I curse my memory in both directions.  I cannot hold my past self fast the younger man who dreamed great things the details slip and splotch even two days past I struggle to contain the tiny pieces of my lost dreams. I cannot quite lie that nothing of me dies with them.  But these memories burn me. Better to be nothing,  than remember enough to regret, than to feel enough to weep for loss. I would rip past days from me deny my past, forget my dreams to live in peace  free of comparison.  Both paths are denied. I lose myself in fading memories, my past dreams and old hopes tatter and are gone. Left are memories of memories just holes that held something, their shapes hinting at the loss, the blackness there telling me  telling me I too am gone, in measure. Yesterday's dreamer is dead. I am all that remain.  So today too, I will dream. I will dream great dreams, I will see great cities, I will live great triumphs, and I will remember them,  failingly, haltingly, in tattered record to pass them to tomorrow. So he too will despair, and he too will worry that something of who he was  lives in those fading things.  There  is  another hope another dream.  It does not visit me in visions. but lies above them. Today I am upon a hill I climbed part of it yesterday tomorrow I will climb another. And I must dream, must hope each hill brings me closer  to where it comes from.  That each day's dying and each day's steps trace a direction a path of lives and plans that points to a man some day some when a man wearing something like my face with something like my name who carries some dim piece of  me  a man who needs not fear memory who fears no dream of fairer places. a man who has come home.
