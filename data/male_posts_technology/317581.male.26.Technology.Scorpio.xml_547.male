The point being that without opening yourself up to being hurt, you never experience love in it's most pure/best form.  Looking back on my relationships I wonder how much I may have held back or had held back from me. Good times can be fun, but I'm looking for love. I want the emotional side. I want a girl that I can say, "Have you met my girlfriend?" about. I want to be able to trust someone and be open with them. I want to be her desire.  I don't want to be scared of opening up and having it thrown back in my face.  I know that I can be anyone and do anything with my life. I know that I AM comfortable with who I am. I also know that I get bored at night when I don't have anyone to do anything with. I'm damn responsible, and I'm fun to hang with.  One thing I've always felt about love is, that you can only give love and hope that it is returned. You cannot buy love or force someone to love you.  Part of who I am is based on this notion of love. When I love someone, I try to make myself available to them whenever they may need me. Which often means that I fall for people who are a little sad, because I can help them be happy. I think that maybe I see myself as only useful for when people are going through tough times, so when times are flying high, I feel awkward. I'm not sure how much of this last paragragh is true, but they are thoughts that I'm having, so I'll leave them for the people of the web to read.  I'm in a blogging mood, thanks be to Oregon, Peace- Tim
