Blogging has become a world wide phenomenon, with mllions of bloggers blogging every second. Search engines like Technorati are keeping track of each and every blog and enabling to search the live web, getting to know opinions of people as and when they are published.  Can such a thing be reproduced with live multimedia streams ? There are limited number of audio and video blogs that exist, but I think they are not well organised. There are no search engines to search through, there's no proper central interface like Technorati etc. which can pick the live video streams, club them nicely together and publish it as a news channel.  Currently all the audio and video blogs are kept in files , associated with certain text ; one can go and read text and hear audios, but what would be interesting is if one can generate a live 24 hour video channel from multiple splitted up videos contributed by people from all over the world.  Next time, when I hear a breaking news, I can hear not just what media houses present to me but what the local residents themselves experience. I can have something like visual map of the whole world and can zoom in or out and can wish to hear news stories from any big city to any small native town of any corner of the world.  Big news media does the organization and presentation of news very well - but thats a challenge if one can be a blogger, then there might be whole lot of people who become indepedent journalists, have a rating system and with some clever multimedia and semi-automatic analysis and then anyone can have a live multimedia snapshort of the world at any given moment of time.  This is yet far from reality, but as we move into the future - more and more multimedia generated by our peers will start affecting our life.
