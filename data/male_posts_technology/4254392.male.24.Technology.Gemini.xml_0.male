I can see why they wouldn't include office productivity programs like a spreadsheet or database program with Windows or anything else you would buy, but come on ...look at this list and tell me your computer shouldn't have come with these simple tools:   urlLink Timer  /  urlLink Timer-Stopwatch    urlLink Calculator with a tape    urlLink Tree-based documenting and organizing system   OK, some of these may be a bit less simple, but you could see how useful it would be for these to come with Windows:   urlLink An actual cd burning application    urlLink A customizable volume control that lets you see input and output devices on one screen    urlLink A graphics program that does MORE than the stupid paint program that hasn't been updated since the first version of windows!   Alright well, this needs to be finished cause I've run out of time today.  So have fun with these freebies and tell me what you think should also be on this list.  Personally - I think  urlLink Slimbrowser  ought to be on there too.  Be blessed, JASON
