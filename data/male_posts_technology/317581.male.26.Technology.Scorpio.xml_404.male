Which gets us to the point that some people think I hate kids. Which isn't true. It's just when they're in large groups that I get overwhelmed and must seek refuge in a secluded room. (1 annoying thing was they kept going into my room which was off limits:P )  Anyway, I hope you all had a nice christmas and I'll talk to you latah... -T
