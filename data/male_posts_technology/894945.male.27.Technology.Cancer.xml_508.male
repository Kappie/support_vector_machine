That agent Smith scrap in the Playground would have improved drastically if they had got a pro like that in instead of Keanu.  12 Weeks to go until i give up full time employment and go and be one of those student type people. Gonna be weird as ive been working full time since i was 17 (arrrggghhh 9 years) to go back to doing shit like falling asleep during lectures, failing assingments and the like... but i was good at both of them back then and i bet ill be even better now.
