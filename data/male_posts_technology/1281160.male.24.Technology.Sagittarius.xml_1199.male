So I have decided to close all comments after a week. I still don't know if I had deleted all the spam comments.  But to a hectic schedule, I missed out watching the Euro 2004 Cup matches in tha last week. But thanks to  urlLink BBC , I was able to watch the goals scored. You might need to install the latest version of  urlLink Shockwave  if you don't have it. I suggest you download the latest one. It is worth the download.
