It's a strong possibility, but I would need to accumulate all of my Junior credits during this summer, which means I prolly won't have time to do the ASE apprenticeship thingy... but, I guess you can't win 'em all...  Anyway, the school has a policy preventing people from graduating a year early, so I had to meet with the school board tonight to deliver a thesis on why I want to graduate next year, not the year after.  It took alot less time than I expected (6:45 - 7:30), so I was still able to get to youth group right after worship.    Ben's coming over tomorrow afternoon again, to work on math, and Christine may accompany us as well. Speaking of tomorrow, I really love the new mid-week service.  The atmosphere is amazing.  I especially like the "After Glow" (a period of time after the service - about an hour - where they gradually dim the lights and leave the worship team going as background music and just leave it open for people to pour their hearts out to the Lord.  It's an amazing time.  Yesterday Missy Berdan got back from a month in Africa as a missionary.  Well, it was technically yesterday, but for all practical purposes, it was the day before (1:00am, or somewhere around there...).  She took me home from school that day, and we were talking about her trip, in the car.  She had a really cool time there, and has some interesting stories about it. :)  Well, I am stinking tired, and need sleep.  Will post more about the last couple days, tomorrow. Night all~
