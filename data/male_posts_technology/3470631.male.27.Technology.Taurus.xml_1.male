But I want to pass something along for  those who may need it: the ability to feel what I  attempt to describe below in the final sentences of  this writing - if indeed, you are one of the fortunate  and can feel it - will never leave, and will never  become any less vivid.   I have a different persective than many of you - what  is happening to you today happend to me, in a  different form, in August of 1995, when Jerry died.  The pain subsides, new routines and musical fixes are  found, some family stays with you and some does not -  but I am here to tell you that the detail never  leaves. On most Phish nights, when the lights dimmed,  I always had my eyes closed, and was again watching  Jerry walk out. Those stolen moments were never sad,  but always ecstatic for me. The energy, and the  passion never fade. The love never dims. The lessons  become clearer, and the music even sweeter. You'll  see. In decades to come, the little trick I try to use  below, at the end of this self indulgence, will work  just as well . . .   Regarding Phish: You've gotten what you paid for. And  you got off cheap.   Regardless of how much you paid - to Phish Inc.  directly, to the scene, in your relationships, with  your health or soul - you're in on the bargain of the  century. You bought the stock at .01 a share, and have  sold it at 1,000.00 per. Perhaps you don't know this .  . .   Now, the incidental fringe benefits are not to be  overlooked, nor disrespected: friends, lovers,  spouses, self-knowledge, expanded compassion, honed  capitalist skills, an amazing cd collection, travel,  adversity defeats and victories, maturation, blessed  emotional retarding to the joyous child-like levels,  and of course, lots and lots and lots of really  freakin' amazing music.   But. Allow me to remind you of the Great Intangible.  Of the Priceless Gift that you perhaps weren't even  aware you'd received - of the Holy (in all that that  word evokes for you) Unarticulable: The Magic.   I cannot describe it. I cannot relate it to a  particular show, or to my or your favorite YEM or Tube  or Divided Sky. It is beyond definition, beyond grasp,  beyond description, and beyond value. But not - never  ever ever - beyond perception. Here it is:   It is preceeded by that moment, as you wait for the  lights to go down - you know it will be any second  now, and its killing you in the bestest possible way,  as if you were 6 years old at 5am on Christmas Morn -  and the earthly realm and its horribly heavy (and  light) luggage are about to melt away, completely. In  what surely is the most tremendous understatement in  the history of human language, you consciously or  unconsciously feel and think: "All is right. There is  no where in the universe I would rather be right now."   Then, the Great Inarticulable - you can hear it RIGHT  NOW, as loud as if you were in the moment, as real as  its ever been, capable of literally raising the hair  on the back of your neck, and hardening your nipples,  at *this very second*. See if you got what you paid  for all these years, and then some. Right now, quiet  your head for a second, close your eyes, and imagine:   The lights go down. The crowds roars, to the point of  physical and aural immersion, and the energy - The  Magic - fills your very DNA.   Did you hear it? If you're one of the lucky ones, The  Magic resonates so clearly in memory that it is as  real for you at your desk right now that it ever was  in any venue you've visited. And if so, you got so  much more than you ever bargained for. Congratulations  on your fine, fine, unintended purchase. It carries a  lifetime satisfaction guaranteed warranty.   Grateful,  -p.
