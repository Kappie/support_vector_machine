Ganesh must have received a forward from someone in Infy (I don't know  don't want to know who). He forwards it to the group. He also mentions where he got it from. Vinitha reads the mail. She wonders  why the company name is mentioned and shoots off a reply to the mail. Kicha gets worried at this mail and writes another reply to Vinitha's mail. So it begins...  Ganesh has no part to play in this interaction, so leaving him out, it comes down to two persons, K  V.   V thinks G is trying to make fun of K by not refering to him by his name ( while he is not). G was just trying to give us a background information about the forward. So she thinks why should the forward's origin is given, when there are no information given for other forwards in the group.   Now K reads her mail and feels that he is 'dicriminated' against because of his company/people.    I hope by now, you would've realised that all this was caused to misinterpretation and misunderstanding. The above is just my imagination of what the problem is. It might be real or might not. Unless the concerned persons put forward their points, noithing more can be said.
