Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of modern times, died of a brain edema in Hong Kong at the age of 32.  While the cause of the edema was never determined, doctors believed it was due to hypersensitivity to a medication.   He died prior to the release of his last film "Enter the Dragon."
