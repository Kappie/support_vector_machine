If her development is to be judged by her due date and not by her birth date, then she is way ahead.  Never heard of a baby smiling and rolling over at birth.  Let's face it, she is  absolutely incredible, wonderful, strong, cute and great.  Is she still a night owl?  The other day, when I was talking to Dale on the phone, I could hear her cute sounds in the back ground and it made my heart jump.  We are so excited that we get to meet her soon.  Hope there won't be a delay because of Luke's surgery.  He was supposed to sit in a chair today for 10 minutes, but could handle only two minutes.  We'll see how it goes. I am looking forward to the pictures.  Give Maya a kiss from me.  Love CO Mom
