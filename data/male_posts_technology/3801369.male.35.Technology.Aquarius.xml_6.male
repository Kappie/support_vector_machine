Right now I'm in  urlLink Gothenburg , Sweden, after having spent a week at the  urlLink World Gliding Championships  in Norway, and a week sailing amongst the hundreds of islands near  urlLink Str√∂mstad  and  urlLink Grebbestad .   urlLink A map  will give you an idea of what I'm talking about.  A few more random thoughts and then I must get back to some real work:   Software Development:      urlLink Eclipse  seems to be a great IDE.  I've just started using it, but the more I find, the more I like it.  My suspicion is that, while it may not yet be quite as good as  urlLink Intellij IDEA , it will over time become the dominant IDE on the basis of it's price (free), and support in the form of numerous  urlLink plugins .  Also, the fact that it is language-agnostic is a great bonus for us multi-lingual polyglots ;-)   urlLink Java Data Objects (JDO)  also seems like a very promising technology, although the apparently  urlLink politically motivated battle with Hibernate  appears counterproductive for the Java community as a whole.      Culture  I discovered today that Google provides a great  urlLink summary of trends  in it's Zeitgeist.    Evolution  I'm busy reading this great book called  urlLink Genome  by Matt Ridley.   Nerd Stuff   urlLink War Kayaking  seems fun.
