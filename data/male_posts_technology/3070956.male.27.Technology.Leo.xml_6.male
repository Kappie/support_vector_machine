I remember complimenting some girl because she had a great body and was wearing this wife-beater with no bra.  That kind of boldness is very sexy to me.  Though... I didn't ask her for her number or anything.  I don't know why; we had a nice conversation... anyway... I also danced a lot tonight.... first at DejaVu... there were these two sisters.  One was 30 but she looked 23 (I swear) and her sister had just turned 21.  When I introduced myself to the (hot) older sister, she challenged me to 'get down' with her sister... which I proceeded to do gladly - any excuse to dance,  really.  After that, I guess she liked what she saw; we also had some fun talking and dancing together... and of course she had a boyfriend whom she said was 'hot' and that's why she was dating him. I guess it fits well :)  I invited them to my party, too - of course.  Then I somehow got convinced to go to after-hours  I really had fun dancing there.  It's mostly house music, which is pretty hard to find in Pittsburgh.  I enjoyed dancing to it.  There was some guy named Erwin there who was passing through.  We spoke for a while and I found out that he was in the King and I, touring.  He was a great dancer.  I also met with the owner regarding a conversation I had with one of the top detectives at Pittsburgh Vice. During the conversation it sounded like the detective had it out for this guy so I just shared that with him. He appreciated it and I'm sure he'll rememeber me now... which is good because this place is pretty hard to get into unless you know the owner or the bouncer pretty well.  I made some other friends while I was there, too... It was funny because the 'prick' I spoke about last time bumped into us on the way to DejaVu and so he came to after-hourse with us, too.  He continued to confirm to everyone how much he was a prick hahaha.  Oh well. We all had fun.  How am I to be productive tomorrow???  I'm definitely sleeping in again.  I might try to go to NJ Sunday morning instead of tomorrow so the I can focus on getting my house and laundry in order and get some work done, too.
