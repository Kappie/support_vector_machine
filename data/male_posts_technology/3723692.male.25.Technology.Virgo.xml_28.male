Two weeks back a colleague of mine lost her mother because of illness, today she lost her father(nobody exactly know the real reason). This is one of the tragic events one could hear about and to go through it, must be a real pain. Not yet recovered from one loss and another inflicted upon them. May Allah bless her parents and place them in Jannah. Provide all of her family sabar Ameen. Incidents like these refresh our minds about us being mortals and the importance of parents in our lives. So respect your parents no matter how much you disapprove of their decisions/actions. Never ever lose your cool on them(That’s for you Saad). If any one of you don’t have one or both of them please pray for their Maghfirat that’s the best gift you can offer them.
