 Just purchased this today, in the hope of motivating me to workout more. It's a MP3 Player with 128 MB of RAM which plays MP3 and WMA files. I really like the ergonomics of this device. It will work great when flipping through songs while running. I have no idea at this point what "psa[play" means. I thought it was a typo when I first read it, and don't get me started on the "designer packaging" that took surgery with a knife to get the "box" open.
