He is controversial because he has a liberal slant on a traditionally republican area of expertise. His column in  urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/13/opinion/13KRUG.html">The Times  today makes the audacious suggestion that the collapse of Enron was a good thing (no-fee registration required)  Besides the fact that he’s correct about Enron, he makes a much more disturbing point—the religious zealotry of Tom Delay (Texas congressman, leader of the House, and the mastermind behind the Texas gerrymandering). How and why this man has so much power (and how it ties to Ken Lay and Enron) is a striking example of why the Puritans run this country.   The LA Times yesterday had an  urlLink article  (no-fee registration required) on the extreme conservatism of George W. Bush vs. the mainline views of George H.W. Bush. At the start of the article is a scene from a 1988 Republican rally where George W. won over the hard-line conservatives in the room (daddy was just too liberal for them) by telling his own conversion story. He stood up and stated his Christian beliefs. That’s all it took for a room of good little Puritans to be won over: a statement of belief.   Why is it we are even debating a constitutional amendment on same-sex marriage? What does the definition of marriage have to do with the constitution? Does the constitution affirm the King James translation of the Bible as the only true and inspired translation? Does it even affirm the Christian God as the only god? No, and if these brainless Bible-thumpers would bother to read anything besides a book whose original language they don’t bother to learn in a translation which is almost as closed to them as Hebrew and Greek and even when put into a readable language (think NRSV or such) is still so completely out of historical context as to be akin to trying to apply the Athenian Tribute Lists to modern day Cambodia they would know that the first constitutional amendment was all about keeping their God out of our politics!  But it works—Tom Delay gets Texas and George W. has enough support that no one seriously pursues his hijacking of the constitutional voting process. It goes back to belief. Delay and George W. say, with conviction, that they believe that God is using them to promote a “biblical worldview” in politics. What this means—and why the rest of us are so angry and scared—is that they believe in a theocratic monarchy supported by a fanatical armed force. The Bible teaches that such a government is God’s government. Any means necessary to achieve this form of rule are acceptable—God is behind them.   Do most Americans agree? Do they want this? Well, no—but no one asked the Canaanites if they wanted to be slaughtered either (of course they weren’t, at least not as the Bible says they were, but history didn’t matter to the authors of the Bible, why should it matter to the readers?). They simply did not matter because they were idol-worshippers. And so are the rest of us. Ask a good Christian what modern-day idolatry means. Specifics will vary, but the theme is the same: anyone who isn’t part of “us.”  So belief turns nasty—if you don’t agree with our vision of the future, then all bets are off. Thoughts become words and actions. Can’t convert them? Kill them. Get a few of our own in the crossfire? No matter—God will sort them out.   We don’t want to see the Nazis as human, but they are just like all of us. Specific fanaticisms are merely symptoms, human nature is the disease. We can overcome, but it so much easier to not.   Besides, George W. has vision—he behaves like he knows more than we do, maybe he’s right.
