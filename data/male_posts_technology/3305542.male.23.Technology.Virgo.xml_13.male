Coco Bongo was my favorite for a couple reasons: first, it was a dance club, but every now and then a song would come on (such as the Tally Me Banana song from Beatlejuice) and performers would come out on a balcony hang from the ceiling on harnesses and put on a little show.  It was really cool.  I'll get to the second reason in another post.
