All I know is I want my got dern handcuffs...  If they gonna treat us like inmates, we may as well walk around in the pinstripes. We not here because we wanna be, we're here because our country called us to duty. We never asked for much...never did, and in my case, never will, but this recent development is....BUULLL!!!!  I'm gonna need to talk to the chaplain  get some spiritual counseling cause a brother is tore up right now lol.
