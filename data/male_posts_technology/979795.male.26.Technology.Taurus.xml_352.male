I'm beginning to feel something there. Though I'm still somewhat stiff when it comes to executing it, but I did manage to find the right way myself at least twice. Geez ... sure took me long enough.  We had quite a few beginners today so Sensei took them through the basic ukemi and maybe some simpler techniques. Ah Hee Sensei took the first half of class today. It was nice. Pairing up, we started in shomenuchi position (uke and nage's extended arms touching against each other), nage kinda guided uke in while doing and irimi tenkan himself. Nage will kinda follow in and flow to face the opposite direction. Ends with both facing each other again. Did these flowy movements 2x each and non stop. We progressed on into ikkyo, sankyo and kotegaeshi using these flowy movements. I think it was good coz everyone tried to be continuous.  2nd hr, Sensei took the class again. We did a series of kokyu nages in groups. Didn't maange to learn much coz everything kinda went really fast. Did manage to ask Johnson for help with my kokyuho during the break though.  One thing really pissed me off though. After class, I helped to keep all the mats and went to change. The stupid Aunty was nagging me to leave. I was TRULY pissed tonight. She was well aware I'm helping to keep all the mats. In a way that's like doing her a favour so she can lock up faster too. Being the last one to change, I beared the brunt of her naggings. I was still buckling my belt when she started saying things like "Dun dress up in here, if you wanna dress up go outside." Told her I wasn't even ready / decent enough to go outside. Fact was, I was trying to get myself minimally ready so I can bring everything out to pack nicely and tidy my shirt at the lobby. Here I am trying so hard and I'm still getting nagged.  I've concluded that I'll try to avoid training on days that the naggy aunty is around. If I come on a day that she is, I'm not going to finish keeping the mats anymore. Just pack up and leave halfway. I'm getting seriously pissed with her responses.
