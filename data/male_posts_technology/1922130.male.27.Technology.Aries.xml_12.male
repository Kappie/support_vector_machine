So here's how it breaks down:  nothing worth noting happened between the 27th of October and the 5th of November.  On the latter date, I departed with three of my coworkers from Raleigh/Durham headed to Marco Polo airport in Venice, Italy via JFK in New York.  The purpose of our trip was to upgrade the wireless networks and perform computer support functions at three overseas houses owned by Wake.  The four of us went to Venice, then we split up two and two to go to Vienna, Austria and London, UK.  I am currently writing from London.  The work in Venice wasn't scheduled to commence until Monday, the 10th, so we had some free time built in up front to get acclimated and sight see.  Alison decided at the last second to join me in Venice those first few days.  It turned out alright in the end but it was a major fiasco in execution.  To begin with, Ali hadn't updated her passport since we got married, so it was still issued in her maiden name.  The airlines originally told us that this wasn't a problem so long as she was able to produce a copy of our marriage license, however, when we got to Ralieigh, the intermediate carrier (United)  said that she wouldn't be allowed to board because of the passport discrepancy.  The international carrier, Al Italia, still said that the passport + marriage license would do.  A few tears and several phone calls later, I had the United checkin supervisor walk up and tell us that he'd been instructed to board Ali....yay for the Expedia's customer service.  So on we go through security.  Ali is flying through Dulles, Va. and then on to JFK and then we are supposed to be on the same international flight to Venice (My coworkers and I flew straight to JFK).  Ali's plane boards and I assume she has left the ground 30 minutes later when my flight boards.  I get to NYC to find out that Ali's flight never left the ground due to closings in Dulles relating to weather (there were thunderstorms in the area).  So she is going to miss the international flight because she can't get out of Raleigh.  Ultimately she winds up taking the exact same itenerary she had planned except that it is one day behind schedule.  The combination of several flight changes and my cell phone not working upon arrival in Venice led me to believe that she would be in on Friday afternoon when she actually arrived on Friday morning so I wasn't there to meet her at the airport.  She found her way though and was waiting in the lobby of the hotel as I was leaving to meet her at the airport.  What a mess!  Venice is a beautiful place.  I love being on the water so I was pleased as we got out of an airplane and into a boat - a water taxi - to go to the hotel.  Cars and buses can go to Venice via a single land bridge to the islands but most traffic comes and goes by boat.   Travelling by car is not possible in 90% of the city so you have to walk, take a water taxi, or take a water bus (vaporetto) to get about.    In Venice we went sight seeing the first couple of days (Thursday and Friday).  We visited St. Mark's Square, toured the church and rode up to the top of the bell tower.  We walked over to the shops along the Rialto, one of only three bridges spanning the Grand Canal.  On Saturday we visited the island of Murano, known for it's blown glass.  We got a free water taxi to the island and then a tour of the glass blowing facility followed by hard sell tactics in the factory's gallery.  It rained heavily all day and I got a little tired of following the women in our group into each every one of the hundred or so glass shops on the island.   Sunday Ali and I mostly shopped for souvenirs but we also visited the Gallery Accademia - an art museum filled with the works of the 16th and 17th century Venetian masters.  I am no art buff but the sheer size of some of the paintings was breathtaking.     Each night we were there we ate like kings, there are plenty of sandwich shops and the like to have a quick lunch in but at night you are restricted to nicer restaurants, everything else is closed.  Seafood and pasta dominated the menus and most places had an extensive selection of pizzas.  The wines of Italy are wonderful, we sampled Valpolicellas, Bordolinos, Chiantis, and Merlots.  I was also told of a dessert wine call fragolina which I sought out and sampled as well.  I have a bag full of bottles to stock the winerack at home.    Monday we started working at Casa ArTom, the house owned by WFU.  It is situated at the mouth of the Grand Canal, the waters of the canal lap at it's walls.  It is a beautiful facility and is right next door to the Guggenheim musem of modern art which houses several of Dali's works.   The work went relatively smoothly although we didn't have some of the equipment we were to install until the day before we left.  The house employs a part time computer and network support person, Marco Di Menna, who acted as our translator and was an invaluable assistant in deploying the new wireless network.  We took Marco and his wife Mara to dinner on two occasions and were invited to his home on the night before we departed for an exquisite home cooked meal prepared by Mara.  I have never eaten so much in my life.  Her gnocchi was a religious experience.  Marco showed me the coolest wine tool ever conceived - it forces CO2 through a needle inserted through the cork and the internal pressure builds unti the cork is forced out.  I must have one.  Marco lives on the mainland in Mestre so we had to catch ar ride with him to and from his house.  On the way over we stopped at an Auchan - it's kind of like a much nicer Super Wal-Mart set up in mall style:  smaller individual stores within a larger store.  I picked up some of the wine to bring home there.  The next morning we took another water taxi to the airport.  Venice is no doubt best entered and departed by water.  I will update more on the London Leg of my trip at a later date.
