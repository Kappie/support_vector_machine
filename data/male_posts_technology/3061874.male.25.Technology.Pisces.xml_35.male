The name looks a bit cryptic but for those people who want to still use both GMail and POP, it will let you use your outlook express for GMail mails!   Pop Goes the Gmail is a program that sits between the http://gmail.com web server and your email client, converting messages from web format into POP3 format that a program such as Outlook Express or Thunderbird can understand.
