When, exactly, did sports news start to revolve around the extracurricular activities of these folks?  Sports news, to me, relates to on-the-field events and player movements.  Now, I can see doing simple reporting on this topic, as it could have repercussions for the Lakers if Kobe goes to jail or something... but sending out a SPECIAL email for that?   Not necessary.  Sports Illustrated needs to remember what's important in sports - and it's not the money the players and owners make.  It's how the fans are affected.  Pro sports is entertainment, pure and simple.  And the entertainment is an on-the-field thing.  It shouldn't revolve around the personal lives of these folks.  The more we treat these folks as larger than life, the more we're going to see stupid stories like this.   I would ask Sports Illustrated and all its ilk to cut down on the gossipy crap and simply cover the sports.
