 Congratulations are in order for Mr. A-D.  Finally, after three years of ducking and dodging the system (obviously being controlled by the Man), Mr. A-D has landed the job he's always wanted.  I'm not quite sure what he'll be doing (something broad-band, wide-pass, differential filter related I'm sure), but I do know that he was recruited for the job.  That's no small feat in today's economy.  His two weeks notice is in, and he's on his way to NC in a short 20 days.  That's one UVA grad bailing on NOVA.  Who's next?
