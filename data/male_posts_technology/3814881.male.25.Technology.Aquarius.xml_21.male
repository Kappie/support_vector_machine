I read the stories for the first time in the fourth grade, and then every year after that until some time in high school.  Reading it for the first time since I saw The Movies, I really regret having watched them.  I can't help but picture that greasy guy every time I read about Strider.    Here's a couple of observations I made.  All of these should be read with the understanding that the LOTR is not allegory (according to Tolkein).  Anyway, I noticed that heroes in the story experience death and resurrection scenes involving caves before they accomplish their great deeds.  Gandalf struggles with the Balrog in the depths of Moria and dies for a time.  Frodo "dies" after being stung by Shelob in the cave at Cirith Ungol.  And although he doesn't "die" in any real way, Aragorn walks the Paths of the Dead (through a cave) to summon the oathbreakers.  Just as in Biblical imagery, man's death is symbolized by the cave, because he came from dust and is returning there.  Man then rises again to new life, transformed from Grey into White, or from Ranger into King.     I think there's a difference in the way Scripture protrays the results of this death and resurrection though.  In the Gospel story, Jesus' very death and resurrection is the heroic accomplishment.  When Jesus leaves His cave, there's nothing left to accomplish except to ascend and send the Holy Spirit.  In LOTR though, it seems like the death and resurrection is only preparatory to the real accomplishments of the hero's life.  Gandalf rises again to become the White, lead the defense of Gondor and counsel the attack on the gates of Mordor.  Aragorn must win the Battle of Pelennor Fields and then ride with the hosts to Mordor (there's room for argument with him).  And Frodo of course must complete the journey to Mount Doom with the Ring.  Perhaps Tolkein saw the death and resurrection experience as being a precursor to heroics- a shedding of the old self in preparation for the new.  This seems to be different from the Scriptural pattern where the death to self is the heroic deed.    Here's another brief observation, and I have to confess not having a clear memory for some of the details.  In order to gain the One Ring, Isildur had to cut off Sauron's finger (or maybe several fingers, or a hand, I can't remember).  This is very similar to how Frodo must give up the Ring at the end- by losing a finger to Gollum.  Does this mean that Frodo has become like Sauron because of the Ring, or that he must become like him to destroy it?
