Wish I had seen it on the big screen, like the ghetto it is set in there is so much going on my TV screen doesn't do it justice. The cinematography, direction and editing made the film so real, being based on a real story I imagine that is what they were trying to do.  The depiction of the 60s, 70s and 80s  and the depth of the information presented in the film was top notch. Loved it! Story:   5/5  Production:   5/5    Film:   10/10
