It has affected my senses and brought me to see the movie.  Sabel is a story of a nun, who was raped by a prisoner and as the story goes, we are brought to series of flashbacks to fully explain her identity. Sable is so much like all other women who longs for love and justice in the world and we were thankful that in the end she did found what was hers.  The movie’s progress in storytelling will not get you bored. The flashbacks are quite necessary for so many explanations that the movie has to do. I was able to sympathize with the lead man’s longing for his lost love. Wendell Ramos has delivered a good acting in finding his lost love but eventually in the end settles on someone else’s arms. I was asking myself at the end of the movie, ‘Am I supposed to sympathize with Sabel?’ I have read a column in a newspaper that says that Sabel is supposed to be sympathized. Maybe I was dragged to this thinking. But nevertheless, I don’t think I have too. Sabel is someone like us who are still looking and longing for that thing called LOVE and don’t need other’s sympathy. Judy Santos truly delivers her best as Sabel, every scene of hers is a must-see. The sensual parts of the movie were perfectly directed. Just a thought, would it be better if the story started in the courtroom?  What I hate about the movie are the noises that backgrounds the scene where Sabel is confronting a prisoner who is attempting to commit suicide. I was leaning on my seat figuring out what she was telling the man. But that did not distract my concentration.  The movie has an excellent story which is, unfortunately, for Filipinos who are privileged enough to get a good education because there are lots of discussions that is going to happen once you get out of the cinema. It is a kind of film that needs a lot of intelligent to be understood because of the complexity of the lead character that is being presented to the viewers.  I'm out!
