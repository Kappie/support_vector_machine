It was only four of us and it was extremely low stakes play but it was great to play live.  There was a guy playing that was really good.  He was cool enough to offer tips and analysis of our play.  It was advice well taken.   I was down pretty much most of the night.  I played short stack almost from the start.  I had to buy in twice by the end of the night.  It finally came down to one hand to end the night.  I was dealt an A J.  I limp in and one other guy checks.  The flop comes out and it's A A J.  I had the nuts on the flop.  Aces full of jacks.  I couldn't believe it.  He bet first and I called him playing weak.  I don't even know what the turn was.  I think an 8.  He bet big and I pushed all in.  He called and it was over.  The river didn't even matter.  It was a J to make it worse for him anyway.  He had two pair and was hoping to complete a full house.  That turned my money negative night into a positive one.  All in one hand.  I can't wait to play live again.  I have a lot to learn about live play though.  A lot.  It was a good night of learning though.  Indiana Slim
