Sigh .... 3 weeks more to go to the end of the closing of the financial year. Hmm, wondering if there's gonna be a BIG party and "thirst" quenching session .... Gotta ask Mr Simon L on that though ;D Already kinda had one yeterday at Zouk. Place was ok, music was tolerable, but the people that i went with were fantastic :D.  Also, this is a special shout out to me good buddy, Ms Cresty L who's celebrating her 2Xth birthday yesterday. May all your wishes  prayers come true on this very special day.  Catcha in the near future !!  Savvy ;)  Me and me cowboy lookie    Me and the angels
