First things first, I must pay homage to my  fellow Tube Runner, Mark, who not only showed my general level of unfitness but  also came up with a couple of inspired alterations to our route in the mid-late  stages which enabled us to pick up a lot of time.        Thanks must also go to the guy who stole my bottle  of water at Waterlooas I crashed into him, bastard!!!        So our finishing time was 3h 10mins and 57secs  which was pretty good considering we lost about 5 minutes at Coven Garden when  somebody left a bag on the train and we also lost a few at Aldgate ---  Aldgate East thanks to a very poorly signposted subway (I may write a  letter). We started at Vauxhall on Victoria Line and finished at St Paul's  on the Central Line. Our route was unique for several reasons, most  notably that we didn't disembark at Victoria with the others.        BBC London were on hand and made us do several  'fake runs' with the only effect that we scared a load of travellers half to  death.        Our t-shirts were received well and hopefully these  will turn up on the BBC news footage.          It's remarkable just how much fun something like  this is, firstly from the planning point of view, but also simply charging  around the underground like a nutter doing something most people would not  do.          I'm looking forward to next year (hopefully this'll  end up an annual event) where I intend to not only beat the time, but also to be  a damnsight fitter to cope with the longer runs.          One note was that everybody successfully beat the  previously established record of 3h 16mins so congratulations to all the  runners
