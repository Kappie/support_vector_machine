Arguably the greatest American president since Lincoln (and only FDR is eligible for this debate), not just for starting the fall of the Soviet empire, but for the way he lifted Americans up and made them proud of themselves and their country again, as well as bringing conservative and libertarian principles to the mainstream. May God bless the Gipper and his spirit.
