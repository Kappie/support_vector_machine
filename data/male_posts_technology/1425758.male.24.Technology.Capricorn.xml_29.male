 I wonder who are all those nice people with Israeli names that Jonny Greenwood thanks -- Sharona, Tamir, Daniel, Yardena, Yair, Neta, Yotam, Tomer, Edo. Fans on the mailing list? Personal friends? (I heard a rumour that he has some relatives or friends in Israel.) Whatever. At least it's nice to know that not all antiglobalist  urlLink Indymedia  fans hate Israel (afterall, even  urlLink Israeli Indymedia  fans hate Israel ...)
