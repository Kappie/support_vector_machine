Obama is clearly beyond reasonable attack, so the talking point of the Right appears to be, "his speech was conservative". ... Over at NRO's "The Corner", one of the posts reads:   RIGHT SPEECH, WRONG CONVENTION [Roger Clegg] Barack Obama gave a fine speech, but it was not a speech that reflects the current Democratic Party. It celebrated America as "a magical place"; it did not bemoan our racism and imperialism. It professed that this black man "owe[d] a debt to those who came before" him; it did not call for reparations. It spoke of an "awesome God"; it did not banish Him from public discourse. It admitted that black parents, and black culture, need to change the way black children are raised; it did not blame or even mention racism. It quoted "E pluribus unum" and translated it correctly as "Out of many, one"; it did not misquote it, as Al Gore infamously did, as "Many out of one." Most of all, the speech celebrated one America, "one people," and rejected the notion of a black America, a white America, a Latino America, and an Asian America--a notion completely foreign to the multiculturalism that now dominates the Democratic Party. Right. Powell was booed at the RNC convention four years ago, because his speech -- pro-choice, pro-affirmative action, didn't reflect the Republican Party. This is different. Is reparations a mainstream liberal issue? No. Is unity a conservative value? Laughable, as the Republican Party has fueled its electoral dominance via the Southern Strategy -- using race to scare white southerners to vote Republican against their economic interests -- while attempting to maintain that dominance by demonizing gays.     I'm disappointed that I wasn't able to see the speech live. I'm going to track down some video of it online...
