You're choosing your candidates as if you're worried about getting the readers of The Nation to vote in November.  They're not your problem.  It's those of us in the middle, who hold both extremes suspect.  There's enough discontent among us for either ideology to work with.  We're the only audience that counts.  Sell it to us, or lose.
