I can get electrocuted anytime hahaha!   Anyway this Gorm know by IKEA is solid good for my tv my spare monitors for PC trouble-shooting or virus removal. Planning to convert my room into a small small office damn it. LoL but I like the idea! Wire running neat.  Got three posters at popular three weeks back but only now then I got the time to paste up it goes like:  Focus: Talent and effort are nothing without focus and determination. Success: Some people dream of success...when others wake up and work hard at it. No one can predict to what heights you can soar. Even you will not know until you spread your wings. Quite nice isn't it?  And I got a long 24 k gold plated cable to run across my carpet and my two pair of Altec Lansing ACS 48.1 to run into 4 speaker mode but with two sub woofer! It is really the surround kind of feeling! YEA YEA YEA!!!  Another thingy is I realise I am lousy at steaming machine to iron my clothes as well cos I have a tough time mastering it at my buddy house.  Wish list for tomorrow is two additional lightings for my new TV console! That makes my room with 8 lightings altogether. My room is neat but packed with stuff! I must find a place to store my car exhaust...suspension...extractor...rear lights for ES and EK really taking up a bit of space man. And i think i should get rid one of my old golf set....basically my room is now packed with three cupboards, one wardrobe, one small plastic cupboard, one small wooden cupboard, one wooden display corner display console, one computer table and one queen size bed. Which is like making the walking space become very very very small.  Gonna get a web cam to take it down but of course when i do more packing!
