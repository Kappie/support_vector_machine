What really makes Tech Support difficult is the little stupid things that you experience with every call. A couple examples:  1 - You do NOT have to hit Apply before hitting OK. OK does the same thing as Apply, but it also closes the window. The only time you ever need to hit Apply is if you want to put the new settings into effect without closing the window. Almost every customer I talk to asks "Do you want me to hit Apply first?" when I ask them to hit OK. This isn't a problem localized to computer novices, either. Many of the people who do this have been using Windows operating systems for years.  2 - Computers are capable of multitasking, and shutting the computer down while programs are up isn't a bad thing unless you have unsaved data. If you have Internet Explorer open and I ask you to restart your computer, you do NOT need to shut down Internet Explorer first. This is another one that I get almost every call. Every time we go from one program or task to another, the customer asks "Should I close ________ first?" I've come close many times to saying "I don't give a damn. If I thought that needed to be closed, I'd have said so. Just do what I tell you to do!"  These kinds of things don't really cause problems with the computer, but they get extremely irritating, especially when they keep stacking up. Part of it is probably the fact that customers asking these types of questions are essentially second-guessing you, as if they assume you don't know what you're doing and need to be coached occasionally. This falls under the category of 'If you don't want my help/don't think I know what I'm doing, why did you call me?'. It's akin to asking a grocery store cashier "Remember, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies should go in their separate places in your cash drawer." People don't like being told by customers how to do their job. It's demeaning and insulting, and it doesn't make our job any more enjoyable.
