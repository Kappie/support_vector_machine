 I went to a shopping spree, i had to use my "sport coupons" somehow, bought a lot of shorts, t-shirts and even an elegant buttoned shirt. Some of them were  urlLink Speedo  branded, and apparently i was entitled to receive free Speedo sunglasses. 
 Fine, i will go with them. They are not very protecting, but they don't give me a headache and they are free. I give up.
