I didn't intend for it to be that way, but over the 18 months or so that I've had this particular desk, I've accumulated the following items (note: this list may include things that have only been there a little while, and the list may exclude items that are usually there, but are out for some reason:  1. One Stiga "Competition Line" ping pong paddle and receipt of purchase 2. One set of Koss headphones 3. One CD made by my friend, Dustin Andres, which he labeled "mostly electropop" 4. Eleven golf balls, various brands 5. One sixteen-ounce dixie cup, for spitting sunflower seeds 6. Three paper towels 7. Seven Paper Mate brand pencils, unsharpened 8. A tape dispenser with no tape in it 9. Two highlighter pens, one yellow, one pink 10. Expo brand whiteboard cleaner 11. Fifty or so business cards 12. Scissors 13. Six separate, partial pads of post-it notes 14. A sharpie 15. A rubber eraser 16. A metal fork, plastic knife, and a plastic spoon 17. The pass to the gym to which I don't have a membership anymore 18. A penny 19. The keys to the drawer
