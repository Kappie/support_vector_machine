Now I've been asked to do a feasibility study and estimate for a new ASP.Net project that's coming up. Lot of simple things are to be sorted out in this. Let me see how I do it. Couple of days is all I have.  AutoRickshaw meter reading is 10Rs, whenever I get down during my commute to office and back home. Today once it was 12.50Rs and once 11:00Rs. Wonder why incorrect meters always are defective on the +ve side and not -ve. I only managed to give 10 bucks to the rick guy, explaining him that the rick meter has an incorrect reading. And that was for the 2Kms commute - office to/from home.  My travel is still on hold status. No signs of which way its gonna turn. I may go back to Sydney or may not. I am fine either way on the outlook, but would prefer staying back here and wait for another opporunity.
