So, some of the newest Nokia phones are shaped pretty much like a taco.  Instead of holding the taco flat to your face to talk, which would seem normal, you hold the edge of the phone (AKA bottom of the taco) against your face to talk.  I thought I looked dorky with my Pocket PC Phone, but that just takes the cake.  Observe:
