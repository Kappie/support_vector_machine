IDC estimates that the  market share for Mac OS dropped to 3.1 percent in 2001 from 4.6 percent two years earlier . Windows, in contrast, has more than 90 percent market share. Certainly by...2005, possibly by the end of 2003, Linux will pass Mac OS as the No. 2 operating environment."

 I thought the above comment was the most interesting part of this article. I think it makes it clear Linux is displacing alternatives to Windows rather than Windows itself for the time being. Apple on the desktop and Solaris on the server.
