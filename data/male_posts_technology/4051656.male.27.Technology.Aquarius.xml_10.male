I use  urlLink Firefox  though, so that probably has something to do with it. I really don’t like this theme although I personally think it was the best one available. I might try out the picture collage one too. If I just can’t stand it anymore, I’ll make my own. I’m sure pretty much everything about JTFM will change eventually. Peace!
