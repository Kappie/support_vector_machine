But I think that's the only thing that most of us we have in common we are all pretty different people with totally different interests, it would be hard to imagine most of them as friends if we weren't working together.   Anyway we went to watch Pirates of the Caribbean, it was really good, although it had a little too much swordfighting for my tastes, but Jonny Depp was a riot , he's just so brilliant at playing this weird characters (remember Edward Scissorhands?). Oh and it had the really hot chick from Bend It Like Beckham , Knightley, i read in a review she was only 17 when they shot that movie; you know you are getting old when the new and upcoming stars that are emerging are all younger than you.
