You know what, considering it's probably going to be a couple of months before I buy another DVD, maybe I will take suggestions.  So far I have Superman, and Lord of the Rings: Two Towers Special Edition, and Up and Cummers #27.  What does everyone suggest?  Still, 67% of the ikea shelf is an assload more than I thought.  Last I checked, you had "Wet Hot American Summer" and "From Hell".  Oh, by the way, I've got a new gig as a movie reviewer on movie-vault.com.  I sent in a review of Mallrats, and six hours later, I had the job.  You can check out the site at www.movie-vault.com.  Or if you're just a lazy bastard, the link is on the right.
