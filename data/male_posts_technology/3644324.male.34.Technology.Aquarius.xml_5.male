So, I was sitting in a comfy chair on a hot soon-to-be-summer evening a little after 6pm. All around me people were running and falling and getting up and standing and sweating and drinking water and griping and running some more and throwing and catching and occasionally not catching. It all seemed rather complicated and no one could really explain the reasoning behind it to my satisfaction. After a while I just gave up trying to comprehend it and settled on talking to the cute girls that would wander over and sit beside me for a while. Then after a few hours half the people got up and walked to the other side of the field and started doing the same sorts of things but with a lot more yelling, and still more yelling, then a little bit of pushing and then everyone seemed to lose interest. Oh well, I enjoyed the sitting in the sun. Maybe next week I'll try some of that running and yelling and stuff.   And in conclusion, let's have some compliments, I've got some for each of you.   Cindy Chan:  you're game last night could be summed up by your signature line "throw me the disk bitch!" - nice job expecting the disk and then getting it, and then throwing it and then getting it again and then throwing it and... with your current rate of improved play you'll be playing in the Worlds by September.   Cindy Ong: you were exploiting the Cindy-Cindy connection last night. If we could get a third Cindy the three of you could play offence without the need for anyone else. Brilliant!!!   Lindsay: stellar cuts (even when egregiously looked off) plus wonderfully wanton display of schoolyard scorn - my hero   Lisa:  that play where you ran back into our endzone....and smacked the disk away....from that guy....in the first game....you know the guy who was trying to catch it....masterful   Mel:  is she a charismatic, up and coming, recording artist? Is she a scorned chauffeur? Is she a gazelle on the Ultimate field? Don't hurt yourself thinking about it, the answer to all three is a resounding YES!   Verlane: the back-to-back huge "D"'s in the first game, extraordiary - not bitch slapping the arrogant morons in the second game, priceless   Geoffrey Crofton: once again with the "A" game. Will the accolades and adoration of your team mates be enough to keep you here or will your desire to "get paid" lead you to sign the big contract elsewhere.   Geoffrey Loomer: highly under rated performance. Virtually error free Ultimate: no dropped disks, your check never scored, no disks thrown away, best plus-minus of all the men, you didn't even break a sweat. Possibly the best division 1 performance by any male Swarmer to date.   King: the gentlemen all greatly appreciated you sloppy seconds last night - that huck to Peter in the endzone almost made me cry....so beatiful, sniff, sniff   Paul: masterful throws up the sideline - genius. the play where you wiped out Peter and the two a__holes in the second game will live on in Swarm lore for days   Peter: catch in the endzone + another catch in the endzone + (well you get the point) + that one flick in a game situation - you got game now baby!!!   Roger: you are really starting to get the hang of this game, if only you'd learn to stick up for yourself... Brilliant game as always.
