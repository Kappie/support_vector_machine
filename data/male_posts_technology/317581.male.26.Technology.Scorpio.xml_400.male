Then I was like, ok, now I'll go upstairs and work on my NWN game, but now I'm listening to some classic 80's rock and I don't want to turn it off. So, I'm writing on my BLOG and thinking about travelling.  Today at lunch, one of the peeps that I work with started talking about NZ and europe and travelling in general and it stired my blood. There's just something about getting away for a few relaxing weeks and not having anything to think about. *sighs*  Anyway, I'm skipping church tonight cause I'm gonna go to bed earlier than it's going to get over with:( I'm gonna go when I don't have to wake up so early. AKA december  gnight
