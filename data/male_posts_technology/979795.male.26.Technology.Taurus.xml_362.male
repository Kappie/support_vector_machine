Looks like I'll be sleeping late tonight.  Tonight's Aikido was great. I took warmup again because Daniel and Darryl were late. But the good thing was that this time I was a lot more composed. My mind was quite empty and I'm pretty sure I took the warmup through the wrong order as well for some. No matter lah, the empty minded feeling I had just made everything feel OK.  We did a lot of iriminages. I managed to do some fairly decent ones tonight. Richard emphasised different way of feeling in iriminage tonight. I understood/felt some, but missed the rest.  I think I'll make it a point to grab different ukes/nages in future practices. Just to feel the techniques.
