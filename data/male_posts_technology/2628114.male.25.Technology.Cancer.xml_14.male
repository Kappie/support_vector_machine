This has cropped up recently since I have gotten those arch supports.  I had to stop and walk twice today after two treacherous hills where I was probably running faster than I should have been.  I finished the run with a 2-block pickup which really pushed my limits at the end of the run.  I start this week with a 2-block and continue next Friday with a 3-block, etc.  Other than that, I will be taking tomorrow off to rest and prepare for the 50 on Saturday.
