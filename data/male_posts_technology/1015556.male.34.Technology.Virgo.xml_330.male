Pray for these kids and leaders if you remember.                                          PS - As you can probably tell, these are linked via tripod.com.  I started using it a while ago to host very lightweight images, you get 20M free.  But I've had a really bad time of it... Sometimes my images show up, sometimes not.  In other words, if you have another place where you can host images, use that.  Comment if you've got another good place thats free.  Although, I readily realize that it could be just me... html is my friend.
