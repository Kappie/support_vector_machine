I think the new teacher is okay (but it's the first day, so I'll give him a break). Other news: Ms. Stoltz today got really ticked off in PE. In English, we are "Building Vocabulary for College." We are practicing our lip-sync in advisory (we are doing Funkytown). We had good sub-sandwiches today for lunch. I edited my website during recess, study-hall was boring as usual, and art was boring and sort of stupid. We are doing this "Lord of the Rings" project (which sounds fun, but isn't). It is after school and I am waiting for my mom to arrive and pick me up. My sister stayed home today. I have a dentist appointment after school. Well, I GTG (got to go) now. See ya later!
