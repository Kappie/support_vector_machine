       I am simply not a "morning person".  I never have been.  I hate waking up early, I'm not good at it, I don't like it.  Even with all the things I have to do before leaving for work in the morning, I still wake up as late as possible.  Falling asleep early is almost as imposible for me, but much less painfull!   Today I was tired all day at work.  I yawned 142 times in 2 hours.  I'm just kidding, but I did yawn a lot.  And something about the lights in that place is hurting my eyes.  I'm used to working in a dark environment, with only the glow of the monitor to keep me company.  This new office is well lit with lights that don't shine down on us, but shine up at the ceiling and bounce down an even light over everything.  It's very plesant for office lighting, but its still killing my eyes.   And speaking of killing my eyes: I drive home each day through a very very affluent neighborhood (which is probably bad for me because it puts ideas into my head).  There are always plenty of people walking, biking, and running along the streets.  Will someone please tell me why middle aged white men who jog insist on wearing the tiniest pair of shorts they can find?  They are like bikini-shorts.  And you know they don't wear this stuff at home, because their legs are brown but that unsightly expanse of hip they are showing is bone white.  And these guys always run like they're carying a load in the back of those shorts, which, in shorts like that, would be a hideous travesty.   Get these guys some zoobas.
