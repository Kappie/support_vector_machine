 I'm somewhere between not being afraid of these poor murderous idiots and feeling glad for Hadar, who doesn't have to take a bus to the University. 
 On a happier note, Amazon.co.uk  "dispatched"  my order of  urlLink Joy Division's "Heart and Soul" . Those funny brits, why do they have to say "dispatched" instead of "shipped"?
