Especialy the Chicken Red curry seems to be very very similar to the chicken curry my mom does.. Except for the additional vegetables which these guyzz add.. and Italian Pastas Sux..   So My list of cuisines I have tried in this week. 1. U.S style Indian cuisine. 2. Mexican. 3. Italian. 4. Thai. 5. Chinese. 6. American.
