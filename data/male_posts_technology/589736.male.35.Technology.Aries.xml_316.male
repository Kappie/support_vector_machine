SAN FRANCISCO, California (Reuters) -- Next time Microsoft Corp. employees have problems with their laptop computers, they will have to call Hewlett-Packard Co.   The world's largest software maker announced on Monday that Hewlett-Packard had won a contract to run the help desk for its 61,000 employees and contractors worldwide. That could include advice on how to use advanced features of Microsoft's own software.   The companies said the multiyear deal was worth tens of millions of dollars but declined to be more specific.   HP already had a contract to run the help desk for about 11,000 Microsoft employees outside the United States. The expanded deal extends HP's reach to North America and envisions some overhaul and automation of its help system.   HP is the No. 1 seller of personal computers running Microsoft's Windows operating system, and it also is beefing up its services arm. Outsourcing deals, such as the one with Microsoft, are a key growth area.    urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/industry/08/12/microsoft.hewlett.reut/index.html
