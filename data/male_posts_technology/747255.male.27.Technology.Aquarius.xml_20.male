It's on the TV right now and, frankly, I'd rather go to the nearest Karoke bar and listen to locals... even drunk locals sing songs they hardly know the words to.  Anyway. Something else that bothers me is fat people who used to be super-fat and dieted for a while and now think they're thin... even though they're still fat.  I'm done now.
