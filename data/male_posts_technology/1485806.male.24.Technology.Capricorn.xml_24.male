Battling through the forest of coffee aroma and the people sharing the same network and when all things have pass,  well i am all alone in the downloading stuff in the starbucks while waiting for my time in Cell..  Ha ...doing cell ice breakers....there is a lot of things that worried me and well after talking to Lee Fern and having her testimonies of even seeking for a job....blessed me a lot and i owed it all to Jesus...the keyword for me is obiedience and believe.  Even as Ps Au Yong...yes the older wan , preaching about the fear of the Lord, i believe that i need to regain that fear of the Lord by learning to trust Him and obey Him...even in prayer i must learn to pray like a dog and stop being a cat....confused? well that is another long story....  First i must get rid of the fear of men and insecurities that binds my life currently particularly the job and a place to stay... I must get right with God and some of you may suffer from me...endless talking and rough jokes is,  that i tends to be more of this way when i have stress....instead of sharing it out, i becomes more than i can be,...  So i want to ask forgiveness from all of you whom i have robbed the attention from you and hope that you will forgive me. I have gone through a lot particularly from the housemates, job seeking and the landlord.  So pray for me as i learned to pray for you guys as well...but hey I am still me ....Simply Me..
