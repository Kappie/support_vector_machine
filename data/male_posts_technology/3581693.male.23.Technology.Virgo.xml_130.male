Alone in my office space Trying to hold it in but it won't stop And now it quickens I'll need to wash myself again to hide away the stink and stain 'Cause I'd be scared that the scent is coming through Who are my real friends? Do they know I've got the runs? Am I really stinking that bad?  Baby's got the runs, oh no We better share this with our friends, no no no  Sitting near the lou with my diaper on Talking to my girlfriend shit it's going to happen I wish it was the eighties I wish I was a baby I wish, I wish, I wish that this didn't happen  Where does it go from here? I flush it down the toilet wash it from my legs And where is it now? Brought in the hose oh yeah A sponge and a scouring pad to wash it away To wash it all away  Baby's got the runs We better share this with our friends  Sitting near the lou with my diaper on Talking to my girlfriend shit it's going to happen I wish it was the eighties I wish I was a baby I wish, I wish, I wish that this didn't happen  I want to live, eat I want a regular digestive system I want to live, eat I want to poop freely at my own pace pace, pace, pace  Where does it go from here? The poop is coming out all weird Where are you now (toilet paper)? When I need you
