All you need to do is to enter into a photography  urlLink contest  run by BBC and the winner will get to act in the H2G2 movie.  BBC says,   we want you to send us a photograph of the place on Earth you think deserves to survive the planet's destruction: *Maybe there's a building that you think is awe-inspiring * It might be a breathtaking vista from the top of a mountain or bowl of a valley * Perhaps you have a picture of an animal in its natural habitat that blows you away * Or it might be a warning to other planets against pollution and over-industrialisation   So get your cameras out and go trigger-happy!! And do it fast… the deadline is 25th June 2004. :-)
