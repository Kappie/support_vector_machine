Weston and his bloody 'Only revise the beginning and the middle cos you don't have to do questions on the end' and then what happens, the whole friggin' lot is on the end. Dammit. Well, actually more than damn it, I am very upset and very peed off with history teachers right at this moment in time. DAMMIT DAMMIT DAMMIT DAMMIT DAMMIT. and a whoel load more of 4 letter words. you know, I actually opened the paper, saw the question and said "shit". I was that annoyed and upset. Reall pissed off. sorry to keep going on about, but I've worked so hard and it's all been ruined.  Other than that, It think maths was ok but it was definetly harder than the first paper, but that wasn't really a suprise to me cos I was expecting a hard ppaer, lol!  not looking forward to french tomorrow, but at least it's the last one, then I only have two more exams to go! yay! Plus it's my birthday on thursday so I get a nice relaxing day with no exams!" yay!
