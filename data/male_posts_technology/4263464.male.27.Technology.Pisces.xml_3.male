So a few co-workers and I were talking about good CDs we had. I then mentioned that I would like a copy of a co-worker's CD. The other 2 perked right up and asked if we had a burner in the office, which we do. I then spent about 4 hours ripping and burning 8 CDs and making 2 or 3 copies of each CD. Can a blog be used as evidence in a court of law? If so, may I mention that I'm a frequent liar, especially about gross acts of copyright infringement? :)  Anyway, I ended up with some good rap CDs I was mildly interested in (Nelly  50 Cent). I also ended up with some Godsmach CDs. I couldn't tell you what they sing, but all I know is that it kind of scares me. So I won't be listening to them. But I did score Coldplay and the Jets albums. I would like to recommend everyone getting those 2 albums (whether you prefer to pay or pirate is up to you). The Jets album stinking  rocks  from start to finish. Good stuff.  I just thought I'd let ya' know about my super productive day at work. I finished up the day playing a really weird but wildly entertaining  urlLink game  on the internet.  If you figure out how to maximize all the pieces, please let me know...it's driving me nuts!  Peace out.
