You know folks now if u search "hirdesh gupta" on google u will get my profile as the first link. This blog thing is really great and its making me so much popular.  Anyhow back to the topic.  So I found out that this quote was said by ouw own John Keats as "A thing of beauty is a joy forever; its loveliness increases; it will never pass into nothingness."  This gave me thought Do I still remeber the joy I get from a sight of beauty. Yes ! came as an answer, there are innumberable stuff I still remember.  I still remember the   twinkle of her eye,   I still remember the   dimple on her cheek,   I still remember the   dew on her hairs,   I still remember the   smile on her face,   I still remember the   warmth of her cozyness,   I still remember the   shrill of her voice,   I still remember the   depth of her thoughts,   I still remember the   height of her dreams,   I still remember the   aroma of her body,   I still remember the   scent of her attire,   I still remember the   shine of her earring,   I still remember the   glow of her skin,   I still remember the   pink of her lips,   I still remember those   sensuous curves,   I still remember those   seductive swells,   I still remember the   attitude in her turns,   I still remember the   touch of her hands,   I still remember the   angle of her smile,     I remember so much of her, does she still remember my name ?
