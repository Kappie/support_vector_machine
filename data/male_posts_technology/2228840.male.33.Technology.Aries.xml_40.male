Even though my days of bachelorhood are behind me, bits and pieces of the old lifestyle still manage to cling to me more tenaciously than cat hair on a pair of black pants. Even though I had the entire weekend to get it done, my laundry basket still sits in the corner of the bathroom like some multi-colored volcano photographed in mid-eruption.   I can't ignore it any longer. Not only is it clashing terribly with the girlfriend's  Guest Towels  and  Fancy Soaps , but I've completely run out of clothes for work! Sure, working in a warehouse means I don't have to don the old  Suit and Tie  everyday, but I'm not too eager to relive past nightmares by showing up wearing only a pair of boxers... Or was it briefs? Either way, if I don't get some laundry done tonight, I'll be forced to wear my  "nice pants"  (the ones my girlfriend bought me) and my faded  "Hard Rock Cafe: Los Angeles"  T-Shirt. The shirt should have been thrown out long ago, but men don't throw away clothes... That would be like abandoning a car on the side of the road... You just don't do it! As for the "nice pants", if I recall correctly, I believe I signed some sort of contract that forbids them being within 3 kilometers of the warehouse. So, laundry time it is...  Now, I  could  grab that laundry basket, separate the clothes into clever little piles like "colors", "darks", and "whites", but like I said, there are some parts of the bachelor lifestyle that never go away. If it wasn't already 11:30 at night, I'd probably just grab everything that wasn't  "white-ish"  and cram it into the machine (I find a broomstick is especially handy for "tamping" the articles into place), double the soap dosage, and let the Warm Wash / Cold Rinse cycle do its thing. Next, a nice full load of "white-ish" on Hot Wash / Cold Rinse and we're almost done. All that would remain is to stuff the freshly "washed" loads back into the laundry basket, where they would sit for a week until no iron on Earth could get the wrinkles out. But I haven't got time for  that  tried and true method...  Instead, I'll have to pick through the piles, find exactly what I want to wear tomorrow, and wash it, regardless of color. This is also a common method of mine, which probably goes a long way toward explaining my use of the word "white-ish"...  Anyway, then I'll have to sit up, probably posting something terribly boring to my blog like,  "Men and Their Laundry"  while I wait for the wash to finish. Once it goes in the dryer, I'm home free and can get back to the peaceful sleep I was enjoying before I was startled awake by the realization that I had no clothes to wear.  Here I go again...
