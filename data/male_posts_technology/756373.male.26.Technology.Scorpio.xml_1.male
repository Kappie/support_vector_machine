I'll post another 'horror story' of my own a bit later.  ---- Under the sea   Me and a group of friends went to the coast over a long weekend. Along on the trip came a hot 16 year old ( sister of a friend ). Things developed well between the two of us and on the Sat night 4 of us in the group decided to go for a midnight swim. We had been drinking a lot and it seemed like a brilliant plan. The moon was full, the water warm, and on the horizon was a pleasure cruiser, lit up like a Christmas tree. It could not have been more romantic.The other couple stayed on the beach, making out, and me and the babe went for a dip.   Pretty soon she decided she wanted to be a "mermaid" and she stripped down. Completely. Stark naked. It is a lovely picture to imagine, and imagine is exactly what I had to do, since I left my contact lenses back at the house! I could see nothing but a vague, sexy blur. Light and dark patches combining to tease my over active imagination. We chatted while splashing around in the waves. "You know", she said, "I have a problem." "What sort of problem?", I asked curiously. "I cannot say no to people", she replied.   Now, when a naked girl tells you that she cannot say no, it can mean only one thing. A more studly guy would have grabbed her right there and given her a night to remember. Sadly, I am not a studly guy, so I just panicked and nearly drowned. After inhaling half the ocean I made it back to dry land, where I discovered that the entire group ( nearly 12 people ) had come down to the beach to watch me score.   After a round of applause, a cold beer and some rather blunt advice, I was thrown back into the ocean. Here I couldn't find the girl again. Remember that I was not wearing contacts and was 80% blind at this stage. After much shouting back and forth ( and getting conflicting directions from the shore ), I finally asked her to keep talking till I get to her. Instead of talking, she started singing. Opera. Singing quite well too. The full moon above, waves splashing around me and a naked girl calling me to her like some siren out of Greek legend. This was surely one of the finest moments in my life.   When I finally reached her things were different. Seems that in the time I was gone, she has changed her mind about the situation. She splashed around like some flirting sea fairy, always one wave ahead of me, never letting me get too close, but still luring me on. After about 20 minutes of this, I gave up. I was too unfit ( and too drunk ), to catch her. So I went back to shore. She joined me there and we dried off and walked silently back to the house, hand in hand. We walked into the house and... I collapsed on a sofa and passed out.   I think it is time I quit drinking. ---
