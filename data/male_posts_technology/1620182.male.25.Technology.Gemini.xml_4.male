 Yeah, so it's been a while.  Don't think that I haven't wanted to get back to this.  I'm on the verge of taking my laptop to the emergency room tomorrow.  It won't even boot now.  It coughs and sputters, and just gives up.  To top off my computer woes, this computer crashed while downloading my pictures from the  urlLink Elph .  The Elph didn't like being caught in mid-transfer like that, so it deleted half of my pics just to spite me.  Don't worry, though.  I'll have my revenge.  In the meantime, you can believe that I'm going to be on the  urlLink Dell website  shopping for a cheap computer this week.
 
 There's so much to say right now.  The good news is that I'm no longer a slave to the evil  urlLink conference .  The bad news is that I'm out a ton of money.  The funny part is that I only lost about $50 gambling.  Vegas is just expensive as H-E double hockey stick.  Regardless, I'm going to need to cool my jets for a while...which leaves plenty of time to write to my adoring fan.
 
 So what have I been doing?  Let's see.  There was the conference,  urlLink night clubs ,  urlLink bars , gambling, old friends, new friends, Egyptians, books,  urlLink Blue Man Group , a  urlLink Tournament of Kings , the  urlLink Grand Canyon , shopping, and more books.  All in all, the trip was enough to stir more than my fair share of mixed emotions.  I'd love to write all about it right now, but my clock says it's almost 11:00p, my body says that it's almost 8:00p, and my mind is trying to get them to agree again.  So, alas, I am off to sleep.  Good night everybody!
