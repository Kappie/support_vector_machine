Hi, i'm Neil Cortez. I'm from Bacolod city but i am currently studying in Manila taking up BS Psychology (go psych!!!! Diba gems?).I'm a friend of gemma, keren, edmar, (and cousin) melissa.  Bout when i'm coming home, i'll be home by march 30 coz my brother is getting married here in manila on the 29th. Its gonna be quite busy coz my brother will still have a reception at bacolod pa on the 31st. Ok man ko di a. Kapoy lang kaayo kay i've been having "hell weeks" for about 2 weeks na. :p i dunno if you guys use it bout here it means weeks wherein you just have a lot of work to do and tests to answer and projects to pass and... i'm sure you get the picture. =)  Gems and ker, kumusta na kamo da ya? Still the same huh?  Lis, sori lang gid daw kabusy gid kaayo the last few weeks so wala gid ko kareply even by email. GInaprioritize ko lang subong mga emails ko pertaining to business matters (school, church). Hopefully enjoy ta sa summer a. Summer ta nga LO clan a!!! The best. HAHAHA!!!!  Ed, grabe nagid ni aton ya. Kit-anay na ta every week tapos diri pa gid. Sobra nagid ta kasweet ya! :P San-o gani ya graduation mo?  Bon, i don't really know you but hey, i could always get to know another friend. Congratulations!!!  Well, i'll have to end here. Got to make friends with shakespeare pa for my literature class. Take care you guys. God Bless.                                                                                                                       -Neil C.
