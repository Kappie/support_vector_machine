As I  urlLink talked about  with Noah, we started out the evening as uncredentialed outcasts - stuck on the wrong side of the riot-proof fencing, deafened by over-amped protesters and under-muffled diesel generators.  By the end of the evening, we had traded up our color-coded badges several times and were able to peer down on the convention floor from a lofty skybox inside the Fleet Center.   It's like a baseball game where you try to sneak into better and better seats as the game goes on.  The whole process is a little strange because it relies on exploiting connections and a good deal of guile.  (Neither of which are paradigms I'm particularly comfortable with).    But both led to us jumping a partition into an adjoining skybox which happened to contain Michael Moore.  There was a weird celebrity awkwardness as folks were struggling with their digicams to snap souvenir photos.    But we ended up having a real conversation about blogs, Google and the terrible state of copyright.  Michael Moore is a clueful dude.  And hungry ... which I can appreciate.  The one completely genuine moment of the evening was Barack Obama's  urlLink speech .  The man gave me chills.  In terms of what public service should mean, Obama nailed it when he said "If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription and having to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it's not my grandparent."  That the poverty of others can make all of our lives poorer goes right to heart of the problems government is meant to address.  (For what it's worth, the least genuine moment of the day was dancing to Come on Eileen at a convention after party.  Apparently, I'm going to be awkwardly dancing to that song for the rest of my life.)
