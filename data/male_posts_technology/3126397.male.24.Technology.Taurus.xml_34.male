Next, an article about  urlLink tweaking everyones favorite web browser  ( urlLink Firefox  in case you forgot).     And finally, an  urlLink atricle about the groovy new software development platform  called Mono which is being developed as a compatible alternative to Microsoft's .NET platform. As far as I can tell, Mono will play a MAJOR role in widespread Linux adoption on the desktop in the future. I have already tried out the Rapid Application Development platform  urlLink SharpDevelop    which is a GPL'ed IDE for .NET, and Mono.  It was pretty snazzy.   I'm headed off to observe the Wild Reuter in his natural environment, so if I never post again, look for my mutilated corpse in New Meadows....
