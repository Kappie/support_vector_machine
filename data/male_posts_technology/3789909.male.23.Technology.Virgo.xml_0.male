I mean, do you not have anything better to do than to surf around and read peoples thoughts that they put on the internet?    Of course, I must question why I am even doing this.  Let's just say it's an experiment.  An experiment in how long I actually post here, and what I post.  Don't expect me to come and lay all my sad, teary-eyed stories of failed loves and hardships in life.  I can never understand why people do that.  You are putting yourself up for an uncaring, unknown audience.  Heck, that's even worse than acting in a movie.  Someone could come up and tell you that you did a bad job in a movie, but any anonymous moron could say that your blog is a pile.    Ah well, enough ranting for now.
