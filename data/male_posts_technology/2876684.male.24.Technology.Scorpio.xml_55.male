If you're reading this and know him or someone who does, please pass the information along, his mom is definitely in need of some emotional support right now.  And as for you big fellow, we've had our share of good times and bad times together - I just never expected that seeing you in Sydney a couple of weeks ago would be the last time I'd see you... Rest in peace brother.
