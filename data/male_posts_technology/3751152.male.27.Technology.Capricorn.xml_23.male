Instead of writing letters to the editor, we're told that we can reach a greater audience through our blogs, where the whole world can come to our pulpit and listen to us espouse our views, personality, etc.  There are many, many problems with this:  1. The majority of people online don't have personalities. This community does, thank god, but how many blogs have you read where it's 'i went to school and she was like 'omg, look at u, she's usch a b!tch!''. An infestation of 14 year olds; the only cure, to go back in time and castrate their fathers, if they even know who their fathers are.  2. On the odd chance that someone DOES have a personality, it's most likely a female. Thus, the readership of the blog is all men, desperate men who will wax poetically about how great the blogger is for the sole purpose of getting into her pants. I've seen this happen more then once. The supposed great thing about blogging is that you can learn a lot about a person from what they write. Unfortunately, it usually degrades into "Whoa, she's hot, I'm going to read her blog!"    3. The other sect of common bloggers are nerds. Nerds who will blog about their favorite Star Trek: Voyager episode or posting pictures of their new computer case mod. You know the type. "Smarter" then everyone else, everyone else is a fool, everyone else is ignoring the obvious, everyone else should just do what I say and then everything will be ok. They are also found hanging around #2 blogs, not to mention their parents basement.  4. Political blogs are the worst. There is no grey. There are "Democraps" and "Republi-Cons". Attempting to determine meaning from these blogs is pointless. You're better off reading the hot girls blogs for all of the 'information' you're going to get.  5. Bloggers have nasty, nasty habits of regurgitating other blogs. Just like email chain letters that get sent around, communities of bloggers pop up parroting the same old information that appears on everyone elses blog. Instead of individual thought and expression, we get "SO and SO posted this on his blog, *Copy and paste*". In an attmept to be more popular, we mimic those that we want to get attention from. A lot like high school really. I always wanted to be the head cheerleader :(  At any rate, this blog is different. We all come from different backgrounds, countries, ideals and the only thing that binds us is a little thing we like to call TCZ. This forum is open to everyone, the high school girls, the snooty computer nerds, the pseudo-political-intellectuals and thus, if there was ever a blog that you should read, this should be it.  *cross-posted to Adam Online, LiveJournal, DeadJournal because that's what computer nerds do.
