Domain Owners:  InteractionArchitect.com - a small consulting group in Belgium by the same name InteractionArchitect.org - digitalmoron Interactionarchitect.net - digitalmoron    In the day-and-age of "better have a Web site, too"-ness (okay I made that up), you'd think that would be one of the things you'd check before saying, "let's be this!"
