Needless to say he is a fucking mess.    Regardless, I was giving him a really hard time about some things.   Sometimes I think he is a very difficult person to be friends with.  In going on 7 years of friendship, 4 years living as roommates, I can count the number of times we have done something social that I suggested on one hand, probably less.   The most recent incarnation of his unwillingness was a Biscuits show in Philly, that I thought we should go to.  His response was "get my other friend to go, then I'll come".    I was pretty pissed.  I suppose that this is just his way of saying that I didn't want to go, but it was pretty tactless to say it this way.    I was giving him some grief for this,  and I feel some regret for doing so.  I know that I needed to talk to him about this, but I don't think that this was the right time, nor place.  As mentioned previously, he is probably more then a little emotionally unstable right now, and Phish breaking up certainly doesn't help.  Sometimes frienship is knowing when you need to fall on the grenade, so to speak.   That being said I don't feel too bad.  I needed to get it off of my chest, and talking about it is the only way I'll be able to continue being friends with him.   Anyway life is pretty decent here.  Spending some much desired time with CW, after 2 weekends of being away.  Think I'm going to be buying a couch some time soon.
