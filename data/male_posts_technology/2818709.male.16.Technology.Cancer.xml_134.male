I bought an item from him on the 20th, and he still hasnt SHIPPED IT YET. I paid him the minute after i won it. But noooo. I've sent him like 3 emails...all basically saying "Where's my game?". I bought The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition for gamecube. For those non-cool people out there, it has: Legend of Zelda, Legend of Zelda II, Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. Is that cool, or is that cool?!??!?!? MAJORA'S MASK. I dont know why the fsck I sold it! It was an awesome game!!!! I guess I just was a dumbass or something. Damn, i'm a nintendo fanboy.   [Hey, listen!]
