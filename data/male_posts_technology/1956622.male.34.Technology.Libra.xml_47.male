In fact today she did not talk much instead she sang to daddy on the phone which was nice and I think she would be happy singing to daddy all night long if I let her.  However, she had to go play in the water so I let her go.  Then the fun started.  My attorney e-mailed me and stated that she was now agreeing to the visitation but not allowing me to keep the child support.  This of course prompted a call on my part to   SFW  .  So   SFW   says well my attorney says I don't have to agree to let you keep the child support and I said your right but I am only asking because Karissa will be here and I need that money to support her and to show her a good time.  So then   SFW   says I just want this to be civil again!  I said you know I don't think this was ever civil starting from the time you snatched Karissa up and left in the middle of the night not allowing me to even tell her goodbye.  So from there things just went down hill.    SFW   says you said you were going to file contempt against me so are you still doing that?  I of course said yes as she has the paperwork she has just not been officially served!  That is when the well you won't give me a break and help me out why should I help you?  Essentially if I drop the charges then She will let me have the money to show Karissa a good time while she is here.   At that point I informed   SFW   you have everything why should I give in I have nothing I get nothing I am supposed to pay for everything and you and your attorney think I am made of money and I am not so fine keep the money I don't give a damn.  She says well if I am going to possibly lose my daughter over this why should I help you out.  I told her she called my house barking orders at me and that I was not going to be treated like the boys' fathers and when I told her a month ago I was filing because I can sit back and let you treat me that way or I can fight I was serious.  I told   SFW   a long time ago this year had changes in it and when I say I will do it I mean it so she could have stayed here and worked things out but she did not so she gets to find things out the hard way.    SFW   wants to keep telling me how I did not do anything for the past 8 years and I was like well I told you water under the bridge and you can keep living in the past but I plan on making you accountable for what you have done.  She says I will stand in court and tell the judge exactly why I have done things the way I have.  So I said well you better make sure what you tell is the truth because I guarantee you that if you lie I will probably know it and I will have your ass for perjury as well.    The problem I have with all this is that she is probably right.  I am a man and the system works against me.  The chances that the court will do anything for me are slim.  It is OK for her to break the law and lie her way through this process but I get shafted.  So I hang up with her and then no more then 5 minutes later I get a call from the IRS.  Of course after a heated discussion with them (I was already in a confrontational state anyway) I get told I owe the IRS 2K and they have payment programs but I have to have my wife sign it with me.  Great so now I get to call   SFW   back!  So I call her back and start to tell her about what is going on and she basically says well I am not sure what you want me to say.  You did the taxes it is your fault so you can pay them.  Then she has the gall to ask me about my grandfather who is counting his days with his fight with cancer.  She actually says are you OK?  I was like am I OK let me see we have had the conversation we had plus the conversation with the IRS and that does not count the fact that yesterday I was told they did not have enough escrow for the house and now I owe 500 extra dollars payable immediately.    Needless to say I was ready to go off the deep end.    Well the only high point was I got to talk to Karissa again and tell her good night as she was eating ice cream and my neighbor came over and ivited me over to his cook out where I had steaks and other fine grub.
