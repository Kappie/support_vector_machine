The clinician (nurse, whatever) called this afternoon and gave us a prescription for 5 mg (a very small dosage) of  urlLink Lamictal , (lamotrigine) which, according to that link, is used for "partial seizures", though we've not heard directly from the doctor whether this has been determined to be a partial or a Tonic-Clonic.  We're going in next week to talk to him, and will know more at that time.  In the meantime, we're just doing homework to ensure that we ask the right questions, and taking care of Kristen, which consists of making sure that she gets back the sleep that she lost last night studying for the test.
