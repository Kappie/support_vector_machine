Or, and it is a distinct possibility that the next job offer I might not be in a position to turn down!  I could be being paranoid but I have a feeling that the job offer has strings attached or even worse a hidden agenda, i.e. being set-up to fail. I wouldn’t mind but two previous offers of new roles appear to have fallen though. I would have liked either of those and I’m starting to worry that I’m being ‘manoeuvred’ out on my arse! (I had set my little heart on doing the either a web type development role, or the team leader of our software environment team).  Looks like I might have to start looking else where for a job! Probably get better paid to, as the I.T. industry has never rewarded loyalty! – I didn’t even get a bonus in my last role even though Testing delivered more than its contracted through put.   Isn’t life a bummer sometimes?
