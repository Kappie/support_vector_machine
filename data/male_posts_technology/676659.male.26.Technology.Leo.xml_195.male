I learned a lot from the topic of Ptr. Johny  AchI Len very much! :D How are you doing now? :)  Correct me if I'm wrong but, Melissa has been busy doing some things (i.e., ko tiam), Bon is probably in Cebu reviewing for ECE licensure exam (not sure), Gemma is well ... not blogging! hehe :) Neil, on the other hand, is back here in Bacolod busy mingling with his friends! ;)
