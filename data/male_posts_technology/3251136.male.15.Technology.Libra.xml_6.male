As i can see,the numbers of online games are increasing vastly in da past few months...most of them cant realli stay long..some indeed managed to expand wif great number of players on9..one good example is da ragnarok online game or better known as RO.  Ragnarok Online(RO) is da 1st malaysia on9 game..b4 dat it was redi inroduced in Taiwan and Korea..blah..wat m i introducing and advertising ro for?anyway,dis game is one of my favourite games to fulfill my past time esp when i got ntg to do or i m jux too bored,sitting at home during holidays.  Wat makes RO so interesting and players are so willing to pay to play dis game?hmm... i started playing dis game since last year..my fren introduced it to me...dat time it was free..so i thought its alrite to play durin weekends or watsoever..until i started playing,i guess i'm addicted to it..its actually a very fun game,though it was far away from reality..  This game offers characters of different professions wif da aim to lvl up from lvl 1 until da highest lvl 99,which is strongest among all..wif quite a wide range of professions to choose from: mage:to cast spells,swordman:to be da main attcker,acolyte:main supporter and so on....  Dis game also offers trading and buying good system using da ZENY currency,which is pure crap....so it actually teaches young players to learn to do business trough a merchant character..of cox sumtimes,stupid young inexperienced players got cheater by pro hackers and cheaters like me...heh..  Until they introduce da p2p or pay to play sytem...where players hav to start buying expensive reload cards to play dat game..it came accross sum ppl's mind to make money on9..how?ppl started sell zeny fer real $$$rm....1million zeny fer rm7...wat do u think of dis?absolutely crazy rite?real money fer false money!!anyway cant realli blame them...they're jux too stupid to think..  anyway..i m still playing ro until now...although i did stopped at da beginning of dis year, i took up da game again...so,any1 dat plays ro here can alwayz msg me...we go lvl up together n kill mvp ya?hahahaah....
