I did an intense 20 minute climb on the stairclimber that left my legs screaming like a scared, little girl and me with the realization I should probably relax today since I've been going pretty hard in past week.  I set the machine on the strength/speed setting at just about the highest difficulty level.  Throughout the workout, my body was going through ache checks of each part of my leg.  Despite the screaming, my legs felt good and my kneed continues to feel normal (which is a good thing).  I haven't tried any hill training with running, but I am pretty sure that it won't be that bad now that I have experienced consistent workouts on the stairclimber.  Bring on the hilly treachery that is Eden Park!
