I kept writing other things though. Maybe I write too much! It my Blog though, so I can ruin it if I want!   Anyway, I think two tables might be the wrong thing for me. I am the guy in the supermarket that gets pissed if you cut in the deli line, even if the line is not well defined. I am the guy who thinks it is extremely rude to drive 65 in the breakdown lane even if it is open. I do not like to make people wait. So, two tabling makes me tense! I am looking at my one table and suddenly the second table blinks. I have to get back there! I am holding people up! What a rude bastard I am! Then my first table starts blinking again! Arg! What to do! I am getting dizzy. Might as well bet my 6 high when there is a flush on the board. No time to look. Cannot think! Down $40 real quick!! Seacreast Out! Am I the only one who gets a bad headache when two tabling?
