"My dad is a french international banker. He fell in love with my mother on a vacation to Sicily.  They had a passionate love affair and I am named after him. They had to remain apart mostly until I was 5 when he brought us to live with him in the US."  So that's Pierre's story...  I guess that's good cause I hear french people are stuck up, but in my opinion it was the Spaniards that were the one's that were stuck up....
