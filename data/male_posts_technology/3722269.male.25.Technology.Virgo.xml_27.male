Every day, the exact same scene, unfolding with an eerie repetition. Every day the exact same movie playing over and over in my head. Every day, wishing that I wasn’t part of that movie. Every day wishing that it wasn’t my movie. Every day wishing that it wasn’t my life. My life. Mine. That was a joke.   What part of it was mine? It was his. His life. Not mine. Every day it was his. Every day.   Every day, I manage to forget somehow, for a while, the hold he has on my life… precious minutes where my mind is free. Where I am free. Free. Free that is, until I round that final corner, and realize once more, that in no time at all I will be there, that just like every other day I will have to put up with it. It never seemed fair. As I life my key to the door, and turn slowly, the fleeting hope that today might be different is carried away by the thick scent of strong spices. He was cooking again. He always did. Always. To me that simple act of turning the key didn’t just open my door, every day. To me, turning the key was like the beginning, because every day, this is how it started.  Through the widening gap in the door, as I enter, I see him, the same as always, tall.. lanky.. standing in the kitchen, the weak afternoon sun making him seem like a shadow. I thought to myself, that he was a shadow. Just a shadow. A shadow on my life. Maybe I could walk quickly to my room, and find salvation, find escape on the end the telephone. Everyday I hope for that escape. Every day I am denied it.  "I'm so glad your home, come wash your hands and sit down. I made your favourite dish today."  Sighing didn’t help, but was part of the routine. Part of my routine.. no, part of his routine. It was all him. Like always, there was no escape. Like always I would mask it with a smile. Endure. Always. Forever. With an oblivious smile there was now, like there always was, every day, an offer to feed me. Feed me. Me! I certainly wasn’t a baby, I didn’t need to be fed. It made me resent the whole thing more. Resent him more.   "I'm a big girl now grandpa, I know how to feed myself."  Sometimes I wondered if he just said it to annoy me. Belittle me. Giving me a little smile after he offered. It could never be over soon enough, I always ate as quickly as I could, I’d learnt that. Eat quickly, leave quickly. It just made sense. Every day. Eat quickly, leave quickly. Today was no different. Today was never any different. Ever. The small talk always slowed me down. He always asked. I always gave the shortest answer possible. He never got the hint. The next day he’d ask again anyway. It all seemed so pointless. A waste of effort. Every day. Every day, except for the weekend. The weekend was my bastion of salvation, my calm between storms. The closest thing I had to –my- time. But even then, as if he didn’t get the hint. He would be there. Whenever he could. As close as he could. Always asking me questions, trying to make conversation. Every day. Always. Inescapable. I didn’t want to talk to him. I never wanted to talk to him. I wanted time alone. Space. Space and time to myself. Freedom. He was always there.. a choking presence, an awkward obligation. Always.  It was bad enough around the house, but whenever we needed to go out, to go shopping, it was worse. Humiliating. He would always try and hold my hand, no matter how many times I would try to avoid it. Every time. Always the same. Repetition. Never a break. He would never let it rest.  Something woke me. I sat up, it wasn’t even two thirty in the morning. I heard loud noises. Sirens. I got up and turned the lights on. I walked out of my bedroom, and saw people in my house. People dressed in white. Almost like ghosts. Beyond them, my Grandfather   on a horrible narrow bed, being wheeled out of the lounge. Who were they? Where were they taking him? I screamed out. I pleaded. Tell me! Where are you taking him? I found myself being wrapped in a blanket as I followed Grandpa, amongst all these people, out to a white van. An Ambulance. The realisation started to sink in.  Everything is so plain, so cold, so.. numb inside an ambulance. I shook him and tried talking to him, but he wouldn't answer, his eyes were only half open. Mine were half closed, and filled with tears. He couldn’t hear me. He didn’t hear me, he wouldn’t hear me. Grandpa, why won’t you listen to me? Why wont you wake up? Wake up and be ok Grandpa. Please. Please.  He had had a massive heart attack. The nurse told me it would be ok, and tried to hug me. I wanted him to hug me. How was everything going to be ok? Everything wasn’t ok. Nothing was ok. Nothing.  Few hours later, I was in a room with him. He was sleeping. I heard the doctor and nurse said he doesn't have long. I knew what they were talking about. I reached my hand out, and held my grandpa's hand. "I'm hungry grandpa.. Please don't leave me." he didn't listen to me, just like I never listened to him, and he left. He left me. Just like I’d always wished he would. I regretted it. How could I have ever wanted him to leave? I didn’t want him to leave. Grandpa, stay. You have to. He didn’t. He wasn’t. He left.  No one cooks me fresh food anymore. No one asks to feed me. No one shows me off anymore. It's all gone.  Those precious moments in my life have are all I have left of Grandpa. The shadow that hangs over me now, isn’t his, it is my shadow, my realisation that the smiles meant he loved me. The cooking meant he loved me. Everything he ever did, meant he loved me. Everything. Every day. For me.  Five years. Five short years. A fraction of my life that I can never get back.  I try to replay the days, as they used to be, over and over in my mind as I realise that the burden I bare, is that I never realised, that it was never a burden at all. Ever.
