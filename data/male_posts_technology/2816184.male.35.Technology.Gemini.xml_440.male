Swear to God I am Dropped here from another planet You know I don't belong And I want to go home Can anybody help me find my way? Will I ever find my home? Is there a handbook I should have read? Instructions I didn't get? 'Cause sometimes this place just makes no sense Is it all some big experiment? Why don't I fit in? Am I not one of them? Am I an Alien? Swear to God I am Dropped here from another planet You know I don't belong And I want to go home Can anybody help me find my way? Do you ever feel sometimes, like a stranger in your own life A million miles from what you see An alien just like me?  - Kim Stockwood
