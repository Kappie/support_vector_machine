Lock your door 

Zip up your jacket 

Take your vitamins 

Pull into your shell 

Load your gun 

Put on your sunscreen 

Arrest your terrorists 

Check your engine 

Pay your insurance 

Pop the pill 

Censor your media 

Cool your reactor 

Put on your life vest 

Buckle your seat belt 

Sterilize your tools 

Pray to your god 

Sign your contract 

Set your alarm 

But open your heart and mind 

Love is its own protection
