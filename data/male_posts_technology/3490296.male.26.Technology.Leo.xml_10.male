They have e learning too but i probably prefer the primitive class room environment. Just now, Inventis called me with regards to a job application i applied on 17th May. Its kinda 3 weeks ago and they probably did not manage to find the appropriate ones. In other words, i might be their last resort.   I have been repeating Somebody since 1pm. The strange thing is, i did not grow tired of it. Neither did i grow bored.. Am i really in serious deep shit now? Coz' i felt really in love.. Nevertheless, no matter, i have to go away..   Going for her is definitely not an option. I can't be selfish to make her accept me. Neither should i be pestering her when her heart is with somebody. Right now, she is still msging me thru ICQ.. Although its crappy, i smiled.. Somehow, she might be that person.. Or am i hallucinating? Maybe.. Time will tell.  Hap, wish me luck? :)  Misses you..if you know.  DJ
