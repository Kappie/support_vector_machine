But, my point is, when only 4 or 5 are intersted in sharing such information with everyone while the other people remain passive, it provides no boost to people like me to put up something... atleast, people must let know they enjoy certain things. We can't go on assuming everything and keep posting when there is no reciprocation from the other side...  Reciprocity is a very vital factor... as a STS ganesh will know better about that...
