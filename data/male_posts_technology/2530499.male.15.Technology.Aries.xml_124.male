They're sending me 25 CD's, and the other 24 are everyone's. Feel free to: -Upload them to Kazaa Lite K++ -Rip/burn more CD's -Keep all the songs to yourself DO NOT: -Use it as a coaster (THAT'S FOR AOL CD'S!) -Use it as a frisbee (THAT'S FOR AOL CD'S!) -Not use the damn CD (THAT'S FOR AOL CD'S!)  I stress: THIS IS NOT AN AOL CD! IT'S SOME GREAT TRACKS FROM A GREAT INDIE BAND!!  Maybe I'll post a song of theirs on PTH. The...real one.
