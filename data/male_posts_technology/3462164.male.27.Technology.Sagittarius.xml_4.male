I'm thinking right now of Robbie Lawler vs. Nick Diaz, in which Diaz upsetted Lawler with a devastating lead hook.  If you view the fight in its entirety, you'll see that both fighters did one thing that leaves you exposed for a damaging blow if your opponent has any real boxing talent.  They pawed with their jab.  This horrible habit is a common one amongst boxers, kickboxers, and MMA fighters alike.    Pawing with the jab is only a small step better than leaving your lead hand dangling at your thighs.  You are basically just reaching out and touching your opponent when you could be sticking a decisive and intimidating jab in their face.  If you can touch him, you can hit him, and I'd rather hit my opponent than give him a nice little love tap.  Sticking your jab with conviction does a number of things.  It frustrates your opponent, ruins his rhythm, temporarily shocks or possibly even stuns him, if you use it properly it can blur his vision, and all of these lead to the most useful result -- it sets up your remaining arsenal.  From the jab you can drop right hands, hook, throw uppercuts, kicks, elbows, knees, or you can shoot in and slam.  However, if you paw with the jab it does nothing to his rhythm, it doesn't hurt him, and it doesn't take away his vision.  If anything, you are welcoming him in to put you on your back.  You are giving him your lead hand and saying, "I can't do anything with this...so here have it."  So the next time you find yourself on your feet in the proving grounds, be sure to STICK your jab with bad intentions.  Jab through him, and try to make his head into a pez dispenser.  It could be a matter of win or loss, champ or chump, life or death.
