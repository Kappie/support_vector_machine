The computer code can be used by a remote attacker to trigger a buffer overrun vulnerability in the Local Security Authority Subsystem (LSASS), according to a message posted to www.k-otik.com. Microsoft released a patch for the LSASS vulnerability, MS04-011, on April 13, along with fixes for the SSL problem and a number of other vulnerabilities (see story). "
