And for all the snazzy offerings, Jobs didn't talk much about the segment that matters most for the bottom line -- high-end PowerMacs aimed at graphics professionals. He was also mum about Apple's plans in the education market, where the company has been struggling of late."

 Apple is adding all these additional areas to the Mac offering for one reason.  Steve Jobs is a control freak . It's that simple. He doesn't want anyone else touching his baby. Why do you think he killed the mac-compatibles when he came back as CEO in the late 90's? The good thing about a  dictator  is you can can come up with some pretty  cool designs  when you control everything from the hardware to the OS  to applications and peripherals. However, this is just bad business in the computer industry as you diminish all third-party vendors who can add value to the Mac platform and allow it to grow. Steve is the only one who is aloud to do that. It is Steve's selfishness that hurts Apple in the long run. To bad the "Mac Faithful" is too blinded by his "charm" and annual keynotes to see that.
