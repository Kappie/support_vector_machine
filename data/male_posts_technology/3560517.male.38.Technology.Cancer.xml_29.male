According to the law, he is supposed to give up salary for each day he misses.  Not to mention, at the prodding of the media, Bob Dole stepped down from the senate, in June of 1996, when he ran for president.  Apparently, the media doesn't hold Kerry to the same standard.  Kevin    Kerry's absences      A Hofstra University Law School student wants to see Democratic presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry return most of his Senate salary for the past two years to cover the days he has been absent campaigning.      Law student Johnathan M. Stein, 28, filed a complaint against Mr. Kerry of Massachusetts for cashing the pay checks and Senate Secretary Emily J. Reynolds for not deducting pay for his absences.      "I learned about the issue by accident," Mr. Stein said.      "Mrs. Reynolds has knowingly and willfully" violated section 2 paragraph 39 of the U.S. Code by giving Mr. Kerry his salary without deducting daily wages for each day that he has been absent from the Senate, Mr. Stein said.      Mr. Kerry began his day in New Jersey facing questions from reporters about Massachusetts Republican Gov. Mitt Romney's request that the senator resign his seat so the governor could appoint someone with the time to fill it.      "It's not fair, it's not right, and the public is not being well-served," said Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey.      She said Mr. Kerry has missed 64 percent of roll call votes last year and 87 percent this year.      Mr. Kerry refused to resign, saying: "I believe I am serving the citizens of Massachusetts and the country in the proposal I've laid out about health care for all Americans, which George Bush has not, to balance the budget, to be fiscally responsible."
