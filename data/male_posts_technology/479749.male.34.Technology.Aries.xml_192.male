Keep in mind the company I work for owns the largest ebook collection in the world. So far it's been just OK (screen size sucks) but the book has given me that culture shock as a reader that comes from only the best science fiction. Last time this happened was with  urlLink  Futureland   by Walter Mosley.  Comics:  urlLink  Bite Club   has been a fun read with its vampires meets the  urlLink Sopranos  in  urlLink Miami Vice  (or  urlLink Vice City  for those who aren't kids from the 80's) I loved the first cover they did.    urlLink Kiss Kiss Bang Bang  : I'm a sucker for anything  urlLink Bond  or spy related and this has been par for the course. However I noticed that it wasn't listed past issue 6 so it doesn't look like CrossGen is going to keep the title going.  Tunes stuck in my head: Switchfoot's  urlLink Meant to Live    Nina Simone's Feeling Good as heard in the new  urlLink Six Feet Under  preview  Hoobastank's  urlLink The Reason   A Perfect Circle's  urlLink The Outsider   TV:  urlLink The Saint  is on  urlLink BBC America  everyday! The fact I'm excited by this hints to the state of TV right now.   Movies: I really want to see  urlLink Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow ..NOW!  I hope to sneak out this weekend while in Clevland for my sister in law's birthday party and see  urlLink Robot Stories  at  urlLink Cleveland Cinematheque
