I didn't make my 40 minutes on cardio like i had said, but did 35 so that's pretty close.  And I did the circuit as well, and my muscles are nicely exhausted now.  I tried not to go too hard and make myself in pain tomorrow...we'll see.  I did get a very good stretch in, so that's good.  We had our national election today, and I guess I'm happy with the results.  The party I did NOT want to win didn't; the Conservatives winning the election here would have been tantamount to electing a puppet for bush only one more dangerous to Canada's way of life.   I feel Canada does need a change in government, however, so I was a little dissappointed that the Liberals won.  The good thing is that it was a Liberal minority, so the checks and balances that our system of government is supposed to offer by nature will actually be there.  Unlike our provincial government which has such a huge majority they've become like dictators.    Although I don't disagree too much with the provincial Liberals goals, their methods seem counter productive to me.  I quite strongly believe that cutting social programs, arts and education to balance the budget makes for short term gain but long term hurt.  If you remove the future, the safety net, and the entertainment from a society you have not much left but a mad scramble for the crumbs dropped our way, and no way for people to forget about it or things to look forward to.  In the near term we may have a strong provincial economy, but ten years from now we will be royally fooged.  We will have a half assed american style education system churning out automatons with no skills or abilities, we will have huge burdens on the already stressed health care system, and we will have no way for people in trouble to get out of trouble.  Not that we ever really had an effective example of that last one there.  But there should be ways to creatively solve some of the problems present in our province now, without slashing and burning the shit out of everything.    Ah well...in the end I am no politician, and don't really have a corner on the knowledge market as far as the subtleties of how our province is run.  Shit I can't even balance my own budget...heh.  Tomorrow I go to the gym again...tonight i eat chips. :D
