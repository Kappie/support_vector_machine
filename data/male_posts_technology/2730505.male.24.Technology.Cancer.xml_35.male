Constant dribbling, the interactions between the opposing teams, the defense, the offense, the flashiness, the streetball moves that makes the other player look ridiculous.  It's definitely more entertaining than watching any of the other sports as a whole.  There's always something going on.  Dribbling, the passing, the man-to-man defense, the cuts, the back door screens, the alley-oops, no look passes, behind the back cross-over dribble, the shake-n-bake, the intensity of the defensive player trying to stop the player with the ball, how that person is on the other person like stink on shit, the explosive first step, the dunks, the leaping ability, the eye to eye communication that has to happen, all those things and the possibility of all those things happening make basketball a very entertaining game to watch from start to finish.  the list would go (basketball, baseball, football, golf, soccer, hockey)  I don't understand hockey that is why it's last.  Plus it's on skates, and you can't really explode the way a basketball player can and just blow by the opponent.  I would assume that I could appreciate it better if I knew how it was played but since I don't, I don't.  And that damn icing rule, that is just retarded, it stops the flow of the play.  yeah it's hard to catch a "transition" game in basketball to be played the whole time and there are fouls that do interrupt the flow of the game but it's still exciting.  I do like how the fighting is allowed and people just beat the shit out of each other, that seems fun to watch.  I like to play basketball and soccer but if I was by myself, Golf is great, it's just you VS. you and that could be intense.  I think that everyone wants to bether themselves and there's no other competition that you need except your self.  You always want to beat that great game that you had and beat that and no one depends on you and you don't depend on any one.  you are in control and that's fun.  How's that for not too serious?
