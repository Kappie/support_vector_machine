Hope I can keep the breath till I reach the shore..  Yes... I am nearing the end of code completion for my filesystem implementation for MySQL.  After that its all testing, Bugfixing, Some Performance improvements which I have planned to do.. These activities might again push me into the sea.. I hope they don't do that..  I am also planning to do performance comparison with Oracle in the Backup mode.. I am confident that my implementation shows better results compared to oracle..   I hope I do one more round of swimming when I make this file system cluster enabled.. But I donno whether my sponsorers will allow me to do that...
