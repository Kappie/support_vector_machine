Lately I have not been patient and take things too fast rather than to wait for God's timing. I echoed and relate to the ramblings from  urlLink IreneQ  In her postings of Waiting...waiting...  For now ..I want to surrender  to God...and like someone in the blog said ...that you have to be completely surrendered to God...and it also echoed in the bible..to die to yourself, pick up the cross and follow Him.  For now I am contented to be in God's presence , slowly finding purposes in the places He have placed me. In Work, in Cell and in Church. In the company of friends...and in family . God have a wonderful plan for me in Malaysia..God also have a wonderful plan for Malaysia and to the rest of the world. But all of this gonna happen in His TIme.
