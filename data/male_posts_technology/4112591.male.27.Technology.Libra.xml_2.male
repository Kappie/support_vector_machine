I've just read this article on a website (abovetopsecret, excellent site), regarding the latest threat to Italy.  Link to article and plenty of comments  urlLink http://www.terroranalysis.com/story/71455.html  ___________________________________________________________________ The Deadline set by al-Qaeda has passed and this threat has been received....  quote: On Ubay Hfs 's battalions compact : the end of the deadline to the Italian nation On the compact of its source The In the Name of Allah Most Gracious Most Merciful Ubay Hfs 's battalions the Egyptian The Al-Qaeda Network To the Italian nation ... The peace on the one(s) who followed the guidance and after ... The end of the deadline that was defined for you and to your government with the withdrawal of its forces to a relative, and we will see if you were being characterized by the wisdom so that you take the decision of the withdrawal from Iraq, or then the bloody war in its way to you, and we will not stop the raids about Rome, and you will not feel the safety in your houses, then each place will become a goal after the end of the deadline, and will complete targeting any place, and the goals defined, and remained that the deadline that was issued in a first last month ends .. Our cells in Rome and in remainder Italian cities have prepared their equipment and any power will not dissuade us about hitting your strongholds, and we will transfer your life to a hell it is not tolerated, if you did not withdraw from the Muslim country, Iraq . The mocking at the Islamic civilization will not pass below a punishment, and your nation will not enjoy O Brliscony is with the safety except if the Iraqi nation felt the safety when you withdraw from their country .. And that changed then our hitting will head for each place in every age .... Until your getting out of Iraq land .. To our cells in the Italian cities ... The war has approached therefore that mobilize you all to the fierce war after the end of the deadline that was defined, you got ready for hitting any target that waves in front of you after the end of the deadline that was defined ... So that we make taste Brliscony and his group the bitterness of the blood that made taste him to the Iraqi nation, after they chose the mean following Bush, and the mean is Blair .. And he who wronged will know any return they turn back Ubay Hfs 's battalions the Egyptian The Al-Qaeda Network Saturday 21 / 6 / 1425 hijri - 7 / 8 / 2004 ______________________________________________________________________  As stated there are a lot of comments also but I have not included them here, just the chilling quote from the group, follow the link to view the discussion.  I am more concerned about the immediate threats to Italy as opposed to Ney York which was also mentioned, (we have been getting blitzed about the threats to the US and most have been just scaremongering and playing politics with terror alerts. I expect later this year closer to the election there will be a spectacular attack on the US.)  I think al-Qaeda will feel they were very successful in getting Spain to leave Iraq, Madrid bombings saw to that, and you saw the public response. Sack the Gov go with anti-war party/pull out troops. The Al-Qaeda will see this success as a blueprint for all European countries who it has targeted. (I also think they are fully aware of the European citizenry opposition to this illegal war and hence this is a good strategy).  For me Italy is more in danger in the shortterm than say the UK or the US, though I do not rule and attack on either out altogether. The next few weeks will be telling,  I do hope I am completely wrong and this is just more rhetoric.  Garlo
