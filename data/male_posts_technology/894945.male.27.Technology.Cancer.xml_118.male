I'm not talking about, 'paint-job, new sofa's, guest DJ nobody has ever heard of... that'll do it' I mean something brand spanking new, utterly cool and unlike the the normal places we end up.  I think the new Friday's is a step in the right direction, but it's not a club is it? Some of the best nights out i've ever had were at La Cala. Nice big bar area, decent music, good interior.. why don't they rebuild the bastard and we'll all be happy.   I am SO bored of Follies now.   GAP is laughable, I went there on Friday night at about 1am, and the place was like a fucking Butlins holiday camp in January. 20 blokes and one very drunk girl, shit music and Smashy and Nicey on the decks. Dear lord. It's not been that same since that Harry Potter incident anyway.  I like Madison's but never really make the effort to work out what's on when, and I heard it's getting turned into a giant filing cabinet for some bank now anyway.  Of course there's always the Splash.. but I could write down the playlist on a saturday night by heart... and downstairs is like a freaking youth club.  Young alcoholics of Jersey unite, we demand new clubs!
