You're hollow and content  Deep down inside  Give up nothing  So how can you feel so alive?    How can you cry  When you turn your back  On everything you ever had,  Stepping on trust and loyalty    Always falling  You're never there  And you never were  You squirm when cornered    Because you know you're wrong.
