     
      (how very non-destructive of you)  You hear a crash of the symphony as your foot connects with her head, but it's enough to send her sprawling.  The machine shuts down with a quiet *boop*. (perhaps the blue screen of death would be more appropriate?  would this be a windows app?  :-)  The world spins, swirls, shakes, draws inward then spews out again.  Ace lies on his back, unconcious, on the roof.  Carol and Owen are unconcious and bleeding.  Amber, you and Elizabeth are the only ones awake.  Raven, Wolf, the warriors and the village are gone.
