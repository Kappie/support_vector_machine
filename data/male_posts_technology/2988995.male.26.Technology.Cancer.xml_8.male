Tongue in cheek comments i guess that's what makes our lives.....           Ne ways if you thought i was bloggin to tell u all tht u already knew ur wrong.....here's what i think of bloggin....if its going to be a diary then why let others read it........if its ur opinion then why tell me what u had for breakfast....okie cynicism apart....it is a great medium for sure....i'm trying desperately to make a good samaritan out of myself....like say the nice things about people...like how does my Pukie .."yuckie lookin red skirt look.." i swallow my retch and roll my eyes and with all the appropriate emotions bring out an awesome dress.....and go on to say how it is the most desirous of all creations on planet earth...... the good thing now tho is tht Dinesh Kartik is in....and that does deserve more than a few words.......havent seen much of this lad....but after Parthiv's performaces i guess some time away from the middle will do him good......he's got to deliver......cliched but true...... As i age " which surprisingly seems to be happening faster mentally than physically" i can see through cliche's..........that the best thing about them is that they are hardly cliched.....           more time....i have suddenly become this serious human...and i'm petrified at having my sense of humor...i can laugh at you anytime though...but ....its the paranoia......tht's catching up.......okie if you are reading this blog chances are you may not come back....one for i'm not too disciplined in my posts...and i dont write with purpose.....mostly thought streams...and unplanned gushes......but if u catch the mood...i guess it might start making sense.... okie am rushing for a meeting....will come back and blog more...... as i make this a habit...promise u guys...i will fight it out for readership.......but as long as i keep writing thought streams..there'sllbe only two guys who read this..and both of em will be me!!!
