(i'm going to assume that ben was talking about a missed call from chris) me - i just spent 4 days in a luxurious mountain resort hanging with one of my best friends (stef), relaxing in a hot tub, picking up rich boys, playing monopoly pinball (one of those activities is not true - figure out which one!)  - it's been fun.  happy new year!
