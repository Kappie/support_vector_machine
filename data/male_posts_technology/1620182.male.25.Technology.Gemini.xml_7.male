I had to get up in the wee hours of the morning (yes, I consider 5:00am one of the wee hours) to catch my flight to Las Vegas.  Normally, this wouldn't be so bad, but this morning's trial was particularly taxing considering I was up until nearly 2:00am packing for this stupid trip.  I convinced myself that it was okay to stay up late packing.  I could always catch a nap on the plane, I said.  Do you think I slept?  Nope.  What kept me awake?  It seems silly, but, umm...Harry Potter did it.
 
 Can you believe this?  I know I'm not always one to go against the norm for the sake of being different, but I never thought I'd stoop so low as to buy into a franchise like Harry Potter.  The mainstream bandwagon (or mindlessly media-driven cult as I like to call it) has lead me astray more than once in the past.  Consider this short list of purchasing mishaps: Marky Mark's second album, Titanic (the movie), and yes, even Star Wars Episodes I and II.  I know what you're saying.  How can I throw the heralded Star Wars franchise in with this group?  Trust me, I could go on and on about the corruption of one of the all-time great franchises - the subject for a later blog.
 
 So yes, I admit it.  I have been bullied into consuming some of the worst media ever produced solely because it was popular (or so I thought at the time).  Maybe I was curious.  Maybe I was trying to fit in to something I didn't understand.  I'm not sure what was going through my head at the time, and immediately after buying my first Harry Potter book, I had to ask myself:  Have I been suckered yet again?
 
 And them something quite remarkable occurred: I actually read the first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  You know what?  It's really quite good.  It has humor, suspense, mystery, and drama all wrapped in the tale of a heroic child who represents everyone's fantasy - the "average" kid who is destined to do great things.  What's not to love about this?  
 
 Suddenly, this purchase isn't looking so bad.  The Sorcerer's Stone is light, short, succinct, and unassuming.  All welcome changes from the last book I read, Tom Clancy's Executive Orders.  Where Executive Orders is arrogant, Potter is humble.  Where Clancy brings the reader to the brink of political and social disaster, Rowlings gives us the purity of childhood.  
 
 Perfect!  This is just what I need at this juncture of my life.  Do you think I want a novel about hell bent terrorists or contrite politicians when I can read about hate in the Middle East, political unrest, or random shooting-sprees in the news every day?  No, I don't.  Reading Harry Potter is pure panacea - a child's story immersed in morality and sprinkled with heroism.  You can forget about your personal problems.  You can forget that the world is a tad unstable these days.  For a brief moment, there's nothing more important than escaping the clutches of Voldemort, or getting a passing grade in your "Defense Against the Dark Arts" course.  No, buying in to the Harry Potter franchise was not a bad decision on my part.  Perhaps waiting so long to do so was.
