It's really different to doing youth group talks, because it feels like it needs to be more formal. So no throwing in the odd reference to Monty Python, Homestarrunner, or various other inappropriate but humorous allusions. Oh well.   House It's all mine. Eh hehehehe. I paid my deposit on Friday, and in two weeks I can move in....and pay the rest. Ya hooo! Ya'll are invited to my house warming gathering, when I get around to it. I'll let you know time and dates.
