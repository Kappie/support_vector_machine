It conjurs images of weekends with dad(the smell of his house, the kitchen on saturday morning when the light would come in through the window, driving with my step mom)  It reminds me of little tim., aka pierre. Happily living oblivious to all that goes on in the adult world. No bills, no worris, just normal schizotypal Tim:)  PS- Cahlen is avoidant, which is probably why he didn't tell you himself... (True story, he told me that he took the test and is avoidant, when asked to post it, he said, "no way")  Also, it's interesting that he has a job as a security guard where he has little interaction with people. (it's a night time gig, in case you didn't know)
