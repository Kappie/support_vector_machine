Not a whole lot of people there but I was one of the most prolific bloggers until "Jenn" started posting nearly every day and they tightened the security settings on the firewall at my work.  So not only did I slip down in the rankings of post numbers, but my means of gaining ground was severely limited.  And then, the site goes down!  It's been down for about a week now and I have no idea what's happened.  The thing is, I was forming a sort of "structure" for my blog site and now it's gone.  Granted, my topics were somewhat diverse and unrelated but that's me and what I'm into: theater, politics religion/spirituality, and blathering on about my life.  So now I'm faced with a new blog mechanism: Blogger.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.  This was one of the first ones and those johnny-come-lately's have nothing on these tried and true old vets of the Blog Wars.  Fine.  Whatever.  What matters to me, now that I've got a serious case of the "gottablogs" is that I find an outlet for my blather, build up content and find an audience.  I grant you, this is not a particularly auspicious start.  BUT, it is a start nonetheless.
