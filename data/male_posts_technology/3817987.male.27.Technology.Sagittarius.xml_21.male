The lyrics are interesting if you listen to them, but the songs to blend into one big long indistinct track.  The song “Space Beatle” is pretty spiffy.  Over all its good “work music”, music to listen to while concentrating on other things, but I have no inkling to see these guys live that might be a snoozer.
