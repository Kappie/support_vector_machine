I got up, and got to school on time (which is rare), and lasted through first period, chapel (in which Laura, Gwen and I led the pledges), and most of second, but during first break I was terrible. I have no idea why, but I suddenly felt all this weight upon my shoulders, and lost the will to do really anything. I just wandered around in a semi-daze for a while until third period (English, a class I really enjoy). Then I was fine again, and even happy and stuff, but then fourth (Computer 2); I hate that class with a passion. Don't get me wrong, I love doing anything computer related, but this class bugs the heck out of me for some reason. It's like I can never please the teacher or my peers. They come into it with some weird preconceived notion that I am inferior in all aspects of life, and don't waste any energy trying to contain their opinions. Plus the teaching methods are... intolerable. The teacher doesn't give ANY handouts or guides to ANYTHING (well, I must correct myself, he did give us a total of six, maybe seven sheets of paper this year - mostly pictures of what our projects are supposed to look like.), but makes us rely solely on notes. This would not be so bad if the guy could keep thinking on the same track for more than 26 seconds at a time. He continuously jumps around between topics, then doubles back and corrects himself, then stops to think for a minute, then can’t remember what he was trying to say, and so, jumps to another random, entirely unrelated topic. (Does it seem like I’m aggravated?)  ‘Ne way, I had lost all resolve to so anything that period, and had just resigned myself to staring blankly at the monitor for the entire 45 minutes.    Lunch wasn’t much better. Gwen was in a junior planning meeting for the upcoming retreat, so I couldn’t talk to her. (Something I desperately wanted to do – I always, with maybe one exception, cheer up when I’m conversing with her.)   Fifth period (typing) was almost as bad as fourth. The only thing I got accomplished in the entire class was a short sorrowful poem that I have yet to complete, name, and post. Sixth (pre-Calc – the hardest math course offered at our school for one’s relative knowledge level at entrance) was also really bad. I got a hard test back, and found out I got a 6 out of 14 correct. That pretty much shot the rest of that period. I just laid my head in my arms and tried to shut the world out for a little while, with little success.   Sixth period, however, my mood changed drastically (maybe cause I was finally able to communicate with someone(s). For that class, Gwen sits on my right, and Rachael on my left. I spent all period talking to Rachael about intellectual stuff and to Gwen about how her day was going, and doing tons of work ahead cause I finally got back that derive to work that I had lost all day.   Once I got back home, I could tell immediately that something was at least slightly wrong with my mom. She didn’t have that radiant air (spelling?) about her that she usually does around the time that I get home. Later that night, I found out what was wrong at another of our dreaded “family meetings”: My dad was going on another power trip and had decided sporadically that my mom could no longer be in contact with her best friend, my Aunt Darh-wynn. He was as inanely bull headed about it as he ever is, frustrating me and my sisters beyond measure, and pushing my mom to the brink of tears... again.   Yup, so all in all, today did pretty much suck.  O, and I found out that Gwen’s working on Sat. from 4-10, so I dunno if the movie idea will work out... So far what I had planned (on planning) to do was invite Gwen, Goody, Diane, Andrew, Cam, Josh and Rachael (Cam and I want her to meet Diane) over to my house, and then go from there to see a movie (most likely the Core, if it’s still out). But, since Gwen's working, we might end up doing the same thing, minus her, and then visit her later at work. Dunno, I’m still thinking about it...
