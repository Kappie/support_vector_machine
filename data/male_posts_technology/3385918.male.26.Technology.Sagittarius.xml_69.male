The film set a new record for a six-day opening, beating the original record of $146.9 million set by "The Matrix Reloaded" last year.   I saw this film yesterday and loved it. It's much better than the first, which is saying a lot cause I thought that the first movie was excellent. Heck, the first film is one of the best comic to film adaptation. The sequel improves on the formula. Both these films are special in the way the focus on the characters first and then the action. The acting in top notch and it's great to see that they are given intense, dramatic material to build and work on. Historically, summer movies have been all brawn and muscle, using CGIs to tell their story. The script is just a place holder for the action. The Spiderman franchise is proof that you can have an excellent balance between FX action and a human story. And, in essence, Sam Raimi's Spiderman is a love story at heart. What's more human than that?  Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11," slipped to No. 2 with a four-day haul of $21 million, taking its total to $60.1 million (suck on that, Disney !!!).   I would like to note that I am eagerly awaiting Moore's film, that will finally have it's debut here on Thursday. There is great expectations here for the movie, given that there has always been a big Anti - Military movement in the Island. Me? I just hate George Bush, so I know I'm gonna have a good time.    urlLink Sailor Ecchi
