From an early age, i always used to see this old lady on her bike in Rainham shopping centre, she was never without her shopping from either tesco or Co-op and never far away from her trusty push-bike. she was always smiling and looking eager to get home once she had collected all the groceries she needed. These were piled high in her basket and occasionally fastened behind the back seat (although i had seen her walking up a hill pushing the bike due to the weight of her load). no, of course this doesn't seem that strange. It was only as i got older and had a job during the summer of '94 did i realise that she pretty much seemed to do this every day. Ashamed to say it, i remember seeing her in tesco once and watching to see what she bought. she mainly seemed to stick to the sale items and other items that maybe used for ingredients in cakes and biscuits. I imagined that every night was spent cooking with all these ingredients to make said snacks for her large family made up of grandchildren, nephews and nieces, a woman surely indulging in the old-aged traditions of old age.. The way she use to use cirlce round the precinct on her bike without seeming to notice how fast she was going (she'd just ring the bell and smile if she thought she was within a whisker of you)was like a scene from one of the (in)famous naked gun films. people seemed oblivous to it though, but then it was an every day occurence..  Sadly, on my few visits back to rainham, i no longer see her (the mouth-organ player is still there on a saturday). I guess she was about 70 when i used to see her which would make her 80 now so maybe the bike is no longer an option. I like to think that someone has shown her how to use the internet and she is now getting her shopping delivered every day with a similar urgency.    i finally got my fixed 303 back from the shop today.. it's only been 3 bloody months. the guy made attempts at apologies but didn't seem to know what to say. He knew they had fucked up basically and so did i. Probably very wise as it meant that there was need for me to complain too much.. It is a handy shop and i've used it frequently in the past although extra caution maybe used in future. so i now have another machine that makes a lot of silly noises, i've now just got to learn how to use them properly rather than randomly.
