Our new domain is sorted at last so afterhours.ie will be up and running soon I hope.  I have taken all the source code I have and have started working on the new blogging engine (sorry blogspot..) and a couple of funky new features (I am putting in a death clock and birthday clock so it has a count down till members next birthday and their death according to their average life expectancy in Ireland :D)  Anyway, back to the grind stone for the moment...
