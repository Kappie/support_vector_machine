However, tomorrow I'm booked in to read all morning (lol!), working from 12.30 till 4.30, going to a rehersal at 4.35 until 6pm, and then going to Michelle's house for a 'groupie' until 11pm! Wow! Then I need to be at work by 9am Saturday until 12.30 when I will depart so I can get a train to be in London by 2.30, ready to run in the gates of Hyde Park at 4pm, and screaming at BonJovi support acts by 7.30, then hollering at THE BonJovi by about 9-9.30ish! Wow! Then home by about 1ish, hopefully. Sholudn't be too late. Then I'm waitressing Sunday afternoon, 2 till 11pm i think, who knows with the lifestyle I'm leading at the moment?!!! At least I get paid. Oh yes, then Monday Thorpe Park. Oh and Tuesday rehersal at 12.30 till 1.30, shopping until 3pm, then back to school for another rehersal at 3.30. WEdnesday I've got an induction day at Oxted so I have to be out of the house by 7.45 in order to get the 8am train to Oxted! Then I probably won't be back before 5pm! Yay! Thursday I'm working all day for my dad. Friday I've actually got a day to relax, providing I'm not called into work! Woweeeeeeeeee I'm going to be exhausted! Anyways, how were the taster lessons today? Can't have been any more boring than my day, mind you! I'd like to know how Tom's unplanned history lesson went, lol! Nicki, what was art-textiles like? And how many external students got lost, ha ha?! Anyway, Tom I am coming to the rehersal tomorrow but late as I said earlier, I phoned Mrs Hicks (aren't I good!) to let her know, just so she doesn't have my head off when I finally arrive!
