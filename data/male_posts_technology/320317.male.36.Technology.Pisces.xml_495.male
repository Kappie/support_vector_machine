 Over the years I have noticed CNET to be somewhat biased in it's reporting of tech news. Their position, like many, seems to be always anti-Microsoft in nature. This headline takes the cake. If they were reporting the general news you'd probably read headlines like "New Security Cameras in Banks Unfair to Bank Robbers".
