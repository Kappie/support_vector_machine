You bugger off to Sydney, that's what!  w00t! That's right, i'm off to see Kiersy in Sydney for two weeks, to see what I can get up to in the local hosilteries. It's not all play though, the second week i've booked myself on a Red Hat Linux course. Two birds, one stone.. etc..  ToasterFiles.com email addresses are now set-up for... Psycho, Grist, Custard, Baity, Kirk, Scott and Brett. Give me a shout for your usernames and passwords.   urlLink This should keep you entertained for a while...   Oh, and Grist.. friends don't run friend's off with their cars right? :D
