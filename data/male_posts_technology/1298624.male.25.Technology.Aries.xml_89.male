I'm thinking that if I use this laptop as my work computer, I could use the shuttle as a game/Linux test box computer for awhile (at least until I go crazy with Linux and want a completely Windows system again).   Gentoo Linux will be the culprit. I'm thinking of dividing the HD into 20 gigs for Linux and the rest for Windows. Depends though...if I like Linux then I may switch the HD space to provide more...but I'll hold my breath and see.  La Pucelle Tactics has shipped. Should be arriving May 10th. Yay!
