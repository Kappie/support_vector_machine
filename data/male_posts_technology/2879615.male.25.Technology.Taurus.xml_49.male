I bet you could get ringworm from walking on the kitchen floor... WITH SOCKS ON!!! eew! I think I will write you all a poem because I love you.  Everybody likes to come and Chill at Autumn Lane Once you've met the people here You'll never be the same.   Kem and Kristin live upstairs and live in harmony Kimbo has a ferret and a Plethora of trees.   And if you look across the hall, you'll Find the great Christine.  She always wears a smile and her room is fresh and clean.  And if you take a journey down  To see our living room, You'll find a little guy named Craig who Often sleeps till noon.  Down the stairs AGAIN will lead you Straight to Connie's door. She likes to tell fun stories, but She loves tequila more!  And if you hear some techno beats, They're in the other room! It's The Den of Sin and Wierdness with Luke and Lickey Pooooooooooo!  Autumn Lane is where I live. My friends are family. There is not another place That I would rather be.  Yay Autumn! I will miss you all, Kem and Christine and Connie and Luke and Benjamin!! (tear) XOXO.
