The wind is blowing here I don't know if you all know about New Mexican winds, but there are few things worse then the endless dust and howling. Susan is sick today which is unfortunate since not only is she unwell but the likelyhood of me becoming sick has risen quite a bit. The syria situation is becoming worse. They are now accused of having chemical weapons. I'm sure that we have chemical weapons why isn't anyone getting pissed at us?
