I get fairly pissed off when everyone uses gay as a term for something people don't like, WHY DO IT. I know loads of gay people, and i know it offends some of them, and I don't think its fair. (sorry if it seems like I am having a go, don't mean to) Two - Paul (and anyone else who don't know) - I do now have a girlfriend (believe it or not) She is called Becky Aspland, I have been with her for about a week, she goes to Archbishop Tennisons, is nice, what else can I say?   Ok now on to my day, my plan for today was to get up early sort out the 100000000 hours worth of coursework I had to do and sort out my life, a very time consuming activity. However as life is life, things didn't go to plan, not at all. I got up at 10:30 sort early compared to 2pm. So instead of doing work I played Transport Tycoon,  Then I decided I should eat (here's the start of the most stupid thing I have done for ages) My mum decided she would make me and my dad a fry up, we had too much bacon (I don't know why?) so she gave me and my dad 5 'bits' each, as we ate it we talked about weight watchers (which my mum does) we discovered that me and my dad would only be able to eat 18 points each day, my mum worked out how many would be in our breakfasts, and then we decided to keep a track of everything we ate today, this stupidly soon turned into a competition, however not who could stick to 18 but who could eat the most points during today. Well this has got really out of hand, we are both nearly throwing up at each move we make but are still eating to try and win the massive £1 reward. ITS VERY SILLY DON'T DO IT. Anyway now I am watching 'what lies beneath' actually I am not I am watching, my brother watching 'what lies beneath' (he is scared!!!!!!!)  Anyway have got to go prepare my equipment for tomorrows, low work, high pay, work at AMF. Looking forward to that one, but now looking forward to waking up at 8:30, Anyway hope everyone is good, (sorry if I have wrote loads,don't wanna strain anyone's eyes or something like that)  See you all soon, Dave
