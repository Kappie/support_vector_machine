In the last couple of weeks, I have been getting nothing but 4th place finishes.  It's killing me.  Me and my bankroll.  I've played against some really good players who kicked my ass.  My playing style could get me to the final four but I wasn't building up a stack sizeable to compete in the end.  My conservative play in the early rounds was coming to haunt me now.  Time to re-evaluate my game again.  What to do. That pretty much brings you up to my present state.  Low bankroll and perfecting my game.  I'm going to take a short hiatus from money play and work on my game in the play money tournaments.  RoyalVegasPoker.com has been great for me.  The tournament play has been fun and insightful.  I'll keep working on my game and keeping you posted.  I hope to see you in the game.  Indiana Slim
