So I ran to a TGIF within the Airport to get something to eat. We were able to get out of there by 10:30 but I missed my connection in Dallas. Fortunately I was able to get on the last flight out. I arrived home around 4:30 p.m. Once I was in the airport, I received a call from work. Already a couple of issues. So I basically hit the house and started working. After a couple of hours I was able to be with the kids.   I will say on the way back (Dallas/Fort Smith flight), I happen to sit with an intereesting lady. She worked for the Immigration Services and had an interesting history. She informed me of all the gangs in our area, drug trafficking ect.   Saturday morning, my wife had the yard sale. It was a good one and we did pretty darn good. She even passed a couple of Bush-Cheyney stickers! heh heh  During the yard sale, our friends and their kids came over. So my buddy and I took the kids to Mcdonalds to let them play and eat lunch there, while the ladies (our wives) tended the yard sale and have some time together. The kids had a blast and it was indoors away from the heat.   One the way to Miki-D's I stopped by the Republican Headquarters. Dick Cheyney is speaking in Fort Smith on Tuesday! The tickets were free, but you had to give your name and social to get one. I plan to go listen to him on Tuesday. I figured it was the only time I would get to see the guy so close.   After the yard sale, we all crashed for an hour. We went to my brothers birthday party. He knew about it but I grabbed him and one of his boys. My son, brother and his son went to my dads for a bit. We grabbed about 6 pizzas and headed back. It was ok, not many showed up but at least he had a 31 yr birthday party.   It's already 8:30 p.m. and the day is gone. It was nice not being on-call today, but I retain it for tomorrow. The kids already had their showers and currently watching a Mary-Kate Ashley movie eating snacks. I look forward to sleeping in my bed again tonight. Last night I didn't even need tylenol p.m.
