Went downhill for 4 miles, across for 4, and then a lot of switchbacks going up about 1500 feet for the last 4 miles.  Not too bad for me, though I had a bit of a head cold, but a lot of people were having a rough time and were very thankful to see the end of the hike.  At some points in the hike it was so desolate it seemed like we were on the moon with black sand and rocks and nothings else, very cool though.  I am taking pictures of all our hikes, but internet access at the hostel is a little hard to come by, so I will just upload them when I can, along with all the other ones I have waiting.  Met some people from Switzerland, Holland, and Bulgaria, hadnâ€™t met people from there before.
