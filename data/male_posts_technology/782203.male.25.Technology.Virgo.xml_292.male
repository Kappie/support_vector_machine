The thing is usually she will ask me to take the sticker myself. Must be the new cologne that I am wearing. But really I think they should make it so that she has to wear a nurse's uniform, that would really make my day I tell ya !   Still trying to get used to working in the new office; but one thing i really don't like is that some of the other people are really noisy sometimes and its kinda annoying when I'm blogging ...err i mean working.
