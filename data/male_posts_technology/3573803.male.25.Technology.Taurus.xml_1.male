Although I did create this blog address sometime back it was all thanks to  urlLink 88pro  that I finally got around to pouring out my thoughts...  My first experience in living in an apartment in a foreign land has been quite an interesting one. firstly buying sheets that did not fit even half of the bed and then attempting in vain to have 88pro hold it while tried to pull the part with the elastic, over the edge was....interesting.   But the most interesting part is definitely..COOKING. Although I had the option of moving in with a friend who assured me that he could cook, I took the bold/stupid (call it what you like)step of moving in with 88pro whose knowledge on cooking was the same as mine.....ZILCH/NADA/ZERO.   Anyways, after five days of cooking i think we both agree that was one of best decisions we've ever made. Who ever knew that cooking would be so eeeaaaasyyyy!!!! Ok ok I admit...a dish thats supposed to take 6 mins to cook takes us about 1 hr!!! But holy crap (ooops... can I say that ??) we made some awsome currys like chicken curry, devilled sausages, fish curry etc etc. But we seem to have this problem with the lentil (parippu). It doesnt tastes like parippu, (well, it doesnt taste bad...but not the taste of my mom's parippu curry) it tastes like raw parippu. Anyone whose an expert in this area please help!!  untill next time...
