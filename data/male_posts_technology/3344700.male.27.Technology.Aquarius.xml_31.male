There is also a link to  urlLink   C# Language Specification    book as well when scroll down the page. I found the book a year back (May 2003, I believe) when I was going through the  urlLink   Visual Basic Developer Center    at MSDN and then  urlLink   Visual Basic Related Blogs    link, under Paul Vick's blog. Since I started blogging recently, wanted to mention about this here (even though i's too late!!) now.   Many thanks to  urlLink   Paul    and  urlLink   Duncan Mackenzie    for making me to grab the good book.  My personal comments about the book,  It's very descriptive and the information provided about Visual Basic .NET language would benefit the beginners effectively. Overall, it's very interesting and useful.  Hope to get more like this from  urlLink   PaulV   . :)
