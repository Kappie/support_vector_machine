I spent an hour checking out all the job boards and companies i have bookmarked to check frequently, and then 3 and a half hours sitting on the couch watching Return of the King.  Maybe that's why.  Stress plus sitting in my twisty computer chair plus sitting on my lumpy couch plus 210 minutes of the most amazing cinematography ever equals sore brain pan.  I should be a doctor or something.   I forgot how long Return of the King is.  And how amazingly good.  And how sexually suspect frodo is in the movies (and all this time I thought gandalf was the gay oine).  The same thing bugged me in this movie that bugged me in the books: after all the fighting and the good stuff, there is still like 25 minutes of movie or a hundred and fifty pages of book!  I mean, I understand why, and I am glad that I get to find out something about what happens to the characters after (which is something I  always  think about when I read a book, actually), but come on!  The one thing I always want to know after I read a book, and this one gives it to me and it bugs me.  Wierd, huh?  Having said that tho, it's a pretty small bug.  Actually Frodo's girlishness bugs me more, but I can get past that too.  Not that it's bad to be girlish, just that I always pictured frodo as a kinda rock and roll pot smoker dude.  Like Merry and Pippin only a little more mature.  He is, after all, 33 in the books.  But I digress.  The point I was starting to make before I went off on the Frodo tangent is that in my opinion, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is as close to cinematic nirvana as we've ever seen.    IF   you buy the special extended editions, that is.  Which is the only way to go with these (tonites movie was a rental...i'll wait til the spec ed before I actually buy it).  The direction, the art, the effects, the cinematography, the music...it's all pretty well done.  And to top it all off, it's entertaining too.  And not even all "Hollywooded" down to a 2 hour package.  Back to the special edition vs the normal one... I always wonder about these people who pissed and moaned when they bought the Fellowship disc then had to buy the special edition too cuz they bought too soon.   That alone doesn't make me scratch my head so much as the fact that they DID THE SAME THING WITH THE SECOND ONE (Dumbasses) and bitched about that.  And THEN they bought this one on Tuesday when it came out.  Seriously WTF are you thinking people?  And then there's this guy...comes into the store today and buys RotK on both DVD and VHS, because he was gonna watch the VHS and keep the DVD in it's wrapping until it goes up in value.  I didn't have the heart to tell him that they produce 3394883920284387329209 copies of this all on dvd, and it's gonna take a LOOONNNGGGGG time for all of them to deteriorate enough for his copy to be worth anything.  But whatever floats your boat I guess.  My head hurts lots so I'm gonna stop here.  Kinda sucks too cuz I was on a roll.
