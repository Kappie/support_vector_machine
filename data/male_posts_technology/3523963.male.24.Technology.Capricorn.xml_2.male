I say almost, because not always the feelings can be aptly expressed in words, the implicit shortcoming of any language. When i started analysing further on what it can do to us, i had the below thoughts. All these need not necessarily be true for you though. 1) It certainly produces in us the writing addiction. 2) It makes us discover new ways to make the blog visitors visit again. 3) It fuels the thought of becoming like someone,when we read inspiring blogs. 4) it makes us more introverted. 5) it drives us to learn new words in lexicon to express simple things which can be expressed with our current vocabulary. 6) it tries to make us a Click'O'Maniac in search for more. 7) it makes us wonder if i we are one among those who have fallen sick with presenteeism 8) it arouses that 'not so easy to reconcile' critic in us who would like to question our current work. 9) it might make us brag about oneself even if it is not supposed to be. Above all, it made me write this blog.
