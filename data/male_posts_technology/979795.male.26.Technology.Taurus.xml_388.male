I immediately smsed him on the bus to work. He called and we spoke briefly for awhile. He highlighted a few more people from BVSS who were on his Friendster a/c. I popped back in and started adding or messaging people.  So surprised to hear that he has already ROMed. So happy for him. I can't believe the length of time we've not seen or heard from each other. Almost 8 yrs or so... gosh. Time flies so fast when you let it. Anyway, we both promised to stay in touch and try to arrange the next earliest date when we can meet up for a chat, makan or coffee.  After a few hours, I was quite happy to noticed that another classmate, Yinhong, replied the message I sent in the morning. Gosh, memories just kept flowing back. I remembered I was always throwing stuff at her and her friend or tugging her hair back in lower sec. Hahaha ... yes yes ... I was quite a monkey back then.  Anyway, it's good lor. I've always like my sec sch life and friends a lot. It was a pity I kinda let them go after sec sch and lost touch with everyone save for Robin and Roy. Roy, no need to say, he's my best bud even after so many years. No doubt we don't communicate as much but each time we do, we talk or email like it was only yesterday. Robin, well, can't complain. He's one of the few who still makes some effor to stay in touch with me after so long. It brings to mind another good buddy in upper sec, Jialiang, who had kinda drifted away over the years. Quite sad really. Oh well... I'm just glad my Poly and Uni friends are still around me at this point.
