It would be sensisble for Rick Adelman - despite sometimes questionable substitions/rotations - to start Miller alongside Webber and Stojakovic.  What I want to know is how Miller went from .59 bpg in Indiana to 1.19 in Sacramento.   Fantasy Impact   With the departure of Vlade Divac, and despite the arrival of Greg Ostertag, Brad Miller should be posting bigger numbers than last season. I had him ranked as somewhat of a sleeper last season, but now everyone knows. He'll still be playing alongside a (probably) healthy Webber, as well as Stojakovic and Bibby, so don't overvalue him. That said, he is a good pick up at Center - especially now that Shaq is in the Eastern Conference. Certainly a good early round pick; I'd say as high as 2nd round in deep leagues as the roster stands now.
