Yesterday, as a kind of going-away party for our interns, eleven of us went to Champs Karting to race electric go-karts.  I qualified (in third) for the final race and finished in third.  Two things about this picture: (1) check out the snazzy new shirt I got from Value Village for $6, and (2) I have no idea why this picture makes me look like I dyed my hair blond,  because I didn't.  Thanks go to Ram for taking this picture. urlLink
