Mixing and making small talk - not two of my strongest attributes.    All in all it was fun, mixing momineen and others is interesting to watch cause we I think don't socialize enough with others and live in this microcosm of a universe that sometimes limits our "zehen" (minds).    We drove back late late at night cause we couldn't wait to get back to home sweet home!  But boy did we eat!  The whole weekend, I think I gained like 3 pounds in 3 days!
