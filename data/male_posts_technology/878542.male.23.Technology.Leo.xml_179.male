Beautiful blond girl, she lived in cincinnati, then Salt Lake City, then Louiseville, then moved to Oregon, and I lost track of her. She was a lovely actress.  I miss her because I haven't heard from her in some time, and talking to her always made me feel calm, without losing emotional connections to whatever was bothering me. She was very caring, and very lighthearted. I of course had a terrible crush on her, but nothing ever came of it.   I think of her occasionally, though. and some measure of peace returns, even with that faint memory. I should try to find out where she is... The internet fails me..
