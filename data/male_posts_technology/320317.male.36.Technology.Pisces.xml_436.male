Large wired and wireless telephone companies will be replaced by micro-operators, millions of which can be woven into a global fabric of broadband connectivity."

 "Lily pads and frogs". That's a pretty interesting and even entertaining analogy. Call me paranoid, but there just seems like a lot serious issues involved with Wi-Fi. The main issue off the top of my head is that this gives hackers, spammers, and terrorists easy access to the internet to do what they do without ever identifying themselves. I am sure this is fairly easy to do without a wireless network as it is, but let's not make it even easier for them. I am all for free wireless access, but there needs to be some accountability if something bad happens. Aaaarrgghhh ... I am starting to sound like a parent.
