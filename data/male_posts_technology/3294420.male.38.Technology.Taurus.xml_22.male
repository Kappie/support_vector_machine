Maya has cracked the 10lb mark...as you can probably tell from the most recent set of pictures.  She is also now 21.5"...she has grown 3.5" inches since birth.  We recently changed her formula to one that is made for babies with tummy issues.  It has made a world of difference.  She is crying less often and seems to be more comfortable after feedings.  We're still struggling through the sleeping thing a bit.  Hoping that she will soon start sleeping for more than three hours...and that she will sleep longer in her own bed.  It is hard for us to sleep when she is in bed with us as she makes a lot of noises and really likes to snug.  With the recent heat wave, it gets rather warm :-)  My mom just left this morning.  It was wonderful to have her here....an extra pair of hands made things much easier.  Maya seemed to recognize her voice as when mom got here and said her name, she gave a huge grin.  We're looking foward to Luke and Irene's visit next week and my dad's at the end of August.    Love to you all,  Gina.  Dad- In case you didn't get the email about the pictures... go to  http://homepage.mac.com/dlbender/  Look at the album dated July 25th.
