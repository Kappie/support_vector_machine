Saw nearly everyone, but my little brother didn't make it.  My brother has 2 horses now with dreams to raise horses.  Mom and my step dad are both retired now and are doing well.   I hung out around the home town for a few days, spent a lot of time with mom.  Wednesday I went upto newark to stay with my friend.  We went over to his brothers house on Thursday and we played like 8 hours of D  Then we tried to sleep there, 4 kids, 3 grownups in a small apartment.  I could have slept fine, but one of the kids has a Jimmy leg and didn't stop moving on the air matress all night, then at 3am I got too cold and just stopped pretending to sleep and got up.  Friday we made it to origins and then spent the day walking around.  That night we went back to my friends house and killed a red dragon.   My 5th level thief actually hit 2 out of 3 times and did 14 points of damage. :D  Saturday my feet hurt, so I bought my "Yes, it is rocket science" T-shirt, got a free t-shirt with spider man on it and bought a game called Truth or Fib.  I went over to the free board game area and got a game called "I'm the Boss"  About investment banking.  Fun game.  Then we went home and stopped by another friends house and had hambergers and hotdogs before finally going to sleep early.   Got up Sunday and I showered, got my clothes into the laundry and then we headed over to get TIVO for my friend.    We mostly got it setup and then I headed out to the air port.  Got my plane and the connecting flight good, and got a ride from the air port home with another friend.   I always sleep so well on the aircraft.
