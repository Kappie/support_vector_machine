In particular, the fact that I sing along loudly with the car stereo and play a mean set of steering wheel drums.  And nowadays, I'm using my iPod to pump out the jams so I've got 2500 of my favorite songs to belt out.  
  
Incidentally,  urlLink this device  from Belkin is just great.  It's an iPod charger that also has an amplified line out for use with cassette adapter.  Perfect for giving you that extra jolt needed to hit the falsetto intro to New Order's "Temptation."
