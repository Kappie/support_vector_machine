I enjoyed it a great deal, as it was basically what I was trying to do with my old website at the time - just a personal journal where I could put down my thoughts.  I introduced my wife to the site as well, and we both kept blogs there for quite some time.    My wife eventually introduced some of her friends and our coworkers to the site.  Many of them started blogging as well.  We had our own little ad-hoc blogger community, and for a time it was good.  There were perhaps one or two dozen people in the Xanga community who we knew outside of the web.  We all traded comments and e-props, and we all posted fairly regularily.  Things did eventually go sour though, as they are wont to do.    Due to a falling out between two of the community members, which somehow got blamed on my wife and I, the whole thing fell apart.  It got to the point that I couldn't post on my blog without it being brought up by venomous tongues.  After almost two years of thrice-weekly posting, I gave up blogging.  I was disgusted by the community that I had helped found, and I grew increasingly cynical about the content of the other blogs I found there.  That was over a year ago.    This blog is an attempt at a fresh start.  It's actually my sixth attempt at a fresh start in the last few months.  As the title of this post implies, I have very little trouble starting things over from scratch.  It's staying the course that tends to give me trouble.  The six previous incarnations of this journal survived only a handful of posts each.  I'm hoping that this time I'll find the patience and will to continue posting.    What's different this time?  I've just gotten back from a vacation that served as a very strong reminder of what my goals and priorities should be.  My previous six blog attempts have all been meandering and meaningless - I didn't know what I was writing about.  My original blog was meant as a chronicling of my spiritual, intellectual, emotional and physical growth, and I'm going to recapture that with this attempt.    The cosmetics of this journal are unimportant.  The only important thing is that I post regularly, keep my mind on the relevant topics, and don't EVER allow myself to delete what I've written.
