I had a dream last night that I was talking to my old buddy Ruben, who moved away in 8th grade, and he said he was coming to visit for 5 days... which is really coincidental when compared to Brandon's sudden visit to town... maybe ruben's coming back sometime... that would be awesome... ruben's the man... ok, adios
