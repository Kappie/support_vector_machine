I just became catholic on Easter and was asked by one of the Sisters to join them and share my journey.  It was wonderful.  What a supportive group.  The group consisted of people in there 60's, 70's and 80's.  It is great talking to people older than me.  They usually have very interesting stories and have a great deal to share.  There was also a person there with brain cancer.  She had just been treated for it last summer and now she has a tumor growing on the side of her head.  What courageâ€™s woman.  Wow, my problems pale in comparison to hers.  Everyday is a gift.  Remember that!    I'm gone.
