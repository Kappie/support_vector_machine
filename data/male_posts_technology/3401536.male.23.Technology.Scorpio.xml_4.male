I had been going to  urlLink theMILL  (college/20-something) group on Friday nights for about a year now, and I was going to Sunday morning service with my mom. We have a  urlLink SATURDAYNIGHT  service too, but I was always working at PFs cause that's a big money night.    [Flash back to first year of college, Christmas break]      I was sitting in a coffee shop here in the SPGS and felt God tell me I would be involved in youth ministry. I consulted with my youth pastor, and he encouraged me to finish college, then pursue it. So I did...        Now that I had some free time, I thought it would be a great time to pursue that. I talked with people in the college group and in the high school group ( urlLink _tag ), and completely felt God directing me to the high schoolers. I met with Jeremiah, the youth leader, and we had a great time fellowshiping. He told me about what was coming up with the _tag and I shared was God had put on my heart. It was very exciting; we were both pumped about me getting involved. The plan now is that I will co-lead a co-ed high school small group coming up in the fall. The groups will meet once a week and coincide with the school year, so in August or September I will be ministering to some young high school kids. I can't wait!  Ciao
