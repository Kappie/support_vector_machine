He is saying that all our thoughts are nothing but butterflies trying to cross the sea: they will disappear somewhere.  Have you watched your thoughts? If you have lived forty or fifty years, how many million thoughts have crossed the sea and disappeared? Every day, you go on creating new thoughts and they go on disappearing into the dust.  Only one thing remains with you, and that is your am-ness. Only you remain.  As a Zen poet has said, “Clouds come and go and the sky remains.” It never goes anywhere, it never comes from anywhere. You are the sky. Anything that happens in this sky is just a traffic — no need to be concerned about it, no need to be identified with it.   Osho: Turning In, #6
