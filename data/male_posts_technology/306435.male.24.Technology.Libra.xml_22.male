Cowboys and girls galore.   urlLink Jeff Kinne  had the best costume of the night with his Peruvian Cowboy Outfit.  Other than the random act of tearing up of magazines (so lame) and the breaking of Jeff Kinne's gun, the night was a blast.  By far the highlight was Dwayne the Norrwoodian hunk.  He randomly showed up to the party and made himself at home.  Dwayn then proceeded to use the weather to hit on girls, challenge Kristin to a friendship dual, urinate in the basement, and then be escorted out.   Saturday was relaxing.  Waking up at noon any day makes it relaxing.  Saturday night I went to a Kareoke night at Sorrento's.  It was lined up to be really fun, but little did we know that the evil Vince and his microphone bullies were going to be there.  (Vince was a +40 man with a gray flat top that the lady frunning the show seemed to have a thing for.  He would sing a song, drink a beer, and then sing a song again.  Ooooh you don't want to see potential kareokeers scorned.  Vince heard it from the boo birds by the ned of the night.  Eventually we had people sign up with Vince just so they could get a chance to sing... Sunday was firework night.  Well, we watched the last 3 minutes on television.    Ann's house hosted a wonderful grill out.  James mastered the one flip burger and Justin learned how to sit in a hammock.   Monday I continued to lounge until Ann and I rode to Eden Park on bicycles.  What was I thinking!?!  Well I made it there and back and have the craving to watch RAD the movie now. Well that was my weekend...until then...
