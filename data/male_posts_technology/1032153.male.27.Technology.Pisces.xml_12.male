So me and Jono  urlLink jono's blog  are going to cruise down to the Pinnacles, and stay up at the hut there on Tuesday night. Should be a great time. We are hoping to pray heaps! Should be lots of time to meditate, and pray, so it will be super great.    Procrastination  A poster I once read proclaimed:- " Procrastination - Hard work often pays off after time, but laziness always pays off now.  " An interesting thought. Well suffice to say, I have procrastinated abominably this weekend. I should have been studying my Greek, but somehow it is Sunday night, and I have not looked at it period. Why is it that when you need to study something, your room always looks incredibly dirty. and you remember that you need to bake a cake for work, and that you need to play counter strike, and that shucks you could help dad learn a few computer tricks, and install MP3's on his computer. And then you open a drawer........ oh no, that won't do, it's a bit untidy. Oh well I'll just tidy this, and then I'll do my Greek. Oh good that's done, I will go and get a coffee and then i will start my Greek study. Excellent, while I wait for the kettle to boil, I'll twiddle around on the piano. Well I'll grab my coffee and continue practising for a little while. Mate! That's the phone. Oh joy it's great aunt Agatha's best friends cousins dog. Awesome, I'll have an hour conversation. Isn't it sad that procrastination dictates our times to us. I need to discipline myself. I can do it. I will do it nine times......   Seriously though. I am going to make an effort on my procrastination habits.  I will keep you updated... if I don't put it off.   Guy's Relationships  I feel sad that guys don't create deep relationships with each other. I mean, it's true for me. Up until recently, I have tended to make all my deep relationships where I talk about deep stuff with girls. Now don't get me wrong, I don't think that having relationships with girls is a bad thing, but why can't I have friendships like these with my male friends. This is something I want to work on this year. I think this could be a powerful tool for spiritual growth in us males. We need a real close brother to share everything with.
