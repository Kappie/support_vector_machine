He waves at chicks and they wave back. And when they wanna take a photo with him, they tend to hug him pretty tightly, which obviously he doesn't mind at all. But I just find it amazing how gals would hug a complete male stranger just because he is in a cute looking costume,  it's like they don't even realise that there's a guy behind the chipmunk!
