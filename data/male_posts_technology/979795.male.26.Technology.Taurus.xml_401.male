Here are some jokes I overheard from teachers during lunch today. Damn farneee...   Joke with regards to uniform.  Students' uniform consist of a blouse (OKOK, that's a shirt to us guys), and a pinnafole over the blouse.  Nurse (to P5 class): OK girls, later on you will need to remove your blouse for the checkup. P5 class: *Moment of silence as the look at the nurse with a blank look.* Student: Err ... so that means later we can leave our pinnafole on, lah? Nurse: o_O" ... (This expression sums it all.) Nurse: No, you need to remove everything later. Class: *Wails...*  *Pengz* ... For guys, that's as good as asking us to remove our underwear with shorts on.   Backpain  An account from one of the teachers during lunch. I didn't catch everything so pardon me if some details are abruptly missed out.  Ms C: ... This girl kept telling me of a sharp pain in her back.  Flashback 1: Girl: I keep feeling this sharp pain in my back, as though there's a knife stuck in my back. Ms C: *Leans over and looks behind* ... No, I don't see any knife behind right now. You seem fine to me.  Ms C: Student still kept making noise or something and walked around dragging her foot behind her because of the 'pain'. In the end called her dad (who so happens to be a Dr) to ask to be taken home early from school. Guess what he said?  Flashback 2: Dad (to daughter over the phone): Don't talk rubbish lah! Stay in school till 3pm lah. I'm not asking you to walk around the whole school from now till 3pm also. Later I pick you at 3.  Ms D: So did the girl inform the nurses about the pain in theback? Ms C: Err... actually it seems like it was the nurses who 'caused' the pain... One of the medical tests was to bend over and try to touch your own toe. That's when she felt the pain after that. Ms D: So what did the nurses say?  Flashback 3: Nurse: HUUUUH?! ... o_O"?!   A separate joke was when I was in the same lab as a group of CCA students with the teacher in charge. One of the girls came in late. Mrs M: How come you're late? Student: It's not my fault.... It's the bus that was late. Mrs M: ... x_O"  I was laughing quietly. If you only saw the girl's expression and heard her tone. She genuinely believed that she was free of all responsibility and fault because 'it was the bus that was late' and not her.  Kids ...
