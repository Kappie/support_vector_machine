I know that you think it is unfair that we decided to have just the blokes going out, but this not an uncommon thing for a load of guys to have a lads night out.  If we had a lads night out but invited one of the girls, Toasterette/girlfriend or both, then we would of course invite all the guys respective ladies and yourself to come and play. The thing is that this isn't a Toaster Files night out but simply a load of us guys doing something that we haven't done for too long a time. I would like to say that I consider us to be good friends and if you do something on Saturday then I will happily come out with you guys. Once again I am sorry for upsetting you for my part in the organization.  P.S. I hope this has not damaged our friendship and I hope we are cool.  Baity signing off.....  'Into Glory Ride'
