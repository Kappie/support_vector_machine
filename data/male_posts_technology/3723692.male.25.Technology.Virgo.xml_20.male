I am still searching for a 3rd party comments box, found couple of vendors but the templates they got simply suck or maybe I am not searching hard enough. Good news I just heard a sec back, funds have transferred yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay. That might just trigger a dinner or something. Btw today its Wimbledon Female’s Singles final but I think I will miss fair part of it. And I am supporting  urlLink Maria Sharapova  “Go Maria Go”. Though it would be sad she will not have her fan cheering her :(.   Now few words in tribute of  urlLink Marlon Brando .  He was a legend and a complete actor. He thrilled millions around the globe with his acting. There can be as good movies as God Father but there wont be any Marlon Brando.  Adious
