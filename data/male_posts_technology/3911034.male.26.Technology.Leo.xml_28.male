The glimpses into the school through following the characters with long steady camera shots was quite weird at first but made sense towards the end. I was even able to work out part of the plan of the school from it. As far as the film as a whole is concerned it was ok, not quite what i'm looking for in a film. I guess I was more impressed with the production side of it. The direction and the way Van Sant used actual students in an actual high school with improvised dialogue was great. Story: 2/5   Production: 5/5   Film: 7/10
