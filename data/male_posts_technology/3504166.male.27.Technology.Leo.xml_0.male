Went out for dinner with Anneliese and noticed that the focus combined with alcohol brought out a lot of the old irritability in me (or maybe that's just her :p).  So we're now on the following leading up to exams:  2.4g of piracetam (800mg x 3 per day) 4.5mg hydergine (2.25mg x 2 per day) 500mg of centrophenoxine (250mg x 2 per day) 15mg vinpocetine (10mg morning, 5mg evening)  The effects I have noticed so far: * increased ability to recall * increased ability to visualise * am feeling much more introspective * have some strange uber-focus * colours seem more vivid, especially at night * lack of tiredness  Let's see how it goes!
