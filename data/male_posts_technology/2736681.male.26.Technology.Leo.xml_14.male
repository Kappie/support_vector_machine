He quotes someone as saying the Everquest virtual goods market is worth several million dollars a year, which is a nice little market by any standards. He proposes a martial-law type of solution for their fraud problem which, although perhaps dubious from a "who guards the guards" perspective, is pretty cool. That such a scheme can be suggested is pretty neat.  This probably interests me because I spent a large part of the weekend revisiting my RPG past...
