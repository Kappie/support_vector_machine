If we can use the cust id to id service usage and tie back to revenue.  All service revenue comes from Finance (Bill-TO id), but the usage info is more critical (market segment is needed to map the parent company/child companies market segments)  Monitoring performance and usage of programs, rollups by segment/market/contract type, contract hierarchy missing...ERBI has some of the service hierarchy data  -- Phase II : MArketing Spin - Business analysis and metrics- programs to keep/not keep; rolled up customers by program  -- Not sure about the GPS side of things, Julie SHottman/ Angie Blum  - Support the deals - negotiating contracts - views of customer usage  - Boundary reporting systems may have additional needs in the June timeframe
