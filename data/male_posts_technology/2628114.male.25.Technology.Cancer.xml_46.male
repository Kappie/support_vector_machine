I went out for two main reasons.  1. I was itching to get back out and run.  2. This would be one of the last gorgeous days before the cicadas invade that I could run.    The run was short but good.  I am actually still a little sore in my knees from the marathon but nothing intolerable.  I ventured down Madison to the Running Spot and back.  I thought it was funny to still see remnants of the marathon in the form of discarded GU packs and orange peels.  I didn't really feel like stretching too much so I stretched briefly before and really none afterward.  I was mainly just happy to be back out running.  Warm weather is nice in which to run to say the least.  A little hot, but great.    I applied for the NYC marathon on Friday and I will find out if I made it in by mid-June.  If I make it in, I will start hardcore training in July.  Stay tuned for more!
