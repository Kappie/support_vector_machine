In anarchist theory, Anarchy is a society of true equals: having no governmental hierarchy. No one has the authority to order anyone to do anything. Everything is accomplished by mutual consent.   RATIONAL ANARCHISM: The Rational Anarchist recognizes the inevitability of hierarchy in human organizations. Our very evolution as a species, is one of groups or packs with hierarchical dominance. As anarchists, we insist on the dominance of individual intelligence and personal will over that of the hierarchy. The rationally though, we recognize the need for these hierarchies. We recognize that all societies have rules and regulations (not all of them written). We also recognize that breaking them may result in extreme penalties.   Rules will, and must exist. We recognize that. We also reserve the right to break those rules. In doing so, we fully accept the consequences of our actions. As members of a society, desiring the benefits that accrue to that membership; we voluntarily submit ourselves to the governance of said society to this extent: wherever those rules conflict with those of personal freedom, we may break those rules. We reserve the right to determine for ourselves whether any laws, conventions, mores, or social codes apply to us. The determining factor is not self-interest, but our personal code or philosophy. This may sound contradictory, but it is not. If we are caught, we will be punished. If the society is "free" we will defend ourselves to the fullest extent of the law. If it is not, we may defend ourselves with violent action. Again, we accept the consequences. The ultimate rule, is the rule of self.  The rule of self, is one of self-discipline not self-indulgence. The Rational Anarchist recognizes that principle must take priority over personal desire. He may follow society’s rules, but he does it out of pride in himself and his principles, not because of any outside coercion.   The true Rational Anarchist is an idealist. He believes that society can better itself. He believes in the cause of Civilization. By Civilization we mean that nebulous "thing" that is society’s attempt to improve the lot of all its citizens. This improvement must be in the all three of the areas of physical security, physical well being, and finally personal freedom. A reduction in any of these areas is a setback for civilization. One other important note. Freedom is not license. Just because one can do something does not me he is free to do it. If by doing it, he reduces some one else’s rights or freedom, he is wrong to proceed.      Kind of says it all, doesn't it?
