My mum was a ventriloquist and she always was throwing her voice. For ten years I thought the dog was telling me to kill my father.  I've often wanted to drown my troubles, but I can't get my wife to go swimming.  I was doing some decorating, so I got out my step-ladder. I don't get on with my real ladder.  A cement mixer collided with a prison van on the Kingston Pass. Motorists are asked to be on the lookout for 16 hardened criminals.  Well I was bullied at school, called all kinds of different names. But one day I turned to my bullies and said - 'Sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me', and it worked! From there on it was sticks and stones all the way.  My Dad used to say 'always fight fire with fire', which is probably why he got thrown out of the the fire brigade.  Sex is like a game of bridge: If you don't have a good partner, you better have a good hand.  I saw six men kicking and punching my mother-in-law. My neighbour said 'Are you going to help?' I said 'No, six should be enough."  If we aren't supposed to eat animals, then why are they made out of meat?  Politicians are wonderful people as long as they stay away from things they don't understand, such as working for a living.
