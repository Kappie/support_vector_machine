Sometimes you manage to talk to someone on the internet that is so stubborn and stupid that you just want to reach through the monitor and strangle some sense into him or her.  Its like talking to a fucking wall with these people - they won't acknowledge when they're wrong, their opinion won't change, and NOTHING you can say to them will change that!  So frustrating.
