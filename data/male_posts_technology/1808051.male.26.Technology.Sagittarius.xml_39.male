(oh wait not our mgr, the person that thinks he is our mgr)  So I had to go to "Joy Ruck, How I helpa yooou?"  The fortune that was with the food was by far the worst   ever  !  "In GOD we trust, all others pay cash" oh and it was in spanish too at the chinese restaurant? " En DIOS confiamos, los demas pagan en efectivo"  Yes it was in italics too.  I bet that if you played to loto numbers on the back you would have to pay the loto winnings!  "And tonights losing numbers are.... 6... 5...  14...  33... 36... and 49! If you got all 6 numbers right please come and pay us 10 milions dollars!"
