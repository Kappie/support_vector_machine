I used to get their #6 (basic veggie sub) all of the time, but switched to the #5 (the Vito, an Italian sub comprised of salami, capicola, provolone, veggies and vinaigrette) after my first taste.  The site has  urlLink nutritional information .  The Vito weighs in at 24 grams of fat and 562 calories.  The veggie weighs in at 35 (!) grams of fat and 671 calories.  When I first started eating at Jimmy John's my freshman year (4 years ago, sigh), I always got the Gargantuan.  46 grams of fat and 892 calories.  Ooops.
