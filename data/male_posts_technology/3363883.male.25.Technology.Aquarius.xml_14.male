I have managed to keep myself busy by not smoking and actualy not drinking but instead going out with people and going for bike rides.  I haven't actually got around to the gym but that is only because I simply haven't had the free time.  So that's always a good thing.  My big buys this week was a new pair of football boots [Â£35] for the astroturf that I play on once a week.  In no way do I expect it to make me a better player in any way, however it will make me less of a comical player.  At the moment I start of running like Road Runner with my legs spinning in circles underneath me until my shoes finally get some grip.  There's nothing like contesting a ball to find that I'm sliding four metres past my opponent giving them a free ball.  I also got around to seeing Van Hellsing this week.  The verdict?  Absolutely Brilliant.  I was stunned as you would be by this.  I thought it would be allright, but it ended up being thoroughly entertaining.  Sure, you leave your brain at the door and there are some incredibly cheesy moments.  I chose to believe that the director intentionally made the movie this cheesy which makes the film far more entertaining than if it was all serious.  Kate Beckinsale did absolutely nothing for me thought.  Her accent was pretty poor and she was wearing very unflattering clothes the whole time.  I found hugh jackman far more attractive in his more dashing outfit of wearing just pants.  Trust me when I say I'm a lot more disturbed by this than you are.  This week, all I have planned is a couple of bike rides, a spot of golf [for the first time ever which should be fun], the occasional barbeque and watching some football [eurocup England vs France].  While it doesn't seem like much, I have no doubt it will end up taking up most of my time.  Due to not smoking, and stress over kristen and aggrivating hayfever, my sleep is absolutely shot.  No matter what time I go to bed, I am guaranteed to be up between three and five.  It's dawn here at 4:30 so I have managed to watch the sun rise for the last 4 mornings.  It's been nice, but I'll be honest, I'd rather trade it for some precious sleep which seems to be just lacking at the moment.  Thank god it's friday.
