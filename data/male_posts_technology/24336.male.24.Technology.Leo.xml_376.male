The single player mode is a bit dry so far, but I only played for an hour!  I really can't decide whether or not I like it.  The interface is a bit clunky due to the Sims-esque circular navigation.  If you haven't played either of these games, the navigation starts by clicking on an object (right-clicking for NWN).  The click brings up circular icons in a circular pattern around whatever you clicked.  You are then required to click on one of these circular icons.  If there is more than one such level of navigation, a new set of circular icons in a circular pattern pops up.  If not, then your selection has been made.  Belanger and I discussed the merits of this game and decided that multiplayer games with a DM on an isolated server are where this game will shine.  People are going to start making modules soon, too.  This could be the next Counterstrike.
