I didn't make any this year, but I want to make a couple now.   1) My life has been consumed by (a) working during the day and (b) writing books on nights and weekends. The unfortunate casualty of this has been my free time. I still make time (regardless of whatever deadlines I may have) for my wife, but I need to make time for myself. I have a pile of books on my bookshelf that remain unread. I still buy books (mainly from Amazon.ca), but I can't read them. And I have a pile of movies on my hard drive that need to be watched. This will free several gigabytes of space once I watch them and delete them.  2) I had a year of steady work to concentrate on picking up a new skill, like J2EE or .NET. But have I made use of that time? No, not really. Note to self, your skills is what puts food in your stomach. Don't neglect them.  Scott
