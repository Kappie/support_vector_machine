In this case the imagined part came at 2:30 am on a recent sleepless night.  At the time it was magical, but when I started writing it was hard to make the symbolism work coherently.  The words didn't flow, they more correctly fell out onto the page with a thud and much breakage.  After several messy drafts and discarding spurious metaphors, here it is.  This is certainly not my best writing, but this is as good as it will get right now.  Maybe I will revisit this in 5 years when I get my first anthology published. ;-)     Opposite Cats  it was a grey morning, a foggy day, the sky and the concrete, both sullen grey. a grey tabby watches, mildly curious  as two cats stare at each other  a black cat on the fence, a white cat under the car  a human would find it bizarre, I think, opposing cats staring from afar,  waiting for the other to blink... like gunslingers before high noon.  time freezes, the world stops, tension created. issues of feline importance are debated  telepathically, as the temperature drops.   fight or flight left or right hiss or growl sleep or prowl  kill a bird, or a mouse in, or out of the house be lovable, or aloof climb a tree, or scale the roof  guard the yard, or stay on the fence run, or engage in homeland defence sleep all day, carouse all night   two cats staring, one black, one white.  the moment passes, the fog melts away the two cats decide to gracefully back down they'll settle their differences another day,  there's more important things to be done, like cleaning and chasing and eating food and sleeping all day, if one's in the mood.  the grey tabby lingers, watching, content to be in between two extremes, and then indifferently turns away.
