The only thing worse than being mundane is reading about someone else's mundanity (made up word, but I like it).  One thing that just occurred to me is: Many of the songs, movies, name-brands, or people I dislike are a direct result of my insecurities, and my associating those things with other people having a good time when I am not, therefore fuckkem. Kinda stupid, but true. Two examples: 1) I will never buy a Dodge pickup becaue their commercials epitomize an arrogant, bigger is better, my vehicle represents my manhood, tough-guy male stereotype. 2) There is an 80's song, can't think of the artist or title, but it has the line "you really know how to dance" and was used in Bud commercials. I hate that song and can never listen to it.  I may explore this more in the near future.  Wouldn't it be ironic if this post were several hundred words long?  Not much to say, indeed.  I just needed to prime the pump.
