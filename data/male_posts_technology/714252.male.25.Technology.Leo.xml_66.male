Went to a Salsa thing in cork on Saturday (Which was the reason for my bitter twisted post I made on Saturday morning.) to hand out flyers for the Bundoran weekend (you know you want to go, all the cool people are going!) and had a mad weekend..  First off I went to an intermediate class that had an emphasis on "leading and following".. That was "interesting" to say the least but I have to say it really was quite good :)  Then Dinner with Daddy and Salsa teacher (yes, Helena.. Shut your mouth fat-ass) and on to a Salsa partay! The Night started out slowly but a few drinks later and Helena convinces me to enter the bloody Salsa competition. I end up entering the beginer level with another lady who has only had one class and had a great time :) We also came second which was GREAT.. The winner had been dancing for Just under a year so they had a LOT more moves than we did :) My partner was well chuffed :)  Anywho.. too tired to continue, going to bed for the moment :)
