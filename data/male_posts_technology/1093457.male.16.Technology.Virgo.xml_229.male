Just think of hiroshima, all tehm people dies, we are close to london and that is gonna be the main place for an attack? They would get the royals and all the cabinit as well ! Im slightly afraid that if this war goes ahead then we are gonna alll die and painfully as well ! Not to make you all feel bad but im just slightly worried ! LOL Well anywho we better live our lives to the full now cause we mite not be aound for much longer With Love jackie ! x x x x x x Anywho Back to more exciting matters ? How are you all? Have you all got your stuff for the ball ? And are you looking forward to Natalies and Darrens party? I sure am cause its gonna be fun dont ya think ? And is it just me or are you finding it hard to motivate yourself to do the work set and coursework and stuff, i find it soo boring and i just feel like: Whats the point !
