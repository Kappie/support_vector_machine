Meet a boy from my primary school that i havent seen for 5 years ! It was nice seeing him after all that time. The film was great, lots of action and suspence, although i do believe that the first film was better as it woz more interesting. Now all i have to do is wait until The Matrix Revolutions comes out in Novemeber. Well for those of you that went to Jo. C birthday party, did you have fun? or woz andy's party better? Big Brother has finally arrived, YAY. I already hate one of the housemates called anouska, she is so annoying and loud, she is up for eviction so that is good. Well im off to bed now so byebye.
