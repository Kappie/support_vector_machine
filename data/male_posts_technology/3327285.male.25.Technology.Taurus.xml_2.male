Monday I came into work pissed off from the obvious oversight that my boss made the week before in handing my job to someone other than me and realized that I had a 3-hour website developer's class to attend.  So that was a bit of a plus, seeing as this meant I didn't have to be in my building for the first half of the day.  Anything to keep my distance from the ball of negativity that has built up over here.  Anyway, so I attend this class, fully expecting it to just be cut and dry nonsense that I already knew, when I came to find out that the company is going to be creating a web developers position, and that I was the lead candidate for it.  Naturally I was high as a kite with this info.  I just came off of a bad weekend, and now, suddenly, I forgot the travesty of not getting the promotion.  So this made for a very good morning.  Then, once class was over and I got back to work, my boss pulled me into the office and asked me to pick out my co-worker.  Basically he felt that since I KNOW what is best for my department, that I should be the one to pick the team.  So I got to pick my co-worker that I have been trying hard to get over here.  Bonus happiness for me.  Now, I hear that not only do both of my girlfriend's children have ear infections, but now the youngest has a rash caused by the medicine she was given to combat it.  Not only that, but my grandmother informed me that my grandpa had a pacemaker installed to help regulate his heartbeat.  Great, so now I can only hope that equally momumental highs are in store for me, otherwise the title for this blog is quite false, wouldn't you say?
