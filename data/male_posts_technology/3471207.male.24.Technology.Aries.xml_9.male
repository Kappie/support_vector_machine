When i woke up i couldn't get back to sleep even though i lied on the bed for 2 hours. The feeling was quite bad. It was definitely because of yesterday's tennis game where i played 2.5 hours in the morning. So it was exertion that caused the sickness coupled with the sun's rays. Also, this meant that i rested the whole day. I don't know whether it's normal but when i rest, i can't get to sleep. I guess i've not had a fever for quite some time so i don't know whether it's normal. Tonight i hope i can really sleep. Actually i just came back from seeing the doctor. Besides the standard cough mixture, antibiotics and panadol, i also asked for sleeping pills. Wow it's $3.50 per pill and i got 5 of them...grr didn't know it was so expensive. In the end i paid $40 but as i had not enough money i had to go to the ATM to draw out some. Now that i'm sick, everything seems to go slower..when i was walking to the docs, the scene was very serene and i could see other people in their "house clothes" walking either to the nearby market or walking back to their blocks. The atmosphere was kinda relaxed and my breathing was calm and slow. At least this is one of the good things of getting a fever. It puts me away from the stressful lifestyle of always being efficient and productive and gets me to slow down.
