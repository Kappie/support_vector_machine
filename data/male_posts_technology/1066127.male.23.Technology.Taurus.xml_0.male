Especially Dane and Greg and Lisa's parents who really helped to put everything together and make sure that everything ran so smoothly. Even with the groom to be and his family managing to get completely lost and arrive 2 hours late... (though if anyone needs a good shortcut to New Millford, I can provide) Thank you to everyone for coming and for all your congratulations and thoughtful gifts.
