Folks not initiated to carnatic or any form of classical music find it boring (and old fashioned and not 'happening' and...) . Just a small matter of familiarity and exposure. Friends in college introduced me to english music with MLTR, BSB, Roxette, Bryan Adams, Savage Garden, Alanis Morisette and that gave myself a rough idea of the kind of music I like and then on get the confidence to choose. Happened to bump into a classical (really old style) guru and am clinging on to him to appreciate the classical art form. I surprize myself by appreciating them too.  Classical music is bound by so many rules. So many rules that you wonder has it got any scope for creativity at all. But when you see a performance, involving atleast 3 accompanyists, its amazing how they synchronize with each other's creativity 'cos unlike western compositions, here they dont have a clearly jotted out 'Notes'. Must listen to Chaurasia to be mesmerized by a vibrating air column. He sets the sound to flow and our minds afloat.  Now, to why music ?  Out of college and into the industry ? Do we get a chance to appreciate things other this browser window ? Other than the chat client ? more interesting things like a nice sunrise ? enjoy the evening rains ? Music is one such experience, all you need is a pair of headphones and a mind which can appreciate. Neither unreachable. And you're out of the routine. And when you can create it, say singing, or playing an instrument, all by yourself... wow. Exciting isnt it. I find many of my colleagues all 22-28 starting out on some instrument. It is not for performance on stage or as a career option, it is to enjoy the learning experience. The thrill to imitate a famous composition, the thrill to create one of one's own which doesnt seem to be a racket any longer... ecstatic.  Disclaimer (before it gets boring): This blog is not to initiate others into music, it is for others who are already initiated into some kind of music to agree and/or argue with my thoughts.      ps: 'Why Technology...' will be posted some other day, you are sufficiently warned !! :)
