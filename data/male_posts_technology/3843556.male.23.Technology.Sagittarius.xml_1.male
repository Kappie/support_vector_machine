We are so similar that we would look like mirror images of the other. We started of with a couple of beers and then vodka which was followed by a few shots of tequilla. Knowing my capacity, I played the game slow. A few hours and yessss, our special guest of the night Rev.Kabali was all ready to unleash upon the world few of his hidden thoughts.   Kabs grew up in Madras. He spent a few years away from madras cuz of his schooling but nevertheless returned back to Madras where his heart felt close to home. He later came to the US to pursue his masters. He has loved his life all along. He made friends everywhere he went and nobody could ever not like this guy. He has had his ups  downs in life but nothing could change the fact that he loved every bit of it.   His roots are from Kerala. A small village close to Guruvayoor was where his ancestors lived. But then a few decades ago his grandparents decided to leave Kerala and move to Madras for good. A decision that Mr.K would thank his grandparents for  the rest of his life. I wondered what the big deal was. Well, I did get it after his detailed account on what his life could have been. An interesting piece it is...chatambi govindan vs. funky k-Dawg   Chatambi Govindan was named govindan kutty by his parents. He could have been anything from saju,siju,biju to gopu,achu. He spent the younger days of his life running around half naked in the lush green paddy fields and the vast stretch of banana plantations. He walked to school everyday singing songs and exchanging exciting stories about his cows with his friends. He grew up on fresh milk. He was such a "sucker" for milk that it go into him straight from the cow. Naa, you fools in the city bother way too much about boiling it and stuff. I know my 'lakshmi' gives the best milk. Safer then your fat city cows...Hmmmm what can we say??? Our city boy Kabs grew up playing with the few toys that were given to him. His favourite toy would be what he called "chaii papam"(which was a tiny tricyle). His early attempts to walk very extremely painful. Every step he took, he fell "thhuddd" on the concrete floor. Not to mention the ammmmmmmaaaaaaaaa that followed. He travelled to school on a rickshaw with four other girls(damnnnn.. lucky son o' $%*#). He would lie to them through his nose. Tales of how he was superman and spiderman and what not. And what do you think, the stupid gals bought every bit of his bullshit. Milk to Kabs was like poison. But with a touch of boost or bournvita it went straight from yuck to yummmy.   Govindan grew up quick into this energetic teen. But then, all the youthful energy was spent for causes other than good. He had his first taste of kallu aka arack at the age of 14. To complement it he also developed a new found love for dinesh beedi. He loved his lungi and singing romantic songs from tree tops was his speciality. The girls of his town dreaded him. He was already charged with 4 counts of ever-teasing. On the other hand city boy Kabs was deprived of such worldy pleasures. He went to this Christian school where he was being moulded into a gentleman. Kabs hardly got to see girls. He studied in a all boys school and the few women he did get to see were atleast three times his age. He then had no choice but to resort to helping himself. There wasn't a day in his life where he had forgotten to thank GOD almighty for the good things in life like debonair, fantasy and playboy. He now fully understood the meaning of the proverb "Self help is the best help". He had this HUGE crush on this gal which never came close to materializing. Gov on the other hand had no such worries. Emotional attachement was taboo in the world of G.   G-Man dropped out of school after three failed attempts in 10th grade. He was the prominent figure in every strike that swept mallu land for the years to come. Mr.K on the other hand went on to do his engineering. He made many new friends, which  included many many girls. All the girls thought he was a sweetheart( little did they know of the other side of him). Don't blame the poor kid. He was after all making up for all those lost years. He had big plans of flying to the US. At last Mr.K had a girl friend who went by the name of Thirupura Sundari aka sundeli(which means little rat  he called her so with affection). Every other person who knew him thought they looked like a horse and a donkey being brought together(ps:The k-man says he will play the donkey...nice guy, how can you not like him). But the two of them enjoyed every bit of their new found love. Their favourite spots were the nearby temple, pallavan or an ocassional movie or COFFEE DAY or T.Nagar(what were they thinkin'..didn't they find better places..sighhh). He even received generous offers to two-time but good old K decided otherwise(wat a loser huh). Years rolled by and it was time for Kabs to fly out to the US. Kabs was soon to become da K-Dawg (wtf is that????). He ended up breaking up with sundeli due to irreconcilable differences, details of which they refuse to divulge fearing they would lose their privacy(the effect hollywodd can have on the common man). G-Man was by now the hottest property in town for all the wrong reasons. He had tasted all the evil pleasures life had to offer(K envies him to the core). He was only 20 but was already the proud owner of Kalyani Kutty Wines(that was to keep his distant aunt happy...her daughter was what he calls "a work of art by god"). She was probably the only bootiful girl who had not fallen into his net. His had very exciting business plans which drew the attention of many venture capitalists. A club(like the ones you get to see in mallu films where all the bad guys play cards and half naked women dancing),mutton stall, ganja and ofcourse his own political party were a few to mention.   Ufff..after all these years of struggle, K-Dawg(that is what he calls himself now) was in the land oppurtunity. No more of Coffee day, T.Nagar or Pallavan. K would only visit bars, pubs, clubs and not to forget the strip clubs. He like G-Man began building on his list of names. He moved on from Jenna(not Jameson) to Monique to Chinky Lee to Jigisa Patel while G had his lekshmi,ammu,ladhiga,kunjama..etc. He had a big heart and never did he discriminate. If you were short of love all you had to do was visit K-Dawg. He was the universal symbol of true love and byooty. His tastes in music included Pachas Cent, MM and Snoop da Kutha. Our G-Man on the other hand was the same. He still loved his kallu(Black Label  Old Monk made him throw up..now that is what you call a true indian). The last few years had transformed into a super-hero. He got anything he wished for(including kalyani kutty's daughter). He was a regular to all the poorams in the state. His usual line being "Eda Josapa, nammaluku poorathilu ithiri shine cheeyanam". And yeah, not to forget he was also the favourite to win the next election. It had taken him years of hard work and he had finally qualified. 3 murder charges, 7 rapes, 11 robberies(which includes 4 banks)were a few to mention. Here was K-dawg attending interviews and negotiating his compensation in terms of 50 and 60k and there was G-Man negotiating 15k for the left hand and 25k for the right hand. If you wanted to pack the guy straight to heaven he would for no less than 50k (he also had board that read rates are subjected to change without notice). So who is ur man..K-Man or G-man?? Let me know.
