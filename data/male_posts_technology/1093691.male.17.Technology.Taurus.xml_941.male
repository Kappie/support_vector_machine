Thats my first lay in since I started work at Woolies! Today I tried to do some work but my brain wouldn't concentrate and I ended up either sleeping or watching Lord Of the Rings. I didn't go on the comp once! Not until now so i must be ill! LOL. Hoep I didn't miss much, hope ya'll had a better day than I!!!!
