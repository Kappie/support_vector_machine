Both days went horribly unsuccessful - Rita cried practically the entire time, except for the times she decided to take a nap to recharge for more crying.  The experience has been hard on both myself and Marina and we're possibly contemplating stopping the whole experiment if she doesn't get used to the environment in the next week.  Maybe she's just too little at this stage.  The very first day daycare was open, but very few kids showed up.  We decided not to stay and when leaving the daycare, Rita decided to step off the sidewalk on her own.  That was mistake number one.  I thought to follow Marina's advice and "let her do it" - that was mistake number two.  The third mistake came when Rita went down on her face, right into the hard asphalt... in front of our eyes.  Ouch!!!  Once we calmed her down and cleaned her up - we saw that she scraped a good part of her face, under her nose and on her nose :  I just hope this daycare experiment doesn't end badly...
