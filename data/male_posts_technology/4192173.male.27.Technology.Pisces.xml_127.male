According to The Sun newspaper, the pair met by chance at the Electric Cinema in London’sNotting Hill. "We got talking about music and agreed we should do something," explained Brown . He added: "Noel sent me some music he’d done and I recorded a vocal. The result is brilliant, I’m really excited. I hope it will be a single." The news comes after denials from the Oasis camp that Liam was to form a supergroup with ex-Roses guitarist John Squire. As previously reported onNME.COM, the band claim the story was "dreamed up" by editorial staff atThe Sun. Oasis are currently working in the studio on the follow-up to ’Heathen Chemistry’, which is due for release later this year. Brown’s new album is expected in August or September.
