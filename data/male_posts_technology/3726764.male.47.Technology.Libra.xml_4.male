I got my mail read and getting things together to go up and spend a few days at the lake. Hope to be gone before noon. I'll be back prolly Wednesday to feed my fish (2 bettas and several different kinds of tetras) and check my mail and prolly wash a few clothes. Then I'll go back up Thursday or Friday for the weekend. Tom and Becky and the kids are flying in to the Cities from Ohio and renting a car and driving up Friday. Hope they have a nice sunny dry week of vacation. My Sumsmer class starts a week from tomorrow and I want to get some serious fishing and vacationing in before then. It's only a 1 month class running from 8:30 to noon on Monday through Thursday so I could still spend a few long weekends up there. Then I have a break before Fall classes start. I think about 3 weeks. That's it for now. Today's thought of the day is from Albert Einstein:                  "We cannot solve our problems with             the same level of thinking that created them."                       ~ Albert Einstein ~  Makes sense, doesn't it. Such a statement tells me to "think outside the box"...the basis for linear thinking...something I always try to do.
