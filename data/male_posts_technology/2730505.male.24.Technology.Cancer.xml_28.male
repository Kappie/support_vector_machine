From RMA-ing a bad switch, replacing a thin client, installing software to catching up on some  urlLink IT news   Lotsa small things to do but finally was able to finish them.  Tuesday holds more excitement at work, YEAH!  Will be renting Lost in Translation for Tuesday night's movie viewing.  Got a couple of recommendations and apparently I've been living under a rock because I have never heard of the damn movie and it's got 4 nominations for that gold statue they award people for doing a good job in film.  I dunno.  I guess that's really it.  Tis was a good weekend.  Left the XBOX at Jerry's since it'll get a little more action plus it's a nice house warming "rental" for the time being.  I still gotta finish KOTOR and apparently I have to get on every magazine cover for NFSU.  Started playing Halo again.  Last thing I have heard about that game is that it's not going to be released till fucking Christmas (at least that's what GI said).  Man that sucks!  So along with Half Life 2, both these games better be fucking UNREAL.  Call of Duty should also be ported over to the XBOX.  I especially enjoy it when someone gets killed, there's a replay from the person that killed you point of view so that you can tell if they were cheating or cherry picking or what not.  It really evens it out so even the best locations are going to be discovered since they're being replayed to the person who died.  Everyone has to keep moving, there's no ultimate hiding spot.  (YAWN) time for bed, long day tomorrow.  Gotta make up hours missed at work.  Have a good one.
