I will be making a few websites and trashing that old angelfire site. i will just use those sites for hosting and all the links will be here. So I guess this is the new hub or "homepage." The sites I'm making are: -anime episode guides and reviews -picture galleries -alt codes -japanese tutorials and info (As I am learning) -go stuff  the sites will be made in that order, but im not promising anything.    Alt code of the day- alt 456-â•š
