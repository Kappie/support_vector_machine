As I dont get enough time reading and replying blog I just deploy floppy to transfer docs from office to home. when my brain starts working my floppy does not and when my floppy starts working  I dont  get time. When everything is fine, sad that I travel outside coimbatore. Let me get a wi-fi Latptop soon.   So I thought If not today then it is going to be never. Rini that was a faux pas. yes it was the cost and not the price that I referred. When the cost goes up, adding to that my production units are fixed, naturally my quality comes down. Hope u would appreciate.  Kicha sorry da once again my floppy didnt work. Bear with me dears because I am a sales guy, will not get enough time to sit and type.  chottu  Try to work smart; the day u feel u cant, start working hard.  good luck frenz
