But I still can't break properly its pretty embarassing, and sometimes I tend to miss the ball completely.  Need to practice more. Oh and I gave him a burned copy of Mars Volta album. He's the 2nd guy that I gave it too. It's a little crazy but I really want everyone I know to listen to the album, its just so damm amazing. Hopefully if they like it they will buy the original album and support them. Yeah I am a dreamer.  Oh and bought a couple of stuff. First was a book from MPH ,"Bioinformatics for Dummies" (it's for work) and the other is Audioslave's self-titled album which I am listening to now.
