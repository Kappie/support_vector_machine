I loved hearing it but I had to tell her it would be a few more weeks.  We talked about the circus coming to Houston and how I was going to try to take her to the water park and stuff.  She was so excited she was yelling at   SFW   about what daddy was going to take her to do.  We told some stories to each other nothing special just made up "once upon a time" stories.  Karissa told me about her new bear (the one I linked to in a previous post) she said she liked it so so so so so much and she slept with it every night.    Karissa accidently hung up on me a couple of times but I called her back and stuff.  Once of the times I called Karissa back I got   SFW   on the phone.  I asked her about the CS and what we talked about.  Her exact phrase was   "I am too tired to fight with you about it so that is fine.  If I tell you no you will keep arguing with me about it so it is easier to say fine"  I simply said ok I will send you an email to that effect if you would plese reply to it stating that you agree that would be appreciated.  I then talked to Karissa some more and we hung up because Karissa had to go to dinner.  She said she would call me back but did not but that was OK as we talked for a long time today.
