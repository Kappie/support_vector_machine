There are a lot of sites out there taking about how nice it looks - have they actually used it or just loaded the page? It seems to be badly broken.    urlLink Searches  haven't worked since yesterday and the link to profiles just stopped working. I needed to go and get some new code. Not a huge problem but it would be nice if they could have let users know that the links they have back to Technorati are useless. Oh and New Links was no longer registered as belonging to anyone - I had to reclaim it. And now I can't log in at all. At least when Blogger rolled out their redeisgn it came with loads of new features and took a while to settle down. Technorati seems to have introduced no new features just a new skin so what's their excuse?  Still not to worry - it looks nice.
