It's got a cool interface thats very snappy.  It's a little confusing, but I'm sure it's just a matter of getting used to it.  The 1G inbox had me drooling for weeks.  I was just looking at all the folders I had with my yahoo mail.  Yikes.  I heard someone saying that their dealing with attachments still needs some work.  I do know that I had played around with sending a Word doc and that was fine.  But I liked the way they lay out attachment info when you get one.  And I liked the zippiness of when you reply/forward and how the frames 'jump' to life.  Cool.  A nice perk to using blogspot.
