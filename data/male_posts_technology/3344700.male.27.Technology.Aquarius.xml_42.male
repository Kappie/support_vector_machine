I have to admit this is a must have site for your favorites collections.     http://www.pinvoke.net/     About the site  PINVOKE.NET attempts to address the difficulty of calling Win32 or other unmanaged APIs in managed code (languages such as C# and VB .NET). Manually defining and using PInvoke signatures (also known as Declare statements in VB) is an error-prone process that can introduce extremely subtle bugs. The rules are complex, and if you make a mistake, youâ€™ll probably corrupt memory.  It's time to stop writing PInvoke signatures from scratch! Instead, copy and paste your way to productivity!  Another very cool site for those of us who can not recall the value(s) of a ADO or ADO.NET connection string     http://www.connectionstrings.com
