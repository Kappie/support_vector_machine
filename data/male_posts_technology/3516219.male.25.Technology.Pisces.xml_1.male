Dutch politicians in general always like to use Brussels as an argument when debating in national politics. I myself found that when they feel that their position is under fite, they tend to blame brussels for the decisions made in the past. The same thing happens in municipal-counsel debates, they blame the government in the Hague. I myself am a true believer of a unified europe, one europe with many cultures, wich has unity as it strength, but still maintains local governments... The single currency, sjengen, maastricht and other conventions have given us the unity to function as one country. Europeans are doing great things at the moment. In Toulouse we are building the worlds largest passenger jet for commercial operations (The Airbus A380). European products are becoming more and more advanced, more and more commonplace around the world and above all more "European". I pledge for an even stronger european union consisting of all the eastern european nations, Russia and Turkey. The Russians have done a lot of work in the field of research, and have a lot of technology waiting to be implemented in products. Europe is the continent of thinkers and scientists, we all know that great minds work the best.... when they work together!
