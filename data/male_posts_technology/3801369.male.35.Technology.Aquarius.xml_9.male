You can get the software  urlLink here  (free, of course), and call me by clicking on  Skype Me! .  Much of the buzz around this software originates from the fact that it was developed by the founders of  urlLink Kazaa  peer-to-peer file sharing software.  There's an article about Skype  urlLink here .
