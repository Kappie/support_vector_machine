I also recently picked up City of God which is also a fantastic movie about living in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. It has fantastic story and really pretty cinamtograpy. In other news the great web comic  urlLink Goats  is trying to raise money just as  urlLink Something Positive  did a while back. I recommend checking out goats and reading the archives and if you enjoy it donating a dollar or two.
