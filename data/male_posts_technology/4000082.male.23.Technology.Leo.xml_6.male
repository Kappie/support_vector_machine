I played it for an hour or so and suddenly realised I should blog this...WHY?Because there is an important lesson embedded into the game. Only you have to look through it and not just play the game.  Max Payne is the lead character in the game...a honest and upcoming police officer living with his beautiful wife and his healthy  baby. Everything was so perfect...his family...his friends...his job and all. But what happens when a man is scraped out with all that  is perfect in his life...what will he do if his wife, child and his dearest friend dies and what happens if he was purposefully framed  and lost his job...What would you do in such a situation. Turn to an astrologer...Wait until the next big oppurtunity comes...Cry over  your misfortunes...Hurt everyone by sad words. That's the typical mindset.  Let us take another scene from a famous movie "PAYBACK" by Mel Gibson. He was cheated by his girlfriend...shot by his friend,  stripped of his money and washed out his dreams and came to a near death experience. What else is left in his Life? He is lying in  the road with blood oozing from his viens and half unconsious and witnessing his own girlfriend running away with his dearest  friend whom he had put all his trust...What will he do now? What future can you predict at this guy...What can be recovered and  What hope can you give a man at this stage of Life??? What is common in both their lives...they are at the bottomest pit of their lives with nobody to help...nobody to catch when they fall  back and nobody to give hope. But what do they do...they decide not to cry over spilled milk or broken eggs...they decide to fight back...they decide to come  up....they decide to overcome their fears of future and overcome their weakness.  At this point a guy has nothing to lose...he gets up. His only goal in his Life is to find who did this to him. That's it...he is  concentrating so much in his goal that he ignores or removes whatever hindrance comes in his path...no matter whom...no matter  what...,and no matter when the negative force strikes you. People should have this ability to bootstrap with nobody's help and come up in Life. There are times when you are pushed to the limits...pushed against the wall...dumped into a ditch and made to eat the dust from  your peers and higherups. These times are oppurtunites to get to know "Who you really are?" and "What material you really are  made up of?". What happens to a buoy (which is floating alone in the sea) when you push it. It comes back....push it down harder...it will come  back with double the force...push it to the depths of the sea bed...IT WILL COME BACK WITH A JUGGERNAUT FORCE that you  don't know what happened and you don't know what hit you. Such is the power of setting goals and to be one-tracked like a horse in a race where it can see only one direction...When you set a  goal...focus and go for it...your path is clear there is nothing in this god damn world...no creature...no power...no human being and  no physical thing that can stop you from attaining it. I am not saying that something bad should happen in your life to be successful...All I am saying is that at difficult times this blog  may help you to rise and remind you that there is always hope when you set a goal and pursue it with dogged determination and  dedication and that you have many facets of your life still to be explored...all you need to do is channel it in the right directiion and  ignore and fight back the negative forces that hinder your path and influence your goal. I think I got you pumped up such that you can face any worst situation in your life and still stay on track Until the next blog..See ya and BEST OF LUCK
