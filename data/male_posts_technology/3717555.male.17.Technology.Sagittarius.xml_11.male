Sure I believe that the oil peak will throw us into a 30's-like depression, but they are underestimating the human nature. We adapt, we've always done so and there is no reason why we can't do so again. It's not like we run out of steel or so, and the hubbert peak assumes that the demand for oil is static. As the oil prices increase the demand will drop, and so the oil supply will diminish slower then hubbert anticipates, and during this period people WILL work like crazy to find a replacement. In fact, if it wasn't for the oil crash in the 70's bumping renewable energy research we'd be pretty screwed now.  Recently found some pretty  urlLink interesting reading  about hemp, and it's possible usage as replacement for diesel and plastics.  urlLink Algae also seems to be an option . Well worth a read.  As a footnote i've emailed a few Swedish politicians and asked if they have any contingency plans, will post their replies here later.
