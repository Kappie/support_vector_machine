Then got up at 12:30 and played until like 2 when I ate. It started snowing around 3:10 and kevin and I went and saw Orange County. Not as funny as I was hoping, but it was kinda a feel good movie I guess.  So I don't know the point where I became cynical of movies.... (saw a preview for some shitty looking movie about a kid that gets a watch that speeds up the user) I mean, I'm thinking that I wouldn't even go to that movie if someone paid me, well, maybe if they were paying me to write a review of it, so I could stop other people from seeing it.  *sigh* oh well,  On the other hand, we(kevin, Jarred, and I) watched  urlLink Buckaroo Banzai  last night. That was a funny ass movie. Probably would have enjoyed it better drunk, but you can only be drunk so much;)  Hmm... speaking of which, I haven't spoken to my girls in awhile. (probably cause they found out that I call them my girls:)) Plus, I've been working nonstop and all that shit:P  Gotta bug the Volt lady about videogames again this week. Gotta work on my resume tomorrow.  Peace- T
