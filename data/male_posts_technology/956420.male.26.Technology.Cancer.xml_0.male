But wait, here it repeats all over again! Oh sure, here you don't have any headaches+tensions like MSB but the pay day are way  late!!! . if on 27-30th then fine by me...but 2nd of  next month!?!?!   But wait! there's more. At MSB, you have a bloody fight just to get you claims approved by the manager. After bloods  tears (and a major cut on the sum of the claim itself) its smooth sailing from there. You can expect the payment by late of next mth!!! Here...easy to apply but... Arrrghhh!!!!  have to wait 2-3mths!!! Some CSE have to wait up to  6mths!!!   ....i gotta find a place to lie down...
