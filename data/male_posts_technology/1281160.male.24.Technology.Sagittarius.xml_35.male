They allow quicker translations that are free, but the translations are illogical. I wanted to translate Plant (the green one which has leaves and flowers on it); Google's translation service is adamant on giving the translated word for plant( the one with lots of people and machinery spewing out pollution.  Got to translate a lot of pages... French, German, Italian, Dutch (My head is already spinning with words). I'm still searching the net for free translation engines..    Bye / Adios / Au revoir / Auf Wiedersehen!    Jax
