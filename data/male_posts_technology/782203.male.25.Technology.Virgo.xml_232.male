Because sometimes you wanna be 'Invisible' just because you only wanna talk to certain people and so you put them in your Visible list. But then there are times when you dun wanna talk to anyone at all, this is where 'Really Invisible' comes in. I should bring this up to the ICQ people.   My left button is totally screwed up so I changed the buttons around ...now im using the right button for double-clicking and stuff. It's a real pain in the ass and is slowing me down like crazy, so really stressed now cos I am trying to finish this work thingy!  Update : ICQ thing was dumb , please ignore that.
