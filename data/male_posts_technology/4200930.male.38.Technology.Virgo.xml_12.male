How can a society possibly encourage the dross we see on our TV’s such as Channel 4’s Big Brother who’s tag line should read “Plumbing new depths for the intellectually challenged”.  How a sick twisted tranny like Nadia can win such a show is beyond me. Okay she’s a foreigner and for that possibly deserves some sympathy alone, but why do they have to come here and be all weird. For Christ’s sake don’t encourage them. Knowing this country she’ll probably get a morning TV show on C4 or 5, just like Kate Lawler (a previous years winner!) – great show Kate see your still on it – sorry my mistake, it got axed ‘cause you were crap!  I realise that often for many sad people in this country that other people’s lives are more satisfying than their own but come on lets have ‘normal’ people on shows, not trannies, gays, yardies, drug dealers, woman beaters and asylum seekers. (Don’t even get me started on asylum seekers, that’s for another rant another day!).  Give us programmes that people can succeed at using their skills and merits not a popularity contest based on stupidity and shock value.
