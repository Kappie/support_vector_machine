Comes a feeling that if you had a little red button that would blow up the world in a fiery glory of brimstone and sulpher, you'd slam that candy-apple red button down without a second thought.  Then in walks my little two year old 'nephew' (really my best friend's son) yelling 'uncle Dave!', with his arms open wide and a huge smile on his face.  Spilling out all his little matchbox cars on the floor and pulling me to the ground next to him. Driving them around on the carpet, handing them to me one by one. Laughing, giggling... Getting up every now and then to where his mom put down his french fries, grabbing one in each hand, walking back to me and the cars, eating one fry and giving me the other. Climbing on me, asking me to put on musica on the computer, playing peek-a-boo, grabbing his favorite book (goodnight moon) and climbing into my lap so I can read it to him, trying to lift the couch pillows and falling on his butt when the weight gets too much and laughing some more, trying to tell little stories about his toys to me in his not-yet-understandable child speak, talking to my bird and calling her beedoo because he cant say bijou yet, running in circles wanting to be chased, climbing under the coffee table and peeking out...  well... It all melts away, it all disappears, life is good again, happy.  I look forward to when I can have some of my own.   urlLink    My instant cheer urlLink
