I have been manager at the store I am working at, well over just the shop, and for the past two days, some lady has come in there and ran whatever I was suppose to do!!!  Did I get pissed off, oh yeah!  but, what could I say?? get out? I know I will need her help so I can't really burn the bridge if you get my drift....  so, I have just been kind of dealing with it, once she leaves, I take over the duties again and do whatever I need to do....  so, work has been BUSY to say the least.  I have been coughing a little bit more than usual, I kinda think that is after effects of the pnomenia *sp* I know I spelled it wrong...  so, I don't have to work tomorrow, which makes me happy and I even got a thirty dollar check from a rebate. are you kidding, that is awesome, it's like have free money:):)   well, I guess I better go and do something else:)  take care!
