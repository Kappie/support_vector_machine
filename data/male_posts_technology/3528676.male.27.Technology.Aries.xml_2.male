It has a smell that I have gotten used to as I grew up. The beige colored Safeguard is the most commonly used soap, I think.   I have also tried using   Zest  . One thing about Zest is it gets very hard when it dries up, so whe you try to use it for the millionth time it feels like its brand new, only smaller. However it feels like its loaded with chemicals you know, something "industrial"  like what the that fish guy on "The Beach" wanted    Lifebuoy   is very fragrant. you can put lifebuoy in a tray half filled with water and youll have it turn to mush, but your bathroom will smell like the pirated version of eternity sold in Greenhills.  Whatever soap you use, just make sure you dont do what my friend in Cebu did. He was a little too close to the toilet....
