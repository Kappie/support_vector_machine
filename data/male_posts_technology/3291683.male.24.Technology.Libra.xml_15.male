But Alredhead posted a couple of comments, and even if they were just more or less in response to my comment on her blog, I feel like I should put  SOMETHING  new here...  So let me show you a  urlLink photo gallery that has my pictures in it. It's very small right now, but I'm going to start expanding it shortly. When I have the time, I'll go through and take better pictures of all the models I have finished painting, and post them in there. The 3rd picture, in case you don't realize, is a sub-gallery; it's an "in-progress" series that shows my work during the actual creation of that mini. No finished pics are in there yet (I've varnished it since the last one in the sub-gallery, which changes the colors a bit), but it's all pretty close.  I take a lot of pride in some of the minis I do. I'm nowhere near the level of some people I know (or know of), like  urlLink Eric Lautenschlager or  urlLink Drew Williams , but I like to think I'm at least not terrible.  But minis are on hold for tonight. Tonight, I get to paint my spare bedroom. After weeks of pushing it off, we finally finished taping it two days ago, and yesterday it got a primer coat. We're hoping it'll only need to actual coats of paint. That might be a bit optimistic... But hope springs eternal and all that jazz. I'll try to remember to take a couple of pictures of it when it's done.  The painting upsets our cats, though. They don't like being locked upstairs, which we have to do while painting that room. Oy, they'll hate it even more if we ever have to do something drastic like paint the dining room or the living room. Well, they'll survive; or at least, they will so far.  I should really get going, and pack up to go home. Havea good night.
