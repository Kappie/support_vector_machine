To aid, I borrowed my sisters boyfriends bicycle (actually he was borrowing it from my brother...) to cut my journey in half.  So I start down my hill. As anyone who has seen it, its quite steep and I regularly used to reach 40 mph on my old bike. Good for a lazy git like me! Any way, The road has been closed for the entire of this month as they are replacing the drains and expanding them to make it a little bigger. Now the drains are on the left going downhill and the right is pretty much untouched apart from the odd patch where the offshoots of the drains cross the road. Although the road is closed to cars, this side remains open for the cement lorries, JCB's, pedestrians and of course, cyclists.  So this morning... Me... Peddling down... I see this bit of dug up road in front of me, The road-diggers had placed a large sheet of metal over it to cover it (and allow the Cement lorries and stuff past). I slow down knowing full well what flat metal roads do to rubber tires, especially vehicles with only two... So I slip. I hit the floor, Hands first, legs still about 2 foot off the ground, still attached to the bike. The bike does a rolly poly down my back as my head hits the floor, Eyebrow first!. Less than a second later, Im getting back up fully aware that the builders saw me go arse over tit. As I stand, I notice that its raining, No Pouring down. Only in one place, and in red? My Left eye! (The one that survived the bouncy castle). Was bleeding. More precise, My eyebrow was less of bleeding, more than  dripping, Not squirting, but umm... I suppose I can only say Pissing with blood. The workmen, Bless their grubby manual worker hearts, leapt into action. Got the first aid kit on my face. The then opened it and put a sterile swab on the wound (after I had said "Murfle Murfle Mumble Murfing mell", or at least tried.) They then raced me down to the hospital where I spent an hour in A just to get a couple of stickers on my brow. My bleeding  I feel such a stupid arse (no change to normal I suppose)  Anyway, To cheer me up (after making you all say "Ha ha, what a stupid plonker") I will be down the splash Saturday in fancy dress. I have yet to decide on the costume.  And Happy Birthday Helen. I doubt you read this but enjoy the chicken.
