These Web logs are becoming quite valuable in the software community for sharing ideas. A blog is an easy-to-use web site, where you can quickly post thoughts, interact with people, and more.  Check out the April 2004 issue of MSDN Magazine on  urlLink All About Blogs and RSS   Now a days there are so many blog sites available.. For e.g.  urlLink MSDN Blogs  where you can find interesting blogs authored by Microsoft Guys, another one  urlLink Gotdotnet Blogs  here also there are many Microsoft Blogs, Here in gotdotnet blog I regularly used to visit a blog authored by the inventor of IUnknown  urlLink Don Box .
