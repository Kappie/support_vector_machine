Not only is torture illegal, but the information gained through it is completely unreliable. Imagine this situation: You are being detained by an agressive army. They have you tied to a chair in a jail cell and are forcing you to watch as your child is raped and beaten by some "soldiers". Are you going to sit there and watch, or are you going to start telling your captors whatever they want to hear, even if it's not true? I think I would take the blame for 9/11 if it meant that my child was allowed to go free.   So, why is Britan doing this? According to Lord Justice Laws, he is "quite unable" to see why the Home Secretary could not rely on evidence "coming into his hands which has or may have been obtained through torture by agencies of other States over which he has no power of direction." Meaning, the information gained through torture is reliable because someone else did the torturing? I don't understand this logic. He goes on to say that he could not believe "that the law should sensibly impose on the Secretary of State a duty of solemn inquiry as to the interrogation methods used by agencies of other sovereign states." Meaning, he thinks that the Secretary of State should just accept the information without asking where it came from or how it was obtained.  That  sounds responsible.   So, in the end. These guys get to stay in jail (they've been there for 2 years already) without charges based on information obtained through torture. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!
