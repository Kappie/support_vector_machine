It must be strange for him, spending time with someone who's head of state even though they weren't elected, just because of who their family is.  The security crackdown here is unbelievable.  I read in yesterday's newspaper that 1 in 9 policemen, nationwide, is involved in the security operation surrounding Bush. Half the police in all of London, too, apparently.  If I weren't marching tomorrow, I think I'd carry out a few burglaries as far from George as possible.  Eva and I have been talking about ways of protesting Bush while making it difficult for the media to portray it as mindless 'anti-Americanism', which is an accusation Blair has made, predictably.  Any ideas?  Richard Dawkins said he wanted to see a burning American flag behind Bush in every shot, but Eva thinks this'll just look threatening to people in the US, and I can see her point.  Oh, and I think most of the protestors will be from the UK, but there'll be be some from elsewhere, including plenty from the US, if experience serves.
