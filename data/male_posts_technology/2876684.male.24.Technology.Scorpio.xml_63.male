I've been trying to figure out my situation and how to best approach things, I've even been very seriously considering whether Perth would be a better place for me to stay.  Anyways, today I get two phone calls about a job offer. It seems like my cousin has lined me up to be involved in auditing the project that I've been working on; the details are sketchy but it will definitely push me a few rungs up the ladder and I'll even be attached to the client from the sound of it. The duration of the contract is 5 months and the work starts next week.  Seems like the gods have conspired to keep me in Sydney for a while longer.
