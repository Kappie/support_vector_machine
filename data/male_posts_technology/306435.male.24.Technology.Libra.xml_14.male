We were on a search for a REAL bowl of chili.  You know the kind based off of a tomato.  Not that their is anything wrong with Cincy style chili, I just really wanted some home style chili.  I would have given anything for my mom's chili and Arthur's came pretty close.  So Ann got a burger and I got a cup of chilli and a turkey sandwich...it was soooo good!  It was the perfect thing for a cold Fall night.  Later, Ann and I came back and watched some tv.  Tonight, Ann and I went to Pane e Vino with Jeff and Devon.  It was cool to have such a grown up type dinner.  We all happened to be dressed up which made us feel important.  I had some good tortallini...  I cleaned the kitchen tonight...man it needed cleaning.  I pretty much cleaned the whole thing...I am not the greatest cleaner, but man it is clean now.  Okay, I don't have too much more to say...until then...
