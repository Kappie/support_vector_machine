Here are some bullet items that will have to suffice as the record of the event until my memory comes back to me.    FRIDAY    Trip started with some strange lady drawing me in the airport. Some dood comes up and points her out and says..."dood, that lady is drawing you!" I reply "well, i'm not photogenic so maybe this'll come out better". I never did see the finished product. This was 2 double jack and cokes into the trip. Friday 10 AM.  We sit on the plane (Brad, Dave (the bach) and Me (the e)) for 5 fucken hours before even taking off because the folks at American Airlines are incompetent beyond measure. They lost the fucken gas cap for the plane!!! Unreal. We passed the time drinking a bottle of bubbly that Brad snuk on the plane. After that, we began buying cocktails. There was no more booze on the plane by the time we took off.  We get to Chi-town at 11:00 PM. Sober, tired, frustrated, we meet the Danamil (Dave's brother) at a cozy lil bar in Lincoln park. The only other recollection I have of that evening is Dave and his brother doing a pole dance on stage together, and the Lawyer (good ole Ben) standing there with his nut sackhanging out of his pants (called partying ballz out) with a balloon tied around the sack for about 20 minutes.  Something I learned the first day: Bars in Chicago are open until 4:00 AM. :o)   SATURDAY   11:00 AM at some bar (name escapes me) throwing back bloody Mary's as fast as they can bring them. We meet Edith the waitress who is easily persuaded to hang out with us for the rest of the day as we gave her and her roommate tickets to the cubs game with us. Drunk by 1:00 with chicks in tow on the way to the game.  The Lawyer brings a cow outfit (complete with hat and utters) for Dave to wear for the balance of the day. He looked pathetic. It was perfect.  1:30 Bleacher seats in Wrigley field. We stand under the scoreboard on top of a wall for the game. That place is fucken amazing! I drank 100 beers and me and the Lawyer didn't piss until the 8th inning. We beat the next closest contender by 4 innings.  After the game we goto tops where we employ the skills of Edith the hottie to get all 12 of us in without paying the $10 cover. Edith delivers. Dave on stage dressed as a Cow. We have a pic of the whole batch party going "ballz out". Nice....real nice.  Back to edith's house for a house party. (Have I mentioned how amazing Chi town is????). Party all night long at Ediths before going to the Dancing lizard which is a college like bar. By this time, our little Moo-Cow is back at the hotel....so we partied in his absence.  Hit up one more bar (the name as well as other details escape me) so that we can party till at least 2:30. Was a long day and lots of drinking done.   SUNDAY   Hit up 2 street festivals and went to Murphy's bar outside Wrigley to watch the cubs game. Got drunk yet again. I ended up spilling beer all over my crotch while trying to get away with a road soda. By the end of the day, I was done!  Ryan paid the airline an extra $100 so he could stay till this morning. He wins the "I haven't had enough yet" award. Kid is amazing.   So this is all the details I can remember or reveal. Awesome time! I think our boy can get married now!
