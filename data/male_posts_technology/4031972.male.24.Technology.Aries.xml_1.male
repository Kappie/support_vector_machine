Shankar who is otherwise a very lousy person suggested this place for a team treat.GV is a Punjabi restaurant but pure veg. Situated near the Thousand Light's signal, it can accomodate 25 people. They have agood Punjabi cuisine. 8 of us had gone there. Don was at his best. A hardcore non veggie, he had two rounds of starters (all of us had) 2 rounds of Tandoori and Rasamalai.   The food tasted good. "Rabri Rasamali" was excellent and so was "Punjabi Di Beer". I had two mugs of the latter which is nothing bud Masala buttermilk. I did not look for the individual rates at it was someone who was paying. 1500/- for a group of 8 is reasonable.
