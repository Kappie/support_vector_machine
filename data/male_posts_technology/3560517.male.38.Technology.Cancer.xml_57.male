Just like bribing homeless with cigarettes in WI, registering dead indians in SD, getting 102% of registered voters in Philly to vote, keeping the polling places open for hours after they close in non Dem strongholds, getting a different person on the ballot in NJ after the deadline, and on and on the Dems can't ever play by the rules when it comes to voting.  They know the only way they can win is to cheat.  Kevin   Liberal groups supporting Democratic Sen. John Kerry for president have been accused of fraud and of sending felons into people's homes in their efforts to register new voters in Missouri.      The massive drive -- concentrated in the heavily Democratic city of St. Louis -- has registered nearly 25,000 Missouri voters in an effort to take the battleground state from President Bush, who won it in 2000.      "They're going to people's doors, getting their Social Security numbers, birth dates and how many people live in the home," said Woody Cozad, former state Republican Party chairman and board member of the Center for Ethics and the Free Market, a nonprofit group that has raised questions about the voter drive. "That, by itself, could lead to all sorts of problems."      St. Louis election officials  rejected for a variety of reasons more than a quarter of the voter-registration forms  filed by America Coming Together (ACT) and other liberal groups committed to defeating Mr. Bush in November.          In the past year, the Missouri Secretary of State's office has provided ACT with 106,656 voter-registration cards. During that time, ACT and other groups have turned in 34,683 cards to the St. Louis Board of Election Commissioners, of which 9,879 have been rejected for various reasons.      The majority were rejected as duplicating existing voter registrants, while others were rejected because the prospective voters were underage, had been convicted of felonies or couldn't be verified.      "In short, by inundating election authorities who are under significant legal and staffing constraints with such large numbers of non-verified applicants, the activities of these groups threatens to undermine the legitimacy of Missouri's electoral system," says the report issued by the Center for Ethics.      Under particular scrutiny are 16,000 voter-registration forms requested by Missouri Department of Corrections employees helping in the voter drive, Mr. Cozad said.
