Nice weekend off the rock, and I didn't meet any French people that made me want to stab them, which was very nice. I do have to say however that French people are generally bastards behind the wheel of a car. They don't slow down for anything, and they drive so far up your arse they might as well be sitting on your bonnet like one of those little Rolls Royce flying angel things. It's a shame I was driving as some good old fashioned bum-out-of-the-window-Winston-Churchill action was required.  It took me about twenty minutes to suss out that the speed limits only apply to you if you're a tourist as they cane it everywhere.  My dad's moving over there and has bought a HUGE block of farmland with a big jock-off house and SEVEN barns for about the price of a cheaper Porsche. He even got the farmers old tractor thrown in and everything, and I got to drive it around and scare the neighbours dog. Yay!  Next weekend I am off to see Eric Clapton play in Liver-fucking-fool with Loverat.  He got a great deal on some VIP tickets, champange on arrival, four course dinner and open bar all night. I promise that I will post a picture of me putting Clapton in a chicken-wing if at all possible.  Go and play some of the rude games at  urlLink Viz Magazine  now, because i'm going to watch  24 .
