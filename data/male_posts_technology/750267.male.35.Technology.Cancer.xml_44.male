I switched from  urlLink regular coke  to  urlLink diet coke . Started adding low-fat milk to my coffee and even switched from sugar to sweetener. You know, it really had no effect. I was convinced that saving 500 or so calories a day would make a big difference. But in the end, nada. Zippo. Zilch. The big goose egg.  Then I started tracking my calories. Found this  urlLink cool USDA web site , and was happily entering my daily food consumption. The site actually convinced me to eat a more balanced diet -- I would go down and grab an orange juice as my afternoon snack instead of a diet coke. Drinking 1 orange juice a day brought my daily fruit intake from 0% to a decent number (50%). That lasted about a month. Again, no effect.  So this  urlLink new diet  is crazy. I'm eating all these weird foods at odd times, some I never eat. I had peanut butter on toast for breakfast this morning, a can of tuna for lunch, and chicken, beets and string beans for dinner. That might sound like a normal meal to you, but other than the chicken, I never eat any of those foods. Beets aren't too bad actually, never even had them before.  How the heck am I going to last 12 hours until my next meal? I am starving...
