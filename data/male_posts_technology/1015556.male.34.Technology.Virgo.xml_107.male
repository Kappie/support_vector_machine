I was really intruiged, because they have some serious knowledge with the collection of books.  But why would they put Purpose Driven Life and Waking the Dead on there.  I mean, sure, they aren't huge tomes of thought, they have gotten eaten up by the masses, but is there something fundamentally wrong with them?  Is there bad theology in them?  Are they unbiblical?  Am I so unlearned that I am missing the whole construct?  If you know, please tell me, if you think I can grasp it.  And even something by Erwin McManus (whom I've never read, but am pretty sure I'm going to  urlLink Origins  in May.)
