Work has for some reason never been an issue to me. In fact at most times I end up working on the weekends too. Definitely not as much as the weekdays but there is always something to do. Weekends I would say is the only time that we really get to go out with friends and let that extra steam out. Well, of late the reasons have been different. It is the only time I get to see an angel. It may sound exaggerated but it is the truth. She truly is an angel. Paid a visit to he hair dresser in the morning. Work was as always fine. Convinced Supriya that women after all are not as good as they potray themselves. If you had read my previous posting you could tell how disgusted I am about the whole thing. I am sure there are women out there who share the feeling towards men as I do towards women. I might have agreed with them three years ago but the last few years have ben very painful. Not just for me but for many of my friends too. The night was good. Went to Whiskey Park. It was my first time there and it was not a bad place at all. Gaurav  I had picked up Shilpy on our way and Saira came along with D  Trishna. Finding Shilpy seemed such a daunting task. However we did manage to find her place after a good thirty minutes. Sairoo looked beautiful tonight. Her smile lit up the dance floor and her sweetness transformed everybody's evening into an amazing  one. I was irritated for some reason and in the process managed to irritate Sairoo too. I did apologize and we were alright. All in all a good day. There have been these strange feelings beginning to take over me over the last few days. I feel lonely. It seems like I am in the middle of a barren dessert with nobody to turn to for help. The kind of feeling you get when you realize that you are beginning to lose someone very precious in life and there is nobody to help you. Not even God almighty!!
