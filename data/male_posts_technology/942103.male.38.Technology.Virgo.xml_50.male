Or at least the Michigan and Ohio schools did.   urlLink Eastern  does;  if you're an Ohioan, you pay  urlLink Michigan resident  rates to go to EMU.  Well that's cool, thinks I.  I can go to  urlLink Bowling Green  and enroll in their  urlLink Popular Culture program  which is nationally known and highly respected.  But boy -- was I  wrong .  Turns out it isn't every MAC school, just the ones who want to do it.  And BGSU doesn't, apparently.  So the  urlLink per credit hour  cost of $776 for graduate credits translates to nearly more than $4700  per semester .  Nearly $10,000 per year.  I just ain't a-gonna pay that kind of coin.  I can't afford it right now.  But there is hope yet.   urlLink Michigan State University  has a very good program in  urlLink American cultural studies .  I didn't really delve deeply into it since I thought, "Hey, Big Ten school, Big Ten prices!" but I was a little mistaken there.  Big Ten school, not-so-bad prices.  I can go there for a much lower cost than BGSU.  The  urlLink basic cost per credit hour  is only $291.  According to their nifty  urlLink budget calculator , I can take 6 credits at MSU for only $2,150.  Much more in-line with my financial ability.  And, hey, a Big Ten school in my home state with my alma mater's colors.  Synergy.  I can deal with it.  Now to do some research on the application process.  GRE, here I come.
