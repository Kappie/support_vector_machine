My flight was from via Emirates, from Birmingham to Dubai, where I had to take a transfer from Dubai to Singapore with a stopover in Columbo/Colombo. That's where the delay occurred. For a stopover, only passengers whose destination was  Colombo needed to alight. Those going to S'pore just stayed onboard while the plane refueled. But some buggers actually alighted and they didn't get back on the plane on time. Basket, the least they could do was take note of the time and listen to announcements what right. Really selfish coz they delayed everyone else and it was really inconsiderate of them.  Anyway, I was suppose to meet a friend who was working at the airport but coz some miscommunication and my parents early arrival we didn't manage to meetup. Nevermind lah. Was quite knackered out tonight. I tried to stay awake on the plane as long as I could so I'd have to go to bed early to recover from jet lag. But I feel so awake now.
