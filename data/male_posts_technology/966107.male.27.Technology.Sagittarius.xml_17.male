I had gone to the Income Tax office in Bangalore to file my annual returns... What a pain it is!!! Anyhow cribbing about the difficulty of filling SARAL (which incidently means easy) is not the point of writing this. When I entered the elevator (lift) to reach the 4th floor to submit my form, I noticed another weird sign on the elevator wall. It read: "Lift only till 3rd floor. To reach 4th floor, turn left  walk" What else do people do in that building? Crawl, slide???? I mean how else can a guy reach from one place to another within a building??? And how does providing lift only till 3rd floor make sense in building having 4 floors? Did the architect or engineer forgot that they were building a 4 storeyed building?   If I continue noticing such signs in Bangalore then I am sure Bangalore will dethrone Pune as the Wierdest sign board Capital of the world...
