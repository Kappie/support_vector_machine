Oh well let them try to get it out of me.   So pride was this weekend. I should have gone to just seen what it was like. Apparently from some of the pics I have seen its quite interesting. I went to the gym instead with rusty and shanda. Not bad really, though I wanted to do an half to an hour on the elliptical runners and they couldn't even finish 10 mins. I can understand them not being able to do that much though. Rustys has skin issues because his belly hangs over his waist so much. And shanda has ankle issues as well. But the pool was good and the steam room was very relaxing.
