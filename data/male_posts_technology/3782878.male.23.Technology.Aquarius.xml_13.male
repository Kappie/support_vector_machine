Perhaps the reason I chose not to write one so early was that as a young Tier'Dal Necromancer, I feared my notes may be discovered and used against me by my own kind. Now that I've entered the 8th season and achieved the 3rd circle of necromancy spells, I no longer fear this as much. I understand that there are still many more Tier'Dal who are more seasoned than I am, but I now understand the concept of making plans against your superiors, without making them openly known.   Anything I publish can be safely hidden, as can I, for I have now achieved the art of manipulating shadow. This is a powerful tool that even the mighty wizards do not achieve until their 16th season and their 5th circle of spells. I practiced this art last night with my ally Kretero, and Sazlan. I will now publish what I have discovered since I began my travels.  Neriak, is a place only Tier'Dal could love, it is highly convoluted and the first time wanderer into the gates and even some of our elderly still get lost inside the city. I would say it's not overly convoluted as I have heard Ak'Anon is, it will be the Gnome's folly when they become trapped inside their own city due to their overly complicated construction.   The first day I left my home, I met up with Kretero, a fellow Tier'Dal Wizard, whose power could augment my ability to eliminate our enemies. So I formed an alliance, and he made use of his powerful ice spells while I used my basic spells to poison our enemy. I also met up with a mage, named Konaddar, a high elf who must be so ignorant to ignore our races long standing blood feud. That aside, he is a very useful tool in the battles ahead, and as I come to know him more, I find that he isn't as repulsive as the rest of his kind, most of them have a superiority complex, because they forget that we were born of the first king and queen of his kind, augmented by the sheer power of Innoruuk. We are better than them, they just fail to realize it, as they stare blankly refusing to see the truth. This works to our advantage of course.  I made it to my fourth season 2nd rank with these two spell casters, before they had to leave. Later someone must have been watching over me(I assume it was the Tier'dal ally for he was higher circle in his spells than I was and had the contacts to do this) for a Cleric of Brell came to my aide! A cleric of Brell! Unheard of that a cleric of brell would ignore the fact that I am a servant of Innoruuk. But this gnome seems to be one of those that gives freely of herself, yet another tool at my disposal, and a good tool at that, she had to be at least 9 circles in her spells! I appreciate a useful tool, and Akcron assisted me through to my 7th season before leaving me to assist some dwarf ally of hers.   While I was in my 7th season, a associate of the Call of Honour invited me into their ranks. It was a guild of adventuring parties, of whom Kretero had told me of. They are an honorable group, and as Kretero explained to me one day, it is often safer to make friends with those less ambitious than yourself, for they will often save you from those more ambitious than you. Such wisdom, it is no wonder that Wizards are regarded highly by most. So I made alliance with Call of Honour, it turns out their ranks include all races great and small. I was surprised by the diversity. It is indeed wise to befriend those that will have you, as long as they do not attempt to claim sovereignty over you.   I spent some of my 7th Season on expedition in the Field of Bone, and I must document I have discovered an odd dungeon just beyond the desert. Inside were many spiders my construct had no problems dispatching, however there was 1 golden spider, further research turned it up as a Burnai-bane spider or some such, whose fangs are capable of setting the blood to boil for a short time. I broke a fang off and tossed my old dagger to the side. This is a much more useful tool. I also found the ruins in the Field of Bone amazing, from what I understand this area was ravaged in a war between the Iksar and the Dragons. Cabalis used to be a majestic city, is not nothing but a bowl with ruins around it.   Finished my 8th season and 3rd rank of Necromancy with my ally Kretero, and last night I gathered my spells I required for my rank. Sazlan, a Vah Shir Shaman, whom which I must say has features that please the eye, joined Kretero and I in assaulting the Field of Bone again. Armed with my new spells that take my life for my mana, and a stronger pet, we were assaulting larger enemies than we had before. An Iksar Monk, a Gnome Wizard and a Gnome Cleric all joined our group in assaulting the scorpions in the field. We even attempted to fight the evil giant Burnyai, a badger like creature. And we lost a few lives to that account.  I shall continue to document my travels and those that I meet, for any who find this tome when I perish, may be able to make use of those allies of mine that are still alive.   Love is a weakness, it must be shown behind closed doors, Qaz
