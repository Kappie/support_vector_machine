Take a look at their updated privacy  statement:  urlLink http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/pixels/details.html  About half-way down the page, in the section 'Outside the Yahoo!  Network', you'll see a little 'click here' link that will let  you 'opt-out' of their new method of snooping. I strongly recommend  that you do this.   Note:  This acts just like cookies.. so you have to do this for each browser and each pc and everytime you empty your cookies.
