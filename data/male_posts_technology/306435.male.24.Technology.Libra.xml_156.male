We saw St. X play Trinity, Colin and Matt run a cross country meet,  and Kentucky play Football.  The next week we went to Milwaukee for Ann's birthday.  We soon got on quite the bowling kick.  We bowled with a group from my work and then again in Wisconsin.  We have since been going to Stone's Lanes on Tuesdays.  They have a deal that includes 3 games and shoe rental for $7.  Not bad.  I  am averaging around 140.    I went to my first Bengals game last week.  I saw the mighty orange and black knock off the undefeated Kansas City Chiefs.  I went with Paul from work and we were in the very top row at the 50 yard line.  Not horrible seats at all considering.  I had a blast.  I wish the seats were a little wider and can't see how people bigger than me can sit at all.    As for my web site I am not sure what I am going to do.  I am thinking of leaving my blog up as the main page and just using tripod as a secondary link.  I don't know.  We will just have to wait and see.
