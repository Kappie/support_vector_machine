Anybody got tips against the fear of flying? Well, apart from drugs? And no, don’t tell me that I should relax because there are more people killed by donkeys annually than are killed in plane crashes. (dunno if that’s true, I doubt it but well, I just read it… and now I’m afraid of donkeys too).  Well, since this is my first visit to the states ever, I did a little research on the internet and gathered some facts about america and its inhabitants. That’s what I found out:  - About a third of all Americans flush the toilet while they're still sitting on it.  - Most American car horns honk in the key of F.  - There are more plastic flamingos in America than real ones.  - One of every 11 boxes of cereal sold in the U.S. is Cheerios.  - 36% of Americans say that God has spoken to them.   That’s all I need to know, huh? Or anything else?
