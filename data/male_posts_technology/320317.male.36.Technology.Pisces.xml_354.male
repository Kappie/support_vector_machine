More importantly, it means Windows operating system users will finally get some support. Apache has been available on Windows 2000/XP for some time, but it was without any help from Microsoft."

 This is really good news for everyone, however unlike IIS and Apache this compatibility will cost you. Not sure of the pricing, but I am not sure it will be free.
