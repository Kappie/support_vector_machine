Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 bushwhacked the box office over the weekend, astounding analysts and even the filmmaker himself by taking in an estimated $21.6 million despite playing in only 848 theaters, many of them small-capacity art houses. By contrast, the No. 2 film ($19.6 million), White Chicks, played at 2,726 theaters, while the No. 3 film ($18.5 million), Dodgeball, played at 3,020. "We sold out in Fayetteville [NC], home of Fort Bragg," Moore told the New York Times Sunday. "We sold out in Army-base towns. We set house records in some of these places. ... Republican states are embracing the movie, and it's sold out in Republican strongholds all over the country." He predicted that the film will be cleared in twice as many theaters by next weekend, when it will have to do battle with Spider-Man 2. Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Exhibitor Relations, told today's (Monday) Washington Post that he was particularly impressed with the per-theater average of $25,115: "I'm amazed at those numbers," he said. "That type of per-theater average is usually reserved for a blockbuster." Separately, he told E! Online: "This is maybe the sleeper hit of all time." Only Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ and Shrek 2 have recorded bigger per-theater averages this year. In an interview with the Associated Press, Moore attributed the success of the film to his detractors. "I want to thank all the right-wing organizations out there who tried to stop the film, either from their harassment campaign that didn't work on the theater owners, or going to the FCC to get our ads removed from television, to all the things that have been said on television," Moore said. "It's only encouraged more people to go and see it." The success of the film also pushed up the overall box office to about $149 million, up 22 percent from the comparable weekend last year.
