So what's going to change this time?  Answer: I don't know!  But hopefully I'll be inspired by enough of on-going things around me to fire off thoughts, and inquiries.  For any that truly knows me, I'm inquisitive by nature, sometimes to a fault.  I question everything and anything, mainly because of the fact that there are no absolute truths.  Will my brain be the end-all be-all to answering all of life's questions?  Probably not, so if that's what you're looking for, you came to the wrong place amigo.  But hopefully my words will cause you to at least *think* about things from a different perspective.  Maybe not from *my* perspective per se, but will at least allow you to venture away from the cookie-cutter ways of thinking that so many people succumb to, if only for a moment.   With all of that said, I hope you enjoy reading my blog, and if you indeed DO, and I don't update it enough, feel free to light a fire.   ~J~
