Why do conservatives oppose welfare?  ITS NOT A   RACIAL THING!!!  We contend that welfare is not effective and is   contrary to an effective government.  Actually we oppose big government and want as little   government interference as possible in our lives.  By giving handouts to people who are able bodied to   work - they are merely teaching people to be lazy.    We know you're capable - if you try.  A rock has   potential - but the finest granite can't reach that   potential without work.  It just sits there. I'm all for TEMPORARY benefits - but when we have   third and fourth generation welfare families   (families whose main source of income is welfare) its   a pathetic epidemic and needs to be stopped. This is   not some Myth the VWRC dreamed up either - my Mom   used to work in an office distributing welfare checks   - she knows first hand.  Its pathetic. The liberals   lie and say we want to take away whats rightfully   yours while they take our money from us - the working   people and giving it to those who do literally   nothing.  I'm all for TEMPORARY unemployed benefits -   but anybody can get a job at Wal-Mart or McDonalds   while holding out for something better.   The liberal would rather enslave you to the welfare   system - give you money that is essentially buying   votes and allow you to be lazy.  Then they claim that   conservatives want to take away what they GAVE you in   their vast campaign to get power by manipulating   those they keep under their shoes.  They are enslaving the lower class - to a system that   they put together only to stay in power.
