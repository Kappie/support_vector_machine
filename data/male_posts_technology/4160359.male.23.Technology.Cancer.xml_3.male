I've always wanted to be a dad.  I like to think that I would be a good one.  I think I'd want a little girl.  She'd be a tom-boy of course, cuz I would have to teach her to throw a baseball.   Girlfriend has two boys from a previous relationship.  Most guys are scared away by a situation like this.  I'm scared but not scared away.  I'm afraid that they won't like me, and that will put a strain on our relationship.  I know I hated my step-dad.  And I know it didn't help things go easier.  I feel bad for my Step-dad sometimes now that I know what he went through.  But its hard to feel bad for someone you've hated all your life, and who feels the same way about you.  I worry that they won't like me.  Girlfriend says that if that happens, and they give me the thumbs down, I'm out the door.  I can't blame her for that.  It seems unfair at times that such a huge part of my life is completely out of my hands.  They won't ever be my sons.  I will never be their father.  My best hope is that we can be friends, and they can approve of my relationship with their mom.  But it will always be a friends relationshp and not a father-son relationship.  I daydream about it sometimes.  I dream of Girlfriend telling me that she's pregnant.  I wonder how it would happen.  How would she deliver the news?  Would she be happy about it?  Would she tell me directly, or do some strange thing like leaving me a pair of "#1 dad" boxers on the top of my drawer, and let me figure out what to make of it?  Fast forward 9 months.  The delivery room.  I can't even imagine what it would be like other than I would be there holding her hand as she cursed me a thousand times and tried to break my arm off for putting her in such pain.  And then, when it was over, a doctor would hand her a little ball of baby.   I know I'd hate the part where we get woken up in the middle of the night by baby-cries.  I wouldn't be able to stand that at all.  But during daylight hours, I'd be happy to change diapers, feed, burp, and all the other stuff.  Fastforward again to the first smile, first words, first steps, teething.  Then, the first day of school.  I would want my kid to be smart.  I'd read to her every night.  I'd want to make sure the kid enjoyed reading.  That is one of the greatest things my parents ever did for me... Giving me that love of reading.  That alone is all it takes to make sure your kid will be above average for smarts, I think.  School plays wouldn't be any fun for me.  I'd like seeing my kid, but I'd hate having those moments mashed together with seeing everyone else's kid.  Puberty would be rough.  I'd probably be the one having the talk with her, and I'm not sure why.  This is the only part where I'd wish I had a boy instead.  I wonder if she would be an athlete or a band geek?  I was never either one.  Thats where the fun part of parenthood stops.  Because right after Puberty, the real world starts to close in.  Its not about playing sing-along with elmo anymore.  Now its about saying no to drugs, and how to deal with the sex thing.  But I would hope that I'd done a good job up to that point, and then do what I can to make sure that the choices she makes are the best ones.  I'll have to remind myself that I can't make those choices for her.  There is one part of parenthood that I am afraid of, more than anything.  I'm afraid of failure in parenting.  What if I raise one of those people who belongs on a Jerry Springer show?  What if I fail as a Father?  I don't know how I'd be able to handle that.  I don't know how I would react if I found out my child was a drug-addict, or a tramp, or an assholish jerk, or a snob, or one of those kids that gets teased for being too fat, or too ugly, or just too strange.  If I had to pick out of all that list, I'd go for the too strange.  I honestly cannot tell if I am dissapointed or happy about missing out on being a parent.
