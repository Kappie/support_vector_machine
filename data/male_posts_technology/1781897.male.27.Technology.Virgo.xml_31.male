One interesting notion that they introduced me to is being more "gay" to myself.  They point out how men typically wash by scrubbing relentlessly like they are sanding a deck, and when they shampoo, they mash the product into their scalps like they're trying to rip open their skull.....well not any more my friends, at least, not for me!  I'm working on being more gay to myself.  I'm now messaging my hair product into my scalp.  I gently lather the soap.  I gave myself a fucken pedicure for crying out loud!  What does all this mean.....I guess I'm trying to pamper myself.....fucken odd feeling....but being an androgynous male, I'm comfy with the notion of self-pampering....which females have practiced since...well...forever.  So guys, doods, amigos.....trust me....be a little more gay to yourself....in then end....you'll have soft...glowing skin, soft feet, and a new appreciation for self-pampering!
