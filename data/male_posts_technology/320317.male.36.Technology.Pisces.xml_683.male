The survey reveals a growing number of metropolitan areas across the country where people have greater freedom to access information and entertainment on notebook PCs and wireless Internet connections. Today, there are more than 3,7001 hotspots in the United States in locations such as cafes, airports, public parks and hotels."

 Cincinnati is at #57, although I don't know of any public Wi-Fi hotspots that don't include a hotel or airport. None of the coffee shops I know of have wireless access.
