Its past midnight now and here I am, trying to kill time writing a blog just because I can't get myself to fall asleep. Its been going on for quite some time now, this midnight mania... going to bed at about 1 and then just wishing that I'd fall asleep and realizing that I'm wide awake still at 2:30 and then finally at about 3:00 it happens, the best part of life. Anyway, I was just browsing and found this neat little one...  Can you take six drinking straws and make four triangles all with sides of the same length?
