I will say one thing though, i am absolutly knakcered and i should go to bed, but as per usual i cant go to bed yet casue i havent finished... (started) my homework yet! I had to work Saturday and Sunday, which i am not used to and on Saturday i had to get up at 7.00AM which is earlier than i do for bloody school! Geez. I would of done some homework earlier but i came home and feel asleep on da sofa, then i went out to trampolining, then i had my dinner in like 10 mins be4 going out to babysit over the road. I dont get in from that until around about 10! And no thanx Nicki i would rather not a have a Sindy doll, they are tacky and crap!  (WH Smith RULES) Hehe!
