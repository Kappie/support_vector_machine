If it is impossible to imagine someone who might legitimately value a different thing than you, then most likely you perceive a universe of absolutes.  Thus, in a matter of speaking, you are a believer.  Which brings us back to your previous posting, which compared a believer to one who is drunk.  So perhaps you cannot fathom someone voting for Bush because you're drunk.
