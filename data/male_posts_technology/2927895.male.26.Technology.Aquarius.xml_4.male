We ordered a pizza and some chicken fingers and decided to sit back and watch a movie at home.  It was too hot in Chennai to step out.  We picked a movie titled "Something's Gotta Give" starring Jack Nicholson, Keanu Reeves, Amanda Peet and Frances McDormand.  The movie started off as being boring but started to get better as it went along.  Sis decided to get some sleep while the movie was still on and stretched out in the living room itself. I watched the complete movie and then we decided to have some hot tea and then get dressed to go out.  We visited a couple of temples on the outskirts of the city.  For the first time in my life, when I stood in front of God, I felt truly humbled.  My experiences the last 10 months have made me realise that everyone is vulnerable and sometimes, situations and circumstances can humble almost anyone....and no one is invincible.  For the first time in my life, I realised that happiness can be stolen away in one swift stroke of fate and you can be helpless and only hoping for things to get better.    I am too tired to talk about what I am thinking right now.  Its already 11PM and I need to get up early and set out to Blore.  Its going to be another 7 hour drive and I need to get back as early as possible.  So, I'd better sign out now and hope that tomorrow is as good and as enlightening as today.
