Cool, I can search people like I can on  urlLink LiveJournal .  Well not really search per se but more or less look for people with the same interests that I put down.  So being me, I clicked on IL to see if there are a few bloggers that reside in the state of IL.  Lo and behold, there were a few.  So I guess that's my last post for the day, you can say that it has been a very uninteresting day for me that I had a lot of time to be able to put shit on the Internet.  Let's GO CUBBIES!!!
