I know as of the moment everyone there are preparing there things for the saturday's training which i was hopefully be able to attend. unfortunately, we are also having our office-sponsored training that day... Good for them, they will be heading to samal where they prefer to have it, on the other had, we will be at Malagos Garden... Fortunately, it will be my first time to visit the magnificent (it's what some of those who have been there described it) Malagos... We will having our Team Building.  So what with DTC that I am very much eager to join them, aside from some obvious reasons, DTC has been a family to me... i might admit that i have been involved with the Center since the time i met there youth coordinator, before he was only an assistant... If i had known this institution during my school days, i would have spent my wee hours with them... It is kind of nice to help other people especially the younger generation realize their importance and in sharing also everything you knew about everything... we shared our hopes, our dreams, our life... after work, i always do visit the place to fell the need of connection to the humanity... (grin!)  Although I must admit that i only stay there at most a couple of hours. so afterwards, i go home and watch tv until my eyes hurt and fall asleep... i have my schedule of what to watch... if i come home earlier than 7, i'll be watching the news (TV Patrol), then Wassup! Wassup!... i fixed my viewing on Studio 23 until 9 then i switch to MTV to watch TRL... at 10 ill be watching News Central, Oprah then back to MTV to have my eyes get sore... hehehehe... i guess ive shared enough today...  it's time for me to go....  im out!
