It permeates everything, the very air, and it almost seems offended when some jackass interrupts it's conversation to shout or whoop or scream obscenities or sing drunken songs.  Every city I've ever been to, big or small, has a point in the night like this.  It is both melancholy, yet strangely warming and soothing at the same time.  A car hisses by on the street and it seems like it is trying desparately not to disturb the city's chant.  Deep in the distance a train or a boat sounds it's horn, but the city doesn't seem to mind too much.  This is the hour of which songs are written and stories begun.  This is the hour where in the movies some sad saxophonist or harmonica player starts to blow some incredibly soulful and beautiful piece and the movie watcher is able to completely feel every note ripped from his or her heart.  It is "Solitation time" as in solitary meditation.  I feel the pulse of this organism when this point of night hits, and it's one of my favorite times to think or stand out on the balcony and smoke.  Wrapped completely in solitation, I can absorb the heartbeat of the city and let it's blood and smog scrape away my frustration and loneliness, giddiness and exhaustion, happiness and bliss, leaving my core open to rebirth itself with all the previous day's (week's? month's?) shit whisked between the buildings and down the streets.  The catharsis of this cleansing usually can last me weeks, but unfortunately it's often longer than weeks between the times when Solitation's people and my people can arrange a meeting.    I can NOT seek solitation, because to do so would be to destroy the magic it gives me...ask the above mentioned sax or harp player, they'll tell you.  If you seek this muse, you will be disappointed, and the promised cleansing and creative flow will just not happen.  Should you catch up with her she'll kick u in the nuts, usually in the form of a siren or car accident a block away.  But most likely you just won't catch her at all.  Solitation just comes, often when you desparately need it, but sometimes just when it misses you and feels the need to see you.  Think of her as a slut, and you as her booty call.  But there is no way you could ever turn her down.  Nor would you want to...she gives the best loving you can imagine and you know it.  Solitation came to visit me a bit ago, but I was too agressive with her and she has left now.  She may come back tonight, but I doubt it.   More than likely we are just plain done now, until her next visit.  The brief cleansing I recieved will last me a day or two and it is up to me to get the most out of that; to let the residue of the city's soap last as long as I can.  Until her next visit.
