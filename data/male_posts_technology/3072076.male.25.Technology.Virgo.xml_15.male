The food is extremely pleasing though a little expensive.   It was Saravana's birthday on the 2nd of June and he decided to give a treat today which turned out to be good opportunity to taste the wide variety offered by the restaurant.  So, if you plan to go to this place here are some hints to pick your meal  1) If you are a vegetarian/Non Vegetarian, go for a Hot and Sour vegetable/Chicken soup. It is mind blowing.  2) For starters you can have the Spinach Toast if you are a vegetarian or the threaded Chicken if you happen to be a non-veggie. These are really different and you would not have had anything like this before.  3) For the main course go for Chicken volcano, Mongolian Noddles or Szchewan Egg trapped fried rice; something really new.  4) You can avoid the Combo meals and the vegetable spring roles as they are not worth the money.   How do I reach there?  Simple, If you know the road in Jaya Nagar where Nandani and G K Vale are on your left and Pizza Hut is on your right, keep going straight, cross the junction and you will find the place right at the corner.  Happy weekends
