The passage goes this way    "Aryabhatta, born in 476 AD in Kusumapura(now called Patna), was an astronomer and mathematician. He was reputed to be a repository of all the mathematical knowledge known at that point of time. He was only twenty-three years old when he wrote Aryabhatiyam in two parts. The text covers arithmetic, algebra and trignometry and of course, astronomy. He gave a formula for the areas of a triangle and a circle and attempted to give the volumes of a sphere and a pyramid. He was the first to give an approximation to pi as the ratio of a circle's circumference and diameter, arriving at the value of 3.1416. to celebrate this great astronomer, India named its first satellite launched in 1975 Aryabhata"
