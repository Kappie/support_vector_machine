I don't know about the whole Andy Kaufman thing... on the one hand, why would he reveal himself through a blog?  The greatest prank of all-time should be revealed on a national stage, like on Conan O'Brien or between episodes of American Idol.  Then again, anything "conventional" doesn't apply to Mr. Kaufman, so in a way it makes perfect sense.  I don't know, I'm just waiting for Tupac Shakur to tell everyone he faked his death, and was really the new, thinner Missy Elliott.  And the old, heavy Missy Elliott is really Ja Rule... and the real Ja Rule is dead.  Very, very dead.
