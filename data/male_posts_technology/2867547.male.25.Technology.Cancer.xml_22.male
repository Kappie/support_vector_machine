At this moment the library is being used in my new project by my colleague, who used it in the previous. It fells good that at least someone finds your work usable. But the new usage of the library brought up some new requirements. So I put some new features like transaction support and changed the code it to deal with some connection closing issues. I did a lot of refactoring, too to better separate the concepts and to make the design intuitive.  I also finally made a working sample project that illustrates the most important DAL library features. It uses a simple MS Access database and  two forms that show what's in the DB (the starting form is really ugly, sorry). In order to be a perfect sample I should only add code to demonstrate (1) how to work with transactions and (2) how to boost performance by overriding some functions that use Reflection. I guess I should also include some NUnit tests classes, but wait for the next release. Another thing to reconsider is modificators of functions in DbObject class. I mean which ti declare virtual/protected etc..  The current status of the DAL library is pretty good.  Number of bugs have been fixed, design has been improved and a working sample has been provided. There are a few things in my TODO list, but they are not critical currently, so I won't bother to implement them. If you are interested anyhow in using the library, I am ready to e-mail it to you. It includes (1) Library code and a sample project (2) A explanation of the ideas in bulgarian (a little outdated but a version history is provided) (3) great looking MSDN-like documentation.
