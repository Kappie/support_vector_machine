Cloning is widespread, and because of that Code 46 exists - a law that prevents couples of similar gene patterns from reproducing.  William ( urlLink Tim Robbins ) is called in to investigate unauthorised papers that are being sold on the black market.  urlLink Samantha Morton  (last seen by me three months ago in the good (4 of 5)  urlLink In America ), plays Maria, of one the suspects. They immediately hit it off and they  quickly fall in love. But maybe there is a reason for their close attraction...?  For some reason I just couldn't get into this movie. I usually don't mind voice-overs, but I found the constant voice-over by Morton's character to be a bit annoying. Nevertheless, it's an interesting ride if only for the future the movie presents -  William for example uses an empathy virus to aid him in "sensing" information about the people he questions, giving him an ability similar to, if not as powerful as, mind-reading.  -->
