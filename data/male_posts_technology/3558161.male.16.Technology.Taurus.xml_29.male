My heart feels like it's just falling apart at the seams, all the threads that hold me together are steadily coming undone, and there's nothing I can do about it. It's not like something's missing, it's like everything's missing, but it shouldn't be. I feel like I'm being tricked into beliving I have things I don't, and that's because someone has taken them from me. It feels like I'm not worth anything, that no one needs me, that no one cares. I feel despair, and pity, and carelessness. I feel people pulling away, and I feel like I'm losing friends. I feel like I'm dragging my feet, and as much as I don't want to be, I'm at a standstill in my life, and none of it is in my hands. None of it is under my control, but I'm expected to get out of it. I expect from myself that I should get out of it. My stomach's clenched fists are readying themselves to swing aimlessly, at anything standing in my way. I have an anger that I can't subside, that I can't absorb, that I can't vent. I can't bike it out, I can't read, play, work it out. I can't think it out, and I can't love it out. Because it's out of my control. And not only that, but it's not going to change at all. I feel lost, and scared. And I'm sick of this feeling. I want the truth, and I want it to be proven to me.   Everything's on fire, and everything's falling. Fast. Too fast. It seemed just a minute ago that the birds were chirping, and the sky was an endless blue abyss, waiting to swallow you up with the sun, and take you on a wild ride of happiness, true happiness. It used to be a sun that gave you everything you ever wanted, and more. And then it took off its mask.  The sky darkened, with unnatural speed. The clouds hastily moved in, waiting to strike at anything they could reach. All I can do is run, because there's nothing to fight. There's nothing to fix, and there's nothing to ponder or decide. There's no formalities or rules, except just one: It's not going to go how you want it to.  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  He fell to his knees Begging for life They spit in his face And pushed him down.  Tears staining the dirt Drawing feebly in the dust With one shaking hand And all is lost.  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  And when I read back, when I look at past feelings and past thoughts and emotions  It makes me hurt that much harder.  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  I'm so scared that I'll never Get put back together  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  ::Sits back and thinks for a moment, then after a while nods and says 'Hmm' to himself::  I think I'll go throw up now.
