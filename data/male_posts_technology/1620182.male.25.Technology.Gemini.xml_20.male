That's pretty good for me lately.  I don't think I made it in before 9:30a one day last week.  It's now 9:10a.  Let's take a look at my morning accomplishments:
 
   Made coffee and consumed one (1) cup from my bright orange UVA mug... urlLink go HOOS !!
  Checked personal e-mail hoping for first piece of fan mail.
  Disappointed by lack of fan mail, but managed to forward one e-mail...
  Read news  urlLink article  about new calculator feature in  urlLink google .
  Played with new calculator feature in google.
  Checked work e-mail.
  Accepted invitation to seven hour long discussion about what we can add to our product to make it sellable in the next two weeks.  Not going to be a pleasant one...
  Bathroom break...
  Added items to Outlook about my  urlLink vacation  next week.
  Consumed second cup of coffee.
