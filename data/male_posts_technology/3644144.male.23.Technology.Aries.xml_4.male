He was picked 21st in the 20th round, number 602 overall. He is currently playing for the  urlLink Batavia Muckdogs   minor league team! I can proudly say that I played on the high school team with him for one year!!  Here are some related links:  - his  urlLink profile  from the University of Iowa  - an  urlLink article  and listing of the Big Ten players drafted this year.  - the Phillies'  urlLink draft listing   - the  urlLink Muckdogs' roster  - click on Nate's name, and you can see his picture in his Muckdogs uniform!  Anyway, I think it's pretty cool, knowing someone who got drafted - we'll have to see if he makes it to the big show!
