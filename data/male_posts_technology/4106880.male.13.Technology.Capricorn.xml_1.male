I belive using the brand new unreal engine, it is a superbly beats all other games in the graphics aspect. Be it be in lighting, animation, physics, or just the actual atmosphere of the game, Doom 3 is a revelation. However, going to the gameply aspect, it does not shine. The single player is very unsupported, with just you blasting your enemies back to Hell. Not to mention you will be reading emails!? Whats with reading emails, when all hell broke loose on the ship. And how come its you that must defeat the aliens, and that everyone else died, or was taken over? Multiplayer is even weaker. It supports up to 4 players. Thats right, and just the regular deathmatch style gaming, you recieve major lag. So unless the Doom 3 makers fix it, or these moders start moding, multiplayer will rarely be touched.  All in all, I did not like this game. By a technical standpoint it was oustanding! But gameplay really dissapointed me. If your looking for the best FPS game of the year, or month, then look elsewhere. If you looking for a graphicaly great game, or just something to blast away time with, then you might want to try out Doom 3.
