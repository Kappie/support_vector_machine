THat in my opinion is FUCKED UP You 2 are probably coming from the point of veiw that neither of your parents smoke there fore it doesnt affect you, my parents still pay taxes and shit so why shouldnt they get health care for free? Bah And thoses so called hpercondriacs, well if they are known then they will be left until last on the waiting list evct, and for all you know thoses hypercondraites could have something seriously wrong with them, all they are doing is caring about their health. Gah, im in a really bad mood today so excuse the language But grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr Boys are stoopid and should go to jail
