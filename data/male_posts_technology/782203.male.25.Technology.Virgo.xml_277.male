Oh huge thanks to 2 of my colleagues who helped me till 3 and 4 am last night with it eventhough they had a big presentation in the morning with the big boss in attendance. Really lucky to have colleagues like that. I would have kissed them today if it wasn't against office policy.   This guy chatted me up a couple of seconds ago, he said he was gay and when I said I don't talk to guys online he's like going "please" and even gave his phone number asking me to call. Weirdo.
