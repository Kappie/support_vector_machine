A paycheck which has my salary increase, my bonus, and will have quite a bit of OT.  The  urlLink GOV  will eat up a bunch of it, but it should still be enough to warrant the purchase of a new  urlLink iPod  and Canon  urlLink A70 , or  urlLink S30 .  I'd like the S30 because of the L-Ion battery, but the A70 is more in my immediate price range.  But really I should pay off my credit card.  Maybe just the iPod...  So if you want to drop by on my birthday, just let  urlLink me  know.
