It has been 4 months since that. And she likes me now...  our convo:   undermyalarm: im reading my journal post that night at the party X69KiSsEs4YoU: oh u r X69KiSsEs4YoU: at paiges party? undermyalarm: yeah undermyalarm: i wrote undermyalarm: "and i found out again that it is impossible to get a girlfriend."
