I do agree with Kishore  Valli, yeah certainly's Manny's quote on how to use it....  But... the point here is... rn't we dependent on Technology rather to put us we are making use of it...  Can you stay a whole night if "Storm" rolls the electricity out...Then the city becomes a dessert / forest... yeah, U have to have control you rather than the technology... as Kicha points out... we have to switch off mobile to chew the fat lethargically.... it wont automatically sense ur mood (I heard Bill Gate's Home is designed so, How far its true, I have to taste and say)  Valli, If there is no mixer / grinder u should have prepared urself to grind on those 2 stones  or wash with the gentle palm in a single stone in cases of no current....  R V prepared for that. is the question here to put?????? Get going.... I will come out with spl.. matters....  Cheers....
