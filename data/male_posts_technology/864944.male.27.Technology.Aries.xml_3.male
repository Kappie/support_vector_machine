It should be quite a trip.  ----  I take a martial art called Oom Yung Doe, and last night was a test prep lesson, and that means sometime in the future, i will be having my test to move up a "belt".   In actuality, this martial art uses what to me, seems a more authentic belt system.  Basically they claim that the origin of the black belt, is that a student, who would wear a white belt, over enough time (typically years), would actually stain their belt black with sweat and dirt as they worked out and trained.  The practitioners who had trained hard and long enough would have "black belts", hence the moden understanding.   So at this school, as you progress up, a section of your belt is dyed black.  There are eight sections to dye, such that when you are 8th section, you are a first degree black belt.   Chris and I will be testing for our first section.   And judging on the "review" lesson, I would say we have some practicing to do ;p  ------  Interesting thing happened to chris and I last night.  We both awoke at about 3 in the morning to the smell of a wood fire.  I suspect that a house somewhere not too terribly far was on fire, but my 3 am glances outside didnt find anythnig.  What I thought was so interesting, was how the smell of smoke, wafted in from the outside, was enough to trigger both of our brains to complete awakeness.  Like some animal instinct that something was amiss..and our brains knew it was fire.   Neat.  -----  My gaming link today is for a technology demo of a new game being developed called Midway.  There are not too many naval sims out there.  And no-one.. and I mean NOONE has yet to make water look truly realistic when ships are on it, and smashing through it with cannon fire.   That is until this game.  ZANG.  I encourage anyone even remotely interested in games to check this out.  It is really quite something.  The sounds are also great!     urlLink http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/113089.shtml   (link comes to us courtesy of David Della Bitta, my partner in gaming goodness)
