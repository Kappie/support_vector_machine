The kids didn't want to go at first, and I would not have complained, but Anne convinced tham that it would be fun, and I wanted to do it, and the kids agreed.  Fern Canyon is adjacent to one of the least crowded but accessible beach areas remaining in California.  You have to drive about 7 miles in and out on a little dirt road - pretty typical for this area.  The land is an uplifted terrace, with layers of compacted soil and depositied gravels compressed together over time at the bottom of the sea.  When uplift occurred, this section of the coast was not deformed in the same way as most areas locally.  Streams began cutting into these tightly compacted gravels, but created vertical-sided gorges rather than the typical V-shaped canyon with unstable slopes.  The resulting landform gives you up to 75-foot high near-vertical walls covered with many species of ferns, with a year-round stream flowing at the 20-30' wide bottom.  There is wildlife in the area as well.  There are several herds of Elk roaming the area, and you must be careful to not get too close accidentally.  There were coho salmon fry (endangered here) swimming in the stream, waiting untill fall rains to migrate the short distance downstream to the ocean.  Frogs were abundant, but we did not see any salamanders.  After walking the canyon, we went to the beach and watched seals, pelicans, cormorants, crustaceans, and waves.  On the drive out, we stopped about 15 feet from a medium size bull elk, munching on a willow tree, wary but not concerned with our van's presence, velvet still decorating his large antlers.  It was pretty cool seeing one that close in its environment, but I'm glad we were in the van and not on foot.
