Retail Forward notes that Amazon's revenue for 2001 represented roughly 22% of the total revenue for all 50 companies in the study. Interestingly, Retail Forward also finds that eight of the top 10 e-retailers in 2001 were multi-channel -- up from five in 2000 and just three in 1999."    According to this article, I guess focusing on one product line isn't such a good idea in eCommerce these days. In reality I think these figures only make sense because a "Wal-Mart" is going to sell a lot more than a specialty or hobby shop. Interesting Wal-Mart isn't anywhere to be seen.
