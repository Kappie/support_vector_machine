Yesterday my family went up to Sioux City to see the President, Laura and the VP. That was really cool, and we got floor tickets so I got within about 10 ft. of the president, but the mass of people kept me from actually shaking his hand. That was spiffy though, so I was glad I went. I also got my senior pic proofs back the other day, which turned out well enough, but David, the photographer who took them, threatened to tie my hands together and drag me behind a car for several hours if I attempted to reproduce any of the proofs, so I better not post any of them on the blog (well maybe those weren't his words, but he made it vitally clear that I wasn't to be copying the pics). Soooooo, thats all I got for now (all i  have  for now, for the english teachers out there). I'll leave you with a pic of the man himself at the convention. I'm out!
