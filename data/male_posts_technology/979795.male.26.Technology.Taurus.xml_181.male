So embarassing, when I came out a door across the corridor opened and a lady came out. She muz've been really shocked to see me exit the ladies. But I really wasn't that bothered. Maybe that's wat they mean by having a clear conscience, huh. Still, thinking about the incident is sorta funny. Hmmm ... my high point this term. Hahaha.  Lastnight's Aikido training was an ultimate low for me. Sigh, felt sooooooo tired and I just don't feel that I'm concentrating properly. Actually though of leaving after the first hour with the beginners. But I just though, if I gave up so fast and easily when will I ever improve. So I stayed on for the 2nd hour. But still didn't feel like I'm doing anything right. Hope next week will be a lot better.
