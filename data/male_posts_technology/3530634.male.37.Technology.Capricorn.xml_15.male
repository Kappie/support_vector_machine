       
      Welcome to my Blog! I hope you will find insight, news and information about the City of Rochester Hills and what's going on.  Throughout each month I will post a quick synopses of each City Council meeting and any new information on what's going on in and about the City.  You can also be sure to get the "Rest of the Story" here at my Blog as I will do my best to quell any nasty rumors with factual and honest data.  Feel free to let me know what you think of my Blog and any suggestions you might have to improve it.  Gerry   urlLink Top
