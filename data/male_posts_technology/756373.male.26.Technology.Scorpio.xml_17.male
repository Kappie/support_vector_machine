If you're anything like me, it was probably spent with lego, or action figures (Masters of the Universe in my case), and which young lad would be caught dead without a Lone Wolf book? Well, thanks to Bishop, I am now reliving those days playing the Lone Wolf gamebooks. So far I've gone through three in the space of an afternoon, and  boy  do they bring back memories! Such brilliant, carefree memories...  No, he didn't give me his collection of paperbacks (I wish!). Rather, he pointed me to  urlLink this site.  The Aon Project. Joe Dever has given these guys permission to redo each and every Lone Wolf book, from 1 to 12 (these I consider the classics - the ones thereafter are not available for free download unfortunately), in HTML format. Not only is this much,  much  easier (thumbing from page 3 to page 347 every few moments could result in quite a few papercuts, believe me), but the site includes an amazing utility called Statskeeper that saves your progress. It even includes a random number generator. The Aon project makes playing Lone Wolf even more fun, painless and immensely rewarding. All the books are downloadable, they include art, maps and so on.  I can't help but babble incoherently on and on about it, but let me bow out with this - if you're a Lone Wolf fan, and want to give the Kai/Magnakai sagas a bash again, check it out. If you HAVEN'T yet experienced the world of Lone Wolf... what the hell is wrong with you?  Go read it now! What are you still doing here?  Go!
