Today's joy will be  Workout: hit some racquetball shots 5 min stationary bike Stretch Bicep curls	3x12 Push ups	3x12 Tricep pushdown 3x12 Crunch		3x12 Leg raise	3x12 15 minutes stationary bike  Post-workout Notes: Arms feel weak yet again after today's workout. But my recovery time appears to be doing better since I'm not as shaky afterwards.  Anthony Moore and Jordan Rusher stopped by my cube which was a nice surprise. Anthony just landed a 10 week internship at NASA Langley working on a database after getting his degree. Jordan is finishing up an internship with one group here and will be working for the Dewey group starting in July. Hope things go well for both of them.
