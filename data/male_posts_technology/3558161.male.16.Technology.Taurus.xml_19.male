I've always had this unnatural urge, feeling, whatever you want to call it, that keeps me from quitting... I can't explain it. When I'm feeling so depressed that I can't get ANY sadder, or when I just want to give up, when I'm not thinking rationally, there's always  something  there that keeps me just happy enough, makes me think optimistically, makes me  want  to go on, makes me think clearly again. It brings good 'ol common sense back, and leaves me feeling... Better. And I don't know what it is. It's nothing that's being affected from the outside. It's all in me, but I have no idea what it is that drives me. It keeps me alive, breathing, healthy, and happy. It keeps that smile on my face, and it keeps my momentum up. It amazes and impresses me quite often. I must have some purpose... What does fate have in store for me?
