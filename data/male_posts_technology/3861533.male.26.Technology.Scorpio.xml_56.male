He has dreams about a girl he secretely loved, but he does not remember her face nor her name. None of his friends knows who she is either, since he's never told them about her. While trying to find out who she is he finds himself falling in love with another woman who is trying to help him find her.  I really liked this one. Interesting story and likeable characters. It's not perfect though - in comparison to my most recent keepers in the asian romantic drama category it lands in the bottom half, but it is nevertheless a keeper. As a reference, the following are the most recent movies in this category that I've decided to keep (and their viewing date):     urlLink ...ing  2004-06-05    urlLink Lost In Time (Mong bat liu)  2004-06-01    urlLink Marriage Is A Crazy Thing (Gyeolhoneun michinjishida)  2004-05-31    urlLink Turn (Taan)  2004-05-31    urlLink Il Mare (Siworae)  2004-05-23     Other good movies in this category, that I for different reasons decided not to keep, are:     urlLink Classic  2004-06-12    urlLink Lover's concerto (Yeonae sosheol)  2004-05-31    urlLink Oasis  2004-05-31    urlLink Christmas in august (Palwolui Christmas)  2004-05-22    urlLink Ditto (Donggam)  2004-05-22    urlLink The Road Home (Wo de fu qin mu qin)  2004-05-02    -->
