Apparently my lovely government decided to play with the calendar, so my flight is on the Memorial Day and not on the Independence Day, which is not very nice. In any case, i also noticed that i land back in Israel a day later than i thought. Oh, the dates. But why should i care. 
 In the duty free we got ourselves 500ml of  urlLink Chivas Regal  in a plastic bottle, for the trip.
