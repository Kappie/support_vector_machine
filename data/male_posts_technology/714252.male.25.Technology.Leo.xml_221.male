Last night was unbelievably good fun. Went to see Bruce Allmighty and then into the Garda Club for some Thaltha (Before anyone says anything it was after classes were over so I had a choice of paying into Bojangles or free in Garda Club..) which was great fun! (Just sorry big G wasn't there..)  Alvin can lapdance like a squirel chasing a nut down a hill or some other vermin related comparison. Orla as always was a rockin dancer and D ROCKS! She lead me (on the floor too damnit!) and it was... bizarre? no.. freaky.. yes but not strong enough.. enough to make me want to shit my pants and always beg a woman for forgiveness before I dance with her? NOW we're getting there..  I must say though she has some funky moves.. She should me two really small but VERY neat little tricks recently.. Yummy.  Anywho, posting this blog mainly because I will be away next week till Thursday (finally going to see my baby bro!) so thought I had better give you something to play with for a few days..  Hmmmm.. That's pretty much all my news..
