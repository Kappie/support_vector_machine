He then takes on the gifted but troubled Annakin.  Annakin starts to surpass his fellow apprentice; resentment and jealousy brews; something goes wrong; Annakin makes a hotheaded choice that leaves Qui-Gon in a bad spot and he gets killed.  A rift begins between Obi-Wan and Annakin.  Follow through to final confrontation and betrayal.  A whole family unit falls apart.  Mythical, even Biblical.  Wow.  That's great stuff.  I think I'll become famous so one day I'll be at a party where I can walk over and kick Lucas in the shins.
