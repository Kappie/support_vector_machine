The majority of my family local to this area went to Old Country Buffet in Beaverton to celebrate.  Fun, I guess...  I got a Van de Graff generator which, upon assembly, fail to operate.  That was a rather large disappointment, since I had spent almost 5 hours on it.    Yesterday, We had our "Christmas party" of sorts at school, and I finally invited Gwen to the Winter Banquet (after several schedule conflict which I had to resolve before I even knew if I was going to go), but now my parents are getting more restrictive, and saying that I should ask her to pay for her own ticket, because if I pay for it, it'll be a "date"...  I never really got that reasoning, but I guess I'll just have to flow with it...    Later that afternoon, Goody's family (minus two siblings), Peter, Rachael, Emily, and I went to see  The Two Towers .  It was way better than I thought it was going to be, but I was expecting more people to be coming.  Later when I got home, I received a message from Brady informing me that I had not, in fact invited them to it, though I had been operating the last couple day, with the expectation of seeing them there...  Really stupid of me.   Consequentially, I am prolly going to go see it again with them within the next week.
