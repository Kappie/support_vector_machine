To me, the true message of Christ was one of inclusivity, understanding, compassion, forgiveness, and above all, love.  And being a Christian to me means living a life that is "Christ-like."  Though I know that I am by no means without sin, the most important thing for me is to live my life with love and compassion to the best of my human ability.  As for the film...  I have yet to see it.  I think I'd prefer to see it privately in my own home, because my faith is very strong and very personal to me.  I feel like I might leave the film feeling like an open wound, and I don't want to risk being around insensitivity at a moment like that...  But as for the way it is marketed...  The movie business is still just that...a business.  It is an unfortunate reality that, if you want to put asses in seats, you have to have some sort of draw.  Since James Caviezel is not yet an A-List celebrity (though I think he could be...he's a brilliant actor), his name alone is not enough.  And while many people love Mel Gibson, the masses of asses in seats tend to prefer a Mel that is in front of the camera, not behind it.  So producers, wanting to make money on a film that they know is monetarily risky, come up with a way to sell the film, i.e., "the TRUE story of WHAT REALLY HAPPENED."  Whether or not it is historically accurate does not matter to me.  As Harmonium touched upon, truth and fact are not synonymous.  After the release of "The Killing Fields," director Roland Joffe asked one of the journalists, on whose experiences the film was based, if the film was accurate.  He replied with a yes and no.  No, he said, that's not exactly what really happened.  But yes, he said, that's exactly what it  felt  like.
