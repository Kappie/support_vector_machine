Over the last 800,000 years the Earth has, on the whole, been a pretty chilly place. Interglacials - or warm spells - have come every 100,000 years and have generally been short-lived.  Over the last 400,000 years, interglacials have lasted about 10,000 years, with climates similar to this one. Before that they were less warm, but lasted slightly longer.  We have already been in an interglacial for about 10,000 years, so we should - according to the pattern - be heading for an ice age. But we are not.  The Epica team has noticed the interglacial period of 400,000 years ago closely matches our own - because the shape of the Earth's orbit was the same then as it is now.  That warm spell lasted a whopping 28,000 years - so ours probably will, too.  "The next ice age is not imminent," said Dr Wolff, "and greenhouse warming makes it even less likely - despite what The Day After Tomorrow says."    Phew. No need to stock up on thermal underpants just yet.
