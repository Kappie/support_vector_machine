I don't mean to be mean or cold hearted or insensitive to those with weight problems, but I strongly believe that those who are overweight (and  want  to lose weight) simply aren't trying hard enough (or maybe just do not know alternatives).  Not that I don't understand the fact that there are reasons behind their weight issues.  I understand that people look to food for comfort, that they eat when stressed out, or that maybe they were just never taught anything about healthy eating habits.   I also find it hard to believe the people who try to stress the fact that being overweight is ok, that you just have to love yourself and your body.  Being overweight is simply  unnatural  and  unhealthy .  Look at other counties, or even the animal world.  You never see grossly overweight Iraqis, Indians, or animals.  I feel strongly that American diets are to blame for a large percentage of modern health problems, obesity included.  In fact my problem is more with accepted American eating habits rather than obese people.  Diabetes, cancer, and heart disease have all become much more prominent over the past fifty or one hundred years.  With it being easier to get fast food and a 60 ounce soda, what do we expect?  And now other country's health issues are changing with the introduction of Western diets.  Also increasing are their obesity levels.   There's nothing wrong with not being a perfect physical specimen, but for me it just comes as a matter of pride.  I feel better about myself when I am active and in shape.  And look at the overweight people who are sick with themselves for looking like they do.  I don't think it's just about society's expected image.  It may be a factor, but deep down inside I think every person cares at least a little bit about how they look, not to fit a societal standard, but to please themselves.   When I'm at the gym and I see someone who is overweight exercising, it makes me feel good.  I'm happy when people care about themselves.  And I really bet that it is making them feel a hell of a lot better too.  But the thing that really gets me is when I see a very heavy person who waits 2 minutes for an elevator to go to the second floor when they could have walked in 30 seconds.  I rarely take elevators when there are stairs available.  And if anyone deserves that elevator, it's me.  And what about people who've gotten so heavy that they are considered handicapped?  They get that handicapped permit and get to park right next to where they need to be.  Maybe they should get a restricted permit so they have to park farthest away.  They could probably really use the exercise.   Just because we have a higher standard of living and more money than most countries, why should we be getting less healthy?
