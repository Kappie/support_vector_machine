"The best way to describe Morita's extraordinary drive," the consultant Kenichi Ohmae once remarked, "is to scan his schedule for the two-month period immediately preceding his stroke [while playing tennis at 72]. He took trips from his home base in Tokyo to New Jersey, Washington, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Antonio, Dallas, Britain, Barcelona and Paris.
