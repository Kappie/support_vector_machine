I’m really confused as to my position right now regarding her – Steven, I told you that I was over her and I thought I was, but now I realize that I’m not. I still very much in love with her, but I’m praying that if it’s God’s will, that He help me let her go. Her position is “just a friend” but I’m having a hard time adjusting to the idea (yeah, and since we were never technically a couple, that really *ahem* makes sense, yeah...). Though, I only think that way when I think about her by myself; when I’m with her, I’m fine just being friends. It’s not like I’m depressed or down over it or anything, I’m just really confused with myself right now, that’s all I guess.   Second girl, Bwitty; to begin with, don’t get me wrong - I’m not attracted to her like ‘that’, but for some reason I just realized after talking to her today for the first time in... several months (and she lives three blocks below me, how stupid is that?) that I really care about her. I don’t get it, I can just see her hurting from a ton of stuff and I get almost... I want to say protective of her, but that’s not the right word. It’s like I want to just pull her away from all of it. (And the weirdest thing is, I don’t really know her that well.) By the way Bwitty, if you read this, please know that I’m praying for you.  Third girl, Laurie (and out of you three, you’re the only one that actually reads this... if I’m thinking right I should have talked about you first... hmm... and the fact that I just said that before posting it makes me question my sanity, but oh well) LOL ‘Ne way, it’s kinda the same way with you as it is with Bwitty, though I actually know some of the stuff in Bwitty’s life, and I really don’t know too much about you except from your blog and when we talk. Again, though, I find myself really caring about you (though not so much in a ‘protective’ sense). I guess it’s more that I can relate to your situation and feel for anyone going through it ‘cause I know what it’s like. Hey, I got your phone # btw, email me and tell me when a good time to call is. :)  Ok, the fact that I actually wrote that is starting to weird me out, so I’m gonna go and get some... sleep... yeah... sleep sounds real good right now...
