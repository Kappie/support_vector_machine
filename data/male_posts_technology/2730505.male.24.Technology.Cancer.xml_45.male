Going to North Beach tonight, I guess that is the starndard for Saturday nights if there is nothing to do.  Free party again so it's a hit or miss on the quality of females that will be present at the bar.  We'll see how it goes.  Man, it's hard to look at fucking code all day.  I really don't know how people do it for 8 hours every damn day (even more!).
