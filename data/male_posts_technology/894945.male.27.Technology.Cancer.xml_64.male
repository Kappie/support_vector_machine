Fuck it who am I kidding, I just haven't bothered for a while!!!  Well it appears that I have been punished for having such a hectic and dangerous lifestyle!!! I guess it was only a matter of time until playing with explosive chemicals and swiss cheese got me hurt!!!   Picture a warzone, a bullet riddled landscape, pitted craters caused by endless bombardments from above. Imagine the feeling of blood stained sweat dripping down the back of your neck, sending shivers down your spine like thousands of tiny needles pricking your very soul. You look all around and realise to your horror that your whole platoon has been wiped out like cum stains in the wash (couldn't think of anything else!). Suddenly it hits you as if you just just stepped out in front of a train. Rounds wizz pass your ears and crack off the wall your cowering behind! In a last dip attempt you spot your salvation...........THE MARSHAL!!! Yes theres the marshal, the man in the bright yellow shirt, the man who can dodge those paintballs as if they weren't even there, the man who is supposed to be your holy protector. In the back of your mind you hear him crying to you to press on and take that bastard enemy trench, and like a twat you listen!!! So you brase yourself for the push, you ready your gun and take a deep breath, you assure yourself that you are invinsible, the enemy is only twenty foot away behind his little bit of wall and he doesn't know the fury thats about to be unleashed..........ITS PERFECT AND NOTHING CAN GO WRONG.........YOU CHARGE.................YOU STEP ON A MINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Ok it didn't quite happen like that but the long and short of it is that I made the charge, slipped, and knocked my front tooth out!!! FUCK IT!!!! THere goes my prince charming smile (Tears begin to well) I even managed to get a few nice photos of the aftermath ha ha. Well I guess its time to go meet that nice man in the white coat (No, not the loony bin guy) the DENTIST!! Yup that guy that smiles after doing his job and presents you with the bill for £6000. I will post the final cost and the photos when I have them, but until then tata.
