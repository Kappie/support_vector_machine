They were a little vague leading up to that statement, talking about Bush's general unpopularity in Europe and something about a large (no percentage given) portion of the population supporting Bush.  On a sidenote, I just about fainted when an AIDS activist was complimentary of the Presidents record on AIDS - has hell started to freeze?  Anyway, my question is simple.  Are the 100,000 protestors from the UK or are they from all over western Europe?
