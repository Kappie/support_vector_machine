I remembered this topic came up during my O-levels Chinese Oral (prelims). I did pretty OK for it. Felt quite strongly then that mercy killing was not being merciful at all. Murder was how I'd classify it. In the series, the doctor wasn't convicted. Brought some feelings and contradictions to mind.  First of all, lawyers. They'd defend the guilty for money. Innocence can be bought. But than again, anyone guilty of a crime still deserves the same rights. We can't say that a person in jail who was murdered in his cell deserves anything less than anyone else who got murdered on the street.  Second, I was kinda unhappy that even in the eyes of the law, it was possible to let the 'murderer' get away scot-free. Mercy killing was still killing. That there was a chance that freedom could be 'negotiated' in the court of law was ... I can't find the words to say it. I'm disheartened, really. I know it was just a TV show but I feel that a lot of things we see on TV were created from half-truths. There has to be some resemblance to the real world we live in. That's what made Law and Order such a damn good show.  At the the same time, I feel a bit fearful. The law isn't black and white. Reality has such a big grey area that we stand exactly on the line ready to be tipped in either direction. But all this only serves to strengthen my conviction that we need to take up some form of responsibility to uphold our beliefs. For me, it's to uphold the law as best I interpret it. Double standards prevail in everything and I don't deny that even in myself. I guess the only way is to remain balanced and react to every situation in a yin/yang fashion (Irimi and Tenkan in Aikido) but to always return back to the line/point of balance after the situation is resolved.
