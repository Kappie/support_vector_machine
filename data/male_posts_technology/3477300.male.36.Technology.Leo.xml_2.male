Actually, it's almost a year ago since we went, but that's by the by.  Obviously still holding a grudge that it cost him $40 and half a day :-)  He's put the following picture up on his "site".  Presumably he's having a dig at me because I'm always going on about how great California is and we have everything, whereas Leeds just has rain, homeless people and a tier 2 footy team.   urlLink Click for full size image     It amazes me that he totally failed to see the pre-historic monster off the port bow.  Should get his super-hero super-vision checked maybe :-P   [1] - Actually, he's no hero, he's just delusional.
