I wouldn't have known how to cope with getting infected with something deadly. Now I do. The official advice is to find Cannon and Ball with the aim of infecting them. Sterling plan.  This is an excellent parody of the  urlLink official site . Too excellent it seems - some  governmental busybody has  urlLink written to complain  that it may confuse people. Pah spoilsports. But Thomas Scott says he isn't taking it down. Yay! He'd just better watch out for eager to make amends and show they're not very  urlLink crap  after all secret service types with brollies full of poison. Probably.   via  urlLink boingboing
