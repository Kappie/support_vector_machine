The Canadian elections are getting closer and I get to look at all the parties as an outsider. I can't vote (not a citizen yet), but I read the papers, watch the TV and have to say that Canada has some of the most incompetent politicians in the world. More concerned with telling you what the other canidates are going to do rather than there own policies.  I watched the televised debate on Tuesday evening, I have never seen such a rude bunch of people, this was not a debate be a yelling match.....  Well Goto go...
