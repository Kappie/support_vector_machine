Cory Annett should be fine, and, while Randy Bowles is no Mike Sellers, he allows us to play an American somewhere else and may actually be a better blocker than Sellers.  We might be able to go all-Canadian on the line which is huge, and Eric Carter is a nice pickup.  Keith Stokes is clutch.  That said, we still need a second receiver, an import if need be, and we still have too many linebackers.  We also need a defensive end.  But if we were to get Nate Davis (who we can't cause I just read on sportsnet that he signed with Saskatchewan) or Joe Fleming, we'd have a strong enough push that we can play average defensive ends and be fine.  We're not Edmonton or Montreal yet, but we haven't lost anyone key either.  Edmonton lost Ricky Ray, Saskatchewan lost Kenton Keith, and Montreal lost Woodcock.  All being said, we are two or three key guys away from being genuine contenders.  But we still need to get those three guys.  I'm more excited about the Randy Moss/David Boston to Miami rumours.  San Diego wants a third round pick for him, and the Dolphins need to jump on this.  AJ Feely, Chris Chambers, Ricky Williams, Randy McMichael and David Boston is an offence that can win a Super Bowl with our defence.  I'd love Moss, but they want too much.  They want two of Ogunleye, Madison, Chambers and picks.  Sorry, too much for Moss when we can get Boston for almost nothing.  Plus, if Minnesota signs Ogunleye, they give up their first and third.  If we get Boston for a third rounder, and we get Minnesota's first and third, we don't need to draft a receiver and we can use all three picks on offensive linemen, which is RIDICULOUSLY weak.  Oh, and on the "I wish" radar, John Lynch was released by the Bucs.  Try passing on Madison, Surtain, Knight and Lynch.  Hell, try anything on the entire defence.  Morlon Greenwood can only be exposed so many times.  Oh, and we're also looking at Josh Bidwell as our punter.  Eat it, cheesehead!!  I'm curious to hear what's happening with everyone else's respective teams (Nex - GB, Al - Atl, Russ - Sea)  Come on, don't tell me you haven't heard anything.
