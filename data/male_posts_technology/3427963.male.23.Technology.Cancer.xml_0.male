Every Tue and thur would go all the way to CCK to swim wif my swimming kakis. Would mit up wif my fren at ard 11 at yew tee mrt station and take a bus there while another fren of mine whos very anti-social, i wld say, would be in the pool liow when we reach. I would swim for 30 laps. yes 30 laps, which usually took me ard one and the half hours to finish. 30 laps in terms of to and fro along the length of the pool is consider one lap. Siong lah but enjoy it thoroughly cos after that we would go over to the Spa Pool where they have jacuzzi and apend another half an hr there. And i got so tan in the hot afternoon sun that my dad reprimanded me and say i look like banghala. Then after the swim we would have our lunch at either yew tee or coffee chop near Lot1.  Cos workload getting heavier liow and roadshows coming up soon so stress also building up. Life's like that lah, when u r in it, u wont appreciate it. Its onli u gone thru it and look back then will find how lucky u were back then. Like when i was still serving the NS, everyday will be like thinking when can ORD. But now i find NS life very carefree cos onli have to act on orders. Now working liow, no more such things. And thinking back, how fun NS life was. Looking back at all the photos taken realli never fails to make me laugh or smile. All the stupid and funny things we did, joking ard like nobodies business, shouting ard and all the fightings also.   But nevertheless, we still have to look ahead. Looking back is good sometimes but we still have to move on. Life still gotta carry on and i guess we cant do anything about it. So, Lets move on and keep searching and work towards our goal in life or simply jus live life everyday until u vanish from the face of earth. Realli wondering now whether the scenarios in the movie, " the day after tomorrow", will happen or not. Wat do u ppl out there think??? @_@??  Cheers, Teddy (nothing to write, write crap)-_-"
