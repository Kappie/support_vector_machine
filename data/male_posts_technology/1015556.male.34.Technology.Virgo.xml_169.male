Whether or not you like Rick Warren (I for one like him), he's done a lot for the evangelical church here in the US.  Catch the end of the article, about how he would like each one of his 2000 small groups to adopt a village. "He wants each of Saddleback's 2,000 small groups to adopt a village in a developing country, make mission trips there and send educational and medical supplies, along with spiritual and financial support, to its residents." Now THAT is some influence.  What would that look like if each one of those small groups caught the vision for unreached people groups and being accountable and responsible for indigenous church planting movements in each people group?  Maybe I should send him a letter....
