What a day awaits as I've got to pick up a parcel from the Post Office (could it be a win!), I think I'll be on their door at 07:30 when they open. Also taking my mother out to Chester for a little day out, lets hope the weather stays nice.  Good night and may your god go with you! (if you have one, I don't but that shouldn't stop you)
