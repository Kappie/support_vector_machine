The only thing on my mind right now is going home and sleeping for a year. Sleep. What a waste of time. Imagine what one could accomplish if sleep was unnecessarry.  I could study. Teach myself something. I could actually finish Neverwinter Nights. I could play online, and spend an hour or two each night talking crap on IRC. Watch late night TV. I could devote more time to my so-called 'art' in an effort to drag it out of the muck and mire of crappiness into spectacular mediocrity instead. So much a person could do , if he/she did not need to sleep. . .. zzz... SNORT, Buh, wha? Oops, sorry, must have dozed off for a moment there.
