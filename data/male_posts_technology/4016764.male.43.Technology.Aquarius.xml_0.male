There are extremists on both sides of the fence, and I think they are equally insane. Somewhere in the middle is reality, and sensibility, and compassion, which is what Jesus was all about. He was not all about inflicting pain and suffering on anyone, least of all an unwanted child. He was also not in favor of killing people to prevent them from performing medical procedures. And therein lies the quandry: Is abortion a sin? Is it murder, like the Right to Lifers would have you believe, or is it the same as removing a cancerous tumor?  If you were to listen to the latest speal about stem-cell research, the right-wing would have you believe that it is a crime to take a flake of skin from your left arm, because it is living tissue after all. At the same time, the pro-choicers are sending out t-shirts proclaiming the fact that the wearer has had an abortion, and is ding-dang proud of it! I rather doubt that either of these is truth. first of all, a flake of skin is not going to get in your face and cry or yell about being removed. And no woman is proud to have had an abortion, I don't care what they tell you. When they look you in the eye and tell you that it is not a child, anyway, THEY ARE LYING! To you, and to themselves.  Still, I would not tell them that if there is absolutely no way out of the situation they are in, they still cannot get an abortion. They would just go get one anyway, through some other means, possibly injuring themselves, or worse yet, taking 2 lives instead of one. So, abortion may not be advisable, or preferable, but it should be available. And with that said, an opportunity for some ministering comes up. Again, so called christians FAIL MISERABLY at this. They stand outside of these abortion clinics, harrassing and shouting and chanting and making these poor souls miserable instead of embracing them and telling them how loved they are, and then picking them up after the act is done and comforting them, telling them it is ok, they are forgiven, and they are loved.  If you have had an abortion and need help, seek out the Heart ministry. They are there for you. If you are considering an abortion, and would like to talk to someone about it, please seek out the Heart ministry and a doctor before going through with it. You need the clinical and the spiritual assessment of the situation. And if you have wrestled with the subject, and decided to see the pregnancy through to term, good for you! Seek out assistance anywhere you can find it. Ask and you shall receive.
