After the shitstorm that followed this getting out, there was a massive witch hunt to find out who leaked it.  I know who it was (not me), but leaving the full text here probably still isn't the brightest idea.  I remember seeing my boss the day the email went out and he looked like someone had kicked him in the gut. Then he showed me and I felt about the same. Seems sorta stupid now, and from the outside, it looks really stupid. To understand why it was bad, keep in mind that the managers he's writing to are prone to gross overreactions to anything the CEO says. A lot of crazy things happened in the six months after, most of which required us techies to work more and more and more hours for free.  Part of me knows I'm stupid to go back. But another part of me is hungry for a challenge. I'm still a little pissed at myself for wussing out and leaving 2 years ago. But that's a story for another day.
