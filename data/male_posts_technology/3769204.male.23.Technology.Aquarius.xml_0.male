Honestly, it's just not the same anymore.  So I address this post to Lorne Michaels himself, and I digress...   Lorne, Oh Lord of Sketch Comedy,   What in the hellllllll have you been thinking?  As the main man behind the scenes of SNL, isn't it your job to keep the SNL name alive and well?  Well I'm sorry to break it to you Oh Canadian One, but your job might soon be mentioned nightly in the breath of fellow famous Canadian Alex Trebek.  In one word...Jeopardy.  Lorne 'ol buddy 'ol pal, I have to tell you, the level of "funny" on SNL just isn't the same anymore.  The talent has gotten progressively worse over the years, the sketches are watered down, and the visuals and original ideas are just sorely lacking.  Let's take a quick look at the recent cast members, and then we'll venture into the old school and see if we can make some sense out of this.    Jimmy Fallon, Tina Fey, Horatio Sanz, Chris Katan, Will Ferrell, Finesse Mitchell, Maya Rudolph, Seth Meyers, Darrell Hammond and a few others.  Now let's reminisce about some of the old cast members... Chevy Chase, Dan Akroyd, Chris Rock, Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, Phil Hartman, Eddie Murphy, Steve Martin, Jim Belushi, Dennis Miller, Dana Carvey the list goes on and on.  Now if my calculations are correct, some of these people have more funny in them then most of the recent cast list put together.  Except for Will Ferrell, and Darrell Hammond, I don't just see anyone up there who has that "it".  Farley, Murphy, Rock, and Hartman had "it", Katan, "Finesse", Seth Meyers, and Jimmy Fallon.. ennnhh not so much.   So to you Lorne, the man who also brought us those fantastic Canadians "The Kids in the Hall", I ask:  How do you plan to fix this mess known as the last couple of years?  You can't expect to just bring back the occasional superstar to host, and expect that your true fans will just call it even, as if the last few years just somehow vanished into thin air.  It's honestly to the point, and I'm sure true fans will agree, that you should either go on the biggest talent search ever conducted (I'm talking Americal Idol 10 times over), OR - and I know it will hurt for you to hear this - it's time to hang up the pens and pads and call it a Night.    ~J~
