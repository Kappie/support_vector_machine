I ran a fast 20 today which included quite a few times to walk since I apparently was running much faster than I realized.  I was running so fast today that I had to alter my course multiple times just so I would not end up at home before the run was over.  I probably ran around 2.5 miles today, maybe more.  The slight ache I felt yesterday in my right shin was present throughout my run today.  I will taking ibuprofen and resting throughout the day today and tomorrow in hopes it subsides in time for my 60 on Saturday.  I will still consider it a good run.  I am finding I can tolerate minor cramps or aches in my abdomen a little better without having to always slow to a walk.  That's all for today's run, now it's time to look forward to my 60 on Saturday!
