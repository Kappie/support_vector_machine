I had a good time, and saw people who I have not seen for a while. Someone asked me about the blonde I used to be there with. When I explained that we were no longer seeing each other she said it seemed like such a shame, since we had seemed so happy? I got me thinking about how little we really know about people in such situations, in rooms that are too loud to talk in and too dark to really even see people clearly. Add in the alcohol and the "meat market" aspects and its amazing that one can even claim to have good acquaitances!  Anyway, this girl (lets call her Wendy, just so I can put a name to her -- thats not really her name) danced with me for a lot of the night. From my side that is the comfort factor -- someone who can put up with my limitations on the dancefloor? I'll cling to them like a liferaft rather than risk drowning in a sea of unknown people. But how about from Wendy's side? I mean, we knew each other, and we were getting along. In the environment of a club, most of the people there have something specific in mind. I assume that she thought a "her place or mine" scenario was where last night was heading....  When all was said and done, thats not what happened. Its just not what I was looking for, you know? Wendy may have been hurt, but since she did not show anything more than surprise I couldn't really get into my reasons. Hell, I doubt I would have been able to get into them anyway. In my younger days I probably would have just gone along with Wendy and done whatever, but maybe I am more mature now (amazing how often "mature wisdom" resembles being just too damn tired!).   In any case I realized that I could show up again in a year, and Wendy would still probably be there. She would be glad to see me. She would not act like she remembered last night. Maybe she wouldn't actually remember it, for real. She would not look older in the club lighting, though in truth the club life is hard on everyone who does it regularly. I would not be doing more than dancing and would not try to translate my gratitude for a good dance partner into a more horizontal form of refreshment.   Somehow I feel like I am a better person than I used to be for some of the choices I make now... and maybe I am. After last night, if nothing else, I think I do understand myself a bit more than I used to. I'm not perfect, but I am perfecting -- always trying to get a bit better each day. What a difference a night made!
