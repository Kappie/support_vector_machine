Now, I had watched Chris "Hammer" Smith perform a couple of harp numbers at  urlLink David Barrett's  harmonica workshop concert a few months ago and he blew my socks off back then with a high energy performance.  Tonight, I walk into the bar, to find him wearing a harmonica  urlLink neck brace , guitar in hand, singing lead vocals. So the guy is a good singer, a good guitarist and an exceptional harmonica player! And he can do it all at once! Well mostly... :)  Not only that, he switched between multiple harmonicas and the guitar during the same song numerous times! During solos, he'd have 2 harps in hand ! And at one point, he replaced a busted harp reed in 1 minute flat after it broke down during a song (I think that's what happened anyway..).  The best part was when the entire band (bass player and drummer) joined us at our table during a break for a chat (Guess they felt obliged since we were the only people cheering through every song like idiots..). He muttered about how hard it was to find decent gigs at clubs, even after all these years. I did ask him if he'd taken lessons anytime, and he said he had, for voice and harp, ages ago. Well, it shows!  What do I learn from this? I need to figure out how to sing. And play the guitar. Think about it!. I could have call and response going between my own frigging guitar and harp!  Aaaargh. So much to do. So little time ...and energy ...and talent.   :-\
