As an adventure, I decided it would be nice to visit a few blogs I've never been to before. This is one way of finding someone interesting to read that is outside your normal circle of blogs.  I stumbled across a blog called  urlLink Missy In France . The blog has several good things going for it. First, it's written by an American woman named Missy, who now lives in Toulouse, France. I don't have to tell you, that people who move to a new part of the world often have different perspectives on things.  It's also a beautiful looking blog. I'm not sure if Missy did the graphic design, but it is amazing. Missy also likes to post photos. The photo's add a lot to the site's personality.
