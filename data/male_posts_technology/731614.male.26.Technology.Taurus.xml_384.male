Because life is about to get a hell of a lot more complicated.  To tell you any more, I'd have to see your CDIB card.  At any rate, I just spent a lovely and low-key evening - wait, make that no-key evening - with my uncle, his girlfriend, and my very first ever real true love and his basically common law wife (also known as the mother of his child).    I loved this boy like mad from the time I was 13 until I was 23.  I don't know if he ever loved me like that, but at a few points in our lives, simultaneously in fact, during nights that were too short, I think we felt "something" in our quivering mid-sections and recognized its existence between heavy breaths and fumbling tongues.  He may have loved me like that.  I think I saw it tonight.  In the 15 years my family has known him, he has come to be one of us, yet earlier my little age-thirteen heart still jumped when he looked at me and my mid-section quivered with an anxiety that will never quite be quelled.   I don't suppose my love for him ever really grew up, and honestly, I hope it never matures.
