And combined with the crazy-woman-speeding-down-the-wrong-side-of-a-one-way-road-in-my-friggin-lane incident from earlier in the week ..  And the crazy-person-speeding-down-the-wrong-side-of- I-280 -in-my-friggin-lane incident from a few weeks before that ..  .. I think everyone's out to get me.  Its not frigging Carmageddon people ! Or frigging England !   Aaaaargh ..
