First strategic target is Minden Place, we shall cleanse this god forsaken cultural whore house!  Then.....THE WORLD! Ever wanted to push that red button that stipulates 'Do Not Press!', I know I do.  Anyway things are really stressful at the moment, lots of things to arrange for the big Halloween party and then the big bonfire night party!!  Man the last time I had so many exclamation marks in my words was the time I recited Monty Pythons Spam Song! (not apostrophe!).  Man, I'm more unstable than normal, need a lovely lady to get me back on the rails!  Baity signing off.....
