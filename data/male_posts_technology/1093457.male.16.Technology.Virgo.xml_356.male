Helen was with me because he needed to give her a birthday present. I got to pick em up and stuff. Holly is lovely, she is so sweet. She kept coming in now an dthen tocheck on them and when they started whining she came in. Bless. You can see their personalities already, the lazy one, the attention seeker, the bully...lol. I'm feeling really down though at the moment. Everything is just so, pants.  I have found that every year my hayfever is different. This year my brain feels like it is wrapped up in cotton wool.
