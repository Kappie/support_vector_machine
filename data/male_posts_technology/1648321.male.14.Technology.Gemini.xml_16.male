They are sleeping in my room so I have to do a lot of cleaning. Mamie is also going to be with Laura. On Wednesday, we get out of school early @ 11:30 am! Mom, Laura, Kelly, me, grandma, papa, and Mamie might be going all out for lunch! Then - we're gonna kick 'em out because we're (mom+dad+laura+kelly+geoff) are all driving to Chicago, Illinois to visit Emi for the long MEA weekend! Today is a B day so thats good, and - tomorrow we only have our morning A day classes. 8-)
