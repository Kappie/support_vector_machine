That to me would be one of the worst things in the world, to sit by and see someone you care about or love, be taken from you. I find it hard watching people go through painful emotional things on tv.. I'm a hella emotive wuss... for some reason its always been easy for me to feel where people are coming from, its a blessing and a curse, all in one. I worry when my friends are sad, lonely or depressed, and usually suprise them by having been the only one to notice, or first to notice. Rah. Anyway, my thoughts go out to him at the moment. My day filled up so quickly with nothing in particular, yet I could've achieved so much more... I still found myself marvelling at how beautiful the sky was, so clear, and that perfect shade of blue that hits about 4:30-5pm... I love life, I'm not afraid of dying, and I'm not afraid of having not lived. Sometimes I forget how fortunate I am. I've set myself a goal to reach, in regards to weight, for friday night, I'll let you guys know how I go, but its to get down to 115kg. Thats all for tonight, something lighter next time, promise. Ka Kite.
