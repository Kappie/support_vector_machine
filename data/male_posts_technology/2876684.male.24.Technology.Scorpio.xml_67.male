Melbourne  was absolutely  freezing , I swear I could feel the wind on my skin despite the fact that I was wearing a jacket! It really went by in a flash though since I had only stayed the weekend, though my last night there was interesting when I caught up with some of my colleagues who were there doing a deployment in  Collins St . After having dinner at a restaurant on  Lygon St (where we scored a free bottle of wine and garlic bread), we tried to get into  The Loft  but were refused entry on the grounds that we "weren't local". HUH? Since when is that an issue? Anyways, we figure it was because there was five of us guys. You can probably figure out why we weren't let in.  We ended up going to the  Men's Gallery , and my colleagues were quite pissed off because the strippers weren't stripping. Well they did if you stuck money in their garters but apparently in  Sydney  you don't even need to do that (or so I'm told). Anyways, we spent the night attempting trick shots at the pool table in the club. I don't know, but it just seems funny to me that we were playing pool in a strip club. :P   Brisbane  was really nice, the weather was great - especially after being in  Melbourne ! I was put up in the  Novotel  which is a couple of blocks up from the site I was auditing and even the second site in  Milton  was less than 10 minutes by cab. A really good change from commuting! :)  I didn't have much free time to do exploring and I was unsuccessful at catching up on my sleep too, but my bedroom certainly looks smaller now after having a hotel room all to myself all week. *sigh*  We managed to finish early on Friday arvo and caught an earlier flight back to  Sydney . My other colleague who left the office earlier to catch his flight back to  Melbourne  ended up leaving after us, and we know because we passed him sitting at the gate waiting to board (we were called for boarding already, haha).  I caught a cab all the way back to  Penrith  and guess how much the fare was?  $134.60!!!  Thank God for  CabCharge ! :)
