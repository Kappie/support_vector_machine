Historical Biblical exegesis has centered on the story, looking at the beauty of the narrative unfolding from Genesis through Acts, and attempting to see what God is doing at any given point by revealing His Christ.  Moderns in the grip of the sin of individualism have a hard time seeing the larger story, something greater than themselves.    Now consider modern pop culture, specifically pop music.  Why does our culture lack so desperately for great story tellers?  Pop music is nothing but an endless stream of broken romances, angsty feelings, or trite love-ditties.  Hollywood Country musicians still tell stories, but they are usually hollow and moralistic, teaching us that patriotism is a fine sentiment, or what goes around comes around.  And the contemporary Christian offering seems to mimic the rest of it, replacing the angst and despair with sentimental and romantic goo.    What's interesting to me is that this didn't seem to be the case a generation ago.  Pop musicians knew how to tell stories.  Simon and Garfunkel, while being thoroughly modern and humanistic, told gripping stories in their songs.  Country stars like Johnny Cash and Merle Haggard made a living off it, telling us stories of low-lives and jailbirds.  And my favorite writer of the era, Robert Hunter (primarily with the Grateful Dead) came up with all kinds of colorful characters, set throughout American history.    Perhaps the fundamental humanism and despair of the storytellers of the 60's led to our modern introspection, but I like to think that our individualistic exegesis must have contributed as well.  Or perhaps our individualism has driven both our exegesis and our storytelling.
