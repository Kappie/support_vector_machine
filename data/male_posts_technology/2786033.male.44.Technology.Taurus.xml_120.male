While I agree with the anti-Barbie crowd (to a very limited extent) that she could use a little smartnin' up sometimes, this stickery article reflects the local tone toward, well, frankly, what we'll call 'an American toy'.    So what's on Barbie's mind these days?  The November election? Holes in the ozone? Stephen Hawking's recent reversal on subatomic theory?   Well, these  are  all things on the minds of most 5 year old girls in America.   Nope - she's looking for just the right pair of floral-design pumps.   Girls buying shoes! What next!?   A wonderfully shameless display of cross-branding is one thing. But a Barbie who pigeonholes girls in an antiquated stereotype?   Young slender women at the mall carrying bags is now a stereotype, says the guy whose ideals probably include the loathing of any center of commerce.     "How do you spell 'ugh'?" asked Debbie Newman, a stand-up comic in Eugene. "But what are you going to do? That's what advertisers tell little girls they want: Little boys want to play with guns and little girls want to play with makeup. It's just not letting  women  be as much as they can be."   Any 'women' who purchase and play with this doll have  this doll  to blame for their lack of success in life. Got it. Please continue.    But Newman, an office manager with Schnitzer Steel, would rather see the toy company introduce "Office Manager" Barbie.  "She'd be just crabby all the time," Newman said. "And outside her little Barbie office would be 17 people lined up needing something from her."   She'd be crabby, indicating that 5 year olds should carry that attitude, while being as much as they can be. If Barbie's life sucks as an office manager, could I suggest Barbie Community College? Moving on.    "Mayor Barbie," the doll dreamed up by Kitty Piercy, 62-year-old nominee for the post in Eugene.   Piercy, although absent the shopping gene, said she's OK with shopping Barbie ... as just one manifestation of the countless roles that women play in society.  "I'd like to see 'President Barbie,' " she said. "I'd like to see Barbies in different sizes, shapes and colors, Barbies of different ages - and there's no limitation to what a Barbie can be or do."   Because every kid wants "Golden Age Barbie". Hey Kitty, how about pro-choice Barbie? I won't go into a description, I just can't do it. All I'll say is, abdomen made of pliable material.  This  is how you spell 'UGH'. I can't believe I'm posting this.     Sally Sheklow, a 53-year-old founding member of the Eugene women's comedy troupe, WYMPROV!, said "Improv Barbie" would have "a belly and a butt and hips, nipples."  "Improv Barbie" would use props and shop the garage sales, not ALDO, Sheklow said. Above all else, she would enjoy free license to speak her mind ... for laughs.  "She could get away with saying anything about the need for regime change without fear of repercussion," Sheklow said, "because she'd be a comic."   Because we know all Barbie can say now is:  I wish they taught shopping in school! Let's bake some cookies for the boys! Don't ask me, I'm just a girl. Let's buy makeup so the boys will like us. Now low let's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry ice cream! (episode 1F12)  Too bad Barbie wouldn't be calling for regime change, that "regime"'s ideals made her a household name.   I guess all I have to do is proclaim my status as a comic, to avoid the 'Wrath-croft' of the government.  (Yeah, g'head and use it.)
