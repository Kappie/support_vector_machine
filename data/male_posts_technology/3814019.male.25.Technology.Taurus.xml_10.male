One you can always rely on though is the incessant nagging a man gets from a woman.When I used to drive round in my van there used to be aconstant squeaking noise fromthe wooden partition behind me, people used to ask me how I put up with it.The simple truth isI couldn't hear it anymore, it had simply beenfiltered out by my brain, its like that with nagging.My girlfriendsleepnags, she nags at me whenwe get up, she nags at me when I get home from work she nags at me when we are getting ready to go to sleepand thus the cycle of nagging continuesfor another day.But I am strong, my minds defenses have learnt from the squeaky partition,its next task is to construct a random retort generatorand maybe if it has time to do something about theglazey eyes I get.        Manhas evolved throughouttime to battle the elements, to adapt to changing environments, to crawl selfishly to the top of the food chain and to ultimately deal withthe greatest foe it has ever encountered 'Woman'.  Forgetassertions by scientists that dinosaurs died out when a meteor struck earth, the truth is that Mrs Rex and co nagged their other halves into extinction. They didn't have the necessary mental prowess to cope with the constant bombardment of demands to watch the eggs, or go fetch a nice tree for us to chew on. They died. Some time later we appeared.I just hope we as a species can cope.
