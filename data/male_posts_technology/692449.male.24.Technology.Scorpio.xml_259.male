So far I haven't reached a point of no return in my school work but I am affraid I'm going to have to drop my phil 156 course because I've just missed to many classes because I can't get out of bed. The problem is there is no one to blame but myself which increases my self loathing which makes me screw up more of my life it's a nasty cycle. I have no idea how I can begin to help myself get out of this shit. This sucks.
