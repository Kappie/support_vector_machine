Anyways, I seriously need to upgrade the stereo system in my car. Turns out the wattage of my back speakers are 25W.  25W!!!  That blows! Yes folks, I have a combined grand total of a whopping 50W blaring out of my rear speakers. Blegh! I'm hoping the front speakers are 25W each but I seriously doubt it. Definately something I'm going to be buying in the future, considering my deck is a factory P.O.S. and needs a little something too.
