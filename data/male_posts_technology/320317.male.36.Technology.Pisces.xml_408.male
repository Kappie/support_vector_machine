And now that developers have alternatives to HTML for truly distributed architecturesalternatives that don't require heavy-handed client installsmany will find themselves rediscovering the power of Windows Forms-based apps."

 This guy really doesn't get it. Sure I like the idea of richer user interfaces, but the one thing that both Macromedia and other HTML nay-sayers don't talk about is that no matter what component you build your UI in, it has to be designed well and with the user's task in mind. I have seen much cleaner user interfaces in HTML than others built in Flash.  It's the design stupid, not the technology .
