Is todays technology like computers, broadband etc.. distracting us from what we SHOULD be doing or is it really just a matter of choice? I personally don't think the workload is too much overall. Its more down to finding the time to cope with it. I for one cannot cope at the moment what with the mocks coming up. I have a 5 hour art exam this Friday and I don't have a clue what I'm doing. Ihave a 5 hour textiles exam next Wednesday and no idea what I'm doing. Add that to Eng Lit where we have to memorise literally the whole novel of 'Enduring Love' as it is not allowed into the exam with us and gelogy of which I do not have a clue. Plus general studies which I don't have any guesses as to what will happen. Its too much. Not too much work just too much pressure to have it at such a high standard even though it needs to be at that high a standard for alevel.
