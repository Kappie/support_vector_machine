Prayer is also one method which we rely on and wish for things to work our way. But not always do we find the help coming that is required. So we tend to get disheartened and maybe even give up trying altogether.  Solution:The simple way to receive help is to first have courage. When I first take a step of courage using the force of all my resources, I automatically find others taking help from that too. For having moved one step ahead, I get the help from the resources available, from the people around, God himself  me. I thus recognize and make use of all the help that is coming my way. So I never need to beg for help, but find help coming my way automatically.  The one who is able to be happy with the self is the one who is able to make others happy too.  Problem:Most of our time goes into pleasing others and making them happy. Yet we find that not always are people happy with us. Many times, instead of our sincere efforts to contribute to others, they do not appreciate what we have done. On the contrary, they might also criticise us and point out some shortcoming. Since all our effort has been to please others, we tend to get disheartened and upset with this kind of criticism.  Solution:Whatever I do is for myself. Even the contribution that I make is for myself. When I recognise this fact, I will never do anything just to please others, but will make effort to bring happiness to myself. When I am content with the effort that I put in, I will never be dependent on others' recognition of my effort. So I am able to enjoy everything and continue putting in more effort. The more I am content, others too will start appreciating my sincere effort.
