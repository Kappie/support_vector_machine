Mas ok tani kng si Brother Eddie, pero i considered the probabilities man bala kng sin-o gd ang laban² na madaog...Ü if I voted for Brother Eddie, and GMA and FPJ both have the same number of votes (it would be impossible to happen pero what if lang yah bala aw...), kanugon sng vote ko eh... tani nagdaog pa si GMA... after the election, i haven't slept gd gani.  Pati ako nagpulaw sa net while waiting for the results sa  urlLink abs-cbn  .  I'm very worried gid about the election result.  I really don't want FPJ to win.  What will happen to my future if he becomes the president of the Philippines? Tsk tsk tsk... God have mercy on me! I'm graduating next year and I don't want to be on the list of unemployed fresh graduates...
