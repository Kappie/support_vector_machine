I have to apologise for some of the pictures, some drunken fool (Me?) knocked the focus out of place later in the night. I also wanna say a big thank the guys at Guernsey Nights  urlLink  http://groups.msn.com/GuernseyNights   if you want to look at their site you will need to register with them, but its worth it to see the pictures of their nights out. I  would also like to apologise to Custard for talking rubbish at him over the phone at some unseemly hour. I don't have a clue what I said to you!
