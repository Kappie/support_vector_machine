So I'm thinking I've getting a Skoda   only now the difference between a Skoda and a skip is 0-60 in 7.9 secs and 180BHP   and really, it's a VW.  Well I don't just want any Skoda, I want the Skoda Octavia 1.8l 20V Turbo RS. Never know, I may even get one.  Alex and Ann are back tomorrow. It's been very strange being on my own. Oh Well, normality here I come.
