You know how  hard  it is to get anything done when you're in one of those moods?  Can't even pick up a phone. Too plain useless to even take an hour off work to wander aimlessly through town. Well, that's what I'm feeling now. Sure, I  could  blather on about some contentious issue. But I just don't have it in me right now. Have a nice weekend folks.
