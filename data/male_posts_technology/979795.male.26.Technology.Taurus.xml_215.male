Looks really funky (maybe a little too much so for me). You can upload MP3 onto it as well, provided they are original MP3s which do not breach copyright laws (where's the fun in that then, sheesh). There's 1 really irritating thing about it, it keeps refreshing something in the background, I dunno what. Once it got so bad it was doing it like every 3-5 seconds. I wasn't even able to key in my login ID and password properly. When I finally did, it just constantly refreshed and I can't get anything done. Think it's just an occasional hiccup because when I closed the browser and went back to the site, it never got that bad again. But it still does the background refreshing thingy coz u can hear mouse click sounds every like 10 seconds or so.  Bottom line? I'm not gonna use.
