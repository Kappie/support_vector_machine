First off, I'm not interested in having such a big group over because I really was hoping for a relatively quiet dinner. Second, there wasn't exactly enough food to go around for everyone. Oh sure, I had my fill of food, but I noticed some people wasn't eating enough. Sigh, it also comes down to some people being a bit shy and all that. No point lah, when you come to such things organised by Singaporeans, being paiseh is like one of the stupidest thing you can do. You only leave feeling hungry.  One of my housemates pointed out a point to me which I totally agree, it was that he wanted to have a proper dinner in which he can actually sit down and eat instead of stand around. I thought over his words and I agree. I also want a dinner in which everyone can be seated to enjoy the meal. I was a bit pissed lastnight and hence seemed a bit anti-social to the main crowd coz after dinner I went back to my room with some closer frenz.  But I was really pissed with myself. Pissed that I didn't voice out when my friend suggested asking people over for Xmas Eve. I didn't realise that most of my housemates actually prefered a quiet dinner instead too. Sighz... sometimes I really need to learn to speak my mind. My other housemates are basically all very diplomatic people so they took everything in comfortably. I'm not. Well, not as diplomatic as them anyway.  So my new year resolution will be to express myself nicely to people and speak up more often if I think something doesn't feel right. That's 1.  O yea, good thing is that I managed to get my stamina for swimming back. No I've yet to swim long distances, but only becoz I dun wanna be too tired for the rest of the day. Think a short swim is fine coz I've been timing myself. Estimated timing lah.  Anyway, whoever reads this. A Merry X'mas to all and Peace on Earth.
