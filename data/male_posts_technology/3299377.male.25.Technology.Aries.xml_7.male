On the bright side though I did manage to start and finish The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy yesterday. It’s a strange sort of book and I’m not sure whether I like it or I don’t will most probably get around to reading it again slowly this time to get in more of the nuances but then again I say that to myself about so many books. My personal verdict on this book seems to have been thrown into an infinite improbability maelstrom the results of which should presently be available in say… oh about seven and a half million years :-).     Started on Children of Dune yesterday. Have promised myself to read this one slowly and comprehend it to avoid the whole reading it again cycle which is quite the precursor to utter chaos. This whole reading soo many books simultaneously with so many more waiting in the wings in kind of getting to me. Though I am glad that I have started reading so much again.
