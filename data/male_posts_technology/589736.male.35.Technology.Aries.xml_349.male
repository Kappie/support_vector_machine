I'm just sad I'll miss the OktoberBlogFest. I toast you in absentia.  not New York. Honolulu. Las Vegas. Portland, OR. Little Rock (?!) That's what I get for answering the housing costs honestly, and checking the "no geographical pref" box. Hmph. I'll be moving back to Astoria (Queens) in the middle of next month, by the way, to share a place with my lovely former roommate Katharine. Will post relevant info in case of housewarming gift-urges. But I like Shipley's list best.  I like she-males.
