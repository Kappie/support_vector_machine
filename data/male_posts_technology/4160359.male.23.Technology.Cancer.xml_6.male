Its worse than the time that my Mom and Dad told me about their Divorce.  Preceeded by months of arguing and plain-to-see signs that the relationship is falling apart and that they don't love eachother anymore.   Ditched is worse than finding out my Granny has cancer, and is gonna die.  That was brought on by her choice to smoke.  Ditched is worse than finding out that you won't ever have children of your own.  Your partner, who you love more than some idealistic fantasy of parenthood, is realistically not capable of bearing children.  Been Dumped by Girlfriend before and that wasn't worse than being Ditched.  She had every reason to get rid of me.  Why would all of these tragedies of life be better than being Ditched?  Because they all have reasons.  There is a cause and effect rationale that can be applied to these situations.  Being Ditched cannot be reasoned out of.  There is no cause to bring it on.  There is no explaining it away except that some person, or persons wants to torment you, and does not want you to be around.  You have to be targetted.  Someone has to specifically pick you and hate you enough that they want to bring you grief.  To Ditch someone, you must have a cruel heart, but be able to keep it well hidden.  You have to pick your target carefully.  See that guy with the glasses, who came to the party without a girl, and has done nothing but stand in the corner and stare at his shoelaces?  He's a perfect candidate to be ditched.  This will be fun...  Being Ditched (in its purest form), can only happen to those who are already miserable to begin with.  You can't take a person who is happy and enjoying life and Ditch them.  It doesn't work.  Being Ditched, in my eyes, is the ultimate way to kick someone when they are already down.   ...We can get a great laugh at his expense.  Here's what we're gonna do.  First, find a good looking chick (or if you are one, you can have the honors yourself) to go up to him and invite him over to your clique.  He won't refuse, trust me.  In fact, his face will light up at the chance to meet someone and make a friend...  When its all over, no only will they be down, but they will be curled up in a fetal position, with tears streaking down their face, and giving serious, serious contemplation to suicide.  Ditching someone breaks the will to live.  ...You play it up a little.  Chat with the guy.  Find out what he likes.  "Transformers?  No Way! I love those robot guys too!"  You see how he smiles at being accepted by the group...  It takes away the hope that just maybe, things will get better if you can just get past this rough patch.  ...And thats when you know you have him hooked.  So, the group (Ditching works best with a group who are in on it)  all decides that they are going to do something fun.  "Lets go out to the beach and have a bonfire." At that point in time, everyone gets up to go out.  Invite the target to come with.  He may need some coaxing.  Once everyone is outside at the cars, you say to the target, "Oh hey, can you run back inside and get a pack of hotdogs?  We'll wait for you right here." or some other reason to seperate the target from the group.  Make sure you indicate that you will wait for him...  Being Ditched lets you know that there is no hope for you, and that you will always be miserable, and that any attempt to create some joy in your life will only lead you to a deeper darkness of which you have not yet experienced.  ...And when the target is out of sight, everyone takes off without him.  Its the equivilent of kidnapping someone, taking them for a ride, and then tossing them out of the moving car into a ditch.  If the hot chick who first approached him can give him a last-minute wave, that makes the game all the more cruel.  Try to time it so that he can still hear you laughing when he comes back out the door, holding a pack of weiners in his hand.  When the realization hits him that you never wanted him in the group at all, and that you were only having fun at his expense, the process is complete.  All that is left is for the target to go wallow in his own misery.  Wasn't that fun?...  Being Ditched is the way for me to know that I am truly a nobody.  I am truly so worthless, that the only way people interact with me is to bring me to the breaking point, where I am ready to accept he emptiness and embrase it as the only thing I have to hold on to.
