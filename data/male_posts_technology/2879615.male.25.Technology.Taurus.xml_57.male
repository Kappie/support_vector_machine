I,ve already had a MUCHO MARGARITA, which was delicous, a Samuel Jackson, i mean Adams, summer ale and a triumph Sampler.  That shit was tantalizing, who knew when your 21 you can actually drink good beer.  I'm used to that natty ice shit with a little keystone twist. What? WHO? Who? What are u a fuckin owl? Hahah I am def drunk right now but typing well, its because of Mrs. Roach, big black bitch, nice keyboarding teacher!!! Well im out for now drinking for a little while and then going out to da bars!!!  Wild flowers is prob not the hottest bar but you know your man will make it a good time. Thats why my name is Doug E. Fresh. THen possible Mcquinn's siteing, which i have no idea about cause my young as would never get served there!!! Peace out fellow nerd ass bitches!!     - Doug E. Fresh
