When I was much younger, Sunday meant nothing much to do, no shops open, pubs open for a nano second and TV was Sunday Night at the London Palladium. Now thank god, places are open and it's pretty much like the rest of the week, but TV still sucks (I did watch Waking the Dead, I like that).  Went to the pics and saw I, Robot. I liked it. Although I watched far too many trailers, it didn't spoil the film for me. Special effects were very good, hard to spot what is and isn't real. I'm guessing that a 1000 robots running about was CGI.  Decided to learn Flash again. Don't know why, just for something to do. It was either that or Visual Studio .Net and I can't think of anything I'll do, if I learn how to use that.  Work tomorrow *groan*    Oh and rabbits still alive.
