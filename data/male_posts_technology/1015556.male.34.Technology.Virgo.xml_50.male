The cool gist of it is that people are going to get big opportunities to ask significant questions since their whole identity, the whole landscape of work, the project, the relationships are all thrown into flux.   It's really as big as getting married, you are excited about the future, a little forlorn at leaving a chapter of life behind.  Pray specifically for CE, had an intense conversation with him about the purpose of life.  It was great, better than I ever expected it to go. Pray for the next two days, Thursday and Friday.  Lots of farewell lunches on Thursday and the mass exodus is on Friday.  Also, pray for the  urlLink missions conference   K and I are going to.  Pray esp for K, for direction and vision.
