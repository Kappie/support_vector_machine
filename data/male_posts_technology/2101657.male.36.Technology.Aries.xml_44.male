The way I'm thinking, is it's good it's gone, so it doesn't have a chance to go that way.     The other good, is that the stiches are out.  My back is fine, Doc says that it's healing nicely.  The leg..well...thats a different story.  The stiches hurt alot more when they removed them from my leg then my back.  I asked Doc about how the skin was really pulled tight and causing the skin at the edge to bunch up in a line. He said they called those Dog Ears.  Woof woof I guess.  So, he said just take it easy, I'm pretty much good to go, and sent me out the door. My appointment was at 4:15, I was leaving the parking ramp at 4:24.  The body parts smarted a hair, from having the stiches pulled out.  It's pouring practically by the time I'm ready to step out of the car at home.  I open the door, put out my left leg (can you see this coming yet?) and I must of twisted my leg just enough as I stood up out of the car, that my leg popped open. Oh, talk about stinging.   I came into the house, went right into the kitchen, grabbing a phone book so I could call the doc back.  I'm sitting at the kitchen table, dabbing the back of my calf with a paper towel, to see that yup, it did pop.  I have a live person from Doc's office at 4:41. They said how soon can I be there, I said 9 minutes, they said come back in.  Doc comes in, cleans the leg up, said Yup! it's popped. I'm thinking SOB, I have to get one of those railroad spikes jammed into my leg again to numb it out.   He said Nope! Just pack it with antibiotic ointment, and cover it with a band-aid.  So, it gets to heal from the inside out.  Hope it's done in time for BS Camp, really looking forward to that.  I ran to Wal-Mart to cash a check at the bank, and decided to look at their multi-purpose tools, as I've been w/o one for awhile now (if you know a techie geek and they don't have their multi-purpose tool, you know their mentally lost).  I picked up a nice little Gerber for $32w/tax.   My leatherman's small tip screw driver BROKE, which really pissed me off to be honest.  I decided since a new Leatherman would run me $29.99, and it was IDENTICAL to the one I have, which happens to be about 7yrs old, that I wanted to look at the Gerber Multi-Pliers 400.  Thats the one I ended up getting, I liked the pliers design, and the locks on the accessories that flip out, so they wont close on you while pushing with all your might (you know what I mean, and man is that a blood blister!).     Will see how good the Gerber does. I had a Winchester MultiPurpose too that I got last fall for $15, and it wasn't worth it.  Was $15 wasted. Looked nice, functioned not so nice..
