I think the world is about to go through a really bad phase. Well, put it this way: people on a political level and big business have been working towards a type of coup. The world has sort of been taken over by big business. It’s not one country it’s in fact big business that rules the world now. And no one has quite grasped that. It hasn’t been quite understood. And all civil liberties will be eaten away at a speed beyond anyone’s comprehension. In the meantime, music’s getting more and more about the spirit of it and the feel of it, so a type of genuine counterculture—which isn’t a marketing thing, but an actual real one—I think it’s just starting up on some level. It’s to sort of balance out the nastiness. The world is never entirely one way; it’s always got a strange balance to it, even if it’s not apparent. So, I suppose what I’m trying to say is: as bad as the world’s going to get in the next five years, I think music is equally going to become quite relevant for good reasons. The soul of music will be the most valuable aspect of it."
