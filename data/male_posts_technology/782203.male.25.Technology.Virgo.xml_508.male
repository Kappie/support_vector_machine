And btw guys say I'm more sexier when I have no voice. Me : (Laughing) It's not really a compliment when guys find u sexier when you don't speak!  Her: You are an asshole. I meant when I speak really softly and low cos I lost my voice.  Me : Eh you know it does sound kinda sexy. Eh go lower for me please?  Her: Don't make me slap you later.   Yeah that's me - a real ladies man.
