Are you looking for a chair that not only looks like it could be made by a six-year old but can  actually  be made by a six-year old? Are you such a ham-fisted neanderthal that the only tool you will use is a mallet?  Well here's just the thing for you: a Chairfix chair. As the blurb says:  "The chairs are routed out of one sheet of 8x4 15mm Birch faced ply-wood or MDF...  Easily assembled in minutes by the end user. Chairfix was inspired by Airfix model kits and is easily assembled by the consumer useing a mallet. No glues screws or fixings are needed."  You could have a couple in the loft in case extras arrive uninvited to your next dinner party: Just whip a couple up while they're hanging up their coats.  Ikea has a lot to answer for.
