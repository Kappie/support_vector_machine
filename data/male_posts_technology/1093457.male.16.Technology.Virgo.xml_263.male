I had an ok day today although there is one thing which is annoying me. And that is the fact that everyone keeps slagging off Mr G. Ok so he may not conduct the best lessons with his sarcastic comments and stuff but he is a good teacher and if it were between him or Mr M, Mr G would probably get us a better grade in the exam.
