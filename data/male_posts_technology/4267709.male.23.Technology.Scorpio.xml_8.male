He basically praised the Bush administration for being so meticulously clever with how they present what's going on and deal with crises.  He was very dispassionate and seemed to focus on the psychological aspects of the PR facet that have worked so well.  It looks more tolerable than the obvious propaganda like in Farenheit 9/11.  I'd call it a tactics study.  By my figuring there's about a nickel's worth of difference between 95% of the politicians that have made it far enough up the food chain to be in national elections.  Don't get me wrong, some are better than others, and there are honest and passionate civil servants at all levels...just the higher up you go, the more you compromise your ideals and engage in the political back-scratching.  I think it'll be an interesting read.  I'll chime in again when I finish it.
