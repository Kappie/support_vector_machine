I just loaded it up with tools and fun things, including: -Python 1.5.2 -PDF support -DOC compression support -"How to Think Like a Computer Scientist" fulltext -"MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science" fulltext -"Creating Friendly AI", and "General Intelligence and Seed AI" fulltexts -"Levels of Organization in General Intelligence" fulltext -"The Physician's Desk Reference" fulltext -"DSM-IV" fulltext -"Best of Psychology Today 1995-2000" excerpts -"Wordnet dictionary database" extended text with annotations -"New Scientist" website subscription(updated with each issue) -"AnandTech" website subscription(updated daily)  plus a few more texts for fun, the strongest palm chess program and Go programs in existence, and maps, phone books and other amusing databases. I have no memory left on it at all.. (just 50k left) but there is so much reference and capability in my hand right now...   -"The Complete Sherlock Holmes" fulltext -All the python documentation, and craploads of python code I've found useful or interesting in the past -
