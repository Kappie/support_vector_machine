I was alien to the concept of a break up. And believe me I am not kidding, I was introduced to words like "going out", "making it work" , "break up" only recently and I am 25. By now you have guessed that I have lived a great chunk of my life in India. I am not saying that relationships do not break in India. Nor am I great fan of arranged marriages. No matter where they break, they break because of one fundamental reason. Lack of faith. Here in the United States and especially amongst Men, "going out" is a fashion. It is a status symbol amongst their other guy friends. The same thing exists to a lesser degree amongst girls also. What ends up happening is that they "try". And in trying they stop being honest to themselves. Most relationships do not work out simply because the characters involved were not honest to themselves. They do not have faith in themselves and in their relationship.   Being in love is such a wonderful experience. And what people have done? They have ruthlessly quantized this experience. How do you fall in love? You "start talking". Then you "hang out". And then after a bit of thought you go out. And when you go out you have a relationship. Where is lovein all this ? Where is faith ? Where is the friendship ?
