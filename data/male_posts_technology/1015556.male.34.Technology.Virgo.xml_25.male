RESOURCES--2003-09-09 (Top Recommendations)  Below are the responses I received to the question: WHAT RESOURCES HAVE YOU USED IN A CHURCH AND FOUND EFFECTIVE IN MOBILIZING PEOPLE TO ENGAGEMENT IN WORLD MISSION? I was a little disappointed at hearing back from only 20 people, but those 20 people had quality recommendations. In each section (Books, Curriculum, Periodicals, Seminars, Websites), I put at the top of the list the resources that were recommended by more than one person (using the asterisk for a bullet), then the rest of the entries for the category follow in alphabetical order (using the plus sign as a bullet). Usually children’s resources are made into a separate category, but I combined them with the rest. ~Nate Wilson, Editor  BOOKS  * CHRISTIAN HEROES: THEN AND NOW - published by YWAM, biographies for kids written by Janet and Geoff Benge - about a dozen in the series - around $6 ea.: www.YWAMPUBLISHING.COM (From: Nancy Tichy - USCWM and Pete and Esther Errington - Mission to Unreached Peoples)   * LET THE NATIONS BE GLAD!
