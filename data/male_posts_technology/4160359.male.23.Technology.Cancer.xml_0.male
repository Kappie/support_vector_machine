Now, every time I see Men's gymnastics, I'm reminded of the Stereotypes that all the guys who do Gymnastics or Ballet are homosexuals.  So keep in mind that I've got this in my mind the entire time I'm watching this.  Now, I have to admit that these guys are fucking buff.  They are built as hell.  The things they do are amazing to me.  Of course, I have all the grace of a 1-legged wildebeast.  And I have the power of a weak, powerless thing.  And they are competitors.  They came to play a very intense game among the very best in the world.  Hamm and the guy from China are neck and neck for the lead.  Each round, they swap places between 1st and 2nd place.  And Hamm is also battling with a wounded shoulder.  Then comes The Vault.  Anyone who watched this and was rooting for Hamm would have been on the verge of tears.  Hamm was heading for a victory when he slipped and fell.  Here's a Tip:  If you are ever in the Olympics and you want a Gold Medal, falling is bad.  Hamm dropped from 1st place all the way to 12th.  And everyone knew he was out of the running for Gold.  He could only hope for Bronze, and that would take a miracle.  But Hamm didn't get a miracle.   He didn't get -a- miracle.  HE GOT TWO!  He gave the best performance of his life on the Parallel Bars and again on the High Bar.  He got twin scores of 9.837.  That propelled him back to the top.  He won the Gold Medal.  This not only was a celebration for Hamm, for overcoming an amazing disadvantage, but for all of the U.S.  There has never been a U.S. Gold Medal in this event.  It was an Olympic first.  Adding all this up, I completely banished any thoughts I had about the manliness of these Gymnists.  This dude was a man's man.  A bro's bro.  A dude's dude.  He persevered, overcame the odds, and proved himself a winner.   Then....   Then he was interviewed.  He has the voice of someone who has sucked on a tank of helium.  His voice had a pitch higher than the woman who was interviewing.  He had the pitch that only comes from having another man's Schwantz rammed up the rectum.  He was a fudge-packer once more.  There is no doubt in my mind.
