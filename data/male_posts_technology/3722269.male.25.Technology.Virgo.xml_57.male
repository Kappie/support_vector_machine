I'm so very critical of other peoples driving/parking/backing abilities, and I'm not legally entitled to drive myself. I admit that, but it doesnt mean that Im wrong, just that I'm a cheeky monkey. So deal with it.  Rotorua driving is so totally different to auckland driving... and this goes for parking, backing and well..cars in general if you read my other entries about pimped out rides. I live across from a nice wee set of shops, on a short road, between two larger roads, one side of the road is shopping, the other side is houses, choice. There is ample parking within the parking area of the shops, but apparently for HUGELY OBESE or HUGELY FUCKEN LAZY natives, it's far easier or more convenient, to park on the road, and waddle over to have a korero with aunty hemi and roll a smoke, leaving their big-ass piece of shit car parked badly, in a bad place. Fuck I wish I had a bulldozer, or a hummer with a snow plow, or something. Grr. Right, you come around a 90' corner from a straight road into our wee street, before your car has finished the turn , the nose of it will come to meet an idiot, parked a car length at most, from the corner. So you swerve, to avoid it, realising that the other car, parked opposite, means that if someone was coming the other way, you would've just died. Brilliant. The store keeper Jai - my indian nigga, has had painted, some yellow diagonals, immediately out front of his shop, to stop the 'oh I just gotta get smokes for rangi' kinda stops, that end up in a half our shop, or visit to the fish and chip shop/pokie machines or hairdresser - fuck knows... but needless to say it doesnt work, if anything its like flypaper. Piece of shit over-engined holdens and fords, stuck to it, 24/7. The town planners in rotorua did a bad job. A pretty job, but a bad job. The city street angle parking is such that if you get two 4x4's opposite one another, you wont get a third through the middle.. hell, the mini barely fits... er not that I'm driving it, that'd be illegal - even if you'd never get caught much less pulled over in rotorua, hey look over there its something distracting! *phew* People in their piece of shit pimped out rides will either boost in every 100m gap they find/make or forecourt they come across, OR they'll drive at 15km/hr, while their Lightning Audio subs shake all the remaining original body paint off their car. Asians. Rotorua has a lot of asian drivers.. that always seem to be the size of a small monkey and about as 'awake' to the world.. they look straight ahead, chuck it in reverse (eventually - it seems to take longer if you're waiting for their park) then slowly back out, regardless of what is coming.. ok a late model SLK cant have the best rear view.. but I'm damned sure if it has a problem, it has backing cameras or something to compensate? but hell, they dont evne use their mirrors, its the same as when they're walking.. this is where I'm going, and what I'm doing, to hell with you if you get in my way, if I dont own your country now, I will by the time it gets to court YO STOOPPPEH ROUN' EYE MUDDA FUH' ER! *breathes* Tourists. Bless their wee hearts, or sweet sweet asses.. mm swedish hiking babes..reow.. sorry.. off on a tangent there.. tourists driving.. thankfully you can spot the huge white camper vans a mile off.. but its still frightening to see them drive down the wrong side of the road. And if I see the universal symbol for 'Im sorry' one more time, I think I'm going to start hitchhiker killing sprees. DIE DIE DIE. Couple more peeves' and I'm off to bed.. hang in there! Distracted drivers... this covers mothers with unrestrained children, people with pets running free in the car, driving texters, driving eating a whole big mac combo with supersized drink people, and the 'I'll look at you while I'm talking and look everywhere but where we're going' people. YOU ALL SUCK. In my short time on this earth, I've been in two vehicles as they've been written off, driving neither of them, and in many more that nearly got written off, everything from late model Aristos' to 1967 minis.. vans, utes and trucks. My knees have gone through dashboards, and I have spat out windscreen glass. I've had stressed drivers take me through down town auckland red lights without stopping, I've had people drive into rocks, plainly obvious, that were bigger than the vehicle. I've learnt, even tho it'll piss people off, that I cant live with myself if I assume someone has seen something, and they havent. I'm paranoid. It's a rational fear. I dont trust other peoples driving. Me? I'm perfect. Shut up. I am too. Ask... him, or her, or them.. they know ;) Ka kite ano folks :D  Quote for the day: "The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence"
