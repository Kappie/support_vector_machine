There was some pretty convincing anti-Esso propaganda on the poster boards at my school.  Anyway, I purchased $4.85 of gas as that was how much spare change I had. Moreover, the main reason I wanted to go to Esso was to redeem my Esso-extra points.  For every dollar you spend at Esso they give you 1 point. I'm sure many of the other points programs work like this... seems very standard.  The total count of my Esso extra points was a whopping 667 (4 of which were brand new - the other 663 were accumulated sometime in the 2000-2001 time frame). So what does 667 points get you - well I'll tell ya... those points got me 6 regular sized chocolate bars - each worth roughly a dollar... or 100 points a piece.   So I gave Esso $667 of my hard earned dollars - and they gave me a single penny back for each of those dollars. I guess when you think about it - it could have been worse... I could have been given nothing.  But wait -  I'm sure Esso (Exxon) is probably a multi-billion or even trillion dollar company - doesn't anyone think that they could have given me a little bit more back?  I can't help but feel as if they don't really value the business I gave them in 2000-2001. I just wish they could have been more appreciative.  In the end - I even threw away my last 67 points ($0.67) - maybe that was a bad idea - with the gas prices now - another half a tank would have given me enough for another chocolate bar.
