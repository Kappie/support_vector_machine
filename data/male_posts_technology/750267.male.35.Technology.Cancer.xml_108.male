Essentially, I'm working at a small company (50 employees total), with only one full-time IT guy. They've brought a couple of consultants in (myself and another) to design and develop the system that runs their business. So far, it's not a lot of fun but it is interesting. I am looking forward to facing and defeating the challenges that are coming up, and there appear to be many.  Also, I had the double-whammy of being hit with allergies and a cold at the same time. I came home from work a couple of hours early Friday, and slept for four hours. Zonk! I'm better. It must have been a 24-hour cold that's going around. Or maybe it was SARS - we'll never know.  Of course, my wife kept feeling my forehead for a fever every 20 minutes while I was asleep. SARS has got her scared, since we are living in what appears to be one of the main outbreak cities. "It's not SARS, honey."
