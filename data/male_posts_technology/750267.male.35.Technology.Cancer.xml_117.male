I found myself saying "Wow..." several times as I watched it in the theater.  On the other hand, I had a bit of trouble following the story. Some of this may have been intentional, as they already know there is going to be a third installment which will explain everything. I found myself saying "Huh? What did he say?" a couple of times. I might just have to get the DVD just so I can replay a few scenes, pause them, and think about what happened. In "real time", things happened much too quickly for my slowing brain to comprehend.  I don't want to give the movie away of course. And if you've seen Martix 1, you have to see this one. It's definitely worth the $10 matinee price of admission. Although I'll have to wait until November (Matrix 3) to fully get my money's worth...  Scott
