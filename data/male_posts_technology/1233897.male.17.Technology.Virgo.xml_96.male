(will break windows, but not humans)  Yesterday, I left the house at 12:35, drove to Matt's house, dropped my stuff off, and drove to school to meet Mr. Weber and company. We got to the theater around 3:20, with JR griping the entire way about how we were missing the previews :)  The movie, Anger Management, was quite funny, but more than slightly obscene.    After it was over, Weber drove me back to Matt’s house, where almost everyone was already gathered.  In attendance were, Goody, Matt *umm… yeah*, Steven, Brady, Pat, the other Matt, Adam, Jeremy, Josh, Kevin, and me. Kevin had to leave early, cause he had a double header for baseball the next morning.  We got 7(?) computers up and running, and 4 Xboxs, all LANed, naturally.  Over the course of the night, Steven and I called Sam, and talked collectively for around an hour, most of us worked out, and most of us watched at least one of several movies: Signs, The Ring, Phone Booth, the Legend of Drunken Master, AI, and one other. We played HALO (duh), Tribes I / II, Unreal, Counterstrike, Smash Bros., Red Alert I / II, StarCraft, and many other games. I left this morning, at around 11:30, and have been here, dozing, ever since.
