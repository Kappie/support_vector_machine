The second reason was compelling enough for me to grab the offer with both hands. The next round of investigation revealed some more facts. Orkut has been named after one of the the company's employee Orkut Buyukkokten who developed the product in the free time available. It seems Google encourages its employees to utilise 20% of their time to pursue their personal interests, an attempt to increase employees' creativity. Ofcourse, it led a string of thoughts in my mind. But, lets not digress out. This release of Orkut comes in the aftermath of Google's futile attempts in buying out Friendster, another social networking service. The social networking service seems to be a huge market of which I was ignorant till the day before. But here's the smoke in the fire. Days after the orkut was released, Affinity Engines(AE), a company co-founded by Orkut filed a lawsuit claiming that Orkut has stolen the code of its SNS. Orkut, a stanford graduate, co-founded the company after Club-Nexus, an application he wrote for stanford alumni became a huge hit. AE alleges that the company discovered same nine bugs that were in its product. AE also accuses that Orkut had assured he would not work in a social netwroking product in Google. AE claims that Orkut, a Turk joined Google to resolve his visa problems. Google is already facing issues on a large front fighting off lawsuits from Overture, a company that had patented the idea of auctioning the positions in the search results. Adding up the hue and cry is the issue of google providing context based ads in Gmail. So, right now after Microsoft and Oracle, its Google thats facing the music.
