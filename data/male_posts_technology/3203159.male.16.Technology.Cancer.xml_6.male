The title of this post is for my mind.  I wish a tidal wave would come and wash it all away, a lot of stress has come lately from the programming thing.  I love programming, and I've been burning myself out making something that isn't needed or useful or innovative, so I'll go back to coding things I love.  I'll tell you whenever I have ideas.  A blog is just what I need, something to write.  I like journalism, and I love psychology, so soon enough I'll move this blog over to rev.shadonet.com and I'll make my own design, figure out how to add my shoutbox (which I did code, muaha, bow to my 10 lines of text input Perl script), and also add a special section for "Life Unnamed."  For now I'll just put it on rev.shadonet.com.  A lot of people like to see it.  It will be nice.  Relaxation puts me in a pretty happy mood, and I can count pretty far up who has tried to put me in a happy mood.  Finally, one person did.  Not sure how, but thank you Kaptain.  Really.  :)  Anyways people, Life Unnamed, coming soon.  Until I have a chance to get organized, visit:  http://traviswalters.sytes.net/ - Travis' site.  We are just so cool because we blog after the craze started months ago.  http://rev.shadonet.com/life.gif - A picture of me.  http://rev.shadonet.com/Miracle.html and http://rev.shadonet.com/rl.html - Two articles out of about 5-6 currently written ones for Life Unnamed.  More soon.
