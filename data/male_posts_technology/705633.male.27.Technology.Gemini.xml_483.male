That Rage track is class tho :-)  I liked the scrap between Neo and Seraph... hopefully get to see some more action from him in Revolutions.  Out of the whole film id have to say the one part i didnt really enjoy and found it boring was the Zion thing... went on way too long, who really cares about seeing them dance..... god damn it i want fighting.  All that said im looking forward to November.  But then there are still some big movies to come that i cant wait to see...... The Hulk, LOTR - The return of the King, The Last Samurai and T3 to name a few.
