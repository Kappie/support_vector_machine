Relaxing in the driver's seat, listening to  urlLink Oakenfold  or  urlLink Corsten , catching up with friends on the telephone.  Most people would despise the drive.  Most would resent putting this many miles on their car, this fast.  I don't mind, though.  I bought a driver's car, and drive it I will.
 
 One unfortunate side-effect has been the exhaustion of my musical resources.  Quite frankly, I don't think I can listen to Oakenfold's Cream or Dave Ralph's Tranceport II again without forever revolting against the genre.  I keep forgetting that there's a lot more out there, though.  I definitely don't keep up on the industry like my friends do.  But I decided to do something about it this week.  This week, I refreshed my collection -- and I didn't just stick to Trance.  Here's the list in no particular order:
 
 Tiesto - In Search of Sunrise 3
 Tiesto - Nyana
 Thievery Corporation - The Richest Man in Babylon
 Outkast - The Love Below / Speakerboxxx
 Outkast - Aquemini
 Outkast - Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik
 Cee-Lo - Cee-Lo Green and His Perfect Imperfections
 Goodie Mob - Still Standing  
 
 I'll let you know what I think once I've had time to listen, but early results are in and Tiesto's In Search of Sunrise 3 looks like an instant masterpiece.
