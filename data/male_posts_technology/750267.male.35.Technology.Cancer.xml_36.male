So Mother Theresa only needs one more miracle to become a saint. The gist of the miracle attributed to her was that someone who was sick prayed to Mother Theresa and was cured of the disease.  I also read that in the 20 years since John Paul II has been Pope, he has canonized more saints than all of the previous popes combined. Think about it for a second, more saints have been created in 20 years than in the previous 1,400 years.  What's wrong with that? Lots of things I say. First of all, I don't believe in miracles. I believe there is a God, there has to be. He created the Universe, how else could it have been formed. But that's where his involvement in our lives ended. He started the ball rolling, and everything that occurred since that time has been due to the Physics and the Laws of Nature. That LIFE exists is a miracle. That someone thought they saw an image of the Virgin Mary in the mist of a waterfall is not.  (Every once and a while the Toronto Raptors win a game, which can be considered a miracle I guess too. But I digress.)   Second of all, just because someone lived a good life (or a great life -- Mother Theresa is often cited as the epitamy of kindness and selflessness) does not make them an actual saint. Sorry. That's not how it should work. There are tens of thousands of people like Mother Theresa -- nuns and missionaries who have devoted their lives to helping the less fortunate -- who will not have enough "fame" to be made into a saint. It shouldn't be a popularity contest. There should be an injunction on the granting of sainthood for 50 years. Or perhaps some future pope will recind sainthood from a few hundred of the less worthy...  It's kind of like all those Universities that grant Doctors degrees to movie stars. Bill Cosby has a Doctor's Degree -- and for what? Doesn't that diminish the value of the people who earned their doctorates? Doesn't thousands of new saints diminish the value of the existing ones?  Scott (I hope I don't go to Hell for that...)
