The name is Joshua Smith, the nick name Mord is a desperate attempt to be recognized as a special fluffy spiritual entitiy with out having to go into the painfully irritating subject that is my spiritual-oneness... Come one.. naked bearing my soul? No one wants to see that.  And just to point out.. Mord.. is short for Mordaith... No one calls me that.. except like... oh maybe 3 people... in the entire history of me being alive... so... Do not feel obligated.. Ironically it would probally cause me more discomfort than anything... but.. I move on.  I'm inspired by The Good Doctors Blog.... and well... I feel the need/urge to review something. But my thoughts on movies... not really worth it.. I'd prattle on about this .. or that.. and loose sight of any artistic quality... Besides.. .I wouldn't know artistic quality if it jumped out of the shadowy hole that is my house.. and bit me square in the butt.  So I think I will review life. I'll just.. take portions of reality and subject them to my careful discerning gaze....  ...  Or maybe.. resturants...  No reality it is. I have nothing really that I can think of.. I don't want to force something, so, I'll just wait until inspiration hits me. I'm fairly sleepy, it is almost 3am... and I do work in about... 13 hours...   or something like that.  Anyway. Jesse is going to reject the concept that I know him... now that I've filled this with smatterings of 3am-ness.  Later People.  -Josh
