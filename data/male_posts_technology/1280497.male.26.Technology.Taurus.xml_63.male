[Awkward silence]  Me: So, yeah, it's really great because you get to have all your news right there and it gets it for you and did I mention that it's really great?  Them: No, yeah, I mean, it's really cool.  Me: Yeah...[Me waiting expectingly, as if they will sprint to the nearest computer to start trying it out]  Them: I'll have to check that out...  [Awkward silence]  Me: Yeah, totally. Uh, bye.  So I'm no longer a proseletyzer of RSS, but rather, a simple, humble follower. The people have rejected my message of good and timely news delivery, of a one-stop clearinghouse for blogs and websites alike, and I will go to my own place and simply enjoy what good things there are for me.
