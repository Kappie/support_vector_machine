HOT!   urlLink http://www.russellminer.com/mainSite/galleries/newRig/FrameSet.htm   Overall, the case is a little noisy (with 3 fans..thats not shocking).  But the preformance i am getting makes up for it.  The third machine which was previously dead, is now being partially resurrected with the motherboard and 1ghz chip from my old machine.  Chris will likely upgrade to it slowly, as she hates the trauma of switching machines.  (dont we all).    Luckily for me, after all the installation work I only had to "repair" my windows install that means i didnt lose any data (SWEET!).  I did however, lose some hardware, my old A drive got dropped... but who needs it!! (note the new rig is sans A drive!  GO evolution!)  Enjoy the pics and c u later!
