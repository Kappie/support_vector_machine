The data is pulled from various airports, both civilian and military, so no chance of a local weather report for Sunderland then. As New Links aims to be an equal opportunities blog here's a special forecast for the mackems: Everything will be grim.  I saw an even neater implementation of this earlier on. This  urlLink blog  has a banner which is the representation of the view from his parent's farm.
