Lay on top of that the struggle for revenue and sales credit on every deal and it leads to a tough environemtnt to accomplish results.  I'm on this call right now in which two organizations are fighting over revenue and justifying their place on a sales in which I was instrumental in closing.  It boggles my mind that the same executives that are sitting on this call arguing over credit for a deal would change their tune when it comes to getting their own team members (employees) to jump into a tough situation.  Then we would hear "let's win one for the team".  When a guy that has been at the company for five months is providing direction to a team that average 20 years that could be an issue.  That is to say direction on process, approach...versus simply vision and leadership.  That's it for now...not completely clear.
