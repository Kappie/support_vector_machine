Fuck it was a lot of work! But hey, I need to get use to it, and get my ass a real job. So I finally got home about 7ish! I left the house this morning at about 930! So it was a long day for me... And tommrow I need to do the Lowes in Orange, Ct. I got to take a long bus ride, and hopfully I get on right one!  Well I was watching the Graham Norton Effect tonight. This shit is funny! I am glad that I am starting to laugh again, and actually mean it! What started me up again, was that New Staple's add with Alice Cooper, and his dauther! I have been considering getting in to satnd-up comedy.... I have done a few open-mike stand-up's in Norfolk in the early 90's! So I think I would do pretty good... once I get my mind somewhat back... But I have yet to hear about a comidian that was SANE! I think you would have to be CRAZY! So I should feel at home!  Well I am tried, and I have another long day ahead of me to I am gonna finish watching the Daily Show..  So Lates!
