Steph is listening to the cowboy bebop soundtrack and mom is wondering why we listen to this type of music. I'm getting used to typing on this machine. What with all the status messages I get for the servers at work, I'm always looking at the damn thing to see if anything important came in through email. Oh well, time to send this off and sit here :)
