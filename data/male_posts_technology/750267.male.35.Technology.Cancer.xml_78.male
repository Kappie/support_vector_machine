I don't know what prompted me to do that, except I liked some of the promised features  -- RSS feed particularly. It turns out there are a ton of other features. I've been posting my entries by email lately. My blog entries now have titles.  You may notice that I then changed the style for the site. No particular reason, although I like this compact yet imfortative style.  I then downloaded SharpReader and got hooked on other people's blogs.  I then learned about a blog search engine called  urlLink Feedster . Cool. I added my RSS feed to their database.  I'm motoring along. This blogging thing might actually lead to something.
