(Let's set  a starting point, but keep an open mind.  Certainly won't consider multi-million dollar space flights.) 2.  Can't be a matter of quantity alone. (eg. Nobody's won the Tour de France 7 times.) 3.  Can't be something that's so obscure that nobody will care.  (eg. Nobody has ever jumped across Big Beef Creek wearing nothing but pantyhose.) 4.  Can't be illegal.  Any ideas?
