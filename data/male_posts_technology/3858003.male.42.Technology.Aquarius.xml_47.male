Papi (you know the big guy they call Willie) knows you don’t really mean to get so cranky, but after all he takes care of you day in and day out, and doesn’t always get a lot of help from your Daddy (me) because I’m usually at work all day.  So do me a favor and take it easy on him…he really wants to be the best dad a baby can have, but you don’t have to test him so hard.
