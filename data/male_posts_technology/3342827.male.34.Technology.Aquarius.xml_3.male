How  do  other people manage it? I need an old 50s style wife that can be my personal assistant and keep me supplied with freshly laundered shirts, food and a personal taxi service for those 4am finishes would be great too. Please send all applications and your terms to the address below.  During one of my two relaxing baths on Saturday I also pondered (lots of this going on today) my love life, or lack of it. I thought I should write a dating profile in the style of a classified listing...   Offered:  One slightly used man, caring, intelligent, fun, romantic, looking for meaningful relationship, i.e. wife, marriage, 2.4 kids, dog, cat and chinchilla. Kids, dog and cat are optional but chinchilla is a must. Very good condition for age, 34 but needs some attention. All offers accepted, no timewasters.  ...but like all these pondering moments they get nowhere other than pass the time whilst the warm water wrinkles my skin. Maybe I should Google for 'Why does warm water make your skin wrinkly?' or why it only affects your fingers and toes, why doesn't all of your skin go wrinkly? Bizarre thing, the human body.  As for why I had two baths in one day, it was an invitation to go out that caused the cleanliness purge. After one late night on Friday and waking up around Noon on Saturday I had a relaxing bath to ease the pain of 3 hours of energetic dancing with two Turkish girls. I was then invited to go out with some Italian girls so decided I better smarten up, buzz my head, have a shave and wear some clean underwear. You never know, I may get hit by a bus on the way to town. Or with my luck, get hit on by something that looks like a bus.  So Saturday night came, I partied (is this a word?), I crashed out, I watched the Grand Prix and then went out on the Sunday night too. That night finished at 2am and I very, very reluctantly got out of bed at 7:45am to go back to work. So another weekend of excess has finished and my desk is littered with bottles of water ready to start the rehydration process and some more starvation before I cause irreversible amounts of damage to the waistband on my trousers.  Kudos to my dancing technique though from the two Italian girls on Saturday night. All those green daggers from the onlooking males didn't hamper it too much then, lol. Red Bull  Vodka, whoever thought of combining these two ingredients deserves the Nobel prize. Maybe the Chemistry one?
