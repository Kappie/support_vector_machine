(lol) The bright orange "Wreck Ahead" signs littering the side of the road and the fact that the left lane's blocked off with cones offers some explanation as to why.   This laptop's starting to become an annoying weight on my legs so I might put it down soon but I don't really feel like it yet.  Yeah, we just passed the accident site... from the looks of it, a 'fifth wheel' camper came off its frame and fell onto the road.
