Sorry I haven't been blogging much at all (and I can probably speak for Dave here too), but we have both been at panto every night this week till about 11pm, and by the time I have got home I have been knackered, and not had time to blog! So I apologise for me, and I am betting that David's reason is the same! I actually watched it last night (eveyr other night i have been changing scenery) , and it was hilarious! The Dame (who is always brilliant) messed up the end so much. They were singing this song about  'Where's the Cat'  to the tune of Robin Hood, and he came in at the worng time, so eveyrone was singing different things, and then he said " right, after 3" but ewhen he got to 3 they were in the wrong place in the music, so he had to say "4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9" really qyicly, and it was so funny! Also, they got the whoel audience stadnign up and sitting down in time to the music, and some bloke got totally out and stood up at totally thew wrong time on his own, and everyone laughed at him sooooooooooo much! Even the Dame started laughing, whcih he usually doesn't do (they're not supposed to laugh!). Other than that, the usual panto 'hitches' have happened (including the princess not turning up on cue, and then not appearing for a few minutes after that too!), but generally it is all a good laugh and everyone has a wail of a time! I have also made some new freinds, which is rather nice.  PANTO PARTY  next weekend, guys!" yay! Can't wait! Hah ha ha ha.  FREDDIE AND CHIRS. Ahem. Nicki, Are you sure you don't mind if I pay £20? I will pay monday, if that's okay. Yell if it isn't, or whateva!
