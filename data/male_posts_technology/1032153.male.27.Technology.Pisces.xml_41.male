It's one of our favourite movies and we watch it regularly. Hehe, we even know most of the dialogue, and facial expressions. Chaucer is soo soo funny.  This morning I got to work early, and read the passage about Dinah and Shechem. The version I was reading it in translated what took place as 'Schechem violated Dinah." The CEV has the word rape. It was a bit unclear as to what actually took place, because later on Shechem is described as "he was honored above all the house of his father." That tends to indicate that either the rest of his family were a bunch of scoundrels or there is more to this than the initial reading throws up. I thought that perhaps it was an example of fornication where the two parties were consenting. Which is judged to be bad anyway by God. It was seen as a humiliation to not be a virgin when one got married. When I looked at the Hebrew dictionary that came with E Sword, the Hebrew word that has been used as rape or defile had various meanings, meaning it was still possible for my idea about this to be correct. If this were true (and I'm not saying it is, it was just a suggestion) then the fact that we wanted to marry her makes him a bit better. Instead of just getting what he wanted, and then sneaking away and buttering off, he proposed commitment. Not only that, but we see in verse 3 that his heart cleaved to her. This suggests not mere lust, but a constant continued affection. He also offers any price for a dowry, as a way of seeking ammends. Interesting. A difficult passage at any rate, and I'm still not sure what to make of it. But God had everything under control, and he did not want Israel to join into a pagan family, so he destroyed them. Even that's confusing. It seems that the writer looks down on Simeon and Levi for their deceit and murder of Shechem's whanau. They justify their murders by saying that Shechem shouldn't have treated their sister like a prostitute. What really seems to make their action evil, is the use of a sign of the covenant of grace to deceive the men and later kill them. There is much more I wish to look at in this passage, but I share just a few of my thoughts about it here with you.  Better catch some zzzzzzzzzzz's.
