Caught between a rock and a hard place, web designers face a formidable challenge. Yet they are finding an unsuspected ally in the battle: web standards."

 Personally I feel the business benefits of web standards are far more important than anything technical, after all I think we all understand what really drives decisions on producing a web site.
