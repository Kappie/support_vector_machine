Monday, my brother-in-law and I went to Tupelo to see his parents and get some cash so he can graduate.  On Saturday the parking in Ballard Park was a nightmare.  People were inconsiderate at their parking blocking everyone in, in every direction.  It has been raining this summer more than any other since I have moved to Mississippi.  The ground was soaked so before we came to Ballard Park we got a tarp that went below our sheet that we sat on the ground.    So there, my wife, Joey and I all sat; looking around at the sites, watching the sky, and eating PB, Pimento and Cheese, and brownies.  Eventually the fireworks went off, and … we were behind a god damn tree.  So quickly we all get up, Joey grabs one end of the tarp, I grab another and we yank it under a bright street lamp.  For the next 20 minutes we sat, tried to watch the fireworks, and had 30-60 bugs crawling on us at any one time.  The bugs ranging from crickets to mosquitoes were some of the most annoying things I have ever seen.   After the show, we packed up our blanket, tarp, and coolers and started towards the car.  Traffic was a nightmare.  People had serious road rage, trying to cut everyone off.  Of course I joined in and was more successful than 90% of the people out there at winning the cut off.  I am normally a calm laid back person, but if their going to be rude, then so am I.  Sunday, I spent the entire day mowing.  The grass was still damp and the mower died often, but in general it was a successful day.  The yard work got done, my wife spent the day resting from Saturday, and I really felt like I had accomplished something.  It was a fantastic day.  Monday, I went to Tupelo with my brother-in-law.  We had a Coffee at Books-A-Million, saw Spider Man 2(good movie), and ate supper at Harvey’s.  Everything went as planned and everyone had a decent time.  My brother-in-law lost his cell phone; we searched everyone under the sun, but in the end…. We never found it.
