It was this glorious summer that saw the formation of this, Jersey's most awesome website, beating even Jersey European and Les Follies in the local web site rankings. It was a summer where a group of ordinary guys got together, and decided to throw off the shackles of women calling the shots and we reclaimed our hunting instinct, armed with credit cards and razor-sharp wit. It saw Custard in numerous violent outbursts, Baity in and out of love like granny doing the hockey cockey, Speed ruling the local Karaoke scene with a iron fist, Danger getting thrown in Libby Square fountain, Danger getting thrown off the Miss Battle of Flowers float, Grist offering group sex to a birthday girl standing in line at the taxi rank with her boyfriend ( "I'll even push his arse in for him if he's tired.." ) the hi-jinx and joviality have been hard and fast.  But don't you think for a second that we are going to slow down now the weather's gone a bit shit. Bleak October is pregnant with the promise of office parties, Christmas parties, new year's.. You name it.  It may be cold outside but it's sunny in our hearts, and girls to sunbathe. You see where i'm going with this?
