The next class was slightly better. However, being Pri 1s, it kinda took me 1 hr just teaching them how to login to the sys. That's normal lah since they're still so young. Tues, I took 1 teachers training in the morning and 2 Pri 1 classes again. Teachers training was slow but I did gain some insight on how I can conduct classes/workshops with them in future. Same thing for Pri 1s. But I think I'm either getting faster, or the classes are getting more obedient or are generally just more quick in learning because they seem to be going 1 step further than each of the previous classes. Anyway, just to share some cute moments in my classes.  In my first class. Bunch of Pri 1 kids raises hands and calling me: 'Miss'ter Tan, Miss Tan. Me: ... Me (to kids): Mr Tan  Trying to keep the class quiet. Me: Class be quiet. Girl: Keep quiet lah keep quiet lah... Me: (thinking to self) *She's making more noise than any of the others.*  Trying to 'por' them a bit just to get their attention. Me: Is MO1 an obedient class? Class: YEEEES!!!  After giving instructions. Me: Who has any problems raise your hand. Girl: (Raises hand) Me: (Walks over) Yes, what's your problem? Girl: No, I finished already. Me: ...  Something I heard last Sat on the bus to school/work. We were passing the Sheares Bridge over the Kallang River where you can see some nice condos on the river front. Daughter (Pri school age) to Father: Actually I want to stay here one (Points to condos). Father: Ya, I want to stay here also. Daughter: Next time I will built a house here. Father: A house? Why not a bank? Me (cannot tahan liao): (Smirking and controlling laughter. Exchanged smiles with the father.)  Kids say the darnest things...  Tonight's Aikido class was kinda disappointing. I didn't think I managed to pick up much or remember enough of it. Worse still my sitting kokyuho seems to be worse after switching partners. Seriously man, need some serious help on this. Managed to remember to bring down my grading booklet for Sensei to sign my 5th kyu grading after such a looooong while. When I renewed my membership, I think I forgot to tell him and he kinda just missed it as well. Also finally remembered to bring down Hattori Sensei's old video clips on CD to pass to Han via Sensei. Again something I've been owing for mths now. These days memory seriously not too good leh.  At the end of practice, Sensei said the Aikido trip to Hanoi has been confirmed. It'll be from 15-18th Apr and it costs S$900+. More expensive than Bangkok. Haiz, bopians. Can't go anywhere this year I think.  At the end of class I asked Sensei if it's OK for me to train 1 day each week with Yuishinkai. He thought it over for a few seconds and simply said that sounded OK. I'm quite glad really, hope I can learn something from both sides. I'll try to blog what I can whenever I can after each training.
