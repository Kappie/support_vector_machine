All he watches is american anime, and took my name and as he would say added 'leet'...I'm sorry but its 'Elite'.  Damn Follower  He is trying to be like me and I absolutely dispise people who steal other people's ideas or worship the ground people walk on.  Seriously, he wants to be me.  COME UP WITH YOUR OWN SHIT!  I made a forum, and several sites that have been fairly succesful and he steal's my name, he should just change it to Ll4m@.  There is this one kid named josh, he follows me around and we are good friends sometimes. But i actually hate going to skool because of him. He is a follower and one of those people that ask stupid questions that no one knows the answer to, but obviously, I know everything...  I hate people with no self pride and/or ABILITY.  ---and the Llama, Hell, you dont even know html, altcodes, or even how to pronounce 1337 (üH - LëëT) YOU ARE NOT ME!  D4nm FØllØ\/\/3|2
