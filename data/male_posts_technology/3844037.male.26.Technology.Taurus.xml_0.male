Try  urlLink [The Gaming Glove ]   Only 10 quid (plus international postage and packing)  ... Who on earth buys this stuff ? ... Oh wait I know someone who has hehe :P  (erm.. its not me btw .. i just bought a pointless  urlLink giant arcade controller  .. its a little more sane, if hellishly impractical [ although useful in a fight! ] :P )   [mRg]
