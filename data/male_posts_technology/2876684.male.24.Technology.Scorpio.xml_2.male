We had a pre-lunch coffee and ended up sitting and chatting for a good 3 hours before we decided to move on! Lunch was basically the same thing and we stayed long past the cleaners had barricaded the seating area we were in at the food court. No I didn't panic, at least not much, haha. :P  I retract my statement earlier this week about the weather becoming good - it's been shocking! Cold and wet, just like Melbourne... *grrr* At least it's not blazing hot anymore I guess. Karate was good, small class again so we worked lots of self-defense techniques and the last 15 minutes were killer with shadow-boxing interspersed with pushups, situps, and leg raises. Ever try punching when your arms are fatigued? It feels like you couldn't hurt a fly...
