Saw plenty of fireworks from my lani, and had a few good things to eat too.  Looking forward to going to Kauai in a couple of weeks, seeing some of my family.  My parents are off in Ireland right now, and next weekend I am gonna try and scope out some places for them to stay at Christmas time.  Here's a picture of some of the fireworks.
