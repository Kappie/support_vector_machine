Tell me I'm not scared anymore. I got no secret purpose, I don't seem obvious do I? I don't seem obvious do I? The DJ never has it, J A M C Automatic. If those were Roy's headphones, you bet he'd play "What Goes On".  Honesty or mystery? Tell me I'm not scared anymore. I got no secret purpose, I don't seem obvious do I? I don't seem obvious do I? Oh I'm here, that means something doesn't it? Oh won't you dance with me a little bit? Oh you don't notice, I guess the music's too loud. It's how the hustle goes, see what the jukebox knows. Put my last quarter on, I play "Authority Song". Honesty or mystery? Tell me I'm not scared anymore. Say anything you want already I'm not scared anymore. Honesty or mystery? Want something else? Just tell me I'm not scared anymore. I got no secret purpose, I don't seem obvious do I? I don't seem obvious do I?   Yesterday, Cam and Andrew left for Vegas. They're going to be gone until the 7th of next month. This sux, I'm gonna be so bored. Ah well I have a ton of h/w to keep me occupied. I'm going to my school tonight for the annual 'Hoop-a-Thon'.. Speaking of which, I'd better get off and take a shower.
