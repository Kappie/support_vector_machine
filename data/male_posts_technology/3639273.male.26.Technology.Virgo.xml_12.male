I turned around only to see people chasing after me.  Taunting, laughing, shouting aloud.  Obsenities, oblivious and proud.   I fell upon my knees and prayed that  shelter, comfort, love would stay.  I cried aloud again and said.  "Lord help me in your special way"    "Deliver me Lord on this day"  "Open the heavens" hear my cry.   Again I heard no reply.  I prayed some more  "Father do you hear?"   As On my knees I cried in fear.   "Lord do you hear me in my pain?."  "Do you hear me in my sorrow?".   Just then a burst a kind like voice  said ..."Relax my son,there's alwaystomorrow."
