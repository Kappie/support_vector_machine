Like most of my blogs this one too had its origin in a conversation with my father. As usual I am writing to get all your opinions on this.    We say that any deed performed for self gain is called selfishness and any deed performed for the good of others is a selfless deed. But is there really something called selflessness.     The reason this question arises should be evident but I will explain my view point on this. When I perform charity it is to gain good will, name, or expecting a return favour when we need or at the least to accumulate   Punya   on my journey to meet God on the  D-Day . It is the same case when we help somebody. So everything boils down to selfishness. The only reason we can give for calling these deeds selflessness is by emphasizing the point that others gain more than I do.    So is there any point in calling any deed selflessness? I do not know.    No offence to any one intended but just a thought that struck my mind. I wrote this weblog only for the sake of writing.    As usual I thank you for all your patience and as usual feel free to comment.
