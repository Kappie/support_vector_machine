You double-click hyperlinks...ewwwww(I can't stand that), and wonder why 2 windows pop up instead of 1. 2. You think your pc needs an upgrade, when you can't browse the internet quick enough 3. You think that your games and programs and OS are on memory(not your hard drive) 4. You think your hard drive is your whole pc 5  When asked what OS you are running, you say....ehhhhh, Pentium II? 6. The concept of burning CD's is a novel idea 7. The sole purpose of the internet is to check email and chat, oh and download MP3's from Napster(soooo, 20th century) 8. You install programs on the root of drive C: (ex. c:\ instead of c:\program files 9.  You have tons of files and text files cluttering your desktop instead of placing them in My Documents or on a separate folder.  10. One of my faves - You have 15 programs set to start up when Windows starts and wonder why your pc is slow...hmmmmmmmm  --------------------------------------  Actual conversations held between Indian customer and the command center  India: "My job isn't running on the system, please help"  Command Center: "The system is in process of being shutdown then IPL'd (process by which we shut down the system then start it back up)for scheduled weekend activity.  India: "But my job is not running"  Command Center:  "The mainframe is down, no jobs can run"  India: "How do I get my job to run then?"    Command Center:  "When the system is back up, we will contact you.  You're job will then run"  India: "Ok, but this is urgent"  Command Center: "There is a 2 hour outage for this activity, please wait until it is complete"  India: "Ok, please hurry, this is urgent"  Command Center: "Bye"  ------------------------------------------------------  As stated in a past blog, users are the most dangerous part of a computer system.
