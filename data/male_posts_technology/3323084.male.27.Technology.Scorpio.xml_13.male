Curious, I began searching and didn't find much of interest, but I did find a forum about it. The forum rightly named  urlLink Linux on iPod  had some surprising information about the state of the project and some screenshots of the iPod with an experimental Linux kernel made for the iPod.  It's said that the Linux version has more functionality than the original Mac version of firmware.  It looks like the Linux community has found yet another device to put Linux on.  I've already been wanting to put Linux on an Xbox ever since I saw it done on  urlLink Adam Cecchetti web site.  Now I want an iPod to try out Linux on one of those.  Until next time...
