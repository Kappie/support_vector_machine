These swift boat vets have been debunked for what they are, a GOP funded partisan group led by former Nixon political hack John O'Neill.  urlLink http://mediamatters.org/items/200405040004  There are also charges that the group was illegally funded by Tom Delay's campaign. There is an active ethic complaint in the house but we'll have to depend on the State of Texas to handle it because congress isn't likely to investigate Delay while the GOP hold majority. Sad  urlLink http://www.duckstrap.com/swiftboatveteransfortruth_debunked.php   When I was in the first Gulf War some guys got more medals than me and some got less. There was an element of jealously, or maybe it was just natural competition who knows, around all of it when it all came out after the war, not much but it was there then. The bottom line is the guys on the boat with him, all of them, the Green Beret whose life he saved have all come out and attested to his bravery under fire and his fitness for Command. None of the "swiftboaters" in the book served on his boat. Its was just jealous superiors who became so after his antiwar stance and the fact he turned out to be so successful as a Liberal Politician. His did his duty before and after the war. Additionally, what about all those Generals and Admirals, most of whom served under Bush, that are behind Kerry, that stood up for him at the Convention last week. You forgot to mention them.  Just for fun lets compare his military career against dumbya's.  urlLink http://www.motherjones.com/news/update/2004/02/02_400.html   ..and here's an article the sets the record straight on Kerry's Defense votes. He in many cases was voting with the GOP who were trying to save the first George's presidency by capitalizing on the "Peace Dividend". I particularly like the Cheney quote from when he was SecDef .."You've directed me to buy more M-1s, F-14s, and F-16sall great systems  but we have enough of them." The Dems should be hammering these guys with this on Cheney being soft on defense but they are doing a good job of keeping their head above the fray.   urlLink http://slate.msn.com/id/2096127   For the rest of you I know you guys live in Georgia and its pretty much out of play, but I just moved to New Hampshire , which is very much in play, in fact Kerry leads by ~10 point, and I must say the atmosphere is electric. We have a scandal ridden GOP Governor who is going to be booted and there are organized groups of Republican supporting Kerry because they feel they were lied to about fiscal restrain, the war, pretty much everything. These Republicans are true conservatives. They are not just puppets of their SBC masters as in the South. Up here people keep their religion to themselves and out of politics. I actually respect the Republicans up here.  Anyway, don't let Rethuglican punks try to talk you down with their BS about Kerry. Its all lies because that's all they have. If anyone needs any ammo I can provide plenty.  Cheers,  VOTE DAMN IT!
