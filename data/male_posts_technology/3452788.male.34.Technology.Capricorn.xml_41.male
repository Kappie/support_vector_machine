Yesterday at therapy C. helped me make several realizations:     I am angry all the time, but it is really just a proxy for feelings of hurt, sadness, mistrust, and loss.   I suffered many losses as a child -    by death, starting with my Grandpa, then several old people I liked, then finally Mom dying when I was 21;  the "loss" of my birth mom, whom I never knew but I wanted (and still want to this day) some sort of connection;  the "loss" of a father, any one, adopted or natural, to be there for me; and most significant,  the loss of childhood, where I never felt it was safe or allowable to just be 8, or 10, or 14, or 18, or 21, always feeling like I needed to be older than my years.   The injustice and sadness connected with all these losses is that the one person who should have died, who I wanted to die, never did.  The Old Bitch just kept on living, feeding off the anger and bitterness and meanness and hate inside her like a cold, unholy fire. Like an evil spirit, she came to haunt me even at Mom's funeral.  She never had to pay for making Mom and I so fucking miserable and scarred and messed up for the remainder of our lives.  I loved my (adopted) Mom very much, and I felt like I could protect her from the Old Bitch by directing the abuse toward me.  I don't think it worked, and it just made things worse.  From the time I was 8 or 9, I never felt it was OK to bother Mom with my problems because she had enough pain dealing with the abuse she received.  I learned very early that a child can put a vast amount of pain and hurt into the vault, but eventually it fills up.  I learned not to trust my emotions with anyone but myself.  When I wanted to make friends with people, I started oscillating wildly between (1) needing a friend, opening up too much too quickly, getting criticised or teased, leading to mistrust; or (2) self-isolation based on mistrust, causing a loneliness and a need for emotional relationships, then back to (1).  This resulted in many awkward and painful times trying to socially interact with others, which continues to this day.  The abuse given to me has poisoned every relationship I have, causing me to act in anti-social ways in an attempt to protect myself and keep true emotions outside the defenses.  I still have the capacity to be a loving, understanding, caring person.  I need to choose to behave in that way rather than behaving as the inner Old Bitch would have me behave.  I want to find my birth mother before it is too late.  Lost opportunities suck, and none of us are getting any younger.  If I do not try to contact her and then she dies before I meet her, that loss will be very painful.   I might be able to have a sliver of hope that I can change things, that I can let MY self come through instead of being ruled by the Old Bitch.
