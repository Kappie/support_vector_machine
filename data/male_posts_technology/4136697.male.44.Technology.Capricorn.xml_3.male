Some suggest its narcissistic having a blog.  Of course - its a narcissitic self-indulgence, what isn't?  Everyone is looking out for their own asses in some way, shape or form.  Even doing what is "right" at great personal cost, is ultimately selfish, in that its what   you   think   you   should do.  One could argue that a parent makes great personal sacrifices for their children, but isn't it really doing what you feel you must do, whether you want to do it or not? Now that I've justified my narcissitic self-indulgence to my own satisfaction (and that's all that matters to me) - here ya go! Ah, the weekend....  Friday night we rehearsed at G's place and came up with a name for our duo.  How does, "Sound Check" sound?  Its not easy coming up with a name that is suitable.  Its fun brain storming for names, but they've gotta work to.  My favourites were, "The Viagra Boys" and "Hack-Job", but I realized that they might not work in some situations.  I'm feeling pretty good about the music (Classic Hits stuff) and I think we'll do okay on the 20th.  G is pretty experienced, as I am, so its pretty well a cakewalk if I can remember the arrangements! Saturday, I worked on the kitchen reno and made pretty good progress.  I'm really sick of the mess the house is in and I can't wait to finish this.  Its only been 2 weeks, but its pretty hard to live in a construction site.  As I get older and more crochetty, I find my tolerance for disorder and chaos in my personal environment less palatable.  I can see myself at 80, if I live that long - I'll be the nastiest old bastard you've ever met! Saturday night we went to N's place for dinner and he showed me how to cook his wonderful Indian cuisine.  It was fun to learn how to prepare the delicious dishes.  N is a very patient and classy individual, so he makes the process of learning almost as fun as eating the results!  We also enjoyed his excellent piano playing.  His daughter L was home and she babysat A and A and also played the piano beautifully for us.  I've always been a big fan of L's and it was nice that she stayed home and visited with us.  They just got back from 2 weeks in England and had a great time.  N showed us his excellent photos - truly a man of many talents! Sunday, I went to the boat and did some work on it (installing storage racks, etc...)  S and C came to visit.  They just bought a boat to, although its a fair bit smaller (18 feet).  They were impressed with the marina and they're considering putting their boat in there, as its easier than trailering it all the time.  I think they would have enjoyed going out for a cruise, but the weather didn't look promising, so I elected not to go out.  I'm very safety concious on the boat and I'm not about to take chances with anyone's life or my beautiful boat.  I did however move the boat in the marina and handled it pretty well, I must say!  I'm still learning how to handle it and I've got a lot to learn.  Its really like learning to drive all over again - except that a boat is succeptible to wind, current and doesn't have brakes - imagine trying to park your car in a busy parking lot under those conditions - not to easy, is it? I discovered a small leak in one of the heater hoses, when I was doing my inspection of the engine.  I pissed me off, because I had told the boat mechanics to replace everything that may be in the least problematic, as I didn't want problems during the brief boating season.  I had noticed that the hoses looked old and pointed it out to them, but they reassured me that hoses were find and didn't need replacement - now one is leaking.  I'm going to replace all of them - I believe in preventative maintenance, particularly when I can be far from land in the boat and far from help if it develops problems.  Its no big deal doing the work, but it bugged me that I tried to prevent just such a problem and now I have to deal with this.  The lesson here is to trust my own judgement and not listen to the "experts". Today we're having the dishwasher and plumbing done in the kitchen.  This will help us get back to normal, as we've been doing the dishes in the bathroom sink - what a pain!  Hopefully, after today, we can put things back together in the kitchen.  The only outstanding items at this point are the flooring, backsplash and some painting.   The flooring contractor is to come tonight and take his measurements, and I'm hoping the flooring can be installed in the next couple of weeks.  We're getting ceramic flooring and I've designed a pattern of white and blue tiles which will compliment the rest of the pieces.  I'm looking forward to seeing the outcome Well, that's it for now.  I need to get to work, as its piling up as I indulge in my narcissitic fantasy one more time! Feel free to comment on what an interesting life I lead and what a swell guy I must be.   Any negative comments about what a narcissitic asshole I am can be direct to G.W. Bush - I'm sure they would suit him.
