But one thing he hasn't sold much of is satellite radio, a twist on an old medium that arrived late last year. "If I've moved 10 of them since the start of the year, that's a lot," he says. 'I think this might be another case of where expectations exceed demand.'"

 I have XM Radio and I love it. I don't listen to FM or AM radio at all anymore. To me it's "cable in your car". If you are in your car for any extended period of time, or your a music or news junkie like me, this is an incredible service that once you have it you'll never want to go back to limited FM/AM.
