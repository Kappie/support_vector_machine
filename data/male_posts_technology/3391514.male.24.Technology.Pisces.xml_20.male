As per usual, I'm lagging behind, and I only caught up with the end of  Dawsons Creek .  Although the final season strayed away from the place and concentrated more on the characters exploits around Boston.  I think.  The scriptwriters did some  interesting  things with the last two episodes... if you're a fan, you simply need to watch it.  Hell, if you're a fan, you've already watched it, and I'm rabbiting on for nothing.  So...  Rifts .  About 90% of the roleplayers I know hate it.  And why?  The rules.  They bleat on about the rules.  In my opinion, so long as the rules encompass more than combat (i.e. not  d20 ) and are at least readable and not trying to take the piss (i.e not  HoL ) then there shouldn't be any major problems.  Its the background that makes the difference.  The rules problems are of course multitudinous:  (1) Attributes are meaningless unless higher than 16 (2) The character and race selection is horribly spread out and by and large, massively duplicated (e.g. Headhunter, Headhunter Techno-Warrior, Headhunter Techno-Hound, Headhunter Assassin are all basically the same type of class - a fighter with bionic parts) (3) the books suffer from incredible power creep (in laymans terms, one book introduces one item, the next introduces something similar but more powerful, and so on) (4) Magic and Psionic powers are quite poor (5) The rules in general don't make a lot of sense and contradict themselves (6) Everything is Americanised (e.g. in America, the language is called "American" instead of English)  And thats just a small sampling!  However, the background is rich and varied, and there is plenty of scope for interesting campaigns.  What really annoys me is that, despite the fact that most of the above problems can be fixed by the GM, roleplayers I know still whine on about it.  Bastards.
