We're accepting preorders starting Nov 7th (3 days away AACK).  Justin, our lead dev and CEO,  has asked me to take over the administrative duties for the project, since he's going to be extremely busy at work for the next 3 weeks.  Poor guy is doing 16 hour days  7 days a week for awhile  - they're trying  to get everything spic and span for some large IEEE convention, so that they can assure themselves funding in the future.  So I'm gonna be HELLA busy over the next three weeks. School seems to be going OK, day job is going well, I got a nice raise that I'm finally getting to see now - fricking once/month paychecks ;).  Gonna be pretty busy with the day job followed by the game dev. - School program just got finished so now I freed up a bit more time.  Ordered a 20" trinitron refurb, what I got wasn't a trinitron, and was messed up - colors bled on the edges, text was  fuzzy in the top left corner, gaving me a headache, so I'm RMAing it and trying again.  Chris Berry up here at work ordered similarly, and got a nice monitor apparently so I don't feel too bad about it.  the 21" is nice even with the slightly off display, I love having 3 coding windows up at once, and it makes the virtual desktops in linux that much cooler ;).  Apparently Anil has a friend who'd like to buy my old 17" on the cheap, and I'm more than happy to sell it once I get a decent monitor from surpluscomputers.  Speaking of Anil - just a little tip for all the foreign people reading this... Don't take pictures of airplanes in the US.  or near a US armory.  Anil is an amateur photographer (who does great work BTW) and was snapping some shots of some woods around here, not knowing our Armory was behind the trees.  Then he caught a picture of a plane taking off too.  Someone drove by and saw a dark-skinned man taking photographs and called the cops.  This was about a month and a half ago.  last week on Friday his wife was interrogated by the FBI and then yesterday the FBI came back again to interrogate him.  They asked him a lot of questions, they took a CD of the pictures he'd taken, and amazingly enough - the asked him if he was a Muslim.  Seems like I remember questioning someone on the basis of religion to be illegal, but maybe it's OK if you're asking them if they're a muslim, since that automatically makes them evil :|.  Anil is Hindi anyways, so he didn't give two craps.  From what I've noticed he doesn't seem to care for the Muslim's a whole lot anyways ;).  In India the 3 main religions are Hindi, Islam, and Christianity, and apparently they don't mix real well at times.  Anyways, I really wanted to put up something, felt kinda like I was letting the blog slide too long.  So now I've posted for the few of you who may one day read this in a fit of boredom.  Enjoy.  Phil.
