  This sounds like a great idea to get your morning coffee quick and easy every day. It'll cost you 25 cents per coffee for the service. The only question I have is how do they know it's you when you pick up your coffee? What keeps people form form just grabbing some else's coffee. I am sure they have it figured out, I am just curious. They are currently test marketing in Seattle and Denver.
