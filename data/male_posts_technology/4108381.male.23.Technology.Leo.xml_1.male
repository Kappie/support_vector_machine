I hung out with people til midnight last night, I'm starting to feel like I might actually be getting some friends.  I'm at this scary time in my life where all I want is positive human contact and I get none.  Not a fun time to be alive.  Thinking about Teri is the bain of my existence.  Fenix TX said "being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up" in their song Pheobe Cates.  I know fully understand what they mean.  I grew up so much after meeting Teri.  My whole outlook changed from self gratification to pleasing her and her alone, that really sucked.  It started at the very begining.  She had to have seen the signs of it in the first month.  She could have put a stop to it but instead she encouraged it.  Now she holds it against me for all it's worth.  I want to be irresponsible again.  I'm going to get some work done that in all honesty is pretty dumb.  I'm getting it done because I miss the pain and frustration of healing.  My emotional healing has stopped and I need to get going again.  A jump start never hurts, well this type might.  I just wish I could change my appearance but my job requires a vanilla style.  It sucks.  This is enough of a rant.  I'm running late for work but there are things I need off my chest so here they are. Sorry if I spelled Indiana style.
