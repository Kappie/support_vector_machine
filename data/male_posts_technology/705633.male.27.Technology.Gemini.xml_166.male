Especially by that old Thai lady he snogged in Zebra (love you long time)  Tonight we are heading Howard "Jurassic" Davis Park, and plans are afoot for the weekend - even though myself and poor Dougal will probably be working. However, the overtime cash will come in very handy for New Years eve - Toaster Files crew live and direct from Times Square, baby!  If you're not doing anything this Friday night - get your ass down to see the Dapper Crew at the Q Bar. It's r, hip-hop, raggae etc and a fantastic night. I maybe playing again as well, if you're lucky. :)  Here's some pictures from the last night we played..                           urlLink Watch the world's population change before your eyes...
