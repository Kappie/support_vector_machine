 Welp, that about wraps it up for the DNC.  My back is killing me from having sat for 6 hours waiting to see  a bunch of ballons  John Kerry. 
 But I thought the speech was solid.  Strategically sound if not inspirational - "health care is a right," "screw the Saudis," "we're taking back the money from the rich" ... these are all messages I can get behind.  I  urlLink talked about  it some with Noah and I assure you that when I said President Douche instead of President Bush, it was an honest slip.
