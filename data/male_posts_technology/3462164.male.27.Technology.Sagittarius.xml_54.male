This is, to say the least, a very cheap attempt to take the moral high road against the west. Islam-o-fascists regard any tactic that forwards their religion’s power as “good”, yes, even lying. This is straight out of the Palestinian/Soviet book and we have seen it time and time again throughout the history of the last century. I doubt it will be more than a few months now before Iran has nuclear weapons and is threatening to use them on Israel and us.
