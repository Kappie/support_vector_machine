Later this summer, the software giant is debuting new software, code-named Janus, that lets subscribers listen to rented music on portable players that use its Windows Media software. While Jobs and many others have doubted that the record labels would ever support this approach, Gorog says Roxio has signed deals with the five big labels. Janus "has the potential of cannibalizing download sales," says a top record exec. Jobs needs to swallow his pride and get in the subscription game so his old nemesis doesn't gain any advantage -- again." 

 I personally think subscriptions are the way to go. I have been an iTunes/iPod user for several months now, and I have learned I would rather "download at will", rather than to debate with myself on every single song I like. It's really quite frustrating, having to consicously say to myself "do a like this enough to buy it, or should I just listen to it on Napster for free?" When "Janis" comes out, I will be all over it!
