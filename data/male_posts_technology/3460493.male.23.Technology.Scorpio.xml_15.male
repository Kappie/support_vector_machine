As far as I was concerned, I already graduated and had a stable job in the field I majored in, so the graduation would be just a small bonus. But lately people around me noticed that I wasn't making the graduation thing a biggie. They were actually more excited as I was! But my friends actually made me realize how special this event is, especially thinking it'll be the last graduation I'll be part of, seeing that I don't want to spend the time, money or energy to pursue a Masters Degree.  This is a one in a lifetime opportunity. This is like finishing high school, or getting married, which hopefully will be a once-in-a-lifetime event also! It'll only happen once in your life, which makes it that much special. Besidea, after five and a half years of sweat, blood and tears (well, no blood, but there were times I almost burst into tears!) I think I deserve the finishing touch to my formal education. This will finally make official that I'm a college graduate and I'm a Computer Science major, which is probably the geekiest thing ever, but it rocks in my mind!  Today will truly be a day of celebration, as I finally end the chapter about my college career. I'm not too sad, like a lot of my fellow raduates are, because the end of the partying and fun is ending. I didn't do much of that, but in any case I look at it as a new chapter. A new chapter that has already begun in my life. And believe it or not, I'm having more fun now than when I was in college. Believe me, it isn't too shabby receiving a nice paycheck every week, much better than spending all your money on tuition, transportation and food!  I'll have tons of picture, since I leave my house going to the graduation, during the graduation and afterwards. So that I will definitely post in the moblog tomorrow or in the weekend. There's finally going to be more pictures! In any case, have a rockin' day, just like I'll have! To anyone who graduates / has graduated, my congratulations and well wishes to you! And to those who are still struggling through the college years, keep it up, 'cause in the end it'll be all worth it!
