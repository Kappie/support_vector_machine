Let me introduce myself first:   I am a year 2000 computer science graduate of  urlLink FAST Institute of Computer Science, Karachi.  I was a topper and share a 3.78 GPA with two other batch mates (Hamid Shahid and Imran Saeed). After graduation, I joined  urlLink Cressoft Karachi  (one of the most prestigious software houses of Pakistan). I managed to clear SCJP exam by 91% and was then selected for IBM WebSphere Application Server and IBM Commerce Suite training from IBM Karachi. I had to conduct the same training when I joined back the company after 7 days.   Later in Nov 2001, I joined  urlLink Avanza Solutions  where I was hired to write a middleware and transaction processing engine specialized for the banking domain. Upon completion of the project I was given a 50% increment in pay as well as a promotion. I worked for the next one and a half year on various projects and almost always set examples for others to follow.  I now have a three years of work experience and these days I am trying to move abroad for higher education.  What I have written only describes the events; I'll cover the details, motives behind the decisions and the after affects in some later posts. The posts that follow this one are targetted at people like me, i.e., graduates of computer science who want to create some difference by their knowledge and spirit to work. I am outlining a path for others based on my experience.  If you are a believer, you will surely benefit from these readings .   The first series of the posts will be related to my experience of moving abroad...
