Yeah to an extent,  Last night post my dinner rushed to visit this guy who was sick only to know he had been to his hometown and he was down due to flu , felt like God can't I take care of him at my place if niot for him atleast for his dad.  Felt bad coz for even someone whom I've known for ages, I'm not of any use or he thinks I'm not of any use.  O.K, I'll try my level best to prove I'm still what I was and I'll be  , rest God will take care.  Well now the happy part, completed the novel "No Comebacks" at last, now I'm resolved to read atleast few pages before I go to sleep.  I've a Dream, I have dream.  I've been living with that, I'll make it happen, this is my mantra, for those who want to know what it is , pls check my previous block.  Max is too good to spell that.
