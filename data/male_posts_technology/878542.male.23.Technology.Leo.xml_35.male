Specifically I plan to port CopyCat to Python, if possible, as I think Python is both easier to play with, and it's the only language I could concievably do so without hurting my brain. I'm also emailing Douglas Lenat to ask about Eurisko. If there is a reason he doesn't want Eurisko available, that's fine, but if he'd release a version of it, hackers across the world would have a beautiful new concept to play with. It would also make a fine project to port to Python.   I have to admit, this plan is in the very early stages, and may change substantially. But It seems a worthwhile and useful endeavor to add to my list of activities.  . . Which, to be vain, include...:  :Writing a short film script  :Producing and Directing said script  :Organizing a Company  :Applying for licenses and taxy things for said company  :Working towards a new fitness goal(an hour a day, optimum  :Programmatic Study(application, languages)  :Math Study  :Girlfriend Time(very important)  :Money Time(money is unpleasant and unhelpful, down with capitalism)  :Art Time(must learn to draw better)  :Food Time(but enjoyable)  :Downtime(this largely consists of books and games to keep my head from exploding)   And blogging, to organize and analyze my life. :-)
