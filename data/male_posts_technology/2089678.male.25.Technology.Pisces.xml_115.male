This will include objects for manipulating sequences, file parsers, CORBA interoperability, DAS, access to ACeDB, dynamic programming, and simple statistical routines to name just a few things.  The BioJava library is useful for automating those daily and mundane bioinformatics tasks. As the library matures, the BioJava libraries will provide a foundation upon which both free software and commercial packages can be developed.
