This will be my first project party in over 14 months of infy life... we don't have any project parties in my department (SETLabs) as we don't do projects in its literal sense and so there is no budgetary allocation for such parties...   The current project I'm supporting will finally be giving me a taste of it... Kavitha has gone for atleast 3 parties in 9 months at infy and ram went for a party in his very first week... so this becomes very significant for me...!!
