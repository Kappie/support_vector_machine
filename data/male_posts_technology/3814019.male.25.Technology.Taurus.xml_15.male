Like a forest fire it is spreading indiscriminately across the European union, destroying all in its path and sadly I fear it is too late. Damage limitation is the only way from here on in. And what is this disease, this plague I speak of? "Dragostea Din Tei' by Ozone.  Now, I admit at first I was duped into thinking it was a funny song. I naively assumed that there was no way on this earth someone would produce such a stupid song, so clearly it had to be a parody, a cunning mockery of boybands, with tongue firmly lodged in cheek. Oh how could I have been so stupid!?! I implore anyone reading this, download Kazaa then download this song. Only when your nostrils fill with the fetid stench of satans armpits will you truly know hell. Your music collection is the ying, this travesty of noise is the yang.   Our continent is notorious for producing these bubbles of evil that surface randomly from the devils own satanic bath, but normally we have proven ways to deal with them. Once a year we round them all up for public trial to be tortured in front of millions until their very will to live is torn from their souls, we call this process the eurovison song contest.
