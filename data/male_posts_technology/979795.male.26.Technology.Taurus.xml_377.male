We only did shihonage, iriminage and kotegaeshi. Sensei asked for volunteers for the exhibition at Expo this coming Sat and Sun. I'm not sure I'll be able to attend Sat because of training at Ayer Raja CC. But I may go for it if Sensei really need people there. See how lor, but seriously I really want to go for my training at ARCC.  Yay parents going China end of this month for about 10 days. I think for that week or so, I'll plan to go down to BB East on Mon. Haven't exactly attended Alvin's classes for ages liao.
