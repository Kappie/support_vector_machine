The DVD's title is "Man of Honour", a rather old movie.  I been looking it EVERYWHERE!  All the major stores that sells DVD around Taipei Train Station, around SOGO/統領, in 士林夜市, 基隆夜市, and all the video stores in my hometown, 樹林.  Alas, my search was in vain.  Did I forgot to mention the reason?  It was nothing serious, just doing a favour for someone who is/was very important to me...  Luck always appears at the most unexpected moment.  Today I was circling around 內湖... (for some not so bright reason)...  And around noon, I was hungry for I haven't been eating for 16 hours already (on diet).  So I decided to go to this spaghetti place I've been to once before.  But unfortunately, it was not open...  Since I'm still on diet, I don't want to eat anything big, so I changed my mind and decided to go to 7-11 and grab some light-lunchbox.  Anyone who lives in Taiwan shall be as least familiar with the process.  You grab a lunch box off the shelf, pay at the counter and wait for the cashier to microwave your lunch box.  Nothing special.  So I was waiting for the lunch box to be microwaved and so I was looking around, browsing the store. There I noticed a small busket beside the counter with lots of DVDs on sale.  "Well...... what the hell...", I thought.  And so I was reviewed each DVD's title, because the busket was messy and unorganized, it's easy to look over any DVD.  And ... I couldn't believe my eyes when I have found it.  "It's a miracle!!!", I almost shouted out.  Well, I did shouted out inside my heart. ^_^  But there are cashiers and other customers around me, so I have to act cool.  Realized that I didn't have enough money with me, I ran out to my scooter (forgot my lunchbox) and rode to the closest ATM I can find.  When I was back to the 7-11, the cashier looked at me with two query eyes.  Well, I was too happy at that moment so I explained to her how long I've been seraching for this DVD...  And FINALLY...  GOT IT!!  MAN OF HONOUR, 入手! ^_^
