Let’s face it Kerry has been setting himself up for a long time and this situation is a prime example of how Liberals persist in believing they can have things both ways. This man is a hero only in his own mind and the minds of some seriously diluted people. According to his own words Kerry is simultaneously: a war criminal and a war hero. He served in and protested against the war a trend we see continued throughout his career. This alone, for me, calls into question his ability to lead Americans. Waffles are for breakfast not politics, and John Kerry is a consummate waffler.  urlLink After seeing this commercial however I am quite certain this man is a walking disaster in addition to a waffler.  Two of his three Purple Hearts were received due to Kerry injuring himself through stupidity. It is truly hard not to laugh out laud just explaining that to people. If this is the best the Liberals can nominate then they are worst off then one might first believe.
