 In a perfect world web standards are a great idea, however other than personal blogs, I don't know of any major sites that uses standards-based XHTML. Until someone within your organization makes it a "business" decision to incorporate web standards, then I don't think standards will really ever catch onto mainstream businesses. I think it's up to web developers to express in dollars to management what web standards mean, and not just their technical aspects. Of course that is much easier said than done.
