So I apologise for any offence caused, as it was not intended. I just happen to feel very strongly about the way things are going at the moment.   Dad  Dad wrote two letters to the NZ Herald today. Keep an eye on the papers, because they are real good letters. Here's hoping that one gets in.   Camp  I booked Tawharanui for the C.I.A camp in 2004 today. Looking forward to that! Memories man.    Fountain Pen  I have purchased myself a reasonably cheap fountain pen. Oh the joys of writing! It's amazing. I actually go to write hand writen letters, and notes now instead of using the computer. I'm almost tempted to chuck the blog, and start a written journal!   Reading  At the moment I am reading:- Jeremiah, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, Stupid White Men, East of Eden, and "The Christian Ministry". Having trouble getting through it all though. I think I need to concentrate on one.   The Assasination of Common Sense File  I have just finished reading "Standing Tall", which I have found quite inspiring. Steve Farrar (the dude that wrote it), has a file which he calls "The Assasination of Common Sense File". This will be a new feature of my blog. My first entry into it is  urlLink this.  Well that is the last time I give to these IHC, and CCS! Is that or is that not scary?! It is a very silly idea.
