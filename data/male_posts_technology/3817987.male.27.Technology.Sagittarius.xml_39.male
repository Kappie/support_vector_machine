Robyn will also be playing at  urlLink Bumbershoot  this year on Saturday! On Sunday, there is an alternative comics showcase with Harvey Pekar, Gilbert Hernandez, Jessica Abel and Peter Bagge.  And on Monday there are two acts I thought I would never see in my life:  Nick Lowe and the Pixies!!!!  Jesus this should be cool!  I haven't gone to three days of Bumbershoot in a long long time.
