I'd like to be able to promise you humor, tears, or thought-provoking insight, but unfortunately I'm an amateur so I can't guarantee quality.  With that said, we'll get right to this week's topic...
 
  Friends 
 
 Relationships are indescribably complex, and they're built on emotions so of course they're going to be difficult.  But, as everyone knows they can be immensely satisfying (emphasis on "can").  
 
 The question I've been working over for the past month or so is how to treat friends and what to expect from them.  I think I have a lot of friends, or at least I used to.  Attending two colleges and serving as the social liaison for several university organizations presented me with a lot of opportunities to be both a coordinator and a participant in numerous parties, bar nights and excursions.   
 
 Unfortunately, as all graduates discover, no sooner than your student ID expires, you find emails and phone messages start getting replied to with a monthly lag, if at all.  Are these people still your friends?  Maybe they're just too busy settling, or maybe work tires them out and they can't stand to use a computer at night. Or maybe you're just not that important to them anymore.  No matter how much you try to rationalize things, you can't argue the fact that you're just not physically a part of their lives anymore.  You're probably miles and timezones apart, and most of what they see is a job and new people.
 
 So feeling estranged in your new surroundings, you may try to make relations in your new surroundings.  Unfortunately, 99% of the people around you have been there for some time, so they probably already have a full cache of bar buddies, shopping pals and lovers.  If you work in a competitive industry, people of your age and class are probably battling fatigue from overwork as well, so they're even less inclined to go out and meet new folks.  
 
 Despite this, imagine you get lucky.  There's one or two people you find in a chat room or a special interest group.  Great!  You're no longer confined to your own moping for all non-working hours.  However, good relationships, like wine, take a while and can't be pestered into quicker results.  So even though you want to go out every weekend and bounce humorous banter back and forth in volleys of email, you'd best not smother your new friend lest you become a nuisance and better avoided.  In addition, people in your new town don't know you, so any kind of support you could get is going to be topical at best (if you're lucky enough not to scare people away in the process).
 
 So what good _are_ friends anyway?  The old ones you laughed, bled and cried with now ignore you, and the new folks you meet have packed schedules and no foundation with you.  Being out there isn't easy, and it'll never be the way you've grown so used to.  What this means you have two choices: give up and stay a recluse, or keep on plugging and wait it out.  It'll take longer this time around because most people are settled and comfortable with their routine.  But if you stick it out and develop a strategy, you may just find what your heart is crying for so much.  I recommend the scattershot/blitzkrieg approach by signing up to a bunch of personals, carpet-bombing chat rooms, and scouring weeklies for special interest clubs, events and mixers.  This is may also be bolstered by frequent phone calls to mom.
 
 So, the closest thing to a conclusion I've come to is that it takes time and effort, probably more than one is used to.  But, life is long, you are young, and there's a lot of personal discovery to be down in the meantime.  Perhaps a self-affirming ballad will help, so I'll leave you with the words of Paul Simon.  Take care, and stick it out!
 
  A winter's day
 In a deep and dark December
 I am alone
 Gazing from my window to the streets below
 On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
 I am a rock I am an island
 
 I've built walls
 A fortress deep and mighty
 That none may penetrate
 I have no need of friendship
 Friendship causes pain
 It's laughter and it's loving I disdain
 I am a rock I am an island
 
 Don't talk of love
 But I've heard the words before
 It's sleeping in my memory
 I won't disturb the slumber of feelings
 that have died
 If I never loved I never would have cried
 I am a rock I am an island
 
 I have my books
 and my poetry to protect me
 I am shielded in my armor
 Hiding in my room
 safe within my womb
 I touch no one
 and no one touches me
 I am a rock I am an island
 
 And a rock feels no pain
 And an island never cries
