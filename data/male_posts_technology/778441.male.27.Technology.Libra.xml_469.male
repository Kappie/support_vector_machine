And he did not disappoint this time! He was ruled out of the upcoming match against Bangladesh, in the ongoing Asia Cup tournament, with  urlLink an injury to his quadriceps muscle . And that too... right at the start of the cricket season!  Its not funny!! I wonder when players will stop faking their fitness to gain an entry into the national team. I thought that this was a phenomenon of the past with the new crop of players knowing about the hazards of faking injuries!  And it does raise serious doubts about the abilities of the team doctor and physio in ascertaining the fitness of the players and ,indeed, helping them maintain their fitness levels.
