Stay the course.  We have abandoned ship on TGSO.  Yesterday we pooled the cigarettes we had left for the remaining days of the program, something like 15, and smoked them all.  Today in place of cigarettes I have had three bagels and a bike ride through college park to my bank.  Feeling ok.  A little spacey really with is better then the full tilt anger I experienced this morning while working on the database (Angered at my Disappointment, might I point out.)  Curse you Sir Walter Raleigh you were such a stupid Git.
