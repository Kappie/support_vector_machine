The girl wasn't there, but I got a nice chicken parmisan anyway -  free breadsticks! sweet!     2:10 - I'm at Academy Sports getting new toys. $150 well spent. Whoop!    3:00 - I'm at the Rec for some climbing fun. It's a good day, I meet up with another David for some bouldering and top rope action. I'm feeling good, I'm moving well, not enough power yet, but I'm rusty and I'm working on that.    5:00 - I'm in the pool? Doing laps? Ok, so, I did plan to do laps after I climbed, but it's been about two years since my pool injury, so it's odd. But great! I'm swimming in the outdoor pool, Sun on my back, feeling the cool water flow over my body. Breath, stroke, kick, breath, stroke, kick. It's amazing.    6:00 - I'm in the locker room, and I check my messages. It's Aaron. I bet he wants ... yep ... he wants to go climbing. Well, why not, I've got a day pass! I stroll back out to the wall, and he and Leann are there. Aaron moves like the 6' 6" 220 lbs of struggling mass up the wall that he is, but the guy is tenacious - props. Leann moves like the 5' 6' 120 lbs that she is, like a cat, methodical, balanced, and smooth. And we climb till close. And it's awesome.    10:00 - We are dog tired from climbing for four hours.  I've been at the Rec since 3:00.  So, let's go to IHOP!    10:30 - The biggest omlete I've ever seen is lying before me. I devour it. Happily. Mmmm. We talk about weight-training, food, school, work, horror stories about breakups - just good times. The fact that I'm not in school and working fulltime doesn't phase these people one bit. I really appreciate that. Both of them are about my age, graduating in a couple semesters, moved around, have loans, jobs, and all that. And I love it. What a great day!    11:45 - I'm home. I finally check my messages. Looks like grampa is doing ok now.  Still kind of weak though.   Final tally? 65 minutes of bad against 460 minutes of good. Day's a winner. Collect your prizes at the door.    I'm gonna sleep sooooooooooooooooooooooooo well tonight.
