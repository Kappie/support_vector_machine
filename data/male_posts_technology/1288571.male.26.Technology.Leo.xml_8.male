You honestly won't regret it.  Lack of updates recently because I also bought the new Gameboy Advance SP on friday and have been busy playing with that.  Well ok, not all weekend.  Saturday I managed to make it out to the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto.  Cool shit there. I took my Canon ZR40 video camera and was filming a mummy in the Egyptian section. Yeah well a guy who worked there comes up to me and says "It's ok to take pictures but just don't use a flash."  I looked at him and looked down at the video camera I was holding, with the LCD flipped out to the side, and said "Does this look like a camera to you?" Maybe I didn't have to call him on his stupidity and be an ass about it, but I did it anyway, so screw him.
