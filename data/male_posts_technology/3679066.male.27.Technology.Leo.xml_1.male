Trolls are very welcome here. Bring it on Knucklehead bandwagon jumpers so we can enjoy the inevitable demise of the Vancouver Canucks together. As the number of the few quality members of this delinquent hockey club dwindle due to self chosen exportation and crimianl acts, I find it hard to contain my excitement for a year that will see the Canucks return to sub mediocrity at best. See you all in October.
