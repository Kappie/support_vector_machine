In French we have a Culture Quiz (pretty super easy), and in math we are having another party with stockings full of candy and pop!!! One drawback - we have a big test in AMerican HISTory (I HOPE I GET A GOOD GRADE! ;-) It is right away in the morning so I'll get it over with soon and I hear kids say that it isn't too hard, but I have a 3-page review sheet + more questions. OH - AND in Study Hall with Ms. Bergren we are probably also going to watch Finding Nemo again just like on Tuesday! That'll be cool! Emi is coming today to go out for dinner and hang out! That's COOL. Well I got up early this morning, so I have to go study for the test, once that is over, it's time to PARTY!!!! :-) :-D 8-) 8-D
