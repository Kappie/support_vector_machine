Make sure you check out StrongBad's emails.  urlLink http://www.milmillington.com/  : Another hilarious site, this time in short anecdote form.  I just love the way Mil writes.  If anyone is trying to think of a good gift for me, get me one of Mil Millington's books.  urlLink http://www.yetisports.org/  : If you're looking to kill some time, try playing a game from this site.  You'd be amazed at how much time can be killed at work by hitting little penguins.  urlLink http://www.straightdope.com/index.html  : If you have a question, they have the answer.  Here's a couple examples:  urlLink Why is there a "33" on Rolling Rock beer labels?  and  urlLink In a falling elevator, could you save yourself by jumping up at the last minute?   Well, that's it for now.  Enjoy.  - Jeff
