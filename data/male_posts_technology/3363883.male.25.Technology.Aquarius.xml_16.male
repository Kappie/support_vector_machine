Though, in truly Dany fashion, who goes site seeing in arguably the most famous university city in the world when you could go and watch the latest Harry potter movie?  Oh well.  She's her own self and I'm glad that she feels she can do exactly what the hell she wants.  Gotta love her for it.  Anyway.  I managed to make her run out of Harry and race back to abingdon so she could score a couple of free drinks at our company meeting.  We broke work early to go to one of the local hotels.  We were told that the company is doing well and that we need to continue to work hard.  Oh and that IT could pull their thumb out.    [Quick Rant] It really gets on my tits being hassled in IT when I think we do a good job.  If everything goes smoothly, we're not appreciated.  People think we are doing an okay job because nothing is broken.  The truth is to the non-IT people out there.  If nothing is broken and everything is smooth as silk then IT are working their arses to the grind stone to make sure you don't notice they're doing a good job.  [sigh] Some people, especially management, don't seem to pick that up.  Oh well.  Live and learn.  Anyhoo.  We break at 5 and we know we've got about a solid hour of drinking before we get kicked out.  I thought I did a pretty good effort of managing to knock back 5 [imperial] pints and a baileys.  Don't know where the bailey's came from, someone just handed it to me.  I thought it was a sound effort.  Dany managed to make it at half five and fit in a couple of pints as well.  It was all good times.  I thought it was particularly humorous when I came across a couple of the line[not senior] managers having a bit of a gloss over my sister.  Due to us not looking anything like each other they didn't make the connection.  I went up and was talking to them, they asked who the new "hot bird" was.  I'm not a huge fan of either of these people and had great delight in slowly smiling, looking them in the eye and with a casual air quitely told them "That there is my sister and if you keep looking at her the way you are, I'm going to break you're f*cking legs."  My smile never dropped for an instant, their faces on the other hand, did.  You don't get many glorious moments like that in life.  So from the hotel we wandered down to our house [10 minute walk] and one of the ladies who was only just more sober than us managed to cook up a mexican feast of nachos, refried beans, fajitas and all the other stuff which is the same food but just folded differently.  I tell you.  If you've had five pints in an hour, chuck a couple more on top of that, a nice home cooked mexican goes a long way.  Kirsty if you're reading this, that was FAB!!  Paul R, my flat mate, decided to leave us early that evening [in fact right after the meal] to go into town.  Apparently there was a chance of him picking up [a lass or three]and he was OUT of there!!  Not the most super sociable of characters.  oh well.  So we kept drinking and watched some dvds that my sister brought with her. Class.  Saturday was a bit slow with us just milling about taking it easy.  At about 12 we decided it was time to wander off to Bath.  Bath has to be one of my most favourite cities in England.  This place has not changed in the last 200 years I swear.  It's picturesque and gorgeous.  If I were american I'm sure I would have used the term "Quaint" several times in quick succession.  As beautiful as it is, there's not a HUGE amount to do apart from walk around and say "My isn't this q****t and picturesque."  We shared a couple of nice cornish pasties and took in the local ambience.  I think the highlight was wandering into the jane Austen Museum [this is the city she grew up in] and listening to some lass wander in and ask why they didn't have a copy of "Little Women".  I thought the sweet girl behind the counter did a magnificent job of Saying "I'm afraid that Jane Austen didn't write Little Women and it is in fact an american book."  I think I would have given something a little more cutting.  That night was our big night on town.  Dany, myself, flatmates and co wandered into town [abingdon] quite late and went to Grapes.  Grapes is NOT one of my favourite places to go to on a night out.  I find it full of forty years olds trying to pick up some "meat" and the alcohol is severely overpriced to compensate for the late license it has.  Well, we wandered in and decided to get totally smashed.  I think one of the highlights was wandering in to the gents to find all the urinals packed.  I'm the first in the queue and am loudly encouraging everyone to squeeze out what they can as my back teeth were floating.  The guy behind me could wait though and with a "F*ck this" under his breath proceeded to go over and piss in the ONLY sink available.  NIiiiiice.  Oh yeah.  It's going to be a while 'til I go there again I think.  After being suitably inebriated we were off and I introduced Dany to the classic and obligatory Kebab.  I've had arguments with people here about how good English kebabs are.  Everyone agrees that they are disgusting and you wouldn't want one sober.  BUT the fact they are so gross makes them nice when you're drunk EVEN THOUGH you fully appreciate how bad they are even then.  It's a perverted logic and I find I get a headache when I think about it.  What can I say though?  I thought the kebab was so bad it was good.  That or the several pints in me thought the same thing.  Sunday itself was very quiet with everyone having massive hangovers.  The highlight was Paul H [other flat mate] cooking up a massive roast for us all as they took pity on Dany not having eaten properly for the last 7 weeks.  It was huge and had EVERYTHING you could want from chicken to roast potatoes to yorkshire pudding to stuffing to gravy so think you have to spoon it out.  YUMMY  I dropped Dany off that afternoon and went home to sleep off the fomer couple of days.  Happy days all around.  It was brilliant to see my sister.  It's obvious that we care so much for each other and I never doubted it for a second.  Sometimes I tend to get a little lonely up in england.  While I have great and wonderful friends here, they're not my family nor the people I grew up with.  Still, it just makes you appreciate everyone even more.
