Could it be that the "Mainstream Media" refuses to report the good news?  Could it be that they only want to report bad news, prior to the election?  I report...you decide !  Kevin   An Associated Press survey of 788 registered voters conducted Monday through Wednesday shows that while they may be gaining confidence in the economy and Bush's performance, 57 percent said the nation has lost jobs in the last six months. The Labor Department has reported just the opposite -- nearly 1.2 million jobs gained in half a year.
