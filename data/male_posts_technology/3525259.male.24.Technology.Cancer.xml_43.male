Youze a cool bloke, especially in the Godfather, the most massive gangsta flick evah.  Also happy birthday to bizorn. Hope you have a great freakin' weekend and have you some fun!  So I sometimes puff and decide to mix together the bombest CD i can come up with for the day. Here is one i did for this July 4th weekend.  01. Blind Melon - Pusher 02. Jack Johnson - Mud Football 03. Phish - Heavy Things 04. Pearl Jam - (beatles cover) Hide Your Love Away 05. track fucked up 06. Ben Folds Five - Underground 07. Incubus - Wish You Were Here 08. The Doors - Roadhouse Blues 09. Led Zeppelin - Dazed and Confused 10. AC/DC - If You Want Love You Got It 11. Beck - Loser 12. Jimi Hendrix - Along the Watchtower 13. Nirvana - Lake of Fire 14. Counting Crows - Murder of One 15. Blind Melon - Change (live) 16. Oasis - Live Forever 17. Pearl Jam - Better Man (live)  The problem with July 4th weekend is that no one ever plans anything to do. Then everyone scrambles to do something at the last minute and it is always semi lame. Hopefully my friend Coren can get his shit together and plan a bomb weekend getaway. Here is the email:   Hey all,      So, you haven't made plans for July 4? Good. If you have, change them. We're heading up to Helen, Ga -- with a trusty band of misfits hopefully -- for some fireworks, beer, lederhosen (remember Oktoberfest?!) and INNERTUBING (which will include all of the above) this weekend.       Helen is a crazy German hamlet in the Georgia mountains. It also hosts a beautiful stretch of the Chata "Rob's-mom's-a" hoochie River. For 3 bucks, you can float down the river, sip fine PBR-labeled beverages and toast this wonderful country of ours. There are also plenty of cool things to do up there regardless.       So, the caravan begins on Saturday and we'll come back at our leisure on Sunday. It shouldn't be too much of a trek. Write back and let me know if you want to go and invite your friends. I've never forgotten a trip to Helen.   Last time I was in Helen, Georgia I was a little pledge. They made all 23 of us drink tons of whiskey and then we all held hands in this long chain and had to skip down this huge hill in the middle of the night. Needless to say the 23 of us were rolling down drunk all the way to the bottom. Fun shit.     urlLink Oktoberfest    urlLink Troll Tavern    urlLink General Guide to an Amster-damn good time
