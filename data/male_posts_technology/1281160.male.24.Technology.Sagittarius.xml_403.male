I have been seeing Ganesh and others post regularly to the group (in the recent past).  I feel that the matter of relevance is very important.   I suppose not many in the group will be interested in knowing that Microsoft has stopped development of IE, both Mac and Win versions or that Mozilla is better fro browsing than IE. To them, news like the above might be irrelevant. I don't know if any of the bloggers also feel so. Additionally, we forget that the blog does not occupy any space in our system, but the mails to the group consume a lot of space in your mailbox.   Looks like start of a new discussion, I like this.
