His Name is Truth. He is the Creator. He is without fear. He is without hate. He is beyond time. He is beyond birth and death. He is self-existent. He is realised by the Guru's grace.  Quote: Almighty grant me this boon. May I be not afraid from doing noble deeds, be never afraid when on the battlefield, may steel the will and fight with determination to win.  I like the fundas :) Go Sikhism!
