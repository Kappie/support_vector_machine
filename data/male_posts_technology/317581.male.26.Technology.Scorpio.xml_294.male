So, when I got the mail yesterday, Marc had sent us a postcard of a topless girl on a beach and was like, "I read a lot at the beach here", and then today when I got the mail there was a postcard for Austin. This one had a dude on the front and said, "Hey Austin, this beach has lots of topless men on it, it's pretty cool, you should come visit it" I almost pissed my pants I was laughing so hard.  N - E - way, I'm drinking a little Jameson tonight, just to keep me warm of course;) I'd say I was turning into an alky, but this is the first drink I've had in like a week and a half, so I wouldn't say that I am, but I'm doing like 2 of the 4 signs. Drinking by myself, and only drinking hard shit.  So, I've been really busy at work recently, my site went live. So I've been maintaining it. Trying to keep it running. Had to come home early today, because my brain broke down. (You know that time when you are overwhelmed with work to the point of not being able to function, that's the point I was at)  So I came home and bought the new Jewel album, much kicking of the ass:) Also got to play with the game cube, which I want more time with, cause I think it'll be much kick ass. (Played Rogue Squadron, very fun)  So, I'm really looking forward to the Tenacious D/Weezer/Jimmy Eat world concert tomorrow night. IT should kick some major bootï¿½.  Well, I think I've blogged enough for right now, I'll check you dogs latah...  PS - I just checked Sunday hero and was shocked to see she'd changed her layout once again. I guess I'm just a guy that likes my layout, I think the blue helps to neutralize any angry feelings:)
