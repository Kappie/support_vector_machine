     
      Poet-seers who have achieved the highest realisations and have endeavoured to  share that experience with the rest of humankind.The teachings and  very utterances that spiritual masters of this calibre offer to the world come from the most sublime realms of consciousness that human  beings can attain to. Their poetry transcends the page to become mantra,  an invocation to the transcendental consciousness.  Do you think we know any poet seers? or have any of us come across the works of poet seers? Discuss please!
