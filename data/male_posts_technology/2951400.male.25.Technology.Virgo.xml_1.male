A chirp and she was into her car, a passer by heard a sigh but was not sure if was the seat or the woman. He noticed she was very pretty, something out of a childhood dream, she was magical he murmured to him self; he swore he had just seen a fairy driving a Jetta. He shook his head;  "No fairies before 8pm... I'm on my way to the bar now..."  He checked his watch again;  "Jesus it's only 4:20pm...."   With that she took another left and was gone from his view. The stress of the day had built up in her shoulders and neck but nothing a hot bath and a glass of wine couldn't cure. She glanced at her cell phone before deciding that it would be better to just go to his house and get it over with. Less than 24 hours ago the familiar beep of a message woke her from a nice dream. It was unusual for him to be texting her so late, she swore and reached for the sound above her head. Quieting the low beep and squinting to see the name it was apparent that she was correct and her boyfriend had been a busy boy, this was going to be a bit of a read. The surprise was the lack of any attention from him of late. She had called him a few days ago only to leave a voice mail and receive a text that he was sorry and was busy that he would call her this weekend for sure. Busy was never a concept she had ever put into he same sentence with him. He was something of a home body, enjoying the "Blockbuster night" almost every night it was one of the things that made her wonder if they were to be together for much longer. Her heart had always lived in the moment, frequent trips to Santa Cruz alone and her love of music drew her out into the night where she loved to dance and act as if she had no care in the world. She only wished her should share that with him, as he had to be coxed and often dragged out of the house. She smiled and held in a giggle at the thought.   "That bastard broke up with me on a text message and for his ex no less."   When he drank he always seemed down and she suspected he was missing her. The message had come of no surprise and she was happy he had down the breaking up as she didn't want to have to make such an effort to pin him down for the 5 minutes she would have needed. The last thing was to pick up her belongings from his house. Just a few CDs, her PJs and the extra toothbrush she left at his house the pink one she used for whenever she was away from home. This should be quick and painless, she doubted he and his ex would be able to find happiness but that was of no business of hers and she was happy to keep her thoughts to herself. No, she was far from bitter, if not she was quite proud of herself on how well she had been doing these last few months. Living independently was something she had to get used to as her pervious relationship had been lavish as she was always taken care of, never to lift a finger as he had given her anything she wished for. This one she had babied and felt as she was taking care of him and that was something she decided not to continue for much longer but the situation had taken care of it's self, now to the matter at hand.   The city had thinned out behind her leaving only an old dirt road that grumbled as she drove along. Some scattered houses left a feeling of farm land but nothing ever seemed to be growing. She always felt fields of corn were always so beautiful, or wheat a golden sea of heaven. Maybe the value of the land as farm land did not seem so high to the current owners of the lands around her, the sons of daughters of farmers past may want to save there backs. Past the large oak tree and a sharp left brought into her view of the newest looking house she had seen out here. She drove around to the back of the house as the driveway had been poured to allow parking in the rear. Throwing her things in the back seat she slipped off her work shoes and put on a pair of sneakers she kept as she was very fond of her Nine West heels. Out of the car now she glanced around at the fact that she seemed to be the only one home. His father and mother worked later than her and that explained there cars being gone but he asked her to come after work to pick up her stuff she only assumed that he would be here. As she did a full circle her eyes fell upon a black garbage bag on the back porch.  She knew he would never leave her things out in the open in a garbage bag but as she neared the door she saw there was a note attached. Her nose wrinkled again and she began to read;  Julie,   	Sorry I wasnt here to say goodbye but I think a clean split would be healthier for us both. I have everything here that reminded me of you. I didnt want to throw it out but I cant have reminders of you around as I will be starting my new life with Sandi. I wish you the best in all you do.   Thank you,  Jason  What the fuck?  That was the only thing that registered in her head. She was not that surprised anymore at his lack of backbone anymore. She opened the bag to find several cards and a candle she had given him only weeks before. She looked it over to find that it had been lit so it wasnt even presentable anymore. What in the world would she do with it? As ser was asking herself this she carried the bag over to the near by trash and started to take items out that had lost there sentimental value. As she pulled out each card she read them over and smiled. She loved cards and personalizing each one so that her feelings could be expressed perfectly. She always took great care in the gifts she picked out even the candle she bought was of his favorite scent. She knew he had it by his bed side and would light it as he got ready for bed, she wanted him to think of her and not forget that she wished she could be there with him but those feelings were gone now and she dropped the candle, cards and some dried flowers in the trash. Replacing the lid she clicked open her trunk and gently laid the bag in the cargo net so it would not roll and damage anything. She was hurt if any by his return of the things she gave him. Any gift she took the time to pick out and wrap and send to someone with a ribbon included a bit of her heart. She wanted someone to cherish that and be willing to accept her gifts as something scared. She also wanted the same in return. It wasnt what was given that mattered to her it was the love and time, pieces of there heart that were wrapped in such gifts. She saw the sun setting and did not want to be here when his parents arrived. Speeding down the driveway she heard a sound that made her happy, the crickets crawling out of there homes had come to play there songs for the creatures of the night. She was one of those creatures, there was someone for her out there and she would be ready when he came bearing his heart open and she would be willing to share hers as she knew that love would be wonderful.  Until then she would be herself, the only person she knew she could be. Her world was a fairy tale and she was no longer helpless within it, maybe in the days to come she would do some good on her own.
