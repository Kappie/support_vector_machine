Left my house at 7:15pm to wait for the bus to take me to the dojo. Waited over an hour for it but it never turned up. Mind you, because it's daylight saving now, it was still mighty bright when I started waiting. After 1 hour however, it was difficult to keep my spirits up as the temperature got colder and the sky got darker. Class was supposed to start at 8pm. I thought I'd just have to make do with being a little bit late for class. However, at 8:15pm I decided I can't wait any longer. I dialed for a cab which arrived 5 mins later and I reached the dojo under 10 mins. Unfortunately, Sensei had just locked the door to the building thinking I wasn't gonna come.  The situation at the dojo was this, it's basically something of a community centre. But the instructors there do not have the keys to the place. Instead, the place is open at a certain timing and classes are scheduled 1 after another. Which means there's always someone there to open the door for you. As my Sensei does not have the key to the place, she can't reopen the door again. And she had only closed it 2 mins prior to my arrival.  ARGHH!!!!! ... I don't blame my Sensei for this. Anyway, she was so nice about it, she reimbursed me my cab fare back, even though I said she really didn't need to do so. She said I'm just a student, so money and all that was kinda important for me coz I'm not earning anything yet. (Sigh, nice hor.) I really blame the bus service because I suspect the people at the bus depot were probably just slacking around. I know for a fact there's a big match between Madrid and Manchester United. That probably account for the absence of the bus during this hour. I'm gonna find a number and make a really formal complain 1st thing tommorrow morning.  There's a lot of reasons why I'm pissed. 1. Sensei Pauline had shifted about a month ago and she basically needs to take an hr's drive just to come down to teach us and another hr's drive just to get back. (By the way, that's also the reason why she's looking for another dojo location to change to. Meaning she's probably not goin to be teaching University's class in the near future. So even if I do decide to return here for my Masters, I won't be able to train under her anymore. ARGH!!!) Basically she wasted her trip down (much like the rest of us) today. Because of the distance, with due consideration to her, we, the regular students, always try our best to inform her of our attendence in advance to prevent her from making such wasted trips down to the dojo. 2. Sensei paid for my cab fare though it's not her fault. 3. Today was the LAST class for the Easter holidays. Sure there's a class once term reopens. But besides turning up for the 1st week of May, I probably will be absent for about 1 whole mth due to my exams and all that. After which, if I'm lucky enough, I'll be able to attend 1 more of her class before she goes to the US (either on holiday or for some Aikido camp thing there I suppose). 4. I also caused Angelo to make a wasted trip down to the dojo. Sure he stays nearer compared to Sensei but he still made a wasted trip down and he had to gimme a lift part of the way back to my place, something which he does every week. (Sigh, another nice person.)  All because the STUPID BUS NEVER CAME!!!!! ARGHHHHHHHH!!!!  After getting off Angelo's car, I was still feeling kinda frustrated. While walking the rest of the way back home, I kept looking around, probably hoping some fools would try to jump me and try to rob me or something. Just so I can use some Aikido on the fella. Luckily, nothing happened. Must admit the walk did me some good to cool my head down a little. I entered my house and saw Justin and David watching soccer (damn Madrid vs Manchester United). They were surprised that I got home so quick. Explained what happened and went on to make myself a cup of tea as well as attacked a piece of chocolate flavoured Venetta ice cream cake or watever you'd call it. (Mmmmmm ...) Really wanted to practice my 8 directional exercise (happo-giri) but our backyard had no yard light and I thought it'd be too dark and cold to do it at night anyway. Brought all my stuff to my room and passed Lynette. Explained the whole deal to her again and came back online. Met Gary on ICQ and made noise about the whole thing again before I decided to blog things down. After I post this blog, I'm gonna surf for the Midlands bus service website to get a number where I can make an official complaint. I'm definitely not in an Aiki mood tonight. Hopefully when I wake up 2moro, my mood will change for the better.  Can't wait for morning so I can do my happo-giri exercise and go running in the evening. To end this post .... well, ... ARGHHGHGHGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
