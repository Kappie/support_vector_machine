I love my job, although stressful at times, I really appreciate what I do. I know tons of people who majored in computers and are working in something totally opposite. I also like where I work, normally I'm alone in my office and can do whatever I want, and later say I did tons of work. But please don't tell anyone that :). I also get along well with my co-workers, even if some of them cause me huge morning headaches.  But right now I'm hating it all. I'm hating my job, my co-workers, and especially my workplace. I don't know, it's just one of those days when I hate almost everything, one of those 'I-woke-up-on-the-wrong-side-of-the-bed' days. It won't last though, as I'm too nice a person to let something hateful stay inside me for long periods of time.  There are little things that annoy me, which I don't let them get to me, but those small things really suck. For example, there's no way anyone could work with 5-6 kids (co-workers children) next door to my office and listening to them laughing and their parents telling them to shut up. Another thing is when someone doesn't do his/her job and trying to place the blame on me. This was the cause of the early morning headaches.  Also, the kids mentioned before are sucking all the bandwidth off the network, checking out their Barbie, Spongebob and other assorted animated characters. Being a web developer isn't easy. Especially when some people don't like when you change the way the Intranet works and demand you do the same thing, but leaving it as close as the way it was before. Huh? Either you want the change, or you don't, it's that simple.  Oh well, it's Thursday afternoon, meaning I'll be leaving to my in about 26 more hours. Hopefully the headaches will stay in my office and won't follow me in my two-hour drive home. I really,  really  hope you all are having a great day, since I sure as hell won't be having one today! Thanks to the good ol' blog, I feel better, knowing that probably someone, someday will read this and feel the way I do right now.
