What about Robert  Greenwald (Outfoxed) is he the new Leni Riefenstahl too? What about  Nickolas Perry and Harry Thomason (The Hunting of the President) - can they both  be Leni Riefenstahls, or is one of them Leni when she's like younger, and the  other one when she's older and all wrinkled looking, which is how I remember  her? Some people (Washingon Post) even compare Verhoven (Star Ship  Troopers and Show Girls) to Riefenstahl, and who can argue with that. That  pretty much makes it a good argument to use, because basically, when all is said  and done, you're not comparing anyone to Leni Riefenstahl, you're just comparing  everyone's movie to Show Girls. Those GOP b*stards are cunning!
