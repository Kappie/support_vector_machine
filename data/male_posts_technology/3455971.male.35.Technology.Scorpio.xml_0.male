By imitating the action Of brushing one's  teeth he successfully expresses himself to the shopkeeper and the purchase is  done.  Now if there is a blind man who wishes to buy a pair of sunglasses,how should he express himself?  Think about it first before scrolling  down for the  answer...   He just has to open his mouth and ask, so simple.  If you got this wrong please - do not pass go, do not breed, just go dig a  hole and hide. you are a disgrace to the earth.      I got this wrong. Other people know I got it wrong. I am soooo fucking embarrassed.
