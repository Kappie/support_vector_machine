All of a sudden , the phone died lacking of any power....i panicked and i droved my car like you see in Bad Boys II weaving in and out of the road courtesy to the training i received when i play Need For Speed.IV., rushing in time back to my house and to pop the phone into the charger..but the guy never called again...  I mean the interview was great ...although it lasted for 2 minutes and he was asking question pertaining to the job and well ...i could have that job...now it seems bleak...cause Jobstreet.com.my have a private number which is not identifiable with the caller ID in my phone..  But the whole day wasn't brought down by this incident , i have a great time in LoudRoom (SIB College Leader Meet) and we contributed our thoughts together and well....later mamak time was a blast.  Haaahh...it's back with the old sighing of a jobseeker's future and current times....it is both an enjoyable time and a sanfu time ...especially the waiting for the call for an interview..
