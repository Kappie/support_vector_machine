Piangz, she so sensitive about stuff. Chin cai lah ...   Aikido @ BVCC  Grabbed my haircut and missed the first hour of training. Still the second hour was ok. I kinda strained/sprained my left ankle when I landed badly. Noe whenever I need to do a forward roll which uses the left foot, I do it 'Judo' style. Why do I say that? Because I land exactly the same way Sakai (Siglap CC) does. Anyway not so bad that I can't walk properly. Only hurts when I fully extend my foot to be on tiptoe or when I twist it to the side. Just a strain I would think. Bought my ticket for the seminar this coming weekend and Sensei also announced a news. $5 to be charged per session when anyone drops by a dojo where they do not pay the mat fee. Think it's a good idea but I hope it can be enforced among the students tho. (One eg, I didn't pay for yesterday's class ;Þ but I intend to do so from next session onwards.) I had thought that the $5 was applicable to only Pillars (cos it wasn't a CC but a pte spot). Joining 2 clubs means we are able to visit other dojos without paying mat fees. While keeping mats, Tommy was asking "Eh, so now how ar? U join which dojo?" Told him my impression was that cheapest 2 were BVCC and another CC (but can't rem which exactly. Still it's gonna amt to about 160+ (3 mths) or so coz I think the CCs increased the charges due to the GST increase.   Dojos vc Cost  Just checked, cheapest 2 dojos seem to be BVCC and BBCC (not BB East CC). But then again, joining 1 dojo and just paying $5 per session (if you train an extra 1 session a week) means total expenses will be about $130ish (3 mths). But the most worthwhile spots to train for the amt you pay would still be BVCC and BB East CC (if you consider at an hourly rate). Sigh ... too bad I hate Maths, otherwise I'd do up a statistical analysis of these costs.  But if joining 2 dojos means you can train any no. of times and anyplace... now that is definitely the best deal. Just sign up for the 2 cheapest dojo but make sure you get ur money's worth of regular training. If you are only to train a certain no. of times it may not exactly be worth it.   My Conclusion  I guess next thing I should do is seriously consider how regular I plan to have my trainings. I don't intend to leave Siglap anytime soon yet. Doubt I will increase my AFS training beyond what I'm going thru now because of distance, cost and time constraints. Also because I'm committed to Yuishinkai training once a week as well. I guess I will stick to Siglap on Thurs and ARCC on Sat with Yui. As for Tues at BVCC / Pillars on Mon, I may rotate it to alternate weeks or whenever my schedule dictates. Strongly doubt BB East is a feasible spot for me to travel to as long as it's a working day for me.  This morning I went running again. It's ok but I was kinda late. If I only made myself get out of bed 30mins earlier then I'd be able to reach school on time. Was feeling lazy. Actually woke at 6 but lazed in bed till 6.30 instead. Started slow coz I was afraid my ankle will give way when I'm running halfway. But it seemed fine. I'll be meeting 2 colleagues for lunch and a reservist in the evening. The latter is some financial advisor with AIA so I'll be finding out more about these kinda stuff soon. Hope to start some investment/savings plan within the next year or so so need to get some research done now. Evening I'll probably drop by to collect my samsung battery from James then pop home for dinner.  Can't wait for the Aikido seminars (AFS and Yui) to start soon. But it will be a very tiring week for me. Training will run consecutively for 5-6 days for me. Hope I can take it.
