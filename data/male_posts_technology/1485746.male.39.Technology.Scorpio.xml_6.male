Sure, the occasional bobble here and there, but I've gotten 20 points on each race (which is the max) and I'm nearly done.  Of course, I don't expect it to get really hard until I open up the Pro and higher Careers.  There's a new t-shirt in the ilovebees shop on cafepress.com that shows the following: "11+9+4=24". This has fueled speculation that the actual release date for Halo 2 will be August 24th. I am hopeful, but not convinced.
