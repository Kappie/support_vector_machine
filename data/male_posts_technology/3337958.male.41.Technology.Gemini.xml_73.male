The repeated drone of Tom Carnegie's  " There is a tornado warning.  Please leave the stands immediately!"   haunts my dreams still.  I'll get some pictures of the event up on the other site when I get a free moment at home.  Turns out I can't use the utility for that when I'm behind my corporate firewall.  Meh.  Everyone in our party had a good time, and we were probably the only attendees that had the luxury of a steak dinner at home during the break in the middle of the race, even if it cost us a few laps.
