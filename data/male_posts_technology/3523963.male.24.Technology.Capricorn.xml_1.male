I also wonder why i don't avert myself from these..One reason is money..Money provides you with all the stuff you need in this world to live.There are many other reasons as well.Of late i have come to know a lot about this Philosophical stuff..I think this is something which everybody goes through in their own life. And when i opened that mystical door, i saw a new world around me..completely new as if a person in matrix has realised it and come into the real world...It feels like i am now in Zion...Yes..What you r thinking is right.Of course i have gone crazy. Afterall crazy people would call the sane ones insane and vice versa....Actually i am in pretty confused state now...Why do you think i am writing this BLOG..one reason is to really bore you..another reason is that i myself in a restless state...don't know why..Probably i didn't have the piece of cake for the day..Oh good..When i look back and read the paragraph you have just read, i criticise myself, why i wrote this...But still there are people like you who take time to read this...Please don't think that you are wasting time here.. Actually there is NO TIME to waste...I appreciate your eagerness to read this paragraph further...But just hold on..I am still writing.. Do you see any sense in the above paragraph you read..i don't think so.Now i know why they call this as a BLOG..Boring Log..  I can feel that my tongue wanna taste some good food..Yes i am back to UK from india, eating curd rice for lunch daily...May be i can have a good biriyani some time here if i get a chance to go to Manchester or London. People say or rather IBM says there should be Work-life balance..Why the hell then they don't give few days together leave..All Hypocrites..Yes this includes me and you as well..we say something ..we do something..we can't even avoid it..And again when it's all done, we start our complaints..This is gonna go forever unless we put an end ourselves..How can we do that..Is there a way at all..Mind that there is always an answer to your question in philosophy..Philosophy can answer you in one or other way.But that need not be true.Good that i came to know about this early on.But still there is something in me that says you go on in search of that thing which you ought to search.In doing so, i find myself put amidst many predicaments, dilemmas, resulting in further confusion, rather than solving the problems.It actually complicates the process. I read somewhere that this very search itself is the problem..If that is the problem why am i not stopping the search.Somewhere something falsifies me..don't know what is that..May be you know.do reply if you know..Enough for today ..gotta go home. i do have something to cheer in this life. Gonna listen some songs by A r Rahman in my laptop, downloaded last month here in UK, yes of course illegally.. I wonder if i am restless or Reckless....
