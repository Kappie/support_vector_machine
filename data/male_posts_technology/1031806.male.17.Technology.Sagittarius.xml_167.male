K. - Got To Do It   I had a long and meaningfull talk with my mom last night through this morning (Sorry Andrew, that's why I kept calling you back every half hour saying I was going to be longer - lol), and I'm feeling much better for it. She's great to talk too; it's amazing how much of this she understands. Anyway, I'm thinking (this was kinda her advice too) that I need to pull back from Gwen for a while, while this new relationship starts and give her some room to breath. I'm probably going to call her tomorrow night (well, tonight) and tell her that I know she's in a relationship with another guy now and I think I need to pull back and just let them figure each other out without my interaction as a hinderance. I'll probably finally say straight up that I'm in love with her and would be quite willing to have a closer relationship again should she so choose, but for the moment we need to tone down on how much we're communicating (i.e. I'm not going to call her every night and stay up for hours on end, talking anymore). I know that she wants to still keep our friendship alive, but I question whether our current interaction is really within the bounds of 'just a friendship'.  Feedback is more than welcome on this.
