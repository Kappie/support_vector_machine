Day before that my sister is in  court  to testify, and in an unrelated case, while she's there a prisoner escapes, lifts a cop's gun and almost blows away said cop point blank - luckily guns are unloaded in the courthouse. The guy still managed to escape the courthouse - the authorities gave chase, he got hold of ANOTHER firearm somehow and killed a polic officer that was trying to apprehend him. Sometime later the guy gave himself in. Why didnt the cops drop the swine? He's a copkiller ffs! I'll tell you why. Because he's the  son  of a parliament member... Only in Africa. What else sucks about living in this shit hole. Let's see. Tax is high, salaries are low, real-estate is going through the roof, trying to get the latest PC games is an excercise in futility, internet access is slow and costs an arm and a leg... I'm tellin ya, those living in the first world really don't know how good they've got it.
