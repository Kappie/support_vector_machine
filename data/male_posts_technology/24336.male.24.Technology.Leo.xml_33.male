The new  urlLink i815E  chipset from  urlLink Chipzilla  is a definite improvement over the i810 and i820 chipsets, or so says a  urlLink review from Sharky Extreme .  The 820 is obviously plagued by the high cost of RDRAM.  After significant price cuts, 128meg of RDRAM still costs  $350 !  The 810 was plagued by the onboard video, which was not upgradeable.  The 815 uses SDRAM yet also has an AGP slot for video upgradability.  The 815 also has a great affinity for onboard hardware, such as a network adapter, modem, or sound card.  Brand new systems can be purchased for cheap when built with this chipset.
