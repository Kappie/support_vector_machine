When making the appointment, I asked for someone who was knowledgeable about depression, anxiety, and migraines. The person said "Oh, all the doctors here know about that." No, I mean really know, so I don't have to wait for them to figure out what to do with me. I think I lucked out, and they listened to me. I ended up with the new doc, a relatively youngish woman, who seems knowledgeable and understanding. She made me feel relatively comfortable talking about my problems, and seemed informed about the different medicines. Normally I end up seeing a male doc, but the last two now have been women. I have absolutely no problem with that, and I think women are better able to actually listen to a patient and be a partner with the patient, as opposed to some male docs I have met who are arrogant know-it-alls. As long as they don't tell me to turn my head and cough, everything will be fine.     Anyway, we discussed how the Celexa was not working for me. I have been at 40mg for about 3 months. She agreed that if I was still having that much difficulty with depressive spirals, that the medicine obviously is working very well. I gave her the 5-minute life history of my illness, and she thought that since I have both symptoms of depression and anxiety, Effexor has worked well for that combination of problems. So I will try to survive going off one pill, then starting another. I have read of people going 3 or 4 weeks with no medicine waiting for one chemical to get out of the body and the new one to take effect. Apparently I can stop the Celexa within 6 days, then immediately begin with the Effexor. The initial dose is 37mg, then 75mg, then more if needed. Hit me, baby, I need a bunch.     BTW, I can't seem to say Effexor without doing a superhero-type dum-dum-DAAAAAA sound effect.
