"This weekend as you remember, ponder, and celebrate the salvation secured for you on the cross, think about Kurt Cobain and those represented by his voice. I wonder if his cries went unheard for so long that he finally gave up and walked away from life while saying “nevermind.” God “minded” so much that He sent His Son into the world and to the cross. As His followers, we’re called to “mind” on His behalf. Will we “mind,” listen, and answer with the Good News?"
