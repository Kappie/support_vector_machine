After a busy day of city-ness yesterday, we got up at the butt-crack of dawn to drive out to Housatonic Villiage, MA. After a long, but nice drive down the Pike, we arrived at a really beautiful little church, a quick but meaningful service, and then lunch with family. It was our first time seeing Ryan, and he is a great little boy.
