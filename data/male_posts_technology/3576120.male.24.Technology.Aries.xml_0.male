However, I would like to say that I will try to post at least three times a weeks.  Anyway here we go…  So today in computer lab, one of the kids had the brilliant idea of licking the computer screen of his computer.  Now, why this action would occur to anyone, I don't know, but it apparently came to be with this kid.  Perhaps for a minute, the kid had a lapse in judgement and began to hallucinate that the computer was a big bowl of food and knowing since daddy's food stamps only go so far, that he would simple dig in.  Or on the other hand, maybe the kid was just a dumbass trying to show off to his friends.  Well, I hope he gets gonorrhea and dies.  Anyway, as soon as the other kids in class started to spout off about this incidence, the teacher of the class responded by asking the kid why he did it.  When he did not answer her, she immediately through her hands up in the air and said (looking at me) their your computers, so you can deal with this.  Son of a Bitch! I wanted to say was, " well their your dumbass shitty kids ho, you fucking deal with it.  After all, that's what you're making the big bucks for right."  Besides, this is the same fucking teacher that had been out of the room (when she is supposed to be there) for over thirty minutes just ten minutes earlier.  That pisses me off, I am not a damn babysitter.  And if I was, I won't baby sit these shitty little sons of pukes.  I would rather shit fire and drink HIV infected blood from a catheter before I baby-sit these children of Satan.  Don't get me wrong, I don't hate kids, but I do hate the lazy ass one's that like to fuck with my shit.  In the end, it just pisses me off that this teacher couldn't take responsibility for her kids.  I also was upset that I waa put on the spot to react to something like that.  Oh well… I guess I really shouldn't write stuff like this in my blog, cause after all, it could probably get me fired.  Anyway.. This wasn't the best update, but I guess it will have to work for now….. That's it for now… ta ta
