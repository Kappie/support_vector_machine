Probably, but one would think, with such a high profile, Moore would have properly covered his ass by now. Yet the inconsistincies just keep on rolling in - using off-shore contractors to host his site (when he's rabidly against the use of foreign labour - well, except when it comes to  himself  it seems), vocally denigrating all US citizens as ignorant and stupid while abroad, and then, when home, saying that , you know, Americans aren't  that  bad, it's just the administration that sucks... etc, etc, etc.
