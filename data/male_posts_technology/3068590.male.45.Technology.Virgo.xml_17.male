The ability to meet the demand for energy within China will not be met by China. The need to import energy is well established when we consider that China is now the second largest importer.  The inability to secure the pipeline and deliverability for its domestic needs, the Chinese feel susceptible to an oil embargo from the Pacific Ocean. They are therefore developing their first, and certainly not last, aircraft carrier. Now that is a bold energy policy.
