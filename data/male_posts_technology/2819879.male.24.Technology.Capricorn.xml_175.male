Not sure if I were in the dream or not, but it's like in one of the teenage-killing movie (Scream, I know what u did last summer.. etc.)...   I (or someone else) was in a tropical resort and that's when an Alien Shark, super smart and fast killing hunting us down one by one.   There's a scene that the whales come bumping on the shore and ask for Whale-King to help them defeat the Alien Shark... and so on...   Funny dream. Tho I was a little scared when I was IN it.   Also I've had another dream about little turtle ere I woke up, and... that makes me worry a little, I'll contact him ASAP today.
