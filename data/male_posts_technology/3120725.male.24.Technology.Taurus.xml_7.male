Now some Jack@ss had the gall to spout-off on how it was disgusting that the media and others were saying that  it was wrong to condemn the U.S. soldiers because we were not there and didn't understand what they were going through.   He then finished this well thought out argument with "those prisoners are just lucky I'm not over there."  I was actually quite surprised that learn that bigoted @ssholes had learned to use computers.  It hurts my head trying to comprehend what little kernel of thought prompted him to hop on the computer and fire of this humdinger of an e-mail.  Did he seriously think that hordes of Americans would rally to his cause, millions of reasonably intelligent people simultaneously slapping themselves in the forehead and think what dicks they had been for judging those poor, poor soldiers who only tortured and humiliated fellow humans in the name of  justice .  Some people are just morons.
