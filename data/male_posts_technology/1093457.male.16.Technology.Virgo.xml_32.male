Well I found it along with many others at  How Stuff Works  ( How Cruise Missiles Work ) and it is rather interesting, everything from cameras to chocolate - a site for looking at when your bored. What have I been doing recenatly? Not a lot really. Just general things that you normaly do in January. I don't really have the energy to blog right at this point in time, and I really don't have a lot to anyway. I want something interesting and exciting to happen, soon - getting a bit bored at the moment. Have a good weekend people. When something happens I will tell you all about it.
