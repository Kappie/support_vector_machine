Well, I've got four whole days left until I set off to Austria, which should be fun! howvere, I'm not looking forward to the concert side of things, a) because I am veyr unsure of the words in some songs (ummm!) and b) because I am apparently 'middle alto' so I have a little part all to myself (oh and Sally and the girl who can't sing), I can't hear either of them, my sister has deserted me, I didn't know I was supposed to be singing it until Friday, and um, I can't do it! Other than that it shoudl be fine. Oh apart from the small matter of Chango Mangos which I can't do either, me and bloody volunteering for solos. Ah yes, news flash: David T blatanly fancies Louise. PERVERT! Will explain when I see people; " just wanted to let you know your sister sang a solo, she was the better than everybody else there and I coludn't believe it was her". We all know what you're like David.......
