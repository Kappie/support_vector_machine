I'm not able to make head or tails out of it. Meanwhile, I'm continuing to do some work with the other part of my application - reading some measurements (without BizTalk) of response time for a message from a 'send' to a 'receive' ... its throwing up some interesting results in fact... a 11 byte message takes on an avg of 300-340 ms while messages of 1K, 2K and 3K take less than 100 ms ... that is pretty consistent on different loads of 60,120,240,480 and 560 messages/minute...  Got to study this a bit more... but I need to check the results with BizTalk too and waiting for my PL for that...  Kicha
