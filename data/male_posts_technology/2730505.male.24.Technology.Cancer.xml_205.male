Winners make it work no matter what.  The Lakers used to be winners but now they are reduced to almost nothing.  With that being said, I couldn't help but rejoice and lament, at the same time, in the fact that Shaq is leaving the once mighty Lakers and will be heading to the Eastern Conference with the Miami Heat.  Kobe, on the other hand will either be staying with the Lakers or just bolt to the other LA team, the Clippers.  How fucked up would that be.  Sure I know that no one here really pays attention to basketball but whatever.  The Lakers stars bolted and rivals rejoicing.   urlLink Here's  a really good story.  I won't really make much sense unless you know who Magic Johnson, Kareen Abdul-Jabar, Bill Russel, Wilt Chamberlin, Dwayne Wade etc.  I'll just figure that you know who Michael Jordan is.  I suppose that is that for some really juicy NBA stories for now.
