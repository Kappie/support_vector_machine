Plus, I don't want my friends to read it and tell me that it sucks. Not that they would mind you... but I guess I could post about that some other time. 20 something comes to blogspot to post some of his life. Sounds all too familiar right? hmmmm well I guess I am going to have to do better. Truth is I am not better than anyone really, or at least I try not to have that kind of attitude. It does kind of effect my competitive edge to make it more of a dull point that will annoy to great extent but never vanquish (vanquish? that is too big of a word for me, I better tone it down a little). Does your first post determine how the rest will go? I hope not.            Damn, I wish the tab key worked in this text editor. OK, a little about myself. I am a young guy living in DC who has a tech job. I love things such as cartoons and silly kid like stuff. I also like things like Anime, and going to museums and stuff (yes, stuff... I like to be descriptive). I take online classes that are counting towards my masters in IT. I also have NOT had sex in like a year and a half since my last girlfriend and I have lots of... feelings about this. It should be funny to write about me, trying to pick up women, because when all else fails to pick up women it will be funny to make fun of myself (but not too much fun, I am not that self deprecating). Well, I am at work... sooo... I should probably get back to the things I get paid to do. I might post some more later.
