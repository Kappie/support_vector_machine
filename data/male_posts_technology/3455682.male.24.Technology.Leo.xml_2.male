Met my guru, one time, When I slept, late night, It was a time, in fact, I had no idea, of anything about, I gaped at him, talked a lot, Told me something, and concluded that dream.  And another night it was a girl in sight, I admired her beauty a lot, Simple yet what I thought she was, Had a ride on the clouds above, I even asked h er hand, everyone would wish for one, The time was to kiss her, but the dream remained pending forever.  There are so many things around, You can get them happen once and for all, Just dream and drown in that, Don't think much but dream in a thought, Oh! What did I write everything about, Sorry it is not a dream but you can also try to write,  The story of a dream come true, Which can drown you too.
