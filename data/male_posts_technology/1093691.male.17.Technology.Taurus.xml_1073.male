Eek!  I'm really happy atm. Probably because of Paul. I've got a hair appointment for the day of the Valentines Ball in London so I'm gonna have gorgeous straight hair :) I hope you all like, well, those of you that go. You should come, as a large group, it'll be a good night out I reckon.   And you are allowed to bring people from outside of school so bring people!!  I'm also looking to the cinema tomorrow. Scary Movie 3! Wohoo!!  Jackie, would you like to post the subject / question this week?
