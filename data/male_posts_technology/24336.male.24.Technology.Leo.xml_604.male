My first task was to assemble a disguise that would let me infiltrate the ranks of my target.  It required some sort of black cape, weird black boots, a wig and makeup to look like an old woman and four old, silver coins.  I started to assemble this disguise and eventually realized it would not work and came up with a different one.  I had on tight black pants, black dress shoes, a beige collared sweater (sort of like this  urlLink one  but with a collar) with the collar up.  

Now that I had my disguise (if you can even consider that a disguise), I had to infiltrate the target location.  From my surroundings, the locale was possibly the city of New York, but checking my maps showed St. Petersburg.  So, yes, I was infiltrating a Russian installation.  From here, the rest of the dream is very fuzzy.  I do remember getting onto an elevator and having a woman roll her eyes viciously.  

I do remember some of the emotions that I felt.  When I was performing the first task, I knew that I was taking shortcuts and that my boss would be upset if he found out.  I believe the same thing happened when I was actually on my way to the base.  I was using some sort of device to track my location (probably a  urlLink Windows Mobile  powered device, naturally) and that was against the rules of engagement.
