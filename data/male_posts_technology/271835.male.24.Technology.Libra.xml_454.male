Then you'll probably be right at home with some classic  urlLink text adventures . The site has 6 playable online so far.    The first one is  Adventure (or Colossal Cave). The very first time I played with a computer it was to play this at a very poorly attended computer exhibition thing in St Theresa's school when I was about 11/12. I say poorly attended - there was a bearded bloke who was running it, 3 computers (Apples I believe but I'm not going to swear to it) and me who only wandered in on the way home from Heaton Park. I spent ages playing this adventure and was hooked on computers from that point onwards.    The others on the site are Atari Adventure, Rogue, Zork I, II  III.
