It was clear in my mind. I ought to feel like that way. It was on of those days of the month again …   Full Moon day  No Moon day .. are so close to my life. If I found myself solemn than required  mulling over everything again n again …. It’s gotta be those days in month. I’m not lunatic. I’m not ruled by any extraterrestrial creatures. Though I’ve faith in the God  supernatural powers, I’m skeptical enough not to take things on their face value.   After all I’m in technology field where everything happens due to something or everything has a valid reason. Everything is causal in this world. Well not everything…. I’m a bit psychic. All Scorpions are …. By the way no marks for guessing .. I’m a scorpion … On the border of Libra and Scorpion but I identify myself more with a true good Scorpio with it’s The Eagle variety (Read Sun Signs: Linda Goodman).   But I know the exact point when this process of thinking n getting poignant was triggered. It was the conversation with my lovely friend, Anu, over 3 hours and 39 minutes. She is the exemplary whacko, punk, care free, unabashed teenybopper. The best part is she knows how she is n why she is. Well we all were in our teenage. To know that precisely is the best part bout her.   I still remember the time when I was in 10’Th or in 11’Th or in 12’Th. The world was outright black or white to me. Nowadays the world certainly is not a rainbow but smeared, blurred, smudged combination of everything.   Morales are something yesteryear’s people used to care for (n how foolish they were)… Value is something only currency notes have. Virtue is the word somewhere in dictionary.  Why different games like Soccer, Rugby, Boxing, Tennis, and Cricket are interesting? Because they all are played with certain RULES. Or else , a night club brawl, a street fight, a riot can be considered as various forms of those games. Same way …  Life is interestingly worth when it is bound by some rules. Nowadays the only rule is to break the rule or bend it.I ain’t acting like a moral inspector or an eighty yr. old guy who has seen enough n enough scenes.  Suddenly everything you are not supposed to do are means of enjoying life. Everywhere I go , I get the same answer … I want to enjoy my life… I want to experience everything in my life once …. Huh... Hail... Lame excuses for smoking, boozing, doping … lol do I say something bout SEX??? (Scorpions are not supposed to say anything against SEX)  Forget bout Conversation with Anu, she has to experience so many things. Consider my good old friend Sanjay, who is at least 10 yrs elder to me. I hear the same lines in the same tone every time … then may be it is in bar or a pub or at any other damn place. I keep on smiling to them n for myself … Cuz nowadays I’m being seen as someone who is the biggest fool alive … goodness gracious reason : I don’t smoke. I don’t drink. I don’t dope and I’m always the only one to drive all of my friends home when they are intoxicated above all permissible levels.  Life is getting fast  instant … So I’ve decided to write blog once in 2-3 days  decided to stop for today.
