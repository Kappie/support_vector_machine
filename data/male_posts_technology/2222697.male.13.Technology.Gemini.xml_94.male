I do not have to be myself 3. I can rant in public 4. I can entertain while also writing in a journal  and my brother and uncle had them.  I am no longer a noob, or lamer. I have more than 100 posts and I have kept it for more than half a year, w00t!.  I am changing the name to "Elad's Blog" because i have used "elad" on a bunch of sites and I like the name.  Elad is actually Dale backwards which is my middle name. I may change the template in a few seconds, but more is definetly gonna come!
