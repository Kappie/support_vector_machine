Here it is in context:  (v.16) "For even in Thessalonica you sent aid once and again for my necessities. (v.17) Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that abounds to your account."  Paul's desire is not that he, himself, would be well fed (for he has learned to be content in every situation (v. 11) but that the Philippian church would be blessed by God for being generous. His compassion is to see someone else's relationship with Jesus grow, even (although not in this case) at his expense (1 Cor 8:13).  Last night I went out street witnessing again. Although I must confess that my heart wasn't in it. I was doing it more because it was a good thing to do than because I wanted someone to meet Jesus. Oh to be more like Jesus (or even Paul for that matter). Will I ever truely have compassion for people? Yes. :) "For whom He forknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son..." (Rom 8:29). "... for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure." (Phil 2:13).  As my dad would say: "Keep on keeping on." If you are a Christian, God is working in you to conform you to the image of His Son. Pray and yearn toward that end. If you're not a Christian then you need to know Jesus.
