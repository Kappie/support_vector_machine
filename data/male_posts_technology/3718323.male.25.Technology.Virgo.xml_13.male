For the most part it is sunny every day, and it rains maybe 10 times a year, probably less.  There are palm trees lining the streets, and yards with green grass aplenty.  In the winter, I could easily get in my car and leave the comfortable 70 degrees and perfect coastal surf conditions, and within an hour be in a foot of snow in the mountains; from where I could then leave and within another hour be sitting poolside in the middle of the desert enjoying a hot 90 degree day.  For these reasons and more, San Diego is known as "America's Finest City."  The striking thing about it is that aside from the weather, most everything that people have come to associate with San Diego is artificial.  The water that comes out of my tap is imported from the north.  The grass that grows in people's yards is only there because it has been planted and is watered regularly; without this watering it would resemble the natural Southern California landscape, brown and dry.  The palm trees that line the streets are not native.  I think that the flowers which are perpetually blooming are just as confused as the New Englander in me; they don't know what season it is.  San Diego is naturally a desert.  The only place where you will see San Diego in its original state is at the waters edge (even this is probably stretching it, as the ocean is probably too polluted to be considered natural, and coastal development has probably altered the state of the naturally occurring beaches) and in the canyons, where cactus and other aptly suited vegetation cling to life, and the steep canyon walls make it impossible for any sort of sprawling development.  It also seems as though all the people around here good looking, which in most places is obviously not the norm.  Along with this, it's a rare occurrence that you meet someone that was actually born and raised here.  With the fair exception of the indigenous people of the Southern California region, people have moved in from elsewhere over the last hundred years or so.  The weather may be great for those seeking year round outdoor activity, but really it is a harsh climate, where humans would have a difficult time surviving if it weren't for the modern innovations which allow cities as we know them thrive.  I realize that most cities worldwide are in some way or another in the same situation, but something just seems strange when a place in which it is normal to go 6 months without a drop of rain can really sustain the millions of people which it does.  And the amazing thing is that this city is still growing rapidly, and urban sprawl is becoming a major issue.  In all aspects, it really is an artificial paradise here, for now.  This afternoon I was out hiking, and from 1500 feet up I was able to look down upon the city, and there across the expansive view was a distinct thin grey line of smog stretching across the horizon.  Four years or so I remember seeing that in Los Angeles, and I remember being somewhat disturbed by how the smog could hang there like that on an otherwise picture perfect blue sky day.  And now each time I observe that here, it makes me wonder if the artificial paradise that has been created here is slowly deteriorating.
