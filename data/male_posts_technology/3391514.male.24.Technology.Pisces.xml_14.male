I can only hope someone comes up with something else, as shows like  Will  Grace  appear to have lost their edge (based on last weeks episode... the laughter seemed canned).  The pre-op assessment went well, with no needles involved.  Sadly, and predictably, they will be necessary for the actual operation.  Damn.   Armor  is looking up.  The style has become a little more sedate, and the mystery that is the chapter has been introduced.  Not so lucky for my  Lone Wolf  hunt... I thought I'd found one of the books nearby (relatively speaking), but alas, it has been sold.  The search continues...
