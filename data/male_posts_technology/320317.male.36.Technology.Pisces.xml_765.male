We've designed Browser Cam to make life easy for you whether you're a web master, web developer, or QA engineer. Browser Cam creates screen captures of your web pages loaded in any browser, and on any operating system, so you'll be 100% sure your web pages look good-and work right-on any platform."

 This is a great tool and the UI is really done well. Very usable site. However, it is a bit pricey and obviously only tests how it looks rather than functionality. Still pretty interesting though. You can view my site's browser cam  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .
