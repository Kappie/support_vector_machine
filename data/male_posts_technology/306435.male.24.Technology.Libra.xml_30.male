It was pret muddy, but extremely fun.  We had to go through 12 sections and find map pieces before leaving the maze.  I am not usre how long we were in there, but I would guess two hours.  Devon and Stacey even got their picture with Tom himself.    When we got home Ann had a message to call her mom.  It was bad news as her Great Aunt Alice had passed away earlier in the day.  Ann was pretty upset.  This is the second person I know who has lost someone close.  So I drove her to the airport this morning. She went back for the funeral and will be back on Monday night.  I will miss her, but I am glad she is getting to be with her family.  They will be in my prayers.  Okay, well I dont have much else on my mind...if I do I'll post...until then...
