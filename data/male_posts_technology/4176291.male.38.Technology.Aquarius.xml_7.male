But rather than getting into the debate over a meaningless issue, I want to look at the root causes and effects of dirty politics. For those looking for an in-depth look at the Swift Boat issue,  urlLink here is a link .  It is said that money is the root of all evil. You need no better example of this than the effect that money has on politics. The amount of money involved in campaigns for national office is mind boggling, and the source of a great deal of this money is corporations and wealthy private donors. The amount of money donated to campaigns by the middle class worker is basically inconsequential. Campaign finance reform has been a popular political issue for more than a century, but despite the best efforts of many who have championed this cause, there has been little change for the good and a great deal of change that has made the influence of corporate money even worse.   Looking specifically at the corporate money being spent in this falls presidential campaign is very enlightening to those of us who understand how the Oligarchy controls the politics of this country, and thus controls this country. Let's look specifically at the top contributors to this years presidential candidates. Using the latest figures from  urlLink OpenSecrets , we find that 6 companies show up in the top 20 list of contributors for BOTH candidates. The six companies which have donated heavily to both candidates are: Morgan Stanley, UBS Americas, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Microsoft. Now, of these 6 companies who are donating heavily to both candidates, how many do you think have your best interests at heart?  If you were to break down each candidate by the amount of money donated by industry, you get some interesting comparisons. Lawyers and Law firms are the leading industry donating to Kerry, the second leading industry donating to Bush. Securities companies are the 4th leading donor industry to Kerry, the 4th leading donor industry to Bush as well. Health professionals (doctors and their organizations) are the 6th leading industry donating to Kerry, the 6th leading industry donating to Bush. Miscellaneous Financial companies are the 7th leading donor by industry to Bush, the 13th leading donor by industry to Kerry. Commercial Banks are the 16th leading donor by industry to Kerry, the 10th leading donor by industry to Bush. Again, how many of these industries do you think are looking out for your interests?  In the end, you have no choice. Both candidates are controlled by the Oligarchy. The Oligarchs do not have the best interests of the people at heart. The candidates themselves are beholden to the Oligarchs. Democracy at this point is nothing more than a charade. The enormous amounts of money spent is not meant to elect one candidate or another, it is meant to dull the senses of the average short-sighted American, who is cleverly deceived into thinking the Swift Boat issue actually means something. And this process is repeated over and over at every level. Issues that mean nothing, mud slinging, name calling, labeling. Divisive politics meant to divide the people and divert their attention from the man behind the curtain. Wake up Toto, your not in America anymore.   (Definition from  urlLink Wikipedia .  Oligarchy  is a form of government where most political power effectively rests with a small segment of society (typically the most powerful, whether by wealth, military strength, ruthlessness, or political influence). The word  oligarchy  is from the Greek for "few" and "rule". Many political theorists have argued that all societies are inevitably oligarchies no matter the supposed political system.)
