I have scored  86% , I am not happy with the score, but then I lost most of the points in the Locking section which is the most controversial. Whatever it is, its fine.    Here is the full Report card.

This is provided to give you per-section feedback on your strengths.   The maximum possible score is 400;  the minimum to pass is 320.   General Considerations (maximum = 100): 94  Documentation (maximum = 70): 70  O-O Design (maximum = 30): 17  GUI (maximum = 40): 40  Locking (maximum = 80): 44  Data store (maximum = 40): 40  Network server (maximum = 40): 40 Total (maximum = 400): 345     I should thank  Jimmy ,  Latha ,  Nidhi  and  Matira . These guys helped me a lot in testing out the application. Given the score I have got I would maybe have flunked if I had not got a good score on the GUI section.  Thanks  Jimmy  for making my GUI good.
