From an early age i realised this and happily trundled through life with ONE username and ONE password. It was only when a college friend of mine who shall remain nameless (hi there Jay if you are reading this :P) thought it would be funny to log onto my yahoo page and tinker with it that i realised the error of my ways. Good old predictable Kin was devastated! I felt violated and tainted (well, actually i just thought it was immensely amusing but i feel the need to exercise artistic license from time to time). From then on i had to try to remember a plethora of obscure character groups (i refuse to call them words, it would be like calling a bacon and sausage sandwich a pig). I thought all was well and my brain was actually coming to terms with having to remember completely unrelated nonsense. and it was, that is, it was until last night. I wanted to transfer this blog site from kincronicles.blogspot.com (yeah i know, i spelt chronicle wrong) to www.kinackin.net i needed my ftp username and password. could i remember the damn password? could i buggery. last night i was a one man password cracking machine, fervently smashing away at the keyboard trying every word i have ever used, every nonsensical collection of letters i could think of, every pattern of letter on the keyboard, everything bar the password i was in need of.  It was a long night.  I got it in the end (as you can probably guess from the www.kinackin.net written in the address bar) and do you know how? could you possibly guess how, after all that messing around i  finally  got the password? yes, thats right, i just asked  my mate chris (who has access to the server i use) to change the password, can you believe that? all that effort could have been saved with just one phone call! Now i firmly believe if my head wasnt filled up with all those daft excuses for words, then i would have made the mental leap and landed firmly on the other side of my cranial obstacle (that metaphor went a bit wrong i think)  Theres a moral to this story, sadly my brain is completely frazzled and i can't for the life of me think what it is.
