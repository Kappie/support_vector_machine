It will take days, weeks, months for all of us to get used to no dog. I wish I could have said goodbye just one more time before she had to leave. :'(

But anyway:
Today is a Friday! (that is good if you didn't know ;-) After school today we are going to Blockbuster to rent a movie. (I want to get the Revenge of the Nerds.) Laura and I are going to babysit Kelly tonight, so we need something to entertain both us and Kelly. It's a B day - that's good. I don't know what else is happening over the weekend yet; I'll post a new entry when I find out. ;-)
