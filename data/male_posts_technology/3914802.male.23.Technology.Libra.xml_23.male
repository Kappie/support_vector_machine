She had on these hello kitty underwear and she kept flashing them to everyone because she was wearing a dress and she hasn't quite gotten the hang of wearing it yet I guess. She just likes to pull the dress up to her face because it is fluttery like a sundress. She also wanted to show everyone her ability to spin around in a circle. Hehehe, kids are funny sometimes.           I also got to see my other niece's son. A newborn who is about 3 weeks old. She is too young to have a baby (@ 18). She is handling it very well though. She is a strong girl who doesn't take crap from anyone. Some people would call that being a bitch, but she should have respect. I only hope that she keeps going to school and doesn't fall into stuff that isn't aligned with her hopes and dreams.           I saw a nice play called "when the world was green" this past friday night. The actors were awesome in it and the writing was cool too. The lighting made it pretty interesting because some constant lighting would have made this two person show very dull. It is about a chef who chased his cousin all over the world trying to kill him because of some family feud from a insult a long time ago. The chef accidentally kills the wrong man and gets sent to jail. It is in jail that the play takes place and he is being interviewed by a young (and pretty hot) reporter. Then after the play I went to a nice hole in the wall bar with the cast and crew and they all sang karaoke and I watched until I got a little tipsy and sang "space oddity" by David Bowie. Then, after the bar closed, we hung out at BH's house who played the hot intrepid reporter and then I went home.             Saturday I saw lots of nice sailboats at the Governor's Cup ending. Played some little frisbee golf with friends. I seem to have hurt my shoulder since I was trying to throw this huge branch into a tree. I had a reason tho, my frisbee was stuck in a tree pretty far up. The branch I was trying to use was too big so I almost separated my shoulder (I think), at least .. it hurt. Then we ate and went to the Green Door bar and undertook some drinkin. I played darts and stuff, and since I am not good the game lasted a while. I grabbed my  friend JH's butt and that was pretty cool. She is very flirty. I would make out with her if she wanted to. She is pretty cute. Then Sunday I woke up slightly hungover in my friend RM's bed which was funny just because I didn't want to sleep on the small couch. At least I didn't wake up with my ass hurting or anything.  I was slightly hung over because of the 4 shots of tequila and beer I had while playing drinking trivial persuit. But after South Park came on TV we stopped playing. Anyways, Sunday was the day of my nieces b-day. It was a good weekend.
