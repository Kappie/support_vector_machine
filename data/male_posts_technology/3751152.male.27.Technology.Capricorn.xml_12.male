Having secured what seemed to be the last seat in the pub we settled down to wait for the match to start. It was amazing at how packed the pub became and I don't think I've ever seen so many people wearing orange - not even at the Easyjet check-in desks! Naturally the majority of the pub were supporting Holland, altho we did see one chap in a Sweden t-shirt who interestingly had an Italy sweatshirt tied round his waist - wise move methinks with that many orange peeps about ;)   Whilst it was a good match, I couldn't help feeling a little saddened as I recalled that only two days before I'd been sat gripped by the England-Portugal match and as the game went to penalties (as Monster had kept on telling me it would) I felt I couldn't quite join in with the euphoria of the celebrations as Van de Sar saved the penalty and Robben scored to win the game for Holland. Up until Saturday's match Holland had been afflicted with the same penalties curse as England - for some reason they just couldn't win a match on penalties and it was always heartache for the nation - but now for Holland at least the curse was lifted, and I felt a little jealous. I guess England just have to wait their turn for the curse to be lifted - or practice their penalty taking! Anyways, whilst I'm not switching my allegiance, I do kinda feel a warmth towards Holland so they'll be getting my support for the rest of the tournament, and as my darling boyfriend pointed out my hair does match the team colours ;)
