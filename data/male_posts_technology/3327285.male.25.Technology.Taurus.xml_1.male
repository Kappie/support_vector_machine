Perhaps I should put a counter at the bottom of the page?  Yeah, then I will know just how pathetic I really am because the damn counter will never change.  Sigh.    Anyway, I guess what really tipped off this latest rage is the current state of music.  I just don't understand.  Are there really that many idiots in this world?  I was reading about how experts predict that this season of American Idiot has become the most popular and they expect the finale to be the biggest yet.  Are you serious?  There are really that many retards in the world?  I mean come on, who gets the satisfaction of knowing that glorified karaoke singers are competing for a million-dollar contract and a guaranteed tour?  I certainly don't.  There are many unsigned and struggling bands out there that would kill for the opportunity to even open for an established act, and yet, these darlings of the television are being handed a contract and record with a minimum of going platinum at least twice (well, except for that Justin guy...but seriously, did you expect him to be any good with hair like that and a stupid smirk on his face?) and all they had to do was sing cover tunes for a television audience.  Yeah, real deserving.  And if I have to get into another argument with someone over how "the pressure they suffer is so immense that they deserve to have a record and tour" I am going to go Manson and stab someone in the belly with a fork.  Seriously, who can justify this argument?  Look at the facts:  1.) Kid stands in line for several hours for a chance to "audition" in front of an "expert" panel of "judges". 2.) If the kid can impress a fat, uninspiring album producer, a washed-up, has-been choreographer (who has no business telling someone they can or can't sing when she couldn't hold a tune herself), and a bitter, pretentious label head (who only got his notariety by doing that which makes the most sense...telling kids with no talent that they, in fact, have no talent), they are off to Hollywood...well, their parents, partners, whatever will take them to the airport where they will fly to Hollywood. 3.) Once in the land of stars, they will, once again, "audition" for the "judges", only this time they do routines and duets.  Ooh, that's difficult.  Singing with another person.  YAWN!!! 4.) They get selected and spend the next 8-10 weeks (if they survive) singing covers 2 nights out of the week, and spending the rest of the time in a tricked out mansion in Malibu.  Oh the horror.  This group right here are already guaranteed a single on a compilation album, and a tour later in the year...wow, I don't now how they can take all this pressure. 5.) The final 2 will perform live with a song that they have been "working" on for the whole time.  America (read: 30-million screaming girls and gay boys speed-dialing and text messaging Fox) votes on who they think is better, and boom, instant #1 single (because radio forces it on the airwaves 24/7 for a month), album, tour, etc.  Now, where in there is the pressure of having to deal with an audience that hates your music?  When do they get to see what its like for a band to have beer bottles chucked at them?  How are they deserving?  How are they stressed?  As far as I am concerned, all they do is sing some tunes, live in a 'Real World'-type house, and have absolutely no responsibility whatsoever.  Fuck, they don't even write their own songs.  And here's further proof of how bullshit this show is.  That ugly red-headed kid, whatever his name is, did not have any business being in there.  He had no talent (pretending to croon like ol' Blue Eyes is not talent...I can do that while taking a shit) to speak of and was about the whitest thing on Earth next to Carlton from 'Fresh Prince of Bel Air".  I'm sorry, but this needs to stop.  Something has got to give.  When will America see that all they are doing is flooding the airwaves with more disposable tunes and less-talented singers.  I don't mind pop music.  There are some really talented acts out there (Christina and Jessica, Outkast, etc.), but then there are these damn fake pop princesses that think they are the top of the world (I blame Britney..she has a cute face, nice ass, perky tits, but she can't hold a note to save her life and her songs are obviously written by a 54-year old man), and its these "stars" that have tainted the music world and have allowed the insurgence of crap that is...American Idiot.
