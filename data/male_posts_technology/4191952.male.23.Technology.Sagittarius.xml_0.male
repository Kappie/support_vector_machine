The guy basically bought the rights to the website and put in a simple link to an email address. He gets thousands of emails daily and archives them. He doesn’t publish them or tell who they are from…I found it a good place to vent about something you don’t want a soul seeing. I guess you’d say it’s like Blogger.com, but for a one man crowd.
