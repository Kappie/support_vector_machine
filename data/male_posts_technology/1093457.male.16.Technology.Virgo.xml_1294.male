My week's plan: today - bluewater tomorrow - going hard rock with paul and then seeing we will rock you with paul because he is fab and yay day after - brighton, woo! day after that - homework weekend - both days working week after - school and uni trip.  Here is something to ponder if you wish:  How do bees have sex?
