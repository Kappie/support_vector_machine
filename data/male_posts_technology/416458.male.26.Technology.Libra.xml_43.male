Some time ago I read this article on Java.net.   urlLink My adventure in Self-Publishing [June 24, 2004]   I was interested in these experiences, perhapse thinking about the future. The reason I bring this up now is that a friend of mine is trying self-publishing for comics.   urlLink The Variance Anthology   They are using the  urlLink Cafepress.com  system, which is publising on demand. There are no up front costs. There are currently only 8 books in their programming section so there might be a gap in the market for the entrepreneurially minded.
