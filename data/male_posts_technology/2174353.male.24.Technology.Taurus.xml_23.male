Meanwhile, Salman Kasbati (FASTian 2000 - now in  urlLink Connect2Web ) took leave for the first week of August from his office. This meant that our three years old plan for going on a Pakistan tour might get materialized. With little effort, two more friends Humair Mudassir (FASTian 99 - now in  urlLink DreamzNet ) and Sarfaraz Ahmed (FASTian 2000 - now in  urlLink ITIM ) also got ready.  We bought a map of NWFP and listed down all the constraints. The major ones were being in Islamabad on 2nd of August and in Lahore on a working day. All of us had very important tasks to be done on 9th of August. The plan was made while sitting on a roadside lawn outside a house near National Stadium. We had the map stretched on the footpath with papers and pencils in our hands - busy in calculating expenses. No wonder every passerby gave us weird looks.  We selected Kaghan-Naran valley for our trip while passing by Lahore and staying in Islamabad for a day or two. The rest of the adventure would be interesting only for people who intend to go on a similar trip -  and would like to save costs . I'd write that only if I get time, which I never seem to have enough. Why can't I have more than 24 hours in a day?   The Waiter (in a restaurant in Naran):  Sir, aap ka naam kya hai?  Humair:  Bashir  The Waiter (turning towards Kasbati):  Aur sir, aap ka?  Kasbati:  Bashir  The Waiter (slightly distrubed):  Dono kaa aik hi naam hai?  ShahG:   Yeh dono asal main aik hi admi hain!  Kasbti:  Naheen, mera naam Bashir hai, us ka naam "Bashir underscore A" hai.  The Waiter:  Underscore?  (One of the several weird conversations we had on this trip)
