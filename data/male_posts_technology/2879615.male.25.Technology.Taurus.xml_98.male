Craig returns from another trip to the ville today.  That's Monteville for you losers who don't know about it.  Holla at the "party" if you could call it that at Janurary's house (yes that's really this bitches real name), small little apartment packed full of people.  Random people too... some guy who looked like yastine's dad, the french speaking old dude from north africa (holla at the apple martini's that this man made for us all night), the infamous Mike D., and of course doug e fresh's *real* brother Greg.  Lots of drunkeness and after hours festivities that led to crazy conversations and gossip.  Oh, and don't forget that lame fucker who Doug was ready to thrash at the party.  I mean can these fuckers try to fight each other 30 times and never really fight?  Craig the peacemaker trys to talk some sense into these people.  You know you don't have a chance against Doug when your "little" brother Craig could have easily taken care of this guy :-)
