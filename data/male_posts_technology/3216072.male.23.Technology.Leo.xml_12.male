With my girl standing next to me and a set of barrels pointed at me it was time to react to this situation. The reason for these men to be at my house alluded me. I could think of no reason for this and it angered me. I wanted them to die as much as it seemed they wanted me dead.  With no further delay I moved to the left towards the truck. Out of nowhere as if some ungodly gift my two guns sprang from the ground. I knew this was caused by the lever my foot had triggered in my sudden movement. Barrels pointing towards the ground and handles moving toward my hands through the air, it seemed time stood still.  My gaze never left the peripheral view of the two villains sent to me. I didn't hear the sounds of their guns, but only witnessed the muzzle flashes. The handguns landed perfectly in my grip. My trigger finger tapped the barrel right above the trigger, as I acquired my targets. My arms straight by my side pointing in the direction of when I had received my two gifts. Still moving to the left in the midst of dust flying from the ground I methodically raised my weapons.  Two shoots fired one right after another. This was when I reached the truck bed. I tucked my left shoulder and spun so my back would touch the top of the bed sides.  I was now totally horizontal which allowed me to spin one last time to land on my back in the bed of the truck. My arms at a ninety degree angle with the gun barrel beside my head. I was waiting for more fire, but I heard only screaming start from the girl I left unattended.  I got to my knees to find my two opponents lying on the porch. I turned my sights on her. She looked to be ok. I jumped from the truck and went to her. Looking her over she truly was physically ok. They had come for me and only for me. They were professionals that didn't mind witnesses. What was I up against here? As I walked up to the two unfortunates, I vowed to find out.
