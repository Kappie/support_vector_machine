Things like how she does not have any child support money and stuff like that.  I simply told her I paid the state and if she does not like it then that is her problem.  Then she says to me "well how do I get it then" like it is my job to tech support her ass through child support retrieval.  Well as our conversation goes on she makes some comment like "maybe you should have tried harder" or some such BS on of her famous tag lines.  In the background I get to hear Karissa echo  "Yeah daddy maybe you should have tried harder"  Maybe it is me but if I am not mistaken right then and their Lisa is commiting another act of contempt.  Carrying on this discussion in front of Karissa.   I know this woman is doing everything she can to run me out of my daughters life.  It is only a matter of time before her psychotic ass snaps and does who knows what kind of harm to my little girl.  Meanwhile the court just lets shit slide like its cool.    If I did have the stuff this woman has I would be the reenactment of OJ in the white for Bronco but not mother of the year!!
