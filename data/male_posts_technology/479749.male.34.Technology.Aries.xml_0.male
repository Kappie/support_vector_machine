So where is the story so far?  - 33 years old  - Married 3 years - First son born on April 29 which is also my wedding day - work as a software quality analyst at a large library collective - Dad died Dec 12, 2002 at age 54  - estanged from Mom, Sister and brother in-law over money  And that's about it from the 100,000 foot view. Of course things get stickier the closer you get to the surface.
