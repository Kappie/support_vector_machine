So much for contextual advertising ;-)   urlLink   The Skeptics Society  provides a wonderful  remedy for the above kind of brain damage, as does  urlLink The Foundation for Critical Thinking  and   urlLink      Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal  which carries a great article on  urlLink The Evolution of Creationism .    I really appreciate this except from  the book  urlLink Why DO People Believe Weird Things?  (pp. 275-278, please excuse the flagrant plagiarism):        Credo consolans:  I believe because it consols me.    Simplicity:  Pseudoscientific beliefs are simpler and easier to understand  than scientific ones.    Immediacy:  Pseudoscience offers immediate gratification and hope.    Morality and Meaning:  Science does not offer moral messages and answers to our questions about the meaning of our existence. Superstitions give us answers to these ultimate questions.    Hope Springs Eternal:  ALL humans, skeptics and scientists included, look to the future for a better life and world, and the siren song of pseudoscience and superstition is hard to resist.  Oh, and  urlLink An Index to Creationist Claims  might also be interesting to some.
