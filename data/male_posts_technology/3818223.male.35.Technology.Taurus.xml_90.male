They begin to die one at a time.  I'm not sure how it turned out since I got bored and stopped it halfway through. - 2 out of 5 stars   urlLink Runaway Jury :  a strong cast playing mostly unsympathetic characters adds a lot of tension to this thriller.  Very little time is actually spent in court.  I never read the book, but this feels closer to a Grisham courtroom thriller than the other hack jobs I've seen.  Right at the end, however, it suddenly turns a little too cuddly. - 3.5 out of 5 stars
