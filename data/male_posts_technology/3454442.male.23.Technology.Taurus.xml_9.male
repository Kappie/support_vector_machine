Now JP you will argue that the Commission is a waste but I would like to share with you what appears first on the website"   "The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, an independent, bipartisan commission created by congressional legislation and the signature of President George W. Bush in late 2002, is chartered to prepare a full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, including preparedness for and the immediate response to the attacks. The Commission is also mandated to provide recommendations designed to guard against future attacks."    "created by congressional legislation and the signature of President George W. Bush in late 2002"   indicated to me that this is a product of the current Administration.  Sure you want to tell me that the commission is worthless, but it wasnt that worthless when the 9/11 commission was coming down on Clinton people, particularly Dick Clarke, the man who holds all administrations from Reagan on responsible and if you read all accounts of the day of 9/11, managed the crisis itself from the White House situation room.  The point of this ramp is this, the dumbest person in any classroom we ever shared is still smarter than the smartest person on the street.  The American public is not educated enough to realize these hard facts.  The fact is the American public was mislead.  There is substantial evidence and intelligence that says we shoudl have started a war in Iraq (killing his own people, evil dictator, etc.).  However those reason were never stated - rather the "WMD and al-Qaeda/Iraqi links" were drilled into the minds of America.  Now those same Americans are finding that their sons and daughters are dying in a war that is now over (according to Bush himself on 5 May 2003).    It is at points downright embarrassing that the public was mislead so much when the guidelines of the UN that were set in place for inspection were in fact finding the same things we are finding almost 2 years later, nothing.
