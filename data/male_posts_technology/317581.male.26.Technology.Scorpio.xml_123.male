I asked him what he thought about Timmay and him saying that he was French and had all sorts of women after him and all, and you know what he refused to talk and in fact looked a little confused.  I think he was interested in the bacon I had in my hands.  It's beyond me how Tim got all that stuff out of him when all I could get was a "ruff".  Pierre is so cute...
