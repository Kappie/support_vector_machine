I love how they make the game trippy at random moments. Like, for this one boss, you had to switch your controller to socket two. And one time, this mind reading guy was like "You LOVE nintendo games, don't you, snake? Action games, even."...It's a fucking sweet game. Any game where you can hide in a box is sweet.
