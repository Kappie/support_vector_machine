"Can one at this time conclude with certainty that these weapons don't exist?", Le Monde's Mouna Naïm quotes issue 1 (volume 69) of Politique Étrangère as asking. "No, answer WMD specialists and experts in articles published in the latest issue of the quarterly review".  Mainly because, first of all, for 11 years, from 1991 to 2003, the Iraqi régime never stopped lying in one respect or another; and, furthermore, numerous questions asked by the disarmament teams, which operated in Iraq under the umbrella of Unscom until 1998 and under that of Unmovic from late November 2002, remain unanswered. …  Tim Trevan, spokesman for, and former advisor to the executive director of, the UN's special commission on Iraq, … uncovers other examples of crude lies, put forward by some of Iraq's most senior leaders. More worrisome is the ambiguity that Iraq deliberately maintained on the upkeep of the WMD weapons. …   Thérèse Delpech, an advisor at the Centre d'Études et Recherches Internationales and a Unmovic commissioner reminds us of certain elements in Unmovic's report of March 6, 2003. "The inspectors were never able to check what happened to 3.9 tons of VX … In March 2003, Unmovic concluded that very likely, there still existed 10,000 liters of anthrax that Iraq had not destroyed." …   The same questions remain unanswered concerning the Al-Samud-2 missiles, the 6,256 bombs that Iraq finally admitted not having used in its war against Iran, 550 artillery shells which are still said to be missing, and some thirty biological bombs.…   Now, isn't that interesting? And mightn't that information warrant being set somewhere on, or near, the front page? And would that not demand a special story all for itself, instead of falling within the review of a sister publication?  Well, in ordinary circumstances, the answer would be, Yes, absolutely; you bet your cotton-picking a**. But you have to remember here, that we are dealing with the world's number 1 enemy, the most horrible threat to world peace, the most treacherous of societies the planet has ever come across. Whom are we speaking of? But l'Amérique, bien sûr, its horrifying capitalism, and its despicable leaders.   -quoted from  urlLink eriksvane.com
