So now it is a matter or deciding which surgery option to take. It sounds like surgery will give a good chance of getting rid of it permanently, which is good, so please pray that God will work mightily in this situation. Our God is an awesome God, and can do all things.    This and That  "That shirt I'm wearing is like this shirt you are wearing." Sound wrong? Well at Greek class we learnt about near and far prepositions like that or this. It's something that I had never thought about before, but knew when I heard it done wrong (as above). It was kinda weird to think about it actually.    Snippets from Evidence Magazine No.6   urlLink Maxim Institute   Some of you may not realise that at current birth and immigration rates, the NZ population will peak in 2044 at about 4.64 million, and then start declining. Mainly due to the fact that people aren't having enough children. We are not even replacing our population, and are only growing because of immigration. (What happened to the be fruitful and multiply? Are we selfishly disobeying God's commandment?)  From an article about NZ's population time bomb:-   "......The 16,410 abortions in 2001 alone are equivalent to the current population of towns like Tokoroa or Ashburton. Put another wat, they represent 607 classrooms each containing 27 children who will not be starting primary school in 2006."  "Australian National University demographer Peter McDonald puts it down to the effects of gender equality. 'If women are provided with opportunitiesnearly equivalent to men in education and market employment, but these opportunities are severely curtailed by having children, then, on average, women will restrict the number of children that they have to an extent which leaves fertility at a precariously low long-term level.' "  "The Institute fo Economic Research's April report last year warned: "An older, less productive population will be a principle cause of a downward trend in economic growth."  So much for the rubbish about overpopulation.    Speaking Out   urlLink Dan  is hacked off with Maori claims. he speaks out... a little apologetically, but speaks out nonetheless, and it is good to have him back blogging again!   Lately in the Herald, I have noticed a disturbing trend. When people write in from a Christian, or right perspective, others reply saying that the Herald should not print such letters. I believe we will see our freedom of speech lost unless we fight to protect it.   Why do we feel scared as the Christian right/conservative to speak our mind about things? It is because we are slowly but surely being cowed into submission by what is 'politically correct' and for fear of being branded. Well enough already! We have a right to say what we think, just as much as the hand wringing, pot smoking, sandle wearing sections of the population. And I for one am sick of pretending I agree with people by not saying things like they need to be said.   Homosexuality is an utter peversion of God's intentions for sex. It is disgusting. An affair is adultery, and falls into the same category. The people who voted for the prostitution reform bill are godless, and need to repent, or they will face God's eternal wrath. Radical Maori need to pull their heads in, and work for a living like the rest of the country instead of bleating on about past injustices, when 7/8 of their ancestory was on the side commiting the injustice. Maori and Pacific Islanders do not deserve to get into university on lower grades than people from other cultures. This is racism. People who murder do not need counselling or rehabilitation.  People who use welfare as a matter of choice need a kick up the jacksy, and deserve to starve.   I am fed up with the rubbish we have to put up with in this country, and I will not remain silent about it.  How dare people turn this country into a God-forsaken place. Christians arise!   (I do not apologise for this post and will not bow to political correctness. I am entitled to my views, and you are entitled to disagree with me. But do not ask me not to say these things. it is my right of free speech.) God bless New Zealand!
