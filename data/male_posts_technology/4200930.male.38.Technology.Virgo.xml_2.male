I’ve won on this show before earlier in the year and just by luck was entering today and only got 6 out of 50 successful entries in when I got the ‘call-back’. Its just incredible what can be waiting just around the corner for you when Lady Luck smiles at you! I thought WOW that I had won some envelopes first thing this morning but this caps it off just nicely; just need tomorrows win to come in now.  It was only the week before last I was thinking that the month of August for wins was a bit of a wash out; it may have got off to a late start but boy is it coming up trumps now!  Thank you oh great god of comping
