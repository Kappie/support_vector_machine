I mean I was thinking about this last night as I drifted off to bed and I was thinking how little sense 'how come' means. I mean, really, where did it come from?   How come we can use 'how come'? or why don't we just use 'why'? or why do we use 'how come'? How come we don't use 'why'?  weird, 4 sentances with basically the same meaning...  HOW COME?!?!?!
