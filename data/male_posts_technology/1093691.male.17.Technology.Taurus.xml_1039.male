I've just been exceptionally tired, ill, and so exhausting I come home from school and collapse, and I am getting up so incredibly early to use my light box now, I have hardly any spare time. Oh the joys of being a student/cashier at safeways. At least they pay me lots, and I'm getting a new phone! It's contract, £13.99 a month with 50 free texts amd 750 free minutes, and it's a Nokia 6100! Wahey! I'm excited. Are you?
