But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God.   21To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. 22"He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth."  23When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.  He entrusted himself to him who judges justly, even in the midst of toil and trouble.  Quite an example, that Jesus guy.  And in the midst of guilty people condeming the most innocent, he entrusted himself to a higher purpose and calling.  It's so good when Scripture comes alive in the midst of personal circumstances, isn't it?  How often we don't believe that the Bible is really a magical book.
