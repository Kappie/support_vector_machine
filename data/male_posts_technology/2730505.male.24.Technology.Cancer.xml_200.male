Though I don't literally believe in the leteral translation of the Holy Book, I just think it's a little eerie to have  urlLink this  sort of stuff start happening already.  666 and all that shit.  Yikes!     urlLink This  is already in use in this country.  sure they're trying it with Animals but soon enough, it'll be small enough and self propagating (like replicators in Stargate SG-1) they're going to be making themselves and keeping trak of everyone.  They'll know when you take a shit or pick a fucking booger out of your left nostril, or...well we won't go into that "adult oriented stuff"  Pretty soon they can count how many beers you had in a year and be able to market you shit...wow, I am just rambling now.  anyways, back to work.
