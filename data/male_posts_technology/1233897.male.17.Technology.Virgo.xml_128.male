Not like the woman of my dreams. And her hair's not quite as long as I had planned.  Five foot three isn't tall. She's not the girl I pictured at all. In those paint by number fantasies I've had,  So it took me by complete surprise. When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes. She's not at all what I was looking for. She's more.  No it wasn't, at first sight, But the moment I looked twice. I saw the woman I was born to love.  Her laughter fills my soul, And when I hold her I don't wanna let go. When it comes to her I can't get enough.  So it took me by complete surprise. When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes. She's not at all what I was looking for. She's more.  More than I dreamed of, More than any man deserves. I couldn't ask for more than a love like hers.  So it took me by complete surprise, When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes. She's not at all what I was looking for. She's more.  (hehe... Gwen has green eyes.)   Was That My Life?  - Jo Dee Messina   Ooooh.  I don't want to be the one who's old before their time, And lose the wonder that I felt as a child. I can't run this race believing I might lose; There's still so much to see, and so much left to do. Yes, I'll fall before I fly, But no one can say I never tried.  Oh, we just get one ride around the sun, In this dream of time. It goes so fast that one day we look back, And we ask: was that my life?   I close my eyes and think how lucky I have been, To hold the ones I love and share my dreams with them. All those sunny days and all those starry skies: Good morning kisses and sweet goodnights. Oh, I can't tell them enough, Just how much that they are loved.  Oh, you just get one ride around the sun, In this dream of time. It goes so fast that one day we look back, And we ask: was that my life?   We just get one ride around the sun, In this dream of time. It goes so fast that one day we look back, And we ask: oh, was that my life? Ooh, was that my life rollin' on by? Oooh, rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' on by. Was that my life? Ooooh, was that my life?
