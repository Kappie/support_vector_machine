I might be able to get Rennisance to sponsor LAN2, and I have plans for LAN3 to be a 2-day event! This time, (LAN2) will be hosted in the basement and the main floor. Pisses me off that I have to use my laptop's dock for 100 Megabit Ethernet, because I don't want to do it wireless. Oh, and we're getting a 5-port switch and from Steve, we get a 24-port managed hub and all the network cable we can eat! (Sort of.) Games this time around will be Half-Life, AoEII, BF: 1942, NFS, and Medal of Honor series. So, again, like with Lan Party,  urlLink E-Mail me! This includes Karine and JaQ if they want to come. They also get waived the fee for being PTH'ers. Oh, and if Krystynana even exists, you'd better fucking email me unless you want to get the shit kicked out of you twice in one day.
