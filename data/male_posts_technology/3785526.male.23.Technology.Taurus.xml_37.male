My fear is towards `responsibility`. Can i handle it? Remember the most responsibility i have handled is assemble my PC.  I remember, we always joke on the management guys. Like  "Do they know anything except Excel?" "What do u think they really do? I mean really do." "Do they have development environment on their PC?" "Why? They always get the praises. They didnt write even a line of code." "Q: Hey, in Excel how do we....?     A: Stop right there. No developers know Excel. Go to a GL or PM." "We work our ass off, and this GLs and PMs can surf all the porn..." And many other short stories on monkeys, assholes and hot air are written on the mystical profession that is the Project Management and they failed to put a smile on our face. Although i havent opened Excel yet, i already feel like im in the middle of all those jokes. I dont think i can open Excel at all. It is going to be harder than quiting cigerette.  I was never a peoples person. Maybe that why i took to computers so well. They are easy to understand and a lot easier to control. People on the other hand are enigmatic and unpredictable. Agreed that sometimes computer do behave eratic, but at least they are consistent at it. While i can handle a mean Pentium IV, 3GHz with 1GB RAM and 17" flat screen, i go weak when im asked "When do u think the coding will be completed by ur group?".   P.S: Sorry readers, i really thought i'll forgo my complex and write something sensible and informative here. But i learned that im only good in self-humility. Guess it my style.
