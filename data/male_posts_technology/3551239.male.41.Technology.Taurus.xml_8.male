She, like me, was hoping that all of this chaos might bring the two of them closer rather than farther apart...but even Virginia reminded me that absence makes the heart grow fonder. I hope so for both of them. I know I certainly miss my Virginia, but hopefully once all this mess dies down, she'll fly up for the weekend and we can catch up on some stargazing.  Oh, and someone asked me the other day about the titles for my posts here...I would think it would be obvious, but I do admire Shakespeare, he always put things so eloquently. So, I found this interesting site that has some of his quotes and when I put in the general feeling or idea that I have as a keyword, out pops quotes dealing with that word. Let's see if anyone can guess what was on my mind for this one ...
