Went to Hoshiarpur, Punjab where my parents stay 2. Ate and Slept (pure luxury) and the loop kept repeating 3. Caught with few family friends 4. Enjoyed a 10 hour drive (one way) from Delhi and back with good roads and drive through the fields of Punjab 5. Had a severe stomach ache but still kept on gorging on food 6. Saw "Main Hoon Na" in the nice little home theatre at home 7. Played with children in the house 8. Went shopping with mom and sisters in the little markets of Hoshiarpur with Surdi shopkeepers.. was surprised at the number of "Western Union" money transfer outlets.. thanks to the numerous punjabis working abroad 9. Went out on Mom's birthday on 23rd and had great Dinner at Shiraz (one of the good hotels in Hoshiarpur)  i should put holidays in my calendar at a regular interval.. i think that will keep me GOING... ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.
