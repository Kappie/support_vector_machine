Is it her way of saying that I haven't really done as well as I thought I had. or one of those "if you can do it" "I can do it better"  I can't help but wonder what her plans are??  Is she planning on starting a Mother and Son Consultancy  Is She after my Job???? How embarrassing would it be for her to apply for your Job and get it What if she proves to be much better than you were how would you face your old work colleagues again Maybe that's it  "She wants my Job!!"  OMG What should I do??  Is it time to get the holiday Pictures of her in that orange swim suit that she had hoped had gone missing and post them all over the Works Network "I knew I would need them some day"  All Joking aside!!  Well done Mum I'm Proud of ya!!  P.S. Toaster  you can't say your mother didn't warn you that staring at woman's breast's all day would make you go blind!!
