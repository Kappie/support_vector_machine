 I am a big fan of  urlLink News.com , but they really miss the boat on some very simple functionality that they never seem to incorporate into their stories.  Where is the freaking link to  urlLink HP.com  ? They always link contextually to other stories within News.com, but they never link to what they are talking about within the story. They have been doing this for years. I always have to do a Google search to find the site or company that the article is discussing. I know the pain is minor, but considering how simple it would be for them to add these "off site" links they should do it. This story really brought my annoyance to the breaking point. Here the article is all about a site's redesign, but they never even link you to it. Arrrghh ... end of rant.
