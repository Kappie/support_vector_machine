But luckily after practice my wrist still feel fine so Iguess the discomfort was only momentary. There were 2 new white belts as well. They were pretty friendly guys but I'm not very sure how old they are or what do they do. They were quite chatty amongst the 2 of themselves but still pleasant when training with them. Felt that they kept an open mind during class so they were quite receptive about everything in general.  I'll be attending the combined training at Tanglin CC tomorrow with Ueshiba Aikido. Like Sensei had said, 'it's been too luxirious for us' because we're so used to having so much space in training that we fall all over the mat space available. Training in a cramped and crowded environment wll help build an awareness during ukemi (and not kill someone by landing on top of them), as well as more control over how and where we're falling.
