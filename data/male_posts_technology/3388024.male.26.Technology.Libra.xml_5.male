I wasn’t to sure how I felt about that, but it saved $25 and they said we could bring it back anytime in the next 30 days if we weren’t happy with it.    Daen opened it up in the car, and as it turns out the previous owner has left some charge in the battery and 25 gigs of music on the hard disk.  Now I know all people are weird, and I’m sure to outsiders my personal music library would seem rather odd, but this was like super or even mega odd.  It was a mix of N’sync, Backstreet Boys, Bob Marley, Aerosmith, some Christian stuff, Ace of Base, and a whole bunch of Romanian stuff.  Who knew Romania had music??  Hmm, if this was a Simpson’s episode I think it would go like this:  Strange Guy: I’ve got N’Sync or Romanian? Bob Marley: Ewwww… give me some Romanian.
