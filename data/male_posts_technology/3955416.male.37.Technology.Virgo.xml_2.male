I know that I will be sitting down and sorting alot of stuff to get it on the PC soon. I hope to do this over the winter. I also want to get a server built to house the growing collection of pics we have. Katrine is taking alot of pictures. The house is starting to seem empty with alot of things packed. I liked the house but it never had the feeling of a Home. I hope that after all has settled down in September we can make the place feel like Home.
