I started on a level 7 wall, moved on to 8, and struggled very hard on a level 9 before calling it quits. All this under the expert supervision of my colleague El and one of her rock-climbing buddies, Antonio. Always nice to have good teachers when starting out on something new....  I'm very sore right now. Arms feel like someone's holding them down. Can't clench fingers and form a fist anymore. Considering that I will be learning how to ride a motorcycle at 7 in the morning tomorrow, I'm not sure if this was such a good decision.  But at least I had a great time. I have to go back and finish off the annoying level 9 wall sometime. But belay lessons first!  Ow. Hands hurt. Enough typing. Bed time.
