All I've ever seen are bits and pieces aired on other mostly comedic shows, for example,  urlLink The Daily Show . These are rarely meant to offer a positive view of Fox. The result is that my view already before viewing this film was that Fox is a right-wing spouting network.  And that is main the premise of the movie.  The problem isn't that Fox is slanted towards republican views. There are newspapers that state their political view on the cover so that when you read them you know to use whatever filter you wish to. The problem is that Fox claims it's objective with slogans such as "we report, you decide" and shows called "Fair  Balanced".  The movie itself isn't fair and balanced either, but then again it doesn't claim to be either. One of its producers are  urlLink MoveOn.org , an organisation actively working to make sure President Bush is not re-elected.  -->
