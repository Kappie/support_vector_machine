In the main and most interesting story, a young man wanders the streets penitentially tied to his girlfriend who he drove to madness and attempted suicide by briefly deserting her for a richer woman.  The movie is very slow - very little happens in the course of it. Still, you feel for the main characters and want them to find happiness. -->
