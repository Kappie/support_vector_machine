My muscles don't remember how to play  at all .  I left the court dripping with sweat, and I could feel each individual muscle fiber twitching.  So anyway, I went to Coffee Station, conviently located a short walk away from my apartment complex, and got a lime/passion fruit Italian soda.  Bar none, the best Italian soda flavor combination you can get, in case you wanted to know.  interlude I just got a surpise phone call from a girl whom I spent a summer - there was a little troupe of us; those were good people.  Looks like she's still in College Station, and presumably we're going to go to her church on Sunday and then go bar hopping - hey, I'm just passing along what she said. /interlude  Ok, I'm sitting outside and looking at the stars.  I started thinking about how photons are ejected from these massive fusion reactions thousands of light years away.  These photons travel across the vast gulf of space and terminate on the back of my retina.  And then I think, surely this is profound, but it's not.  Profound is the hard work a certain person is putting into a certain relationship.  Stars have nothing on her.
