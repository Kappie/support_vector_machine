The other day I noticed that Skype.com has made a version of its windows telephony software for Linux, the site states that the high amount of demand for a Linux version was the reason.  Also on Slashdot I read that Real Player is going to make Realplayer 10 for Linux.  Novell and RedHat have already announced that it will be installed by default on their future distros.  And forget about Microsoft Excel, a new Excel clone called PlanMaker has been released, and is said to be better at running Excel documents than OppenOffice, of course for a small fee of $49.95.  I've just been seeing all sorts of new software for Linux here lately.  The writing's on the wall, Linux is here to stay.  And it's about time, with Linux numbers at or above that of Macs; commercial developers have to notice the Mighty Penguin. I just hope the trend continues, my biggest wish is that the gaming industry will wise up and start making more video games available that run on Linux natively. I also wish Apple would recognize Linux and start making its software available to Linux like QuickTime and iTunes.  It couldn't be hard, Mac OSX is UNIX based like Linux.  Anyway, enough of that for now, if you know of any newly available Linux apps let me know.  Until next time...
