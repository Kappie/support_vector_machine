If France, Germany, or Russia wish to pony up their own money to reconstruct things and get their contractor's to do so, then let them.  But, as I understand the basis of their arguements, they are upset that we won't let their contractor's bid on projects being paid for with US (and maybe UK?) money.  Mir - Some?  Yes.  Enough to do the job in the near future?  Doubtful.  In my dealing with Contractor's, I have found most of them to be so tight that they squeak and that they claim not to have two pennies to rub together.  So, odds are, except for management and certain ultraskilled positions, they will probably hire Iraqi's to do alot of the work as a cost savings method.  If you bring over your American crews, you need to pay much more (travel and housing) versus using someone local.  I hope and think that most contractor's will do that (see, greed is not always bad)  As far as the medical question goes, your conservative comment seems to imply that you think only conservatives are rich and powerful.  I recall a survey, several years old now, that was looking at the net worth of U.S. Senators.  You might be surprised to learn that there were more Democratic millionaires than Republican.  I honestly don't remember if was a 45 to 40 thing or a 10 to 5, but that is not my point.  There are quite a few rich powerful liberals that aren't champoining these causes either.  Also, do you think that no research is being done on either of the two diseases you specifically mentioned?  Angie can correct me here if I am wrong, but I think that fibro was only recently (last 3-5 years) actually classified as a disease.  I don't think you can expect too much research on a disease most doctors don't know even exists.  I would expect that research is underway now.  As for autisim, I know that research is being done.  There has been some recent finding that some medium used to prepare or administer childhood vaccinations has a mercury compound in it.  There appears to be some connection between the that and autism.  It must be a recent finding, because in 2000, nothing was said about this to us when Katherine got her immunizations, but everytime we get a shot for the twins, it is included in the information given to us.  It does make me ask the question, what is worse - losing your child to mumps, rubella, or polio or having them permanenetly disabled by the prevention?  That's not a choice I really want to make.  Keep in mind that there is only one pot of money for medical research, currently provided by both the public and private sector.  That money has to be divided up amongst AIDS, cancer, MS, heart disease, paralysis and a myriad of other diseases/conditions that I did not mention.  I have much more faith in the private sector to get the most out of this finite pot of money than I do the government.  I have worked for the government and currently work with government programs.  The bureaucratic BS and innefficiencies are maddening.  Money is held up because a form was not filled out 100% correctly or because some Congressman has not had his chance to make a press release about getting the money for his district.  At least with the private sector, they want to get breakthroughs so they can get the return on their investment.  It really is sad that someone is going to benefit from someone else's suffering, but I can't think of a better motivator, since there are very few people in this world who are solely devoted to the relief of suffering (like Mother Teresa was).
