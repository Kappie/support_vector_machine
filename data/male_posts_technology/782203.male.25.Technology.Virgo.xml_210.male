My colleagues are even starting to make fun of me, saying I am his pet and stuff like that. He is a nice guy but he just makes me nervous leh and I feel really uncomfortable around him . Hope this feeling doesn't last long.  Alright I just watched Friends and Scrubs just now and was too tired to laugh even. Gonna go to bed now....eh wait maybe surf some porn first.
