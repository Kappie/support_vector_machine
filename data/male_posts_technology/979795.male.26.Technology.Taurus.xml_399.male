Now, for the show, I gotta say it developped rather nicely as a thriller. I think this show falls under the action genre. But I think it holds about 40-50% thriller too. I'm kept guessing and anticipating what the robot(s) will try to do. And the reason for why robots attacked humans only came to light towards the end or so.  All these about machines taking over mankindv comes down to a simple reasoning. Matrix, Terminator, I,Robot, etc all focus on human beings as irresponsible 'masters' of earth who don't take up the responsibility of taking care of the environment we live in. We are able to pursue such an irresponsible way of live only because we are at the top of the food chain... for now. But each of these apocalyptic-sci-fi-machine-killing-humans type of shows us that as soon as machines evolves to a state where they are able to look at things from a 3rd point of view, humans would naturally be categorised as parasites, bacteria, germs (as how Agent Smith would descibe human beings). We simply take things for granted. I doubt any of us respect any machines in our lives now. Just look at how some of the users treat the computers now. Not shutting down properly, knocking the system unit when it's slow, etc. Granted, I myself find it difficult for me to respect something like the typewriter too.  I really believe that is most probably the direction human kind is heading. Where we do R in AI, with the hope of simulating human emotions and reactions in machines. As soon as that state is achieved, machines WILL behave like humans. We can see that war, crimesand violence are very much a part of human history. As soon as machines starts emulating humans, what's to stop them from making this happen? NOTHING. No safety feature, no regulation, nothing can stop this. We can put in Rules to govern the way a machine thinks. But as soon as any 'living' being evolves enough, having developed reasoning, they are able to make choices; choices to do good, bad, right and wrong. They will easily develop perceptions, and each is subjected to an individual's idealogy as well as things you see, feel and experience.  My point? I dunno, but worrying about what hasn't come to passed is definitely not it. Maybe the simple answer to everything is that each and everyone one of us living on Mother Earth should start protecting respecting everything we see as though it's the last day of our lives. Nature, environment, things we use daily. (The Japanese respected their sword as a living thing.) But how many of us will do this? I'm not sure I'm able to discipline myself to do this consciously either. Maybe human kind IS doomed afterall.
