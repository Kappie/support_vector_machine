Some of the things I like about this series is that is has great díalogue - witty and funny making me laugh out loud at least five times each episode. It has characters you care about and continuity - things happening in one episode has repercussions in later episodes. Another thing it's really good at is displaying the same scene from different points of view, when parts of a conversation have one meaning in the first perspective but when overheard from the second perspective it gets a completely different and often very funny meaning. It frequently has people doing/saying stupid things and then waits for them to be found out, something I normally try to avoid as I don't like that kind of comedy. I think my dislike for such scenes comes from my childhood when I, having been caught doing something, heard words to the effect of "I'm going to tell your parents". This would instantly tie a knot in my stomach which would remain there until my parents had been informed of my transgressions and I had been lectured/punished accordingly. But, despite Coupling's use of these type of scenes I still like them, mainly because they're so damn funny - I find myself watching them being played out with a kind of morbid fascination.       -->
