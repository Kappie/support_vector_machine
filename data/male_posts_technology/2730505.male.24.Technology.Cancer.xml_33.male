The subs were a little off according to Meghan but it was close enough to get the movie.  It was about a randomly selected class (7th grade I think, if I remember correctly) that was "kidnapped" and put on an abandoned island where they are supposed to kill each other.  Yeah messed up.  I guess the youth in this movie were just a bunch of delinquents and they were chosen at "random" to bet shipped off to the island because it was some sort of government act or something (Battle Royal Act).  Very bloody and cheesily graphic.  I thought it was good but I doubt that your local Blockbuster will be carrying the damn thing.  Saturday was the car show.  Pretty cool.  I saw what I wanted to see.  Meghan was a little lost and intimidated (HA! :-P ) but we got to see a bunch of cars and hang out with Derek and Carmie as well as Vicki and Freddy.  Had some drinks at the place chillin, looking at cars.  Saleen S7 was gorgeous.  Porsches were beatiful and the 2004 S2000 was just sitting there aching to be driven.  They didn't have the top of the line trim for the G35 so I didn't bother sitting in it.  I also liked the 04 Audi S4.  BMW had a sexy red M3 on display.  Acura had a beautifully painted 2004 TL.  It was gray with silver glitter type paint, it's kinda hard to describe.  Body kit and everything.  I would have liked to have taken a bunch of pictures but someone (Meghan) forgot to bring the freakin camera and I wasn't about to use my camera phone.  I didn't get to see the freaking new Mustang though, there were just too many people around it and I really didn't want to deal with them.  Top 5 cars that I want that I can get in the next 5 years 5. BMW 330 Ci 4. Honda S2000 3. Subaru WRX STI 1. Infiniti G35 Coupe 1. Acura TL  Yeah it's a damn tie.  Honda vs. Nissan again  After the car show we drove to go catch the fireworks display that was being held at the corner of Michigan Ave and the Chicago River.  We made it but the damn bus prevented the viewing so, instead, we watched it as a bunch of reflections off the Wrigley Building.  Japan 77 was the next stop.  Good food, highly recommended.  Our chef was little lame because he didn't have the flair that the other chefs had but the food was cooked good.  Vicki graciously let us stay at her place and her dad cooked breakfast for everyone.  It was good.  I was full.  My mother came back from the Philippines and got me a bunch of stuff as well as a bunch of movies.  Meghan ate "chocolate soup" I was impressed she even ate some after I told her what it was.  Crazy chick.  Took her back to EL she did her homework and I watched TV it was nice.  Just hanging out no pressures no nothing.  It felt good.  She got done with homework and we ate and then that's where I leave everyone else at.  Hah!  Oh, well I can say "bonk" ;-)  Anyways at work now, nice drive from EL to work, it got kinda busy around Indiana but everyone was calm, no one had road rage, I was just chillin to the sounds of Ghetto Cowboy by Bone Thungs and some old Goo Goo Dolls, Beatles, the old Cds that I made back in the day.  Yeah...  You - I something you 'n stuff  Have a great day people.
