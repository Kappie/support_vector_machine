If all goes well, we should be moving to Medford during February.  Sometime i'll put up some pics of the new place.   Its a townhouse condo in a nice neighborhood in medford right next to Arlington.     It is about a block away from the Mystic River, which should provide for nice walking and biking scenery.  We are certainly dreading the move itself (who wants to pack boxes!), but we couldnt be more excited to move into a place of our own.  At the moment we are waiting on the lawyers to complete the Purchase and Sale agreement, which wil hopefully be this week, though with the holidays who knows.
