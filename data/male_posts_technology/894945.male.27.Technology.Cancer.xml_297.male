I'm surprised we actually got the flight over as we were being told several times to "calm down" and "settle" by a school-teacher like member of the Auringy ground crew. Even though they made us 45 mins late. Fuckers! So we eventually arrived and got in all the gear, the actual 60's party itself was Ok but the PA sucked ass and the Elvis impersonator didn't know any of the lyrics to "A little less conversation.." which I found criminal. But I also found a pair of slinky white panties on the stage so it wasn't all bad.  We Steve McQueen'd it about an hour later and headed down to Guernsey's Follies. It's split into two levels and is pretty cool, it wasn't sardines like ours either. We had stupid amounts of shots, tequila and apple sours, blahhh.. the bar staff in that club are supermodels. I'm getting my camera done which will hopefully have some great pics of those gorgeous ladies on it. I found love in the shape of a 30 something business-suited tattooed lady, I must have been emitting some kind of mystical birthday pheromone as she had her tongue down my throat (or was it the other way around) in about five seconds of meeting her. Awesome.  We eventually high-tailed it outta there at about 12, and went over to  urlLink Club 54 . 54 was pretty busy, and it's a wierd shaped club. I felt a little like Alice in wonderland with all the different levels of flooring, but hey, I was pretty pissed.  We quickly sniffed out a "VIP" section at the top, and tried every trick in the book to secure entry but it wasn't going to happen, a cold hearted and very business like lady bouncer wasn't having any of it:  Me: "It's my birthday" Her: "That's nice" Me: "Can I go in, as it's my birthday?" Her: "No." Me: "Can I have a hug?" Her: "Go away."  Loverat and the Scandal got champange for all of us and then things start to get a bit hazy...  I remember being handed a burger by Gristo at some greasy spoon (then disappearing with some girl.. he's got the moves!!!) , and Iots of singing, doing a few laps of the town centre and that's about it...  So mission successful, Guernsey has some good clubs and great girlies.  Here's  urlLink Scott's pictures of the night , mine will be up soon.  Then next day (despite serious hangovers) we went to an awesome little shop called  urlLink Gaia's Web .  They have some sweet clothes and lots of wierd bits, go check it out.
