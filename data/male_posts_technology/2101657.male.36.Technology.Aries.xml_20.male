I went to bed early Saturday, around 9:30pm. Getting old sucks.   Sunday after getting a decent nights sleep, I still had that tell-tale pressure in my right temple.  Well, about 4pm, the oldest and I went on a run to the store as we needed cat litter, chocolate moo, and ice cream.  Stupid me didn't wear sunglasses, so the late afternoon sun was beaming me right in the eyes most of the way home.  That was enough to push  my migraine button  the rest of the way.  About 5, I took 1000mg of ibuprofen (sorry if it's misspelled, hate the word anyway lol), and one of my migraine meds.  About 5:30 I decided it was time to lay down. My wife Z*lda asked if there was anything she could do, and I asked her to call the ER. One of the guys at work gets migraines and he has his wife take him to the ER, where they give him a shot of demeral, and 30minutes later, he's out and not having to experience the pain.  Well, she called the Ask-oh-nurse, and was connected to a hospital in Des Moines.  The lady sounds like she went down her little chart, sounding like she was agreeing with Z*lda on everything, and I ended up staying home, and spent another 45minutes feeling like the vessels in my right temple were trying to escape from my body (felt like they almost made it too).    The nurse did say "if he throws up bring him in right away", which didn't make sense to me, as I almost ALWAYS throw up when I get a migraine.  Hell, it feels bad, but, it does seem to make it go away faster.  Why would they want me to come in only IF I puke?  Go Figure.    I'd of rather got the demeral shot.  I would of slept through the night. As it was, I woke up about 9pm, thought I felt ok, then about 30 seconds later, Mr. Migraine said FU and looked me in the eye again.  So I rolled over and went back to sleep.  Then I woke up about 11:45pm. Lights on in the living room, and the house was very quiet.  So I got up, since Mr Migraine had finally given up and me and went to beat mercelessly on someone else.  Z*lda was on the couch snoozing, but woke up right away.  Oldest boy was in his bed reading some of the AWESOME book Harry Potter 5.  Littlest boy was playing with transformers (I think) on the floor.   Got him to brush his teeth finally and crawl into bed (12:30AM. for being 7 he sure is a night owl).  I finally went back to bed, and go figure, it took me until 4:15am to get back to sleep.  Then to top it off, having some of the most odd-ball dreams ever. (can anyone say astronaught?)  Well, the old alarm clock went off at 6:45, and my "no freaking way" meter pegged out.  I got up, and got stuff organized as I had to take our pc into work, were I was doing some digitization of video. Must say, that is some way fun stuff!  Put in the full/busy day at work, and then at 6:20, went to school for my 1:15 of learning to program in Visual Basic.net.  This is going to be a very kewl programming language to learn.  My copy of Visual Studio (academic copy) has arrived at the book store, now to figure out how to pay for it, as I just learned I'm not taking enough credits for my student loans Tuesday to be accepted.  I'll get it figured out somehow.  Oh, to top it off on Monday? Mr. Migraine was back, trying to invade the left side of my head this time.  Sometime, I'm going to be a REALLY big stick and give him some of his own back.  At least I fended him off, and he didn't get the better of me.    So, after the long day at work, the long evening, I get home from school, and what do I do? Throw in the Hulk.  Z*lda took the boys down and rented video games, and they had The Hulk previously viewed for $10.  I'll write up a review to post another day. I have mixed feelings about it, both good and bad (coming from an old comic book collector)  So as Stan Lee would say,   Excelsior!
