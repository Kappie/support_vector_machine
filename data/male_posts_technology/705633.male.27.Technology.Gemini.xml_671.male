You are married to your mother's sister's neice.  3. You have one eyebrow stretching across both eyes and have to shave a gap in between.  4. You hate people from the 'other island' irrationally and passionately.  5. You think nothing of shelling out half a million for a 3 bedroom semi.  6. You are grateful when Chris de Burgh comes over to play to a packed Fort Regent of 40 somethings and find yourself swaying along to A Spaceman came Travelling.  7. You think that £965 for 2 adults and a car to France for a day return isn't too bad really.  8. You pull in £55k for a filing job in the Finance Industry and complain about the money.  9. You quite enjoy the spectacle of all the Scousers, Paddys and Jocks who fight in St. Helier on a Saturday night.  10. You start saying "Red sky at night, Guernsey's alight" and then laugh.  11. You say things like - "I'm not going all the way to St. Martins" (2 miles)  12. You have to get a taxi from Victoria Station to Oxford Circus because the funny map with the coloured lines makes you feel dizzy and you cant be arsed to wait for a train.   On an unrelated note it was a nice start of summer evening tonight, and a few of us here at TF were out for drinks after work.....  Where the hell was the rest of the island?  [)
