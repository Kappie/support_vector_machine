There is a massive fire just beyony my line of site, buildings etc in my way, however there has been a steady stream of thick greyish smoke billowong far across the city, soomething like a sceen from Iraq and do you think I can find out what the hell it is. on the net for over an hour trying any Irish news and radio sites and still can not find a dam this on what caused the fire or what was even on fire, I suppose I will get it on the evening news.  Not very impressed with how Irish companies have not yet invested in the Internet in any big way, oh well maybe there will be some improvements going forward,  (could even be a carrer change on the horizon :)  )  end of rant.
