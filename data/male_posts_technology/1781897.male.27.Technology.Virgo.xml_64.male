I wake up this morning in a pool of sweat...fever is gone, and I'm feeling like $678,912.33 (a million bucks after taxes). 2.  Talking to my mom Curley Sue on the horn, and she tells me the most bizarre thing.  A friend of my mom's that I've know since I was 8 tells her the other day that she has had a crush on me since I was in college.  She asks my mom "Does it bother you that I say that?"  Mom calmly replies "Don't tell Eric that, he'll fuck your brains out!"
