We played lots of games and watched lots of movies. Unlike most unemploywed bums:)  Well, I decided against giving plasma for the time being, mostly because I couldn't find anyone to go with me, but also because the state decided to give me a few extra dollars.   Well, I'm going to run. Have a great week! -T
