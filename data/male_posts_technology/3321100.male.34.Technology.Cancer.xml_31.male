So Let me give you his day's program of yesterday. 8:30 he woke up slowly from the sofa. 8:40 he finished my milk-coffee with 2 muffins 9:00 / 11:30 he played on the garden with Sony (a dog friend of him) 11:31 he saw the two of the neighbours  cats and jumped other the wall to kill them.  12:30 the neighbour who caught Foxy in his house with the two cats threw him into our garden. He had a lot of blood on his face, scratched by cats. 13:00 / 17:00 He played with Sony to kill a snake in the wood, and left the dead snake at front of our house 18:00 he played with his mom and dad (me and my wife) 20:00 he ate a lot and watched TV with us 21:00 he played in the garden and found a hedgehog. 21:45 he came back home with the dead hedgehog (4 th hedgehog this year) a lot of blood on his face and a lot of fleas (des puces tesa !) 22:00 / 23:00 he took a shower with me and didn't like it.  That's all, this dog is like a child to us, we really love him, but how can I explain to him that killing hedgehogs, snakes, and cats isn't a good thing ??? If someone speaks French dog language, could he help us ? PS: Before Foxy killed his first hedgehog, I though hedgehogs had a perfect defense system against all predators except car wheels. It seems fox-terrier was another danger for us. Sorry to all the hedgehog family living near our house. Really sorry, Keep Out, Mad Dog at home.  corrected by Mike da hat;) (Thanks a lot Mike)
