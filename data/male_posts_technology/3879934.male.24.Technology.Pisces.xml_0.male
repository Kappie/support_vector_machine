Then simply rely on our auto-complete feature to prefill all your addresses for you. liefe is becoming easy as that... Gmail now supports MAC OX`s 'Safari 1.2.1' plus you can now add your signature... But the most favourite feature that i love in gmail is "Shortcut keys and instant reply forward feature" come to think of it they are much faster than the desktop email applications... gmail is yet to rock!!!!
