I'm so behind...because of the play, I basically lost the month of September, so now I'm going all Nutty McNuts to catch up.    Oh, well.  There are many halloweens in my future during which I will get down and boogie oogie oogie.  Love the costume, Allen. :)  J and I were going to go as either Hef and a bunny or as a priest and a Catholic school girl (complete with cleavage and enormous lollipop)...next year, perhaps, when the world's spinning slows down a bit. :)
