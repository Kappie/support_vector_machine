The subject of the E-mail was something like “How people change” so when the first picture of a naked baby on a bed of rose petals appeared, I thought to my self, “Aww, its one of those soppy E-mails.” A few ponderous moments later and the second picture appeared of a woman on a bed of rose petals, who was quite evidently a natural blond…Unless she was very thorough with the peroxide. My thoughts at this where a mixture of “Better loosen my belt” “Thank god that my computer is in my bedroom” and “What a cool girl this is to have sent me pictures of naked women”. A few minutes had passed whilst I studied the artistic form of the prone subject when I realized that there was a third picture below it. I dually scrolled down, Tissues at the ready (I have a slight cold!!!) and the thoughts that went through my mind upon viewing the tertiary jpeg was a mixture of horror, revulsion and disgust. When I get that old I promise not to feature in any pornographic photo shoots!!!!  Anyway, Real world now. Went to the cinema in the first time in a while, Do not go to see “They”. Apart from some very clever tributes to old, proper, Suspense/horror movies (House, Psycho, American Werewolf in London) the film was ultimately crap, combining a modern day “Pitch Black” theme with a pointless excuse for modern day nightmares.  “Mr Deeds” on the other hand is worth some mindless humor in the same vein as “The Water boy” and “Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo”  Not an all time best film, such as “Starship Troopers”, “Fifth Element” or “Surf Nazis Must Die”, but still worth a look.  I realize why Brett loves working in the Sports Bar, I was in there Wednesday, Sober. (I know – Sober!) And I admire Brett’s ability to rub himself up against every woman in the place on a quest to find the elusive empty glass.  Feeling peckish,  urlLink Try ordering snacks over the Internet   Bored of that, Try your skills at  urlLink the great Welsh game  (game, as in game animal… gettit?)  Bored of that,  urlLink Jazz up your Jizz  with this.  Tastes so good I bought the company!!! Ok, if you didn’t like any of those, urlLink  I will kick your arse
