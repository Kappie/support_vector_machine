Every argument is based on some premises and some assumptions. There are no conclusions without any assumptions... it is always possible to completely bring down an argument. However it is so dificult to actually come up with an issue and see it through. There is ALWAYS a better way, there is ALWAYS something wrong. It is indeed dificult to scavenge through the talk and come up with a winner.
