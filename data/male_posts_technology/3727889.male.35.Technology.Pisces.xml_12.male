As some of my loyal readers may have noticed, I took 3rd last time for a nice $235 win to get me up to $950 again. This was very nice, since I had decimated my pot down to $615 while on a slight tilt playing levels I should not be in. Only one person gave me congrats on finishing 3rd in my first multi-tourney, so for him I am going to try a new feature tonight. I will update my Blog every30 minutes with my current standing, any interesting new, etc.. So you can see how Sir does if he lasts more than 30 minutes this time. I am going to use the old fashion method of winning one of these: Fold most of my hands until the 4th round, and then try and make some money. Anyway, keep tabs on this post tonight. If I get to play in this one I will try my hand at some live reporting.     *** Update: No Freeroll tonight. Sorry. The next freeroll for playing handsis in August sometime. Playing some NL again. Winning again. Up to $1086.
