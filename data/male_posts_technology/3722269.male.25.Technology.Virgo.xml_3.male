I'd like to have a whinge about optometrists... in particular kiwi optometrists. Until recently there was no legislation in New Zealand that said you had to be an optometrist to dispense contact lenses, only to diagnose vision deficiancies etc. This meant pretty much any Tom, Dick or RajaMo Sahd Fahtgna could sell them,  The advantage to the seller was pretty much cost price contact lenses. Woohoo! This meant contacts with an optometrist RRP of $140 per 3 pairs, were available at less than half that, $60 for 3 pairs. So we're getting -quite- screwed on price, because somehow they dont make enough charging $53 odd dollars for an eye exam they -demand- we have every 6 months or they wont dispense to us.. like trying to get medicine without seeing a doctor. Which brings me to my second point, if I want to change to different, cheaper contact lenses, I supposedly 'need' an exam, to test the new lenses on my eye, which negates wanting the cheaper lenses because the $53 exam is more than the difference between the cheap lenses ($90) and the ones I get now ($140)*angst* On top of that.. the same lenses I wear, are rated in NZ as 'monthly disposables' That means, after a month, I should throw them away 'for the sake of my eyes' and use a brand new pair... except, the exact same lenses in a less afluent country, are rated  bi-monthly disposables... perfectly safe for two months, says my optometrist... so why encourage the majority of us, to flick perfectly good stuff prematurely - oh wait.. I think I know this one.. PROFIT. So in conclusion, dear optometrists .. ROT IN HELL YOU FESTERING MONEY HUNGRY STINKMONGERS!! I BITE MY THUMB AT YOU! -sigh- Donations gratefully accepted 06-0266-0080503-00 (National Bank) Current balance $3.60
