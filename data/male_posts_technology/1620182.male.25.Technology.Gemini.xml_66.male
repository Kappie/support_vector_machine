At least, don't worry about it the way some of my team members worry about it.  One girl on my team will shoot out of her cubicle and into a conversation faster than you can say "offshore outsourcing," which is the usual trigger for such an occurance.  People say that this emminent industry collapse is going to be much worse than any before it because it consists of losing white collar jobs.  In the past, you could at least tell blue collar workers that they could work "harder" and get a better education to spring into the IT industry.  Ppffft.  Work harder, you say?  What is harder than working heavy machinery for eight to ten hours a day?  More like, "work differently," I say.  And don't worry about the next big industry.  Why are you looking to be herded from one big industry to the next?  Do what you like, and good things will follow.  I (almost) promise.
