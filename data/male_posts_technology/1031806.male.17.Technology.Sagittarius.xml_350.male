In my dreams I'm jealous all the time Then I wake I'm going out of my mind Going out of my mind   Wow, I just went back and re-read my  entire  blog for the first time in a couple months. A blog's alot like a picture album, though it's got more than just the good times in it. I've never really thought about it like that before.  At the beginning of the year I spend 10+ hours compiling a book-almost of my blog posts from the first time I posted to the end of last year. Heh, most of it's depressing, but that's alright because my life's been a depressing one so I guess it accurately mirrors it.  Eventually I will print it out and maybe even put it on the web… I think it’s over a hundred pages (lol).
