I found my self laughing really, really loud, which I haven't done in a long time.  urlLink James  couldn't make it because he went to a  urlLink Critical Mass  event here in Chicago. I don't know what getting a whole bunch of people together to bike in busy traffic to make it busier accomplishes, aside from road-rage. Ah well.  Today, I'm gunna be going to the  urlLink Field Museum of Natural History . That place rules. I haven't been there in 8 years or so. I don't think they even had the full dinosaur exhibit built out when I was there, last. Pretty crazy shit. After that, we may go up to the taste of Chicago, or Michigan Avenue, and do some shopping. Late this evening, we'll be going to see  urlLink Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind , which is a comedy act where they do 30 improv skits in 60 minutes. It's good fun.  I just finished cleaning up the apartment a little bit. I scrubbed the hell out of my bathroom, and swept my room. It feels good to live somewhere clean, so I'm surprised that I don't do it more often. Hmm...
