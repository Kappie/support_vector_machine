I've been on like one crazy week long party, getting home after work and going out every night, but last night some old friends and I went up to Chicken, shot pool, drank, and met some cool people.  One of the guys with us works there, so we got to play pool for free all night - an awesome perk.  After they kicked us all out at 2am, we grabbed our trunks and jumped in the hot tub over at Sterling apartments.  That was a blast, we were diving off the sides and just monkeying around in the pool.  One of the girls turned out to be a raver kid, so of course, we hit it right off. And, as it always seems to, everyone's favorite subject of body piercings came up, um, yeah she and I are tied on that one. Oh, and then we had waffles. Mmmmm, good.  So basically, I rolled in around 5:30, got a quick shower to wash off the funk, rolled into bed about 6, rolled out of bed around 7, took another shower, and rolled into work around 8.    I'm so excited to see Jenn on Sunday, that'll be a blast.  Church then bar hopping? lol, you gotta love that girl.  Yeah, Dave's had a fun week...  but, honestly, it would've been better if a certain person was still around...
