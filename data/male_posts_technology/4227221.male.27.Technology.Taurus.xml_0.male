I'd hate to have strangers thinking I'm some kind of Mel Gibson fan, or even worse, a die hard Mad Max / Thunderdome fanatic.  No, no, no.  See, me and a friend have a theory that eventually, possibly very soon, part of the US will turn into a scene wholly resembling the post-apocalyptic scenario laid out in the Mad Max movies.  Namely, we believe that Portland, Oregon will turn into a mirror of Mad Max, starting with a micro-Thunderdome in the South Park Blocks area, and eventually turning the entire downtown area of Portland into a gigantic tangled web of torn-leather, naked bodies, and such.  Anyone else notice the transformation already occurring?  I can't walk through the park blocks without encountering what I call a "Mad Max'r".  They seem to be multiplying.  I plan on taking covert digital pics soon... I'll post when I can, but I fear if "they" ever see this blog, they'll "terminate" me.
