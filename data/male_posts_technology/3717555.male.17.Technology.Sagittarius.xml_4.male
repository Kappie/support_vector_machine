The Ice coffee I'm drinking is slightly warm and tastes a bit funny, the weather sucks capital cohones (15C, cloudy, obnoxious moist), concurrently I'm discussing weather cockroaches would survive a global cobalt bomb holocaust with some confused 16 year old over IRC.  Pretty much like any other monday afternoon i suppose.
