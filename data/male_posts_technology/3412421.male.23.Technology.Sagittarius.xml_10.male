One or two milestone versions ago (either 0.4 or 0.5, I forget), and I was using Thunderbird for email about as often as I was using Outlook 2003. Then they came out with a new milestone that rejiggered their spam filter  and by "rejiggering," I mean made it stop working well. The old spam catcher was actually my favorite part of the program, because it did it so damn well! It caught the vast majority of my spam, with hardly ever a false positive. Now, since said rejiggering, despite following every release note instruction to a T, despite probably more than 10,000 emails having passed through its Inbox since the "upgrade," it hardly catches jack shit. And worse, I get some false positives, meaning I have to waste a ton of time double-checking my spam folder which I had gotten used to not needing to do with the old Thunderbird.  Ahh well, it seems I've lost patience with the program. I still collect my email with it, alongside Outlook 2003, but I pretty much don't even touch it anymore. And as the Inbox fills with hundreds and hundreds of spams, my inertia increases because I know if I start using it again I'll need to go through and clean all that crap out. Ugh...
