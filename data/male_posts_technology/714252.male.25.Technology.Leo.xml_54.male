Anywho.. Things have been interesting and for some god-forsaken reason I am being sent to Cork on Saturday to promote a Salsa weekend.. I have visions of Josh preparing to stitch me up by phoning ahead to tell them I am the best dancer they have and to make sure to get me to dance for them just so he can make me look like a complete ass (OK, Maybe he wouldn't do that, but then again I know we would do that to him :P)  Anyway, not much news.. I have being trying to behave myself a little bit recently but it obviously isn't coming up to the high standards of our groups conciounse (Yes, that would be Jonny and Karl of all people. OK so I spelt it wrong.. someone point out the proper spelling in a comment, GWAN)  Anywho, I REALLY have to dash now.. C ya on the flip side or some such bullshit statement..  Salsa classes tonight! Wh0ot!
