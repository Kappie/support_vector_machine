 In the business world we have these documents called white papers that summarize a technology or service at a high level for potential customers.  I think the 2004 Presidential election should have similar papers for each of the candidates -- especially Bush.  This article comes the closest I've seen to succinctly ascribing the problems dogging the current administration including the 9/11 Commission findings, the misleading evidence of WMD in Iraq, the blown cover of a CIA operative, and the Abu Ghraib torture investigations.  I would throw in the lack of preparation for terrorist attacks and the completely flubbed invasion of Afghanistan in there too.  Do people know this stuff?  I'm sure they do, but I can't imagine anyone voting for this administration if they saw all of it together in one place.  How could you?
