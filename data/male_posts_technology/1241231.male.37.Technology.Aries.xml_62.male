When you think of this in conjunction with the fact that  urlLink British foreign aid is now targeted at countries willing to sell off their assets to big business , it makes all this World Bank, foreign aid stuff that I always thought was great looks like a sham.  These superpower funded aid agencies just seem to be a cover for taking over the assets of  poor countries. Block their trade, wait for them to go bust, and then go in and clean up.
