GO ME! Acutually this is just a random medley of funny things that have been said to me (Or I have said on a few occasions) and I just felt the need to share them with all of you.      Just a Bit of Background Information:   I was IMed by a Random!Stalker earlier this evening, telling me that she had read my story on Fanfiction.net, that beej happened to post in the...er...post below. Madness ensued...sort of.   funinthesunbabe8:  my name is Wendy  funinthesunbabe8:   Summers  funinthesunbabe8:   from Maine  xBobTCat:  Nice to meet you. I'm JaQ.  funinthesunbabe8:   i love french boys!  funinthesunbabe8:   im french myself.............just look at my armpits  xBobTCat:  I'm actually a girl. JaQ is just short for Jacque  Oh baby. Nothing like a little gender confusion to get a girl in touch with her feminine side. So later, after I told her about the conversation clip that I'll show you next, she told me that I watched too much porn. I was offended at first, but then I realized, oh crap...anyone but me would think that I  did  watch dirty movies. That worked wonders for my confidence. Moving on! Dani, one of my dearest friends, and I were talking, and yes, the Johnny we refer to IS Depp, but I don't want to explain myself more than I have to...  xBobTCat:   I SAW JOHNNY'S WANG TODAY!!!  xBobTCat:   (Sorta!)  xBobTCat:   (BUT STILL!)  xBobTCat:   LMAO!!!  sweetpea03182:  Explain!  sweetpea03182:  How did this...viewing...happen?? Rofl  xBobTCat:   I'll do you one better!  xBobTCat:  I'll show you! It's like a wang silhouette!   xBobTCat:   A....wangouette!  So yes, my dear viewer s,  I'm not a deep person at all. I am, in fact, very shallow, and very immature. But, on the plus side, I showed her the picture and she flipped out too. So long as I'm not alone, life is good. Finally, just a few clips I saw from the Lord of the Rings special on A (Again, I watched it with Danisorta.)   Interviewer Guy:  What has been your favorite part about working on this movie?  Dominic Monaghan:  Being surrounded by beautiful women and sleepin' on a pile'a cash.    Elijah Wood:  You know, in the sixties, it mirrored Vietnam, so the hippies really took it to heart.  Interviewer Guy:  Yes, we did.   Aaaaand, I'm spent. So, my friends, I hope you enjoyed the "medley" (heehee!) of things that make a whackjob smile. Have a nice evening.   And now back to your regularly scheduled programming...
