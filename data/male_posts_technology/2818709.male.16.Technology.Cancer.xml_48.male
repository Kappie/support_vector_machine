AnorexicSwan: what VacantSilhouette: She came in, and said "have you been using my foot lotion" and i said "no" AnorexicSwan: lol VacantSilhouette: I've been sitting on my ass, playing video games the entire time that they've been gone. VacantSilhouette: Oh yeah, and i went to the living room to watch csi for an hour. VacantSilhouette: Then they started yelling at me. VacantSilhouette: I was like "WTF!??!" AnorexicSwan: Ugh, I'm sorry VacantSilhouette: Leave me alone! VacantSilhouette: The funny thing to do, would be to say, ok, you think i used that? come here, smell my hands, feet, and underwear. If you can find traces of hand lotion, then i'll pay you. I'll fscking PAY YOU. AnorexicSwan: lol AnorexicSwan: Yeah.. AnorexicSwan: wait.. AnorexicSwan: Oh..gross. VacantSilhouette: Yeah, you caught the underwear part? VacantSilhouette: Yes. VacantSilhouette: I'm sure that's what they were thinking. VacantSilhouette: I'm gonna kill em.  Seriously. I didn't. I swear to god. I've been playing video games/watching CSI the entire time they were gone. There was NO forearm exercise.      Anyways, on another note. I was VERY angry today. VERY angry. What about, you ask? Life. All aspects of it, but i'm not going to go into that. You can ask me IRL if you wish, i might explain it. I decided to ride my bike. I havnt ridden my bike in a while, but it's basically the equivalent of a punching bag to me. This time, i was really mad. I live on 38th and Western. I rode my bike to 70th and western. Yeah, i was pissed. Then i rode my bike back to my house, decided i wasnt quite ready to go in yet, and rode my bike to super cao nguyen. I was really thirsty by this time. I was PLANNING on going inside, and getting a drink or something. But nooooo. I forgot my wallet. Damnit. No passion-fruit green tea for me. Or fizzy drink. Or Sarsi. I really wanted a sarsi....
