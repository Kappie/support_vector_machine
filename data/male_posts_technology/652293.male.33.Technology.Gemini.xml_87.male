Speaking of money, I think I will be buying some  urlLink music  from Apple this weekend.  Excellent conversation on the pros and cons of the interface and the service at  urlLink Signal vs Noise .  I bought one song the day iTunes 4 premiered.  Bob Dylan.  Very cool.  I also see that they have some Cibo Matto, which I am listening to as I type.  I only have the Stereo Type A album, but iTunes Store has songs from another album, too.  Not all of then, but I think I may get most of what is available.  I also want to get one of  urlLink these  and  urlLink this  to replace my "boom" box I bought in Ahsland, Oregon in September of 1992.  Back when I would have said, "MP3 what?"  Wow, back when there was no Web.  Anyhoo.  If for some strange reason you feel like  urlLink donating  to the cause of iPod...
