Here's a link to his website.  I've read his book and been trying very hard to use his system for some time.  I have times I'm better at it and times I'm not so good at it, but I definately see the value and recommend it highly.  I recently went to Cambridge, Massachussetts to attend his Leveraging Focus and Vision seminar.  Again, something I highly recommend for anyone wishing to get their life in order and on track.
