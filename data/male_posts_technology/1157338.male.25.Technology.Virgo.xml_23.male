As per usual - the small stuff first:       Finished with Devil Whiskey - it was mucho fun, and I really enjoyed my time there - but the contract has been completed, and I just really don't have enough time to continue on there. The game is still selling well, and the europeans are pouncing on it whenever a magazine article comes out in their country.     Still at SST - still kicking ass there - things are getting tight - we have a seasonal release schedule (being ag based) so this time of year finds us pushing to get all the new stuff done to be ready for fall planning.     Almost done with the Shanna payments - ready for that to be over and done - close that chapter of my life. Got back the Honda she had - she never arranged for new financing so I have to sell it to pay off the lien - there was some mechanical stuff wrong with it that needs fixing first so I'm gonna be trying hard to break even on the deal. Honda's have great resell value, but tossing 60k miles on car in a year will hurt you no matter what kind of car it is.    So that's all the typical here's my life right now news and then the biggie (like you probably don't know or can't guess):    I've met an amazing girl     Her name is Jennifer, she lives here in Stillwater. She's about to finish her M.S. in Psychology, and will be pursuing her PhD shortly thereafter. Very intelligent, kind, and interesting woman. She rocks my frickin socks off and that's that. If you need to know more, you can probably find me easily enough otherwise, I'll catch up with ya later in another three months when I'm halfway through next semester's courses (which will suck).      Anyways, that's enough info for now, see ya soon.
