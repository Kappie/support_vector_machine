I hear so many stories of teens that are hurting and being hurt by someone they Love.  They always tell me the line that the person that is hurting them loves them too but I'm here to tell you ..  IT'S JUST NOT TRUE!!!  I pray that these kids will someday see that love is patient and kind and all the 2 Corinthians stuff.  If you can't put the person's name in for love in that verse then you need to stop and take a look at what is really going on!
