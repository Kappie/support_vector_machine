I sent a resume in thinking I was way under-qualified and way out gunned when it came to getting a call back or interview or anything.  To my suprise, I got a call on my cell phone about a week later, wanting to set up a phone interview to talk about my qualifications.  I go through the motions of talking with human resources, and doing an initial interview, still not taking it too seriously as I am pretty happy with my current gig.  So, a few days later I get another call, they want a 3rd interview with me.  The firm I am interviewing with is a fairly large company, so I thought the third interview would be nearing a final decision.  I went into the interview not expecting an offer... I left with a verbal job offer, which I accepted on the spot.  The new gig is doing consulting, which I have always wanted to do on my own anyway, I just have never had the jack to get a startup off the ground.  Midwestwired.net went out on 3 service calls then was disbanded.  Gelttech.com went under before registering a successful service call(this happened while I was in college, so I wasnt really into it anyway).  The last venture has actually been doing pretty well.  I have been doing private consulting since I came home in march of 2003.  I am by no means striking it rich fixing old ladies email and internet accounts or removing spyware from overburden windows desktops, but the extra $ comes in handy at times!  Stay tuned for updates on the new gig and exit woes from the current...
