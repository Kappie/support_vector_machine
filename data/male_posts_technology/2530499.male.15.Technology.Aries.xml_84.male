Yes, in the physical sense, I  am  leaving. I act as though it's happening tomorrow, but it's not until sometime just after the fourth of July. It's almost fitting that I should be cast out into the great wild world on the holiday of independance. I've called this place my home, yet never felt totally welcome, for a decade now. That's a long damn time. Sure, I've moved around during that decade more times than I can count, but the point is that I've called this state my home for ten long years. I've made the only real friends that I possess here. I've written my first fanfic here, learned about sex on this place's playgrounds, and watched myself and those around me grow.   I have little bits of all of my friends burned into my mind. Things that I couldn't forget even if I wanted to. Like the way that Ben's eyes light up when he smiles, and how willing he is to give me the shirt off his back when it's cold out. And like the way that I feel when ever I can get Rosalie to wheeze when she laughs, and the way that she can't say the word "wang" with a straight face. Of course, I could spend an eternity and beyong just listing the things that I love just about these two people, but every moment that passes is one that I can't get back. That scares me a little. But I think what scares me more is a little question that nags me in the back of my head. Is there any little thing about me that'll be worth remembering? Do the little quirks in my character stick in their heads and make them smile the same way they have for me for as long as I can remember? Every part of me hopes so, only because I know how amazing they are. I know that they wouldn't let me fade away like the image of a young girl in a photograph, forsaken for the ancient image that looks upon it.  Heh. In ever conversation I have with Rosalie where the phone is dying, I always tell her, "I'm going to say goodbye now, then we can just keep talking. That way, I won't feel bad if the phone dies, because I'll have said goodbye." And so I did, and we would. So I suppose this is what this is. My phone is dying, my time is ending, but let's just keep talking as if nothing as ever happened, just so that I can hear the sound of your voice.
