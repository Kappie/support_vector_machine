ROLE 2 ANALYSIS:                  This person has more knowledge and less contribution.                Seems to be fine because he has to let others participate and ask questions.        This role is played by experienced people attending New Guy training.        So again if we take Role 2 Scenarios we come up with:                 Scenario1:    This person has more knowledge and less useful contribution.      Well it can be a bit irritating since he cannot help the new comers reframe the questions they are        trying to ask and can create a impression that this person is sitting with his ego pumped up.        So I think this scenario cannot be satisfactory.                But let us take Scenario 2                 Scenario2:    The person who has more knowledge and less useless contribution can be       acceptable as the sentence says. So I think this scenario should be fine.                  ROLE 3 ANALYSIS:                  Ah, The Role 3 guy…seen many a times in corporate environments who is fresh in certain        Domain. He has less knowledge and less contribution. But this is not acceptable in corporate        world since this person should atleast know some basics of what is discussed about and should be        willing to learn.                The scenarios again:                  Scenario 1:    The person has less knowledge and less useful contribution. He keeps on talking that      he knows everything and spills out less useful facts to the team. This is very very Dangerous        situation because the team members cannot discourage that what he talks is useless and that        he can waste the time of meeting by contributing things out of the subject because he gets a complex        and starts off suddenly just to show that he is the one rolling the ball.                So watch out people…persons like this can be made to shift to one of the other acceptable quadrants.                 Scenario2:    This person has less knowledge and less useless contribution.              Sounds fair..this guy is a new kid in the block and that he makes no mistakes while contributing or        asking doubts.                So go for this scenario at any point of your life.                 ROLE 4 ANALYSIS:                   Less knowledge and more contribution. This seems fair if this guy contributes more usefully as in   Scenario1.          This person can bring his/her domain level expertise from a known domain to an unknown domain and finds        a correlation so that both parties who know his domain the best can share ideas and learn about unknown domains        Should be the ideal scenario when people of different roles meet and discuss.                But this can be very harmful to the meeting if he is on   Scenario 2   that is he contributes more useless facts        and has less knowledge. Half Knowledge is dangerous.                So to wrap up the discussion we have to be in one of the quadrants and in one of those role scenarios.        Let me sum up the good and bad role-scenarios:                  GOOD ROLES:                          Role 1: Scenario 1: This person has more knowledge and more useful contribution.        Role 2: Scenario 2: This person has more knowledge and less useless contribution        Role 3: Scenario 2: This person has less knowledge and less useless contribution.        Role 4: Scenario 1: This person has less knowledge and more useful contribution                And Watch Out for the other roles (  “NOT OK ROLES”  ) if not listed here, those are dangerous.                So whenever we are in a meeting we can use the Knowledge vs. Contribution graph        and populate with the names of the meeting members. After that we must analyze        which scenario they belong to. And then you should be interacting more with the        GOOD Roles mentioned above and try to give feedback or help them if you have        categorized in the “NOT OK: Roles.                So let us divert our topic and explore something else which comes out of my mind in my next blog.                Seeya.
