Here are some random thoughts I have had today:  How annoying is it that everyone stands and gawps at Rivoli's musical clock? Every fucking hour, on the hour, there's fifty people, jaws on the floor, gazing in wonder as "OId MacDonald" echos down King Street. Custard has a lot to answer for.  Liquid School disco nights: Hundreds of pissed-up 18 year olds singing "C'mon Eileen", Bacardi Breezers in hand. How on earth do they know the lyrics? How can they be so scary and intriguing at the same time?  If Chicago Rock's music is all selected and play-listed in the UK, what does Nevill actually do?  Where the fuck is Grist?  Who the hell were those two women in Liquid who were shouting "There's that Toaster guy! Do the running man Toaster-boy!!"  Isn't the Sports Bar due for redecorating? It's been that way since.. well.. as long as I can remember now.    Tiddles was the butt of all the other cats' jokes.   urlLink Star Wars Kid: Reloaded  - Windows Media Player file
