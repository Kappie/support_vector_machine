The goggles worn in the bugs film gave me a headache. We also visited the Science Fiction Museum, which was very cool. It's all right under the Space Needle, which I have yet to go up in.   It's been nice to see some uniquely Seattle sights, something I've done too little of since moving here. Of course, the coral reef film tells me I must visit the South Pacific. One more place to visitin a long list.
