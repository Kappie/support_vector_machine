Have you ever wondered why seemingly intelligent people can't seem to think rationally in a relationship?  Have you ever wondered why the public at large buys into media hype?  Maybe I should have titled this post "why people do dumb things." I've asked myself these questions for the past twenty years or so. It's not out of curiosity, but more from really wanting to understand the phenomenon of seemingly stupid behavior. I think an underlying motivation is that I'd like to be one of the few that can avoid the same pitfalls that the population as a whole can't.  Ah so now you are saying, great, he thinks he's smarter than everyone else; hardly. I have, however, come up with some theories.  What constitutes human intelligence? I’m not talking about the ability to make tools or other scientific explanations. I accept that humans as a whole are already more intelligent than other creatures. I am asking what is it about one person that makes them more capable to deal with life than anther person. Why is it that one person can wade through life at so much an easier pace than others that struggle with just being happy?  AJ’s Theory of Intelligence (Someone else might have come up with this ages before and I don’t claim that I am the first, however, I’ve never read the theory before or came across it in conversations. I can claim that I came up with this version solely on my own):  There are two distinct patterns of intelligence in humans.  Innate Learnable Intelligence: We can call this “book smarts”. What I mean here is the inborn ability to learn and figure out complex problems. We could further break up this category into two sub groups: People that can solve complex problems and those that have exceptional memories.  Let’s give real world examples. Everyone knows that girl or guy that blew through college because of their ability to memorize from the text book and then regurgitate it later on an exam. We also know someone that seems to know everything there is to know about a specific topic such as history, literature, or some other science that requires a great memory. These people seem to be able to recite innumerable quotes without consulting a book. I label them as “memorizers.”  The other type of innate learnable intelligence is best described by the scientist. I knew a guy at my last job that was unbelievable at looking at complex problems and figuring them out spatially in his head. I think most genius’ fall into this category. These are the guys that end up doing well on IQ tests. I shall label them the “genius.”  The other type of intelligence I call...  Common Sense: I believe that this type of intelligence is also innate. You are either born with it or you aren’t. This intelligence is a lot harder to detect but it is something that people pick up on. We all know the guy that seems to wade through social complexities with ease, or that woman that just seems to have her head on her shoulders correctly. No, some of them can’t talk about nuclear physics with you and given an IQ test some aren’t going to score high, although they usually won’t score low either. These are the people that easily read through social bull, sometimes they seem like they are psychic in their ability to read other people.   So far most of you are nodding your head and saying to yourself, I am with him so far. Nothing seems groundbreaking so far.  I figured this out at about are twelve and at that time I thought I was doing pretty good for myself since it seems that no one else around me seemed to get it. It made me judge people differently and made me respect some people that others did not.  Shortly after that discovery I noticed a very odd thing. People that scored really well in one type of intelligence rarely did well in the other and some I would actually say were extremely handicapped in the other.  Let’s go with some more examples. That really high IQ person that I knew at my last job would be a prime example. He could figure out anything mathematical or electrical. I wouldn’t want to play him at chess either. When it came to social skills, he could barely function. He dressed like a complete slob. He couldn’t pick up the subtleties that took place in company meetings. Explaining human emotions of the opposite sex was useless. He also seemed to be alarmingly unaware of his surroundings. Here was a person that could build a modern plasma screen but I would worry about him walking out in traffic because common sense wouldn’t help him to avoid being hit by a car.   For the “memorizer”, I’ve seen the same thing. I’ve tried having talks with that guy or woman that could recite poems from a 1000 different writers or could tell me in precise detail the complete history and nuances of the Russian Czars, but when outside their comfort zone of memorized facts, felt so uncomfortable that conversations would end abruptly. This type of person can also be the most dreaded to deal with. This person can become the know it all with an unreasonable ego to go with it. The problem is that this person also will usually have a large underlying self confidence problem because in their heads is the knowledge that their intelligence stems from someone else’s work. Given the chance to show their own originality, they usually fall short.   The last example should be the common sense guy. That guy that flunked out of high school, never went to college. The guy that can’t seem to comprehend anything but basic math skills and still has trouble spelling your name after 20 years. Maybe there are also completely technology challenged. Do you know that guy that seems dumber than a box of rocks at times but is absolutely the guy you want next to you when the next ice age hit? This is the guy that knows to come in out of the rain. He somehow intuitively understands the man and woman courtship. He can spot and understand simple patterns that the genius missed. You probably wouldn’t want t play poker with him either. He is the guy who is great at the intangibles. You want to call him a genius right up until he opens his mouth.   The last type of person we have met is that rare individual that seems to have a good dose of both. I’ll call them the “Smart” person. This is the girl that can talk about anything and comes across articulate. She can pick up subtle hints from conversations as well as calculate the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow. This is a person that will score well on an IQ test and still operates in society well. I think of this person as having a higher actual intelligence than all of the others. Why? I’ll get back to that.   By now, if you are paying attention, you’ve figured out that I answered two questions from the beginning of this post.   Have you ever wondered why so many seemingly intelligent people get taken in by simple scams? They are the ones that lack common sense intelligence.  Have you ever wondered why seemingly intelligent people can't seem to think rationally in a relationship? Same as above  The last question will take a bit more discussion. It also ties into my intelligence theories rather well.   After I had figured out the differences in intelligence, and that most people are lacking either common sense or classically defined intelligence or both, I started to wonder how to quickly spot that rare type of intelligence. How do you spot the person that has both?  The answer to that led me to one of my other favorite ideas.  “An intelligent person asks questions”  I’ve had some lively debate about this one, until I explain what I mean by it. Then it usually becomes clear to people the truth of the statement.   Let us take a common media and scientific theory as an example of how different type of intelligent people might think.   “The earth is warming. The earth has seen an unnatural raise in temperatures over the last one hundred years that is caused by greenhouse gas production, a by-product of humans and the industrial revolution.”  The higher IQ individual might look at that statement, and if quoted by a respected scientist in the field of climatology, take it as a given. Yes it is common knowledge that human intervention is having an effect on the earth. The glaciers are melting and the summers are getting hotter.  The “memorizer” will simply memorize that statement and regurgitate it back over and over.  The common sense guy might wonder if it’s true, but won’t ask or research it because the topic might be over their head to begin with.  The people that don't posses much of either type of intelligence will take it as gospel.    The “Smart” guy is going to ask the question, Who says so? What is the proof? He has the intelligence to understand the topic and the common sense to understand that what is professed as truth is often far from it. He also doesn’t have to be a climatologist to see through to the reality. This is the guy that uses common sense AND his or her intelligence to probe the subject. They always will challenge ideas. They almost never believe anything until they apply their given intelligence to it and then apply common sense.  I can give an pretty easy set of examples now of the difference between the types of intelligence now.   A high IQ person can look at the data that the global warming from human intervention scientists and see that there is a correlation between higher CO2 in the atmosphere and higher global temperatures, thus confirming the conclusions.  A "smart" guy can look at the data and immediately figure out the large gaping hole in the logic of the conclusion. He will then comment: I see that all your data is from only the last hundred or so years. How can you conclude that humans are responsible for global warming without looking at pre-industrial revolution numbers or for that matter looking at the earth's CO2 to Temperature relationship across the entire lifetime of the planet?  A quick look at that would tell you that the earth has been warmer in the past and that with every rise in global temperatures over the last million years there has been a rise in CO2 in the atmosphere.. I’m not going to go into the absurdity of the whole thing here. You can read about it all over the internet and draw your own conclusions from the raw data. Just use common sense.   Now if you think on it you’ll know that guy that is always challenging ideas. Not just other peoples ideas but their own preconceived notions of everything around them. This person is always asking questions. This isn’t to say that they always are asking them out loud, some might sit and listen for a long time while they form the questions in their head. The tell tale signs though will be when you ask them their opinion of a conversation. They will have one, but not necessarily the opinion you think.   By now I have answered that last question. “Have you ever wondered why the public at large buys into media hype?” It is because the “Smart” people are rare. Most of the public blindly believes what is told of them. The truly great scientists are “smart” people. They have the common sense to always question and to draw their own conclusions, not borrow others. Even after they draw their own conclusions, they leave open the window of possibility that they might be wrong.   I could go on here, and more than likely I will at another time since this is a topic dear to me.  No I don’t think I’m smarter than everyone else. I know better, but, I do know to ask questions. So should you.
