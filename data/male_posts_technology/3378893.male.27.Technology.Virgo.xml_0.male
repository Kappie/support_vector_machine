On Saturday, I went over to my friend's house to watch the latest episode of Enterprise.  There's only one episode left and it looks to be really exciting.  Of course, if you haven't been watching the rest of the season, it might be difficult to understand.  There has been a major storyline over-arching the whole season.  I have to admit that one reason I keep watching the show is because I find Jolene Blalock (T'Pol) so attractive.  In my opinion she's the best reason to watch.  I like Star Trek anyway, so I would probably still watch it without her.  If you are interested in more infomation online, visit  urlLink the official Star Trek website .
