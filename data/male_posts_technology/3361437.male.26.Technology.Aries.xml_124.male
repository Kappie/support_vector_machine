The common house mouse (scientific name Mus Musculus) is one of the most studied and well understood of mammals. It is a model organism for researching many aspects of biology, including neurobiology. Recent studies by Professor Joe Tsien, and colleagues at Princeton University, have been using the mouse to reveal the molecular basis of learning and memory. As a result of their experiments they have produced genetically modified mice which are 4 to 5 times as intelligent as normal mice."
