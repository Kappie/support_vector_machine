Well it means that as of the end of the year, December to be exact, I no longer work here. Nobody does actually. They are closing the whole entire site. 550 Employees gone, the building left for some other company to operate in. And you know, the whole situation is bittersweet. Part of me is saddened, I've been here for 6 years and have some good memories. On the other hand, I realize this job has made me crazy, so it will be good to move on and see what else is out there. I think more of older employees are more worried, since they have the families and the mortgage and the bills. Part of me is glad I don't have any of that, I think it will help me in making a smoother transition into whatever I do. Now the decision is what to do? I've been here for 6 years, so that means I'll get a pretty good severance package. Well actually I already got all the paper work, so it's just a matter of filling it all out and sending it in. So with that money, and whatever money I can save by December, will determine what I will do with myself. I actually have quite a bit of options. I could search for another job here, I could look in another city, I could move to Mexico! All these opportunities are quite possible, just depends on what I want and what I choose. So I guess as soon as I figure that out, then I will go from there. I'm not really nervous, you know this not really a surprise to any of us. I mean we have all been thinking that they were going to make a change here. There were the rumors, the whispers, everyone knew something was up. So to actually have a date, a confirmed day, is actually better. No wondering, no worrying, just a concrete date which to work off of. And I'll be happy to close this chapter of my life and move on. There's many things I want to do and see, and maybe now with the free time I will have I can do and see them.I'm not a firm believer in the whole "things happen forreason" thing, I don't know anyone who really is. But this could be good for me. A time to mature and grow up some more.Be the person I really want to be. If not, then at least I don't have to work for a while, and I can sit at home and eat Mexican Doritos. MMMM....Mexican Doritos. Thank Heaven for Mexican Doritos. They have never let me down.   Well I hope all is well in whatever part of the matrix your in. Adios.
