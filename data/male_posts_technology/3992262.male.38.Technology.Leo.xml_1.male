I think the only thing being made less stable by the Arrow is Mr. Pedatzur's brain.  It was the  threat  of an ABM system that caused the Soviet Union to spend itself into annihilation.  And that was a  threat  against the  Soviet Empire .  This is not a threat.  This is a  reality  against a bunch of borderline Third World thugs.  The real thing causing instability in the Middle East is a network of anti-Israeli countries who seek the end of Israel as a sovereign nation, a people, and a religion.  Get that and learn it.
