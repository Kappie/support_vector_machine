I saw a demo of their stuff last year, and its certainly the best commercial MDA tool I've seen, and maybe the most mature transformation implementation going around. Like  urlLink Haywood  (and  urlLink Kent , and all the guys on the ADTF list), they're seeing an increasing distinction between the executable UML guys and the model transformation guys, which they call the "pragmatic camp".  It's probably an inflammatory phrase, in its unspoken implication that the xUML approaches aren't pragmatic (an implication I have some sympathy for, in the general case, but would never press). They might also get some pushback on the nomenclature, I suspect, from the  urlLink Pragmatic Programming crowd , as led by  urlLink PragDave .  They also talk about model-driven testing, coming in their next version, which is another thing that has floated pretty conspicuously past my radar this year.
