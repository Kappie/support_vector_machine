The initial plan was just to cruise to the Embarcadero but before we knew it we were in Sausalito.   The weather was perfect and along the way we took in many great sights ... including an elderly gentleman with a head full of white plaster.    We got to cross the Golden Gate Bridge (a hoot!) and stuff ourselves full of fish parts over in Marin.  I also highly recommend the ferry ride back.  Ferries  always make me feel like re-enacting the opening scene to Working Girl.     Or that one Madonna video.  Regardless a good time was had by all. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink Golden Gate Bridge (detail) 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink goldtoe .
