Omar is a short, neurotic Indian fellow with a hodge-podge accent accrued while living life all over the globe.  Just his name is a funny, misleading contradiction, and if you ever heard him speak, you would never guess his origin.  He looks Hispanic (people speak Spanish to him wherever he goes), his name is Muslim, his accent is indecipherable, and his family is counted among the microscopic minority of catholic Indians.
 
 Don't tell him I mentioned this on the web, but his drunken adventures are legendary.  He, of course, is completely embarrassed by the stories that come from his nights on the LI bar and club scene, but I won't let him forget.  This is the man who went up to a girl in a bar and said straight faced (and I quote to the best of my ability), "I've been studying them, and I'm positive that your left breast is bigger than your right breast."  ...which of course lead to her denial, which lead to him insisting, which in turn lead to her proving it.  You get the idea.
 
 Omar saves some of his best material for when you co-habitate with him.  And this type of material just keeps coming.  In fact, two years of living with him was not enough to witness all of his quirks.  I knew that Omar had an obsession about washing his hands, but last night was just too much.  I couldn't stop laughing.  
 
 First of all, he was doing his laundry while we were watching TV.  So every few commercial breaks, he would go to the laundry room to move his clothes.  Every time he got back, he had to wash his hands.  When I took a bathroom break, I noticed that he had about four bars of soap next to his sink.  I asked him why and he told me that if he drops a bar of soap in the shower that it has to be relegated to hand washing duties.  There are too many chemicals on the shower floor.  I asked if he would reuse it if he had just cleaned the shower, to which he gave the same reply.
 
 Secondly, he won't take a shower without his flip flops.  This is his own shower where NOBODY else ever sets foot.  He told me about how he had to use the restroom on the way back home from VA last weekend but couldn't because he was wearing his shower shoes and would have tracked that mess into his bath tub.
 
 Third, and this is probably the best, he told me about another of his outstanding bathroom rituals.  He apparently has to line his toilet seat with toilet paper no matter what.  This is his own toilet!!  He's been doing it since he was a teenager.  This really used to get under Andrew's skin since they shared the cost of toilet paper and it was obviously being consumed at a rapid rate.  
 
 So if you ever meet Omar, you'll instantly like him...I guarantee that.  But don't mention any of this stuff to him.  He'll tell you eventually.  Plus, he'd kill me if he knew I was writing about this online.
