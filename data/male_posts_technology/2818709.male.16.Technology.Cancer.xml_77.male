I woke up in a dream today.  I started thinking of all of the songs and phrases I could that had the word "dream" in them, and those were the first 3 that showed up. They go together quite nicely. The references are: Linkin Park, Vincent, and John Lennon. Tell me which one's which? First one that does, gets a prize. Otis does not count for this prize. Because i told him. Too bad for otis.
