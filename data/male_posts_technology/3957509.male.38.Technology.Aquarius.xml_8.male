Looked at the map book and decided that a walk up Yonge would be a great place to start. What energy in the city! I walked up to Bloor then over to Church and down through the most "colorful" neighborhood. I enjoyed a drink at Woody's and imagined the cast from  Queer as Folk  walking in.  On Sunday and Monday did the same walk and saw a few of my "favourite things" - boys from a certain condo there. Total shock in I was! Anyway, even cuter (and taller!) in person. Also, I met one of the objects of my desire, Bozz. (If anyone knows how to contact this guy, please let me know!)  All in all, a very pleasant visit.  Peace!
