I wake up this morning, with a migraine - I've been having a few lately, I think it is a combination of caffiene and wearing glasses instead of my contact lenses. Not to worry, today I pick up my new contact lenses, and everything will be back to -2.0 clarity. Hurrah. I log in to online banking, and transfer $10 across to a broke friend, and leave myself with $133.. hmm it'll be a tight day. Tasks to achieve today: print out document at a cyber cafe (our printer out of ink) mail document to client, pick up contact lenses, ring up and enquire about stoppage on our fuel card, hassle xtra about hugely unwarranted upload meterage. Relax. IRC, and maybe listen to some music. Having no cash on me, I toddle across to the dairy and get a V (sugarfree) and $10 cash for the bus in/out of town. The bus doesnt come. The second bus doesnt come.. it's starting to get cold sitting in the only shadow for miles, the bus stop. I give up and catch a taxi into town, for the princely sum of $8 I withdraw $120 from my account, leaving about 80 cents, I go to a cybercafe and print off the document and get stung for $8.. apparently accessing a USB memory stick is somehow more hazardous than a floppy disk _b nice one cyberdork. *mutters under breath* So now I have a little over a hundred bucks, I can either buy my contacts, and have no money to get me to next thursday, or put $80 on my contacts and have a fresh crisp $20 note. I chose the later (second mistake) I go to catch the bus home and realise that the new bus company has taken over, and that there are 5 busses of a variety of sizes waiting at the bus stop (normally a max of two) all very fancy, and what seems to be something in the vacinity of 10 bus drivers. Despite this, my bus leaves late, driven by a lady who has sworn 5 times before she sat down... I can sympathise with her day at least. We start off, make 3 wrong turns, and she switches on the wipers every time she tries to indicate.. much tooting ensues from the public confused by her driving.. nto suprisingly. I'll point out that we're in a tour coach size bus too.. not the normal innercity size.. not bad, nice comfort, I make a remark to that effect, and she tells me the new fleet are small glorified vans, and that this is a temporary measure. Ahh well. The fare will also go up a dollar, from $1.60 to $2.60. Thanks CityBus - you fucks. we continue, taking what I'll describe as a picturesque route home.. not the new route that my pamphlet tells me we'll be taking, but one of the drivers own choosing, down some roads really not designed for tour busses, much to the entertainment of the locals, scared we're going to hit their holdens parked on the narrow road. I point out as we drive past my road, that the route is supposed to go down it, she snaps at me, something to the effect of her instructions saying turn RIGHT into that road.. I rolled my eyes, hit the bell, and hopped off - very little extra walking for me.. and a lot of extra driving for her.. you see, you cant turn right from the road she was on, onto my road, bummer.. it'll take her 15 minutes up that road before she realises this, and at that point, good luck to her trying to turn a tour coach around.. its a single lane wide at best. Nice one, bitch. Rot in hell :D I get to my house, most of you will know, some wont, that theres a bus stop right at my gate, three little old ladies waiting for the bus, that at best will be half an hour late. I shout myself my one indulgence to wash away the days hassles, a can of dew.. sit down, fire up MSN and proceed to spill dew -into- my $200 logitech cordless keyboard. Nice! It takes a good 20 minutes to take this puppy apart.. compared to cheap $17 keyboards that you can either throw away and get a new one, or basically take the IC (integrated circuit) off, and wash the whole thing easily. Currently the washable parts are soaking in the tub, and the unwashable have been meticulously cleaned by cotton bud. It wont work when I put it back together, this is a forgone conclusion. I'll sell it on trademe when it doesnt. You have been warned. I rang the fuel card company, no real explanation, thanks guys, that was a good 40 minutes on hold for nothing. Xtra tell me I've got lots of spyware, and thats why I've uploaded 800megs in 4 days.. thats a LOT of user feedback from spyware.. that'd be the same as the spyware doing a live video feed with audio in cd quality, of all the time that I'm awake. Nice going Xtra. Two friends of mine have also noted ridiculous upload statistics.. Roll on the 4th, where I become flatrate. Now I'm listening to angsty bitch music, I've finished the rest of my dew, I've had some lunch, and I'm relatively calm. I dont have contact lenses, I've got less than a $20 to last me a week, and my only pair of non-dress pants, covered in dew, have been washed and are on the line.. thankfully its a fine day - tho, I wouldnt put it past my day, for it to start raining... and as I type this, amanda marshall starts singing 'oh let it rain' - fucken bitch, she's against me too!!@#!@#!@  Still love you guys tho aye *hugs* Where's my A class drugs at? Pz out.
