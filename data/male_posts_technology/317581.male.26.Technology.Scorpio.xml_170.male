In other news- Kevin got done talking to Austin who said that his "friend" has another apartment and that he hasn't been staying here for 2 weeks, but that he would introduce him and that he would do the dishes today(sunday).  I haven't heard from cliff or hannah since thursday. :( Hopefully they're on their way home...
