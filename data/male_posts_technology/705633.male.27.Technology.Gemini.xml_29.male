I went to the doctor and he's given me a medicated shampoo and some tablets. He said it's some kind of allergic reaction. Great, start the new year off looking like boiled lobster. What's even worse than looking like a lobster, is having to suffer daytime television. Crap talk shows and "How to make the perfect pasta dish" presented by some pointy haired moron. Nurse!!
