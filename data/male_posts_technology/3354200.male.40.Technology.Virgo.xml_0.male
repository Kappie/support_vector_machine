The surgery went well, but she may also have pneumonia, so she will be going to the ICU on a breathing tube after Postop.  The surgeon is confident he got all the infection.  Other than that, things are going well.  Lyn and I got back from a business trip that I took to Santa Cruz as part of my new position at work.  I snuck her into the motel room, it was fun!  It was good to see the place again, it had been a long time since I had been there.  That's it for now.
