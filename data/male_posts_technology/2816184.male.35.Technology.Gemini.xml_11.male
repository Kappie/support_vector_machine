The Conference is at the Sharpe's Lane Convention Centre and Hotel in downtown Sharpe's Lane.  The town is the county seat of Prince Rupert county and has historical roots reaching back to the original 13 colonies, having been created by charter of King Charles I in 1640.  The conference sessions themselves look eye-glazingly boring, and you notice that there are two tracks listed, a "teacher" track and a "student" track.
