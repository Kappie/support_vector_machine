Tomorow I am going to take pics of all the dead snowmen.  I am starting a new feature on anime geek called alt-command of the day. with alt-commands you can make funny symbols by holding down the alt button and pressing a combination of numbers.  todays al command is- alt-157 = ¥ (yen or japanese currency)  I have two funny comics from mega tokyo today-  *disclaimer-i own nothing*     (my reaction to this comic- "I do that too")    (reaction-"just like my room")     GÖÒÐ ß¥Ê
