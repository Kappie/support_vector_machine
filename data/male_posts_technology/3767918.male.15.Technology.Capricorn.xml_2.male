I'm rather annoyed because Lizzie wanted to stay the weekend in Bournemouth with me Kirsty and Courtney, but my parents (for the first time in years) refused to let me. So I'll only be going for the day - sometime in the summer.  I can't see Kirsty until Saturday which is annoying and it will only be in the evening. She's going shopping with her birthday money and Lizzie won't let me come because her boyfriend Courtney can't come and they were meant to be fucking all day but Kirsty dragged her along lol.  So I've got this week free. I'll probably go into town with some people and spend as much time as possible sleeping - I've been very tired recently.  Also, I've got sports day on Thursday which sucks arse. Hopefully I won't be doing anything though.  My mates Ben and Vicki broke up over the weekend. They had been going out for at least a year I think so that's a real blow. Apparently he just stopped fancying her...  But I think he still does. I think, after a certain period of time, the awe of how beautiful someone is just wears off and you kind of take it for granted how amazing they look. I'm not sure how involved the were sexually, but maybe it just got boring. I mean, if you do the same thing day after day it must just get boring and you stop looking forward to it and it seems like you don't fancy the person anymore.  cvx  Thought of the Post: How can women understand those weird whispering sounds they make to each other?!
