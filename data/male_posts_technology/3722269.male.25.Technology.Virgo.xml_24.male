Mike, a friend of mine has come round for the weekend, we're totally overloaded on sugar, laughing at everything, singing along to bad songs, making up our own words - you know.. being ...well.. being dorks :) and its great fun. I think there really is some truth to being as old as you feel. Anyway, you can just make do with a short update tonight, er, today :D ttfn
