Work life: Crap  Personal Life: Great if it wasn't for the worlds constant attempts to kick me in the teeth  Work wise things are all over the place at the moment.. In some ways things are going great in others though everything is completely up in the air. I am in a serious state of flux with no answers coming to me at all.. Grr and Arrghh that I', in this god damn situation.  Personally just when things seem to be coming together and I am in a good place something happens to remind me that someone somewhere REALLY doesn't like me.. I just can't seem to catch a break..  All of this stuff has finally managed to drain my energy reserves.. I have this store of energy that I use to keep me in a good place no matter what is going on but sometimes so many things all go wrong at the same time and I am left completely drained and emotionally void. This is my cold place and happens to be where I am currently living..  On the bright side I got Orla to wax my chest which was incredibly painful and this cream stuff I put on afterwards combined with the sweat of a night in Coyote caused me to come up in a load of painful blotches that are only just starting to fade properly now.. Yes that is my bright side :)  Actually it was very funny.. Orla took a great deal of perverse pleasure in ripping wads of hair from my chest and I have learnt that I have VERY strong hair follicles..  Hair removal is not all it's cracked up to be..
