Sometimes I wonder if I'd rather have a return to innocence.   Anyway, it turns out that my good friend Brian married Amy last month. I was really looking forward to going to their wedding. It makes me sad that we weren't able to get the contact information together so that my invite could show up and I could go to the wedding.   On the plus side, we got to set our clocks back an hour last night. So I got an extra hour of sleep. Kinda:)  Got the new Barenaked Ladies album, and so far my favorite song is 05 - for you. Peace-
