Prajapita Brahma Kumari's say that kaliyug would end round about  2009 AD. Mexican Calendar doesn't talk about existence beyond 2014 AD. Even Islam doesn't have a calendar beyond 2029 AD.... and the list just goes on..   He opined that now is the time to do your 'karma'. I read somewhere on some website that we are now indeed beyong kaliyug.. I'm confused. Need a cuppa hot coffee
