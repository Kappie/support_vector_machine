       I haven't really eaten dinner today, although I've had too many MMs. I just keep craming them into my face. I just really wasn'thungry today, although I didn't really get any exercise so its no surprise.  

 Blogger, great as it is, is giving me a little trouble. It really doesn't want to let me have my embedded XML tags in a nice format since I set the "convert carriage returns to line breaks" feature to true. I've since turned it off, which works for my posts, but it doesn't seem to work for my post template. I've sent a message to blogger support and we'll see what they come up with. This is the first real problem I've had with blogger and despite it I still feel that this is an incredible tool.  



 By the way, I've added the Web Fire Excape button on the right side of this blog (looks like a little green fire escape sign). Use it if your boss is coming...I know I will.
