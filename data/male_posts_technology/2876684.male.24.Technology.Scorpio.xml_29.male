I'm pretty grateful, my fighting needs to pick up 200% before I step out in NZ.  I was all padded up for sparring tonight and I felt like the Michelin Man for a bit, but that only meant that John could basically use more or less full contact on me, and he put me on the floor with a huge knee to the ribs. It was a pretty good hit, I went down with an almighty "ARGH!" that obviously had the others cringing...  Shihan wants to me to come up for more sparring if I'm not working over the long Easter weekend - so much for having time to heal! Oh well, it will all pay off come June. Count on it. :)
