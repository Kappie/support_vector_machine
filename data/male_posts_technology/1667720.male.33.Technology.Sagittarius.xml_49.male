I'm sure this was just a case of  urlLink DOMS  but I've also been having some pain in my hips. I suspect that my entire core (glutes,lower back, etc.) are tight but I'm not sure how to diagnose this. I've done some stretching and plan to incorporate regular stretching or yoga into my schedule. If that fails, I'm gonna try screaming "Out Satan!" at my ass. Could work. ;-)
