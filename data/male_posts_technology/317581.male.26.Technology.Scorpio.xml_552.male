I'm kind of stoked about it.  I'm still running every other day and am losing weight, so that is good. I'm still looking for a place to live, but my schedule at work has been throwing wrenches into the housing search. I wish I had time to program at work, but for now, I'm going to run some more automation stuff.  Peace- Tim
