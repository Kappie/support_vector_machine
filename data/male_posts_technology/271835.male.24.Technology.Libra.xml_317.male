Except of course the infamous networked chess Dogs and I wrote about a squillion years ago. The handover mechanism consisted of us waving at each other at opposite ends of the room to tell each other we had moved.).     Don't worry - it's not as hard as  urlLink these  - I played it in Shallow mode and beat it in 11 moves (including it's own).
