The Jews and the Muslims kick the shit out of each other, and the Christians stick their nose in (just like they have for thousands of years)making everyone even madder.  The Buddhists sit on mountains and watch and pray for peace, but don't really accomplish much else.  And although this war is supposedly based on religion, we all know in the end it's actually based on land rights.    So I have a solution.  Let's wall off Saskatchewan and Northern Quebec.  We give the Palestines Saskatchewan and the Jews Northern Quebec (or the other way around...).  Nobody lives in those two places anymore anyways, so why the hell not?  Not only that, if Quebec starts talking about separation again, we just tell the Moslems that the Quebecois are defiling their god, and they go in and kick some butt.  I think this is a fair solution for everybody.  The 25 or so Canadians that get displaced we just give them a nice home wherever else they want in Canada, along with a big tax break.  Maybe a hundred litres of free gas too.  And a case of Molson's.    Obviously some ground work would have to be laid first.  We would have to completely dismantle all the holy buildings and reinstall them in their new home.  The buildings that both the Arabs and the Jews feel are theirs we just split in half.  That way the people who are fighting now get MORE land than they had before, the freedom to do with it as they will, way better natural resources to work with, their holy places, and no contact with their sworn enemy.  The plus side to all this is that the Americans can go and secure the damn pipelines which are so fucking precious to Mr. Bush and his robber baron buddies.  We then turn all of the holy land into a completely off limits shrine, where Jews can visit some days and Moslems on other days.  You wanna go sit on the sacred soil, get a pass, a flight from regina, a battery of shots and go nuts.  Your pass will tell u what days u can go visit, and if you go on other days, well...you may face some nastiness.    I don't think it would take much of a buyout to convince the saskatchewan government of the validity of this plan, and the northern quebecers wouldn't be able to read the contract properly so we can pull one over on them pretty easily.  As far as the Jews and the Palestinians are concerned, we don't even have to tell them...just put them all to sleep or something and when they wake up in their new home with the wailing wall right there, away they go.  Or, we could use Uncle Sam's might to go in and say this is the way it is, and if you don't like it we're gonna Bertuzzi you like we did to Iraq.  Although, that may just incite more violence against westerners.  Perhaps it would be better to just draw up the plans and then ask them nicely if they'll agree.  If they won't agree, demand to know what they need to make this work.  It could happen...
