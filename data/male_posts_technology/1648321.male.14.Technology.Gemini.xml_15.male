The weekend was pretty fun. Me, my sisters, and my dad went to the Highland Grill on Saturday morning. I did some homework. I went to tennis. Oh yeah! - I forgot to tell ya that my glasses broke! They are the bendable frame, and I had shown them off so much at school that they became out of shape and was weak. I got so mad that I broke it in two other places - 3 places total! I'm lucky cause they are still under warranty. Anyway - On Saturday night I went out with my friend Zack to the movies @ the MOA! But I had to see "Good Boy!" (you know that dog/people movie). Sunday was the usual - work, work, work. But I actually got my work done early so our family had a "dance party" (it was embarrassing). Well today was okay - AM HIST sucked, in BAND we had a counting test (worth 80 points) and in FRENCH I got a redo ("see me") 10 out of 25 on a quiz we had. MATH was okay - Two HMK assignments, andcorrections as usual. We had a fire drill and I almost had a heart attack. Well I have a lot more to say but I'm running out of time - I'll tell ya more soon!
