(Of course, given the fact that I knew that I had a cold, it wasn’t the brightest idea to eat all those cookies last night) but in any event, my cold did get worse.  I am rather annoyed that it kept me from church this morning, even if it was just Southwest Hills Baptist, not Calvary Chapel.  Whatever - church is church no matter the location I guess.  I am really hoping that tomorrow is off school, cause I still don't have the final draft of my report done... I'm thinking that I probably should go attend to that...  [This was written almost an hour after the above]  Man, this is insane, I just found out that my friend Brady collapsed in the middle of service today at my church, with a migraine and went blind.  I'm talking to him on im right now... he's using voice recognition.  This is too weird...
