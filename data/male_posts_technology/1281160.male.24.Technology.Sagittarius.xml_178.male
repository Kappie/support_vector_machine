Got up at 6 am today morning after a very long time, (last time was in August, I used to get up at 4 am). My parents have left for Madurai and from there to Palayamkottai. My brother has left to Ooty. So I'm home alone till Monday.   Due to a lot of marriages to attend and birthdays, my salary has disappeared in a jiffy. So I won't and can't eat out often. So have to improve my cooking and try out new recipes.   My first experiment is today afternoon or evening, a coffee. Found a lot of recipes on coffee on the net. So will try out a couple of recipes by tonight.   Bye,
