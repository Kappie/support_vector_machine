I shall share it with you.   To avoid criticism, do nothing, say nothing, be nothing.  - Elbert Hubbard  Criticism is part of being a person of opinions ideas and action! If you want to be loved by all people all the time, wake up, or have no opinions, and make no contraversial decisions. It's also a sure-fire way of never being famous/successful/useful to society.
