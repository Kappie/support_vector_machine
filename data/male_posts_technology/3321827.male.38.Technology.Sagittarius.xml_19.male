I think he knew it would fire me up.  This article isn't even subtle in it's slant.  It's the evil rich, the evil America, etc.  Here are some notable quotes:   "People in the U.S. now don't live even as long as people in Costa Rica. Meanwhile the U.S. infant mortality rate has risen, so much so Cuba has a better success rate of bringing healthy children into the world."   "McCain-Feingold is not nearly as effective as it should be," says Lardner. The campaign finance reform act he's speaking of is easy to poke holes in this year, as John Kerry runs against George Bush's $200 million war chest."   "For one, the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy exacerbating the disparity between rich and poor."   "Members of United for a Fair Economy (who include billionaires and the wealthiest of our country, such as Bill Gates and Warren Buffett), are calling for the estate tax to remain, despite its scheduled elimination in 2010 following phased-in declines. Buffett says the estate tax helps to keep America's "meritocracy" in check. Repealing the estate tax could create an aristocracy based on wealth, he says."   "Instead of putting the nation on high red, orange or whatever color alert this summer, instead of spending almost $200 billion dollars (so far) for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and sending more than 100,000 young people to fight overseas, perhaps those resources and that money could be put to use to make us truly a more healthy nation. Wouldn't that be a more admirable model to show the world than the Abu Ghraib photos?"   "In just 14 days the problems of the poorest countries in the world -- starvation, lack of education, scarcity of potable water, etc. -- could be solved if each nation donated its military spending budget for just that period of time -- 14 days."   "As it stands, the United States and other developed nations have even fallen below their commitments to the World Bank, which helps fight social causes like poverty and education."   "Three billion people are living in "poverty" on less than two dollars per day, 800 million people lack access to basic health care, 17 million people -- including 11 million children -- die every year from easily preventable diseases and malnutrition, 2.4 billion people lack access to proper sanitation, 1.1 billion do not have safe drinking water, 275 million children never attend or complete primary school education and 870 million of the world's adults are illiterate."   The article touts Cuba as an example for medical care (don't all liberals do this?), but fails to address any of the reasons why medical care in this country is in a crisis (can you say malpractice and aging population?).  I'll address this in more detail in a future rant that I'm currently working on.  I enjoyed the whining about Kerry running against Bush's $200 million war chest.  Of course, they don't mention how George Soros has  urlLink contributed $16 million to fight Bush  .  I guess the McCain-Feingold bill not being effective to fight that sort of campaign finance abuse isn't as distressing to them.   First of all, "tax cuts for the rich" is really a misnomer.  It's a tax refund...it's YOUR money.  The government takes a position that is' THEIR money by saying cuts.  That the politicians are doing you a favor...WRONG.  It's your money to begin with. Not theirs.  Secondly, the rich pay the greatest  urlLink percentage in taxes , so naturally, they'll get more back with a tax refund.   Of course, the article doesn't address the problems with the Alternative Minimum Tax which seriously  urlLink affects the middle class .  Some of the effects can be found  urlLink here  with an example  urlLink here .  The rest of the article fails to address any of the real reasons for poverty in other countries.  It only hints at the U.S. failure to address those issues in other countries by not properly funding the World Bank and spending too much on the military and war.  The liberal solution to any problem is to throw more money at it.  Poverty may be a problem, but the underlying cause is NOT just a lack of money.  They don't mention the failure of those countries' governments to properly educate and feed their own people.  It's totalitarian and radical religious governments that fail to educate and feed their own people.  They also fail to mention the generosity of the American people who donate  urlLink 1.64% of their aggregate gross income .    Poverty is caused not only by the system, but by individuals living within the system.  In our country, it's a system that fosters government dependence rather than encouraging self-reliance.  Prior to welfare we had a system that worked.  Family, charity, and community were successful for 150 years.  The government has been tremendously unsuccessful in replicated that success.   Funny how they continue to whine about inequality...hey, they're rich and I need some money...can't Buffet, Gates, and Soros give me some since they  care  so much about inequality?  Nah, I'd rather EARN it!
