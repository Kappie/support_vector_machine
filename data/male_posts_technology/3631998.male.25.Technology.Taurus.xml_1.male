But I am not fond of pastel greens over black, don't ask me why. Maybe it's just too much Cyberpunk influence, but for me green on black has to look like it will burn your eye. Full glowing green with the faint ones being at 70% when on the minimum.  And I like blue, and blue on black too so I took some time from my working day to make this thing blue on black. Gave it some fades and tried to make the colors on the sidebar not get more attention than the post itself. So there you have it, new colors and duotoneish style.  Oh yeah, if you can't read the darker stuff, your computer screen isn't set up correctly. It's not my fault. I can read them all. Fix your brightness and contrast, I won't change it back.
