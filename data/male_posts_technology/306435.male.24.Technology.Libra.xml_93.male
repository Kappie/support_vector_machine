We were going to Tumbleweed for Margarita Monday.  Ann was driving, I was in the passenger seat and Elizabeth and Hallie were in the back.  We were stopped admiring the american flag on the Ford 150 in front of us when there was a screetch followed by a crushing sound as we flew forward.  The we drilled the truck in front of us.  Ann's car was smashed on the front and back.  The truck hit the pontiac in front of him.  The guy in the 1990 Plymouth Van got out right away saying he was sorry.  Anyway after waitng for the police and then a ride back home we are very soar.  Now Ann is with out a car until the insurrance makes a decission.   We are all so sore.  My shoulders have been tight for two solid days.   I know Ann, Hallie and Elizabeth are all sore also.  I am not sure how I am going to end this post, but I thought I needed to say something.  I am gong to work on my web page sometime soon.
