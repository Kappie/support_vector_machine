It has been a harrowing few days, and it is only now that I am able to get back to here. The power is insecure, and even now, I write only by the blessing of a battery and a plug, and the glow of the screen is my only light.   I got into contact with fboca, and he suggested... nay, insisted... that I should be moved to somewhere safer. And so it was that Virginia and myself were moved to this place. This safehouse. Safe it may be, but it is also small, cramped, and filthy. I know I shouldn't complain, because it is indeed safe. But Virginia is very uncomfortable here, as am I. I can only hope that we can findsome way to move again soon. Hopefully to somewhere that was made for two, rather than for one.  Things here are not at all secure. There is no way to get any messages out without leaving a trail that a blind man could follow. They looked incredulous that I could bring a computer here. What did they expect? That all my messages would be delivered by hand, with pen and ink? Or perhaps carrier pigeon? They promise that they can make it more secure, given time. However, for the moment, I am in search of software that will do the same.  I can only pray my people are still working. I can do little for them here, as of yet. But patience, they say, is a virtue. I can only hope that I can have enough.
