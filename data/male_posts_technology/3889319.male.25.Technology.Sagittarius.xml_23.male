It was the first time i had to work with it, but i think i'm ready for any challenge now.. I master the JDBC more than anything else that i know i'm good with.  I can't keep on studying the same materials.. I've searched for new articles and tutorials but didn't find anything new. I hope the interview will be in the near future. I wish myself good luck.
