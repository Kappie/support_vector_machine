I spent friday saturday and most of sunday with the fam at the happiest place this side of a hot hotel room. disneyland.   It was crowded and crazy, but fun. quite sunny, quite nuts. They have this new fastpass system which makes lines better sometimes, but usually just means more walking.   So many families. One would think the whole world were middle america, yeasty, sweaty, bulging and embittered, trailing children and losing money.   Well, that's a bit uncharitable. People were a bit more varied than that. But they were all losing money, of course.   ah, for childhood. I am quite refreshed and happy. Back to work!
