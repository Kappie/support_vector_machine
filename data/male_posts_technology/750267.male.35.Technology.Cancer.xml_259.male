It's interesting (to me, at least) to note that a year ago I was whole-heartedly behind the Liberals. I thought Paul Martin could do no wrong. It was a slam dunk -- landslide win for Martin. So what happened?  Well, let's start with his predecessor, Jean Chr√©tien. The man announced his retirement, and then took over 1 year to leave power. During that long kiss goodbye, he was primarily concerned with only one thing: his legacy. What would the people of Canada remember him for? Because of this need for a legacy, the federal government basically did nothing for one year. The federal government basically went on vacation. (Well, maybe they didn't, but they might as well have been since they did nothing significant in that time.)  So then Martin takes over, in November, and almost immediately afterwards a scandal breaks out. It turns out the Liberals have been diverting millions of dollars to their friends in advertising agencies. Money was being spent, with no work being done. The government was spending several times the going rate for advertising in certain publications. Basically, the man who rescued Canada from debt and deficit now leads a party that put millions and billions of our tax dollars into the pockets of its friends.  The final straw for me, however, was the negative ads that have been consistently running on behalf of the Liberals. Ever since the first week of the campaign, the Liberals have been trying to scare me into voting for them.   Oh my goodness! What will Canadians do without the centerist Liberals in power?    So in the end, I voted for "a change". Perhaps in a few years the Liberals will be humbled enough to take power again, but they took me for granted. Please don't do that again...
