Perhaps you are familiar, it goes something like this.    Dear Brain,   Thank you very much for having the forethought to see to our nutritional needs today. You did an excellent job of procuring --insert whatever you've eaten in the last 12 hours here-- and it was both delicious and contained a remarkable variety of each of the 5 food groups. After due consideration and careful processing by all of us here we have determined that --insert whatever you've eaten in the last 12 hours here-- has been relieved of all its beneficial components and is no longer required. We would like to take this opportunity to wish the aforementioned a fond farewell and ask that you, dear brain, see to its removal at your earliest possible convenience. If you are otherwise occupied at this time we completely understand and will forceably evict it ourselves in approximately 3 minutes.   Thanks again and we look forward to working with you in future.   Sincerely,   Department of Digestion    So, when presented so politely with this 3 minute deadline I felt that compliance was the best way to achieve a win-win situation for all parties and I'm all about the win-win. I abandoned my post and headed for a location more appropriate for my inteneded task. In my 3 storey workplace there are 7 different destinations that a man such as myself could head in order to carry out this task.   You may be questioning why I'm walking you through the story of my intestinal tract. It's related to the following.    Theories:      Everyone is at least somewhat crazy.    hopefully no one contests this one    A person's overall craziness is really a combination of a bunch of little bits of crazy.  Each "little bit of crazy" has a specific definition. Thus, little bit of crazy X would have the same symptoms in person A and in person B, if they both suffered from X.   So, I'm a person ergo I'm crazy. One of the aspects of my craziness is that I feel an irrational irritation when I have to perform an intestinal eviction when there are other folks in the same room or where other folks could detect the auditory or aromatic evidence of my activities. So, since I'm assuming that you are a person to, there is a good chance that some of you out there feel the same way. And, for those of you who don't share this particular craziness, you may get some insight into the craziness of others.   So, back to the story of my search for a place to satisfy my need.   Each of the 7 aforementioned locations has its pros and cons in terms of not aggravating my craziness, which is the most important consideration, that is, right up until the point where an unscheduled forceable eviction becomes an issue.       Bathroom Ratings        Location #   Occupancy  Distance  Traffic     1   Single  Same Floor  High     2   Multi  Same Floor  High     3   Single  1 Floor Down  High     4   Multi  1 Floor Down  High     5   Multi  2 Floors Down  Low     6   Single  2 Floors Down  Low     7   Single  2 Floors Down  Low     My search progressed as follows:     Location 1  Rebuffed by a locked door  Location 2  Closed for cleaning  Location 3  Closed for Maintenance  Location 4  Fully occupied     Things are getting a bit more urgent, no emergency yet, but a storm is definitely brewing     Location 5  First Stall in desperate need of some attention from the maintenance crew. Actually my initial thoughts were: Who the hell let a rhinocerous into the men's washroom? How did the rhinocerous make it past the security guards at the front gate and the receptionist at the door? What the hell were they serving in the cafeteria today?!  Location 5  Second stall...acceptable and available   I finally found a place to look after business (my business not my company's business). As I had some time on my hands I pondered bathrooms and the many unspoken rules that accompany them. I started several mental lists (note these are all rules to do with men in washrooms, I have no idea what goes on in a woman's washroom and I shudder to think of the myriad rules that a woman must learn w.r.t. using such facilities):    About talking:     If you are talking to someone and you both walk into a washroom then you may continue speaking. Just pretend that you aren't in a washroom. Ignore the surroundings. Everything is fine  You can never speak to someone when you\or they are sitting on a toilet unless it is someone you share 50% of your DNA with.  You should never strike up a conversation in the washroom unless both parties are at the sink or are headed for the door.   About eye contact:     NEVER MAKE EYE CONTACT AT THE URINAL!  The only thing worse than eye contact is eye contact after glancing down and to the left and realizing that the other guy noticed. Yes, you know you've done it...   The Most Egregious Violations:     Attempting to start a conversation with a stranger as they enter a stall.  Any physical contact with anyone using a urinal.  Any attempted hand contact from the time you finish to the time you get to the sink.  Following someone into the washroom in order to continue a conversation when you don't need to use the facilities    The Punishment:       In my opionion the only reasonable punishment for any bathroom transgression is, of course, revoking all indoor bathroom priveledges and relegating the offender to using the Port-o-John in the parking lot.     By the time I'd worked this all outI'd finished up and decided I should probably head back upstairs and get on with business (the company's ...)- quickly slipping out of the facility hopingI wouldn't pass anyone coming in who may get the mistaken impression that I was the one responsible for the horrendous physical state of stall number one or get the unfortunately correct impression that I was the culprit for the prevailing malodorousair.   I escaped undetected.
