Today one's office PC, home PC, Laptop, Mobile Phone, PDA act as local data syncs. Then there are resources from multiple service providers on the internet where one's data lives.   The amount of data that we are personally generating is increasing tremendously and as we move ahead its bound to grow bigger  bigger. Mobile phone cameras combined with blogging have already started making an impact in this direction.   In such a scenario, finding even personal information will become a challenge. Google has shown that one can search efficiently in a highly distributed environment by making it centralized very efficiently. The information on which we work personally, has to also lie on the network and the local hard discs, memory data chips will just act like a temporary cache which automatically gets synced back to the network.  For this to happen, we need to look at the Storage Vs Connectivity. Though storage costs have decreased tremendously and memory chips now form a part of wide variety of devices from watches, microwaves and every other device on which one can put hand on. But connectivity hasn't yet become seamless. To have a significant effect for next generation of digital era, connectivity must become as pervasive as memory chips are today where every digital chip is always connected to a network.  And services like google or any other service provider can then make data syncs of personal information on the network from any device. Privacy issues can be handled upto some extent via having encryption technologies, the way unix passwords are stored. Data is synced at the server, but in a secure fashion where like a unix password an administrator or a service provider can't interpret the data.  The next step would be then to apply adaptable techniques to be able to retrieve data in an adaptable fashion depending on the environment.
