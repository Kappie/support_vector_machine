There are a lot of bloggers around and many of them write really good stuff.But we find that many women, especially Indian women, are not opening up and talking the way they would like to about non-personal issues such as Politics, Sports, etc. We feel that many of the ladies are either intimidated by others or don't want to expend too much energy into maintaining a full time blog.  This blog is designed to help out in situations like that. We want women (and men) to use our space to post their thoughts, opinions any issue that is of interest to them, as long as it is not the recipe for the day's breakfast or details of their love life (not that there is anything wrong with that).  We want women to speak out here, like there is no one listening. We know they have a lot to say when they are between friends and we want this to be a place like that - where people speak freely, and there is a free exchange of ideas.   I think this is a great idea. It is good to see Blogs being used for something positive and worthwhile. Let us have more efforts like this!! :-)
