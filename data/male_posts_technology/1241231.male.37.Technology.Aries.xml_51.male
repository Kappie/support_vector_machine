Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone claims she is at last moving to release children from detention centres (as reported in The Age on Saturday). Good. But why didn't this decision come years ago? Moreover, the figures the minister uses are fudged; many more people remain incarcerated than she claims are released; families are being deliberately split up as a result of Government policy; and the duress put on children is still appalling.
