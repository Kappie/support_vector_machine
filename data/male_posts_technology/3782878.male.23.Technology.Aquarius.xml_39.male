Well the 4th went pretty well for us. I worked for the day(time and a half woohoo) which is okay since all the good stuff happens at night anyway. I went directly to my soon to be father in laws where Tigger and my Son had been hanging out most of the day. I had a beer and relaxed for a bit, while the ladies made macaroni salad. and I must say I'm not usually a terribly huge fan of a lot of people's recipes for egg based salads. but this macaroni salad is pretty good. and Tigger has learned the art of making it, so I'm hoping to see some in my home someday soon :P  I ate Chicken and Potato Wedges and Macaroni salad for dinner, it was very good. and I helped my youngest Brother in Law with smoke bombs and found some unfired black cats amongst the carnage in their backyard. we did this until it was time to go to the big Fireworks show at Harrah's Casino(I still don't know why Iowa wants to pronounce Harrah's (which I pronounce harrah! like when you are applauding something) like Harris. it's not Harris, it's Harrah!) which was very awesome, my son got a kick out of it, and the place we sat at you'd swear the fireworks were going to rain down right on you. they were huge! Very good show. Anyway, we drove back, me being completely dehydrated for a little home fireworks display setup by the brother in laws.   The brother in laws had mortars to fire off, the first couple went off well, then the brother's got the idea to try to link them together 2 at a time. well, when they lit them off, the tube got knocked sideways and the mortar fired off screaming right toward a neighbors house and blew a big scorch mark on the neighbor's garage door. my Father in law was pretty ticked off at what my brother in law did, but my fiance said he would probably just do some free mowing's to cover the expense if any to be had fixing that garage door.  Second botch came right after the first. the littlest brother in law didn't understand how to load a mortar in the tube correctly, so he placed the ball end down, which of course by any who have fired these lovely night time toys, is upside down. He lit it off, and backed away, all the sudden we head the thump of the propellant fire off, but we didn't see the mortar leave the tube, we all screamed for the kid to run away from the tube, and he was almost hit by the flaming sparks as the mortar tube blew into pieces.  After that the evening returned to normal. But I must say a lot of funny and cool things happened that night. it was a blast!   Try not to feed the stupid people Phoenix
