I got a few cables/adapters so now I can hook it up to my GameCube for portable gaming anywhere! It's pretty sweet! ;-) Also, I went to Ax-Man twice this weekend to get some cool junk. It was cool (and funny). I got a real old bowling pin, a "NO TRESPASSING" yellow strip, and a stupid tiny metallic lunch box. And I now have complete virtual control over all computers on our small home network - which includes my mom and dad's computer! ;-) This is enough to say for now, but I could go on... and on... and on...
