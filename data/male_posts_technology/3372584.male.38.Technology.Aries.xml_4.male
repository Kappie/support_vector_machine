I suspect the true measure of how vunerable we are is somewhere in the middle between the nay sayers and the ones saying the sky is falling.  I have been playing and working with computers for nearly 25 years now and I believe that there is a great potential for disaster, how great is hard to measure but I think we could suffer a much more devistating impact financially then 9/11. A large part of our infrastructures rely on the internet, something that was not really designed to be secure, it was designed to allow for the free flow of information and ideas, but we are asking the internet to handle more and more traffic that requires security. Obviously the two ideas clash and we end up with problems.  Large distributed companies used to send their information over closed proprietary networks that only they saw. This in of itself lent a fairly high degree of security, but the internet provided a cheap alternative so the switch was made. Many companies probably began using the internet without a second thought to security, a lot still do. Unfortunatly alot of the time it's not until they get breached in a noticable way that they begin to think about security.  Anyway that's my two cents worth.
