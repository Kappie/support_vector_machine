Just save so much trouble but lacking the sweet and nice experience also the bad experience. But again getting married also can divorce and what's the point then?  When can I find the other partner of mine? This is what i been thinking and could the next gf of mine be my wife and stop it so at least I can concentrate on my family and something worth while with to continue. It is no longer those having fun thingy of just to be together and enjoy romantic moments....it is about life time commitment...AND I am not in a hurry as well.  I was thinking to buy a web camera for my blog so people can see what I have done in my room. And I want to buy a steaming machine to steam my shirts instead if ironing it when the blardy small ironing board cannot fit my shirt properly. Ok I am fat and tall....that explains why normal stuff to me is not normal.  I come to realise what a friend of mine had say....It is not about small unhappy things that you can put off which succeed you but it is more about putting off those super unhappy stuffs which can affect you so emotionally that make you becoming a better and more successful person.
