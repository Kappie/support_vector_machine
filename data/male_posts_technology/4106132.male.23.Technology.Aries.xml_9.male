It has all happened so fast but I'm really excited about it. Think I am going to be broke for a year.  Been working on this site thing - being a former computer geek I thought that I should really code this site to make it look unique instead of the same as thousands of other peoples. I've kinda given up on that now. I hate computers  couldn't be bothered spending the time coding stuff.  Anyway it's late  I need my bed. I've been sleeping in way too late these mornings   never make it into work on time.
