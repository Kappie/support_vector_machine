Now I am out in the open.  It is neat to change perspective, but I wish I was still sitting by Sue...I just don't like change. The show Smallville is pretty cool.  I watched it tonight.  I also went to Sitwells with Ann and Kristin W. ... it was cool.  I had a Turtle Mocha, it was the best one I have ever had.  Kristin had never been before...so it was cool that she got to go.  I always think of Kate when I go...especially when Ann thinks about ordering humuss...yuck. I hope Kristin Hill is doing okay...I didnt see her online today.  I know she is okay though, she has her family with her and that is all that really matters. Well, that is all I really have to say tonight...not that I ever have to say anything...until next time...
