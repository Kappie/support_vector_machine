We got to the Park at 10:00 and hit every ride by the time we were finished.  I have quite the sunburn.  Today the General took it on the chin again.  We lost 8 or 9 to 3.  I went 2-2 with three RBI's from my first homerun of the season.  It was a small field, but I hit it pretty hard.  Have a double header next week.
