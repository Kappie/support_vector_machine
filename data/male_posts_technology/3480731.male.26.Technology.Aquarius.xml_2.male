I was one of the few that saw  Pitch Black  when it first came out in 2000 and, like many, liked Vin Diesel's character Riddick. Beyond the fact that Riddick was a badass who seemed to be super human, he had what has now been dubbed in the new film "eyeshine". Eyeshine is what gives Riddick's eyes that blue glow. It allows him to see in total darkness; the darker it is, the better he sees. Of course, if he is in a bright place, he cannot see very well at all(which is why some pictures of him have him wearing his signature goggles). This all comes into play in  Pitch Black , when his ability to see in the dark is all that stands between the crash survivors and a squishy end.  I would highly recommend seeing  Chronicles Of Riddick ; especially if you're into action / adventure movies. Also, if you have the time and are inclined, check out  Pitch Black  before you see  Chronicles . There are a few characters and references to it in  Chronicles  and you can enjoy the film a bit more cause you'll be "in the know".   Yes, I do other things beyond watch wrestling and movies...but they are both two of my stronger passions and Blogs are about passions, correct? :)  "You're not scared of the dark, are you?"
