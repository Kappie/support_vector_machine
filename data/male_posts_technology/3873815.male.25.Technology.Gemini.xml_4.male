Went to see I, Robot as i'm an Azimov fan I decided that it might not suck and actually be worthy of the mans vision.  It is!  Will Smiths overacting was actually needed for some of the bit's in the film (not giving anythig away, just go watch it).  The backdrop was spectaculare, the visuals stunning and the story, well, i'm very suprised someone could actually pull of an Azimov based story without his help, him being dead and all.  It's well thought out and planned, and it's a compelling storyline, it comes hightly recomended.  So, after watching such and excellent film (The last one i saw at the cinema being Charlies Angels 2, what a pill of shit!) what could possobly put me in such a miserable fucking mood?  Well, i had to take the bus there (5 passed by, all full) and it took me 30 mins of waiting till i finally got a ride.  But on the way back, things were going smoothly, until i got to the town centre.  I had to transfere to another bus, and i could be at home inside fifteen minutes.  A half an hour later, me and twelve other people were still waiting for the damn thing to arrive.  Considering that there should be one every 5 minutes, it was begining to ruin my day.  Almost an hour later, an alternative bus pulls up (goes NEAR to were i live) and i decide to catch that one and get home with a littl bit of a walk involved.  So, just t reiterate, 30 minutes spent waiting for a bus earlier in the day.  An hour in the evening, and it's not over yet.  We have areas of the town which are heavy traffic zones so no pedestrians are allowed to walk down them (too many accidents and a few deaths prompted this) and the bus is in the middle of one when it suddenly looses power.  We broke down.  And we couldn't get off either, as it was rush hour and we were boxed in.  We had to wait almost an hour till a replacement bus arrived, and then had to transfere whilst the police halted traffic.  Un-fucking-real.  I'm now traveling home on the SHORTEST route and it's taking me 2 hours.  If i'd known, i'd have walked, it would have only taken me 30 minutes.  It's now 2 and a half hours wasted traveling in humid heats on a vehicle thats mostly glass.  Yeah, I was just pissing peachy.  Bought a chippy meal (for our none english readers, I ordered takeaway food), and fucked off home to eat it.  Three fourteen year old girls tried soliciting me (thats a first, i can tell you) and I was told I was the scum of the earth by a passing drunk.  Considering all this, i should have stayed at the cinema and watched Garfield.  Instead, i decided to wait till monday to do that (yeah, like i got anything better to do).  In other news, I started playing City of Heros (CoH) a few weeks ago, and have decided to make my primary character my healer, called Hagan.  Been tricky trying to figure out what character to go for, but i decided to settle with him fr 2 reasons.  1) It's a support class, and i like playing them. 2) Healers tend to get more respect off of other players, and less harrasment (lets face it, would you piss you doctor off whilst you bleeding all over the floor?).  The bad side is your either always in demand, or you get everyone trying to get you into there supergroup.  I recently found out that no-one likes playing them, as they have shit defencive and offencive capabilities, and you have to spend so much on them to keep them safe.  Also, going solo is not a good idea.  Still, i got some friends who have got a Super Group up and running so ill join them, and carry on as normal, see where it all takes me.  Updates soon.
