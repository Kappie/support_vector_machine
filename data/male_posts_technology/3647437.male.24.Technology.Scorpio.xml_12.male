More updates to follow once I stop long enough to write up my NY adventures…    ---    A painful flight after a week of subdued nervosa-anxiety resulted in Simon arriving at San Francisco tired but present in body if not mind or lacking his usual sweet temperament.    My short flight to Auckland was marred by the knowledge that I had left my cell phone charger in my bedroom – I was annoyed with myself to say the least.  Oh well, something else to track down in New York (since done!)    I nearly left my digital camera at an Auckland McDonalds after a tea break but an ever weary Nathan and Greg spotted it in their car - good work chaps!  I think they’re now used to me leaving stuff behind.  Maybe I’ll grow out of that habit.    The flight to San Francisco was long.  Very long.  There is nothing like wanting to be somewhere to make the getting there drag out over an eternity.    I was in a middle seat of the left hand isle in cattle class meaning that the 55 year old yoga teacher who has 3 sons, one of which is completing a Ph.D and is looking at moving somewhere so both he and his girlfriend can see each other more, had to climb over me every time she needed to run through some self empowering pilates routine, or take a toilet break.  It didn’t help that this lady had prostate issues (you figure it out?).  She had this neat trick though where she would leap, poised and graceful like from arm rest to arm rest into the aisle and back again.  This lady was the Cat Woman crossed with Yoda.    The other middle aged woman on my right had no issues with sleeping.  In fact she was so comfortable sleeping that she performed a ‘tower of piza’ routine onto my middle 1/3 of the bench every 15 minutes.  This was irritating.    To add to the surrealism of the trip I downed a rather potent little sleeping pill which made me incredibly drowsy and somewhat doped up for a few hours.  How the sweet escape of sleep taunted me as it came tantalizingly close, only to be chased off by the previously mentioned space invading passenger slumping onto my counter balancing shoulder.  This caused my body to pivot on the opposing butt cheek.  The outcome of this whole cyclic ordeal was that I didn’t sleep a whole lot and remained in a spacey and somewhat irritable condition.  I gave each butt cheek a fair turn at being my body cushion before I finally declared defeat and watched an in flight movie.  At the conclusion of play my iPod was declared most valuable player along with the egg based breakfast option I chose about 2 hours prior to landing.    Watching the San Francisco hills protrude from fog was exciting.  Seeing America loom through the clouds for the first time gave my somewhat addled nerves a second wind.  I’ve had 3rd, 4th and 5th winds since seeing as it’s now 10:45pm Pacific time and I haven’t slept in two and a half days!  I managed to get through customs in good time although nearly got into trouble with a man with a very big gun for taking a photo inside the customs area.  Apparently this was a threat to national security.  Funny how compliant one will become when faced with a sidearm bearing homeland security full metal jacket type.    Robyn and Steve’s friend, the lovely Gratia (pronounced Gray-shia), met me at the metallic and futuristic looking SFO airport.  We trundled my gear around and onto the BART (Bar Area Rapid Transport).  BART whisked us underground north through and under the greater Bay area.  We traveled through the city, Berkley, Oakland and eventually arrived in Layfette where Robyn and Steve live.    Lafayette is a sleepy SUV laden city fully furnished with parks and trees.  It feels like a small town built in a sparse forest with all the trees and hills sprouting out from the manicured lawns.  Gratia was the ultimate host.  She fed and watered me and we went for a fascinating drive around the local area.  We stopped at a cute super market and discussed the properties of Root beer with the locals.  American super markets are something to behold.  Talk about choice.  We bought a tub of vanilla ice cream to have with our root beer floaters – the American equivalent of a spider made with root beer.  Then we sat in the shade at Robyn and Steve’s leafy abode and watched squirrels, robins and the cat all frolic together.  The cat got a bird and I felt compelled to intervene and rescue it.  That was a drama in itself.  I’ve only been here one day and already I deserve a complementary Sierra Club membership.  Robyn came home from work, Steve was in San-Diego for the weekend so haven’t met him yet.  We had Italian for dinner before I finally collapsed into bed.  I have a 6 hr flight to NY tomorrow which should be fun.    ---    Observations:    Every second house having a US flag on the porch.  It’s kinda cool that people are proud of where they live and think  bout what it means to belong to a bigger community.    Americans like really big cars.  The kind they open new iron ore factories to build and generally have massive 4.5 – 5 litre engines.  They are everywhere.    Soccer moms.  Gratia explained that these are the types who have big glasses, permanently attached cell phones and ferry little Timmy to and from soccer practice in their goliath sized cars.  Maybe they are expecting to traverse a river or gorge along the way?  Ahh – the illusion of safety.    The people are really friendly.  The laid back approach of the Californian’s is apparent.  The wonderful hospitality of Robyn and Gratia was much appreciated.  Thanks heaps guys!    Finally - seeing a squirrel!  They have puffy tails.  Tee Hee.    ---    [end]
