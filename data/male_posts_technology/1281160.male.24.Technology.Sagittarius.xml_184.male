The word 'prepone' is used by most people (mostly subcontinental people) to mean the opposite of , i.e. move forward in time. Nothing wrong in using it , though if Sinduja and Valli use it in Uk or US, people might think they are blabbering. The right word to use would be 'advance' like "My final compre has been advanced". Note the 'has been' - past tense. You shouldn't use 'is advanced' - It is wrong.  Hope this small bit of grammar has been useful to you,
