I dont need to know what goes on in the house that I live in. It's not like i live here or anything. I'm tired of all the shit that goes on in my house. Even chris noticed it when he came over. He was like "Ok, wtf? Your house seems like it would be a TENSE place to live in." Everyone in this house keeps things from one another. I always try to tell everyone where I'm going, and what I'm doing. No one EVER bothers to tell me these things. Is that too much to ask? To know where the people that you live with are? I'm tired of the bs that adam does, too. I ask him, "Hey, what's that?", and he's looking at a piece of paper, or reading a book, and he replys with a sassy "Nothing, nick, absolutely nothing." Then, in my head, i'm thinking to myself, "what the hell? what was that for?" then I go on and try to think of what I did to deserve it. At least, that's what I used to do. Now I've realized that adam is a fucking little prick. That NEVER thinks of anyone but himself. Same thing goes with his damn mother. Never anyone but ADAM, she thinks about. She thinks about/does things for adam more than she does things/thinks about my dad!!!! What the!?!? No WONDER adam's a spoiled little bitch. No WONDER he never does his homework. His mom always does it for him. The SECOND he gets into college, (knowing him, he'll end up in an ivy league, sheerly by mooching on his mom) he's going to flunk. He never does anything for himself. I always see victoria reading the books that he needs to read for a project, and writing notes down. Sometimes, she writes the ENTIRE paper for him! All he has to do is type it, and he complains! God damnit. I hate him. I hate the way he looks. I hate the way he talks. I hate the way he walks. I hate the way he treats people.  I really shouldnt be talking about the way he treats people. I'm just as much of a jackass. I talk about things to people that shouldnt know these things.    Are you listening?  [/life]  (In case anyone is thinking that I'm gonna take a knife to my wrist, or sport a spiffy russian necktie, no worries, I'm too much of a pansy to off myself.)
