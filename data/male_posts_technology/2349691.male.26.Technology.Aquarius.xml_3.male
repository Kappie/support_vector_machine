After the  Romantic , the  Wild Man from Borneo , the  Bike-Push  and the  Great White Hope , Ladies and Gentlemen, I present you, the  Patriot . What is so special in this, you might ask. Well, he is the first one after the great Mahatma Gandhi to have  started the "Quit India" movement, or rather re-started. Whoa there.. wait a minute.. we thought the Britishers were peacefully sipping Indian tea and smoking India Kings in their colonial mansions back home in England, with only delusions of grandeur for company. Well, who said anything about the Britishers quitting India. Yes, milord. It is the Indians this time who have to quit India. Where to ?? The United Old States, where else ??   The  Patriot  has a ravenous appetite. You have to see it to believe it. Buckets of rice, disappearing in minutes. Chappathis being gobbled by the dozen. He once said (It was more like an open question), "Guys, of late I am getting fatter, dunno why". We consoled him, "Dear, it must be the combined effects of the sudden climate change and the El Nino and the impending Iraq War. Don't you worry about it".  He is an avid trekker. The lazy guys in our usual trekking gang (includes me) usually forms a committee to veto the suggestions put forward by him. To tell you the truth, it not only makes our life easier, but makes his life easier too. Fact being, enthusiasm apart, he is just another pot-bellied not-fully-fit guy like us. (Ooops.. girls, please ignore the previous sentence).
