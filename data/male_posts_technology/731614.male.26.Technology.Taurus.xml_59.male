Friday was for lettin' off steam. Friday was the glorious day when the whole weekend was laid out before us like a summer vacation...  Not anymore.  Now Friday is for waiting... At least it is for me. Waiting for Monday. When I can go back to work. WORK?!?! Are you fucking kidding me? How psycho am I?   Work is the one place where I feel like I'm accomplishing something... Oddly enough. It seems like at least one of the aspects of your life is always going... O.K.   Let's have a party! Right here! I'm suckin' down an MGD as we speak! Join me!
