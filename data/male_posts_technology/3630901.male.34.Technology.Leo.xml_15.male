A lot of fun, but at times I got fed up with the group and the close-clustering of bikes - happens frequently on group rides.  On the way back, I got ahead of the group, then waited at the top of a hill, but they never came -- waited a good 5 minutes.  Then I thought maybe I'd taken a wrong turn, or they went a different route, and should I go back and try to find them?  I was low on water and getting tired already, so I figured I'd just go on ahead.  The only problem was I wasn't exactly sure which way to go.  But I made it back alright.  I thought for sure the group would be there already, eating lunch, but I was waiting a good 5-10 minutes before they started to arrive.    Weather-wise it was nearly perfect -- overcast in the morning, but the fog burned off by late morning / noontime.  We rode from Pat's condo through Milford, Orange, and to West Haven -- all along the shoreline, mostly flat.  It was so relaxing.  She's got a condo right on the beach.  I ate lunch on the seawall, looking out on the sound.  Her mom also brought out watermelon for everyone and tuna salad for sandwiches.  I couldn't get enough watermelon, until I realized I ate too much.  Nonetheless, we soon got underway for the kayak trip for the afternoon.  I was a little unsure of myself and how steady the kayak would be, but soon enough I was comfortably paddling along.  I kept up with the group pretty well at first, but soon grew tired.  At one point two people turned and went back  ... they later reported that they saw the rest of us paddling but not going anywhere -- that must have been where we had a head wind and were going up-current -- it was quite frustrating.  Kayaking around was a lot of fun, but it was tiring, and I fell behind the rest of the group.  I wanted to just sit out on the water and relax and watch birds, but I felt I should try to catch up.  That afternoon, L told me that Ivy was at her parent's house, while Aidan stayed at home.  I got him up from his nap, played with him outside, walked down to the check the mail, and then he an L had some dinner.  I cleaned up my office, which was a pigsty, so that it would be at least half-presentable.  After dinner, Aidan came into my office and we played together, while L went down to her dungeon to do phone and email and match.  I re-discovered an Opus III CD while Aidan zoomed a lego car around.  I would have loved to play with Aidan for longer, but I had friends coming over for poker night, so I got him ready for bed.  While I was reading him a story, the first visitor arrived, and L was uncormfortable enough where she finished with Aidan while I entertained my guest.  Poker was a lot of fun, too -- guys from work and Dean played.  I was up for most of the night, but then lost near the end, as I started to get bleary eyed and had trouble concentrating (or maybe I just started losing) - down $10 for the night.  Not bad for an evening of entertainment with friends.    Father's day was a bit of a letdown in comparison to Saturday.  I worked a little in the morning, and then wasted time playing a computer game until L got home with Ivy and Aidan from breakfast with her folks at the diner.  L then wanted to clean up the house, so I took the kids outside and played with them in the tent.  I also did a little weeding on the front walk.  We then went inside, and I was feeling very irritable / antsy.  So while L watched the kids I went out for an hour.  I was going to go to the grocery store to buy a few things - and L gave me a list of things she wanted - but instead I drove around Milford, looking at potential houses.    L had dinner ready when I got home, but was upset that I hadn't gone to the store.  I didn't give an explanation.  After dinner, I played with the kids some more and L got ready for her date.  She left at some point - I didn't hear her say she was going.  I put Aidan to bed first, then I got Ivy ready and then we went outside to sleep in the tent.  I read her a few stories, and tried to lay down in the tent, buy my allergies were killing me.  So Ivy suggested we go back in.  I put her to bed, and then played on the computer for a little while, before watching six feet under.
