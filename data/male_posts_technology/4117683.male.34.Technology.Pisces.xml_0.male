Cos I was on heroin! Now I am sober, and getting better mentally. I am somewhat ready to move on...   Humm what did I do today.. I helped my dad paint... I hate painting.. But I got to hang out and work with my dad, and got to listen to music too.. I got him to listen to  urlLink Hedwig and the Angry Inch  He enjoyed it. There is now Midnight showings!  Well I need to get some sleep... I actually need to work!  Lates!  [Listening to: Welcome To The Machine - Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here (07:30)]
