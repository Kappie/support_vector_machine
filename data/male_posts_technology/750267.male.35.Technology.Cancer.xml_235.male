Do Canadian companies really have a shot at winning those contracts? I mean, these contract usually go to reliable U.S. Department of Defense suppliers, people who donate lots of money towards the President's reelection, that sort of thing. We should just shrug our shoulders and say, "So what?".   I guess I understand the reasons why the Prime Minister had to "pretend" to be upset: (1) If somebody insults Canada, the Prime Minister cannot say "That's ok. We deserved it". They have to be offended, even if we deserved it. (2) Canada is contributing MONEY to the Iraq reconstruction project, even if we're not involved in the actual war. So shouldn't the "moral support" count for something?  In other Iraqi news, it looks like the U.S. government is paying $2.50 a gallon for gas in a country in which the average street price is $0.15 a gallon. Those are the type of government contracts companies are bidding for? That's a sweet deal for the Kuwati company who got the government to agree to that!
