Sensei came down this evening and Richard wasn't around. Sensei seems to be down more often these days. Maybe he plans to discipline the dojo personally. Alamak *slaps forehead*, forgot to check with Sensei where I can train on a Sun. Even paying $5 per session seems well worth it to occupy some of my free time.    Beginner    Sakai came down to help with the mats and watch. I'd have to say, he's definitely one of the more committed beginners I've seen. Probably due to his grounding in Judo since young. He had to opt out for the night because he was having a stomache upset.   I started with the beginner (husband to the European lady, who so happened to be absent yesterday). He was stiff, very much so than most I've came across.But I suppose that's understandable considering the fact that it's only his first month with us or so. Anyway, I really didn't know how to train with him. Felt very difficult to explain Ikkyo omote and ura to him. When told of what he was doing wrong, he made the classic mistake most Singaporeans would; nodding head and going "Oooh" when he still don't understand it. These days, I try to remind myself not to go "Orrrrh" when I don't understand what I'm taught on the mat.   To digress a bit, I'm amused as I remember some of the things I recall coming from Tang. Sometimes, after training with him and Frankie comes over to correct and give pointers, I would go "OK" or "Orrh". Then Tang will just say "You understand what he's saying? Wah you damn steady. I train here 3 yrs still don't understand and you come here 2 weeks can understand liao. Harharhar!"  Anyway, training with beginners works a little in contrast to what I have to say in the next section below. With beginners, you have to feel in a different way how they react to you. Naturally you can't get to physical or violent with them. Anyway, my parter thinks too much in his techniques rather than just train. He would constantly ask me "Right or wrong?", "OK?", "Can?", etc. As nage, 85% of the time he was the one moving around me instead of me being moved. Sensei came over to help a few times but it was still difficult as he seemed to need more supervision than any of the others. Sensei rotated me out and slotted Leon in. But it kinda had the blind leading the blind effect. He asked if Cryssabella is willing to take him through Ikkyo but she said no. So in the end Sensei took him and Leon while he left us with one or two techniques which we could train by ourselves.   Cryssabella (spelling... err??) / Sunny    First experience training with Cryssabella and I gotta admit she is a bit more rough on ukes as compared to any other females I've came across. She's a4th kyu I think. 3 of us (including Roxanne) did some sumi otoshi - corner drop if I'm not mistaken, and the first time Crys did it on me turned out to be a slam. I wasn't exactly ready for it but I did breakfall enough to get out unscath (whew). Turns out she loves to slam (though Sensei did tell her that her slams needs slight improvements on her landings). Then we did a series of iriminage (suwariwaza) and I thought she did it pretty hard as well. First person I was reminded was Jesse, where his Iriminage  definitely  worked on you. FOr the rest of the evening, she just reminded me of Sunny. Where an uncommitted attack on him means uke rarely moves enough or properly, then that's when Sunny  moves  you instead. Same thing with Crys. She knows enough to move/offbalanceyou. But I'm not sure she considers enough onthe welfare of her uke to remember how much breakfall then can tahan from her.  Despite it being so, I found that she usually can't control her strength. Hence, her reputation for being hard and rough on others. She may seem violent if she trains with beginners. Sensei has said that she should be training with people in BV instead (but heard it's a bit far for her and parents don't quite allow it). I agree, she would probably pick up much faster if she actually tried training with aslightly different crowd.
