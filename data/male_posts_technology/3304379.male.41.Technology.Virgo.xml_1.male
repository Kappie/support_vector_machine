Thanks outlook!    Of course, have to respond to each reply...  names have been changed, confidential stuff left out.  -----Original Message-----  From:   Some guy that works in another department.

Wrong department, similar name.  Thanks Outlook! Subject: Special Flowers     XXXX,   When I think of you I think of flowers that are flowery.   You make my time here so special.  The things I learn from you make me want to be more like you.   I am glad you are my friend.   We should go camping.   -XXXX    My response to e-mail below.  Reply-all  I am glad you guys included me in on the camp out.   Since I am from the south (south Carolina) I can bring my special cast iron skillet, set line (we have to camp near a body of water so I can catch our food, kill it, or both) and a jug of stump water.   Not any ole stump water, but Burl Cadaverine's new barrel aged with new cherries he puts in straight from the tree, lets them soak for a month to impart a slight cherry flavor, then racks and we have a peanut boil and cherries.  I broke my nose last year at the annual event and my friend lost a toenail, but I digress....   I will bring my copper worm meal for the fish.  Can someone bring a frog gig and miner hat (with a halogen bulb please...) ?   I can't  wait!  yarddog  -----Original Message-----  From:   Some guy that works in another department.  Thanks Outlook!

Thanks Outlook! Subject: FW: Special Flowers     Hello Yarddog,   I believe this email was intended to go to XXXX instead of you.  Sorry for the intrusion.   There is a lot of team building going on right now between XXXX division and XXXX division so the level of enthusiasm is running a bit high right now.  Please disregard.   Thank you.

Subject: RE: Special Flowers   Can I still come camping with you guys even though this e-mail came to me by accident?  -----Original Message-----  From:    Some guy that works in another department.

Subject: RE: Special Flowers       Apparently Yarddog really wants to go camping.  He knows a good spot up by lake Okeechobee.   XXXX, it sounds as though you only intended this to be for XXXX and yourself.  Is there room for everyone, cuz I wanna go now.    -----Original Message-----  From:    Yarddog Sent:    Tuesday, August 12, 2003 5:45 PM  To:      People I don't work with.

Last time Brent and I went camping, I took him snipe hunting. Imagine to my surprise, he bagged a snipe.   This had a rough ending and I lost a lot of camping gear as it was dark and he actually bagged a rare species of bird called a "Purple Sandpiper"    urlLink  Purple Sandpiper    I didn't know it was rare, and we fried it up in my skillet with swamp cabbage.  The game warden came, (she was also a card carrying member of PETA), she freaked out, pulled out her stun gun on Brent and by the time she jammed it in my neck, the batteries were run down.   I threw Olive oil in Brent's face (trying to cut back on LDL's) to wake him from his cadaver state.  Little did I know, his heart had stopped from the continuous electric shock so when I kicked him in the chest, he awoke.   He had a look on his face like a kid who just popped a charred, burnt, marshmallow in his mouth and the inside marshmallow goo that is still at boiling temp meets the tongue and sears it.   We both ran like kittens when you start up the vacuum cleaner when she pulled out her revolver and started randomly shooting and yelling that this was the first time the park had ever seen a purple sandpiper, and we had eaten it.   She was fireball mad, but we made it back to my truck (with fake bullet holes, see black S-10 in XXXX parking lot) and got out of there faster than a pack of doves at a cat show.   So, count Brent in too.  He has a 12 foot frog gig that is the envy of any everglades  hermit living on one of the 10,000 islands they now call home.   yarddog
