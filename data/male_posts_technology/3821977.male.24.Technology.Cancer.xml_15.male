I began my vacation receiving my new computer parts from the internet and upgraded my computer in anticipation for Doom3 which i promptly picked up 2nd day from Frys for 13 dollars. I slept all week long as to make sure i was fully rested for each day of doom3 that promptly ensued.   Mind you Doom3 never came before 12 as this would be an insult to a vacation such as this. The game is quite simply amazing. I've never had an experience like this unless you count in 96' when a copy of the leaked quake fell into my lap. I have been terrified all week long walking ever so slow with my flashlight gripped tight. I hear a noise and turn but it's nothing..just the cooling down of the sewer pipes that clutter the cramped confines of the shithole i'm in. I turn back around to continue on my path when a godamed monster jumps out and scares the shit out of me. It's a very tense feeling playing this game. I feel like my life has taken on a fresh load of stress ever since D3 fell in my lap. I'm 10 levels in on the game and have since picked up the plasma and chaingun. I saw the bfg9000 in action from some other npc's that were in a cutscene and it looks breathtaking. I upgraded to some beta 4.9 catalyst drivers and Winxp Sp2 last nite. I'm doing everything in my power to increase the fps to the point where 1024 is a reality.   I also attended Charlene's sisters marriage. I was the cameraman and did everything in my power to make the cinematography on par with a high budget action film. Lots of camera zooms in at Charlene. I caught the garter belt and Charlene caught the bouquet. ok more later. This post was dedicated to Alex as he seems to push me more on the blog wars scene than anyone realizes.
