Then, he leaned to the right and let the disproportionate weight of his noggin' turn him over! It was quite a cool thing to see. He's a week shy of three months old, so it's not phenomenal, but it's cool to see. I guess we'll have to start really watching where we put him so he doesn't fall off. Like the roof of the car. And the roof of our house.
