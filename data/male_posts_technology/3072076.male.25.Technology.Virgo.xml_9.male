When I finally could not think of anything else even after giving it so much thought, I thought  T h o u g h t s ...   would look like a title I was thinking about.   So hereafter  urlLink http://piyushgaryali.blogspot.com  would take you to the 'thoughts' of Piyush Garyali. Gee, I guess I should get back to work now.
