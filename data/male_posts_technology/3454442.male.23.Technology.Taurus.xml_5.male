The reason the Met, et al. took his name off is that he pledged that $20 million for a specific show and refused to let them postpone the opening.  All the Met wanted was a short time to garner the requisite liquidity so they could host the production without any adverse effect on their fisc.  Vilar wanted the usufructs of the donation (the show) without the obligation (the $20 million).  I have been saying for years, and continue to say now, that Alberto Vilar is still trying to revel in his aristocratic upbringing.  It's nice and all that he made so much money in the stock market; I'm sure it was hard work and took much effort.  But now he expects to be treated as a demi-god when he passes out his dough.  That status needs to be earned, not hoisted upon one.  At least one other institution is still waiting for an $18 million check so they can finish (lo, pay for) a building that he wanted (and he suckered a certain college president into foolishly supporting).  I've met Alberto Vilar once--at a concert with the Vienna Chamber Orchestra.  His hand shake was cold and his stance was almost "who are these peons talking to me".  I was very put off, and have only seen more of his pomposity radiated in his "donations" and now current "victimization" as a result of his reneging.  Retribution is horrendous; but it stings the most when he who deserves it ignores his own culpability.
