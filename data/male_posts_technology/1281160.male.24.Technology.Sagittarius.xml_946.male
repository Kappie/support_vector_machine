Beautiful movie, with good music and good acting and on top of all, excellent theme. The core is similar to what happens in Mahabharatha. Yes, When the japanes king decides to modernise his army, the warriors riot against it (not just like that, but since he employs modernisation in a way against their core values). The samurai leader, though the teacher of the king, cannot correct the king when his student(the king) takes a wrong decision. This is similar to all those great stalwarts in the Hastinapur, who were unable to educate dhuriyodhana when he decides to fight against pandavas.    Ultimately, the samurai leader gives his life for his cause and only then the king realises his state. But by then, they had lost the entire set of legendary warriors. Excellent are the dialogues, though u need to have an idea of the subject dealt.    If u see, superficially, u might think, y these samurai's are fighting against the king, but they do, coz, he does so without understanding the age old tradition of fighting and he takes up the words of those who work for their own welfare rather than the nation. Samurai forces were built to protect the nation and there lies the entire interest. But the king is interested in just modernising and strengthening the army with more arms and ammunitions and training them. so there comes a conflict in his motive of modernising and doing it at the cost of losing the tradition. But what is their tradition, that u will have to grasp from the movie! So do film it and view it ya.   Hei u know what guys............. yesterday i went to a concert ya. To Pandit Jasraj and L. Subramniam's concert. Both are stalwarts, the former in Hindustani Vocal and the later an international Violinist.
