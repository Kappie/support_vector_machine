I'll out something when I have some free time to jump into the depths of scripting.   I'll be going to Madurai on Sunday afternoon and be back at Coimbatore by Monday night. My visit is related to my  MCJ  course. I can't make head or tail about our university's prospectus. On one page they say I need not send the tution fees, but on the form, they want me to send the tution fees with the application form.  Got to straighten out things in person there.
