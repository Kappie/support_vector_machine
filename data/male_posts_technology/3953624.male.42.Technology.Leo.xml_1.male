This is a very popular starting point for the Crescent Trail, a 10 mile paved bike trail thatstretchesits way down to Georgetown, DC. With the exception of one uphill rise over a bridge, it’s mostly flat with a very slight downhill grade. It’s frequented by joggers, skaters, and bikers but on this day a strange new vehicle made its appearance. I hit the play icon on my iPod and started out down the trail towards to bridge over River Rd. to meet the man who sold me my Trikke, Willie. It was an easy ride down to the bridge and the day was gorgeous. I quickly realized that in order to gain enough speed to cruise comfortably down the trail I had to use both sides of the trail. This only forced me to be more aware of the bikers approaching me from behind. The infrequent shouts of “Left!” became my cue to move to one side.  Once arriving at the bridge I left the trail to find Willie. After a shot of Red Bull and some talk about my Trikke experiences so far we headed further down the trail. It was a beautiful run, not too many people on the path and everybody was generally curious. Willie, who has ridden for much longer than I have, was able to generate a lot of momentum on his Trikke. So I tried to keep pace with him and mimic his movements. I have always liked riding with someone better than I. It pushes me to become better and reach the next level.    Once we reached the tunnel Willie had return to the point at which we met and so we parted ways. I continued on to the canoe and bike rental house further down the trail. I made a point of completing that leg of the journey (about 1 ½ miles) without touching the ground. And I did just that. Now it was time to take a break. I used that time to explain to the onlookers about this strange new three wheeled scooter. I gave out a few of Willie’s business cards. I hope they result in sales or at least more inquiry.    The next leg of the journey, from the canoe and bike rental house to GW Hospital was pretty smooth. Once again I rode about 1 ½ miles without touching the ground, an excellent workout. Once I arrived at the base of Wisconsin Ave in Georgetown I had to hop off the Trikke. The street that lead to the intersection of Wisconsin Ave and M street was pretty steeply slopped. However I quickly hopped back on the Trikke once I reached the top of the hill and proceeded to GW Hospital.    I arrived at GW Hospital just when it started to rain. I tough my journey was over then but I decided to take the subway across town. I was hoping that the rain was isolated to some areas of DC. I was disappointed to find that when I exited the subway it was showering. I then decided to see how this thing handles on wet pavement. Now I read all the warnings about riding on wet surfaces and being an inline skater I knew how unstable these kind of wheels can be when wet. However I found that if I don’t carve too much, the Trikke can be ridden on wet surfaces … carefully though. The brakes are even less effective but I learned earlier how to step off the Trikke in order to stop and reduce my reliance on the brakes.    The rest of the evening I stayed at the outdoor concert, held in the light rain, on the sidewalk under the trees. Once again I answered many question about the Trikke; What is that? Is that a scooter? Where is the motor? How do you make it move? I found it better to show them than to explain. And show them I did. At one point a professional photographer inquired about the Trikke. Even though I was not asked to pose/ride for the camera, I wouldn’t be surprised if he snapped a few pictures while I was riding unaware. Trikking on the Penn! I can live with that.
