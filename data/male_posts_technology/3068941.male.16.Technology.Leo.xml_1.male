It was hilarious there was me(a student with a backpack) chasing him(a teacher with a school milk in his hands). It would have made a great got milk commercial.  OH OH OH  and I finally saw The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and OMFG is it awesome I LOVED IT and am going to buy the DVD. But now the songs have burrowed even deeper into my head AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. But I will survive(I hope.)   Nothing intresting has happend yet today, wait thats not true, someone at my school was arrested for having a box cutter.(which he was showing off to teachers whose OBLIGATION is to report it. Can you say STUPID) He "resisted arrest" and broke a policemans hand. Thats pretty much all that happend today, at least up to now. Update L8ter
