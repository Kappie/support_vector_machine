First thing, some stats: Miles driven: 1304.7 Pat's Cheesesteaks Eaten: 5 Bottles Consumed:  2 (1 Tanqueray, 1 Gray Goose) Beers Consumed: 10 Dollars spent Hitchhiking: $50 Miles avoided walking by hitchhiking: 24 Lbs Ham consumed: 2 Lbs Turkey consumed: 2 Red Bull Pounded: 8 Water drank, (in gallons): 3 Liters, Tonic mixed:  2 Tolls Paid:  ???  What a great trip.  Worth feeling like shit right now for.   Thank god for coffee.  Some thoughts: First things first: This was a disaster for Phish fans. Probably 40k people got turned away from the show. I'm not sure who is to blame for this, but rain should not be able to make festival so difficult. Reports of people waiting 18 hours, sleeping in their cars, then being told to turn around and go home? Good grief. Decision should have been made long before. Oh yea, some gravel or cedar chips could have make a huge difference. Using tractors? Not sure if this was the best decision. I mean if cars are going to destroy the turf, imagine those thick tractor treads wreaking havoc.  I mean all of these cars DO need to get out...  Driving down I91N was a little spooky.  Thousands of cars abandoned on the side of the road, and hardly a person around.  Was traveling at 105 mph in my little mazda, and almost got pulled over.  Seriously very lucky.  Thank god for the other schmo that got pulled over before me!  Anyway, IG and I drove up, planning to make it just in time for the first set. We were turned around and told to go home twice, but decided to simply try to walk it. Thankfully we were picked up by some local yokels, who for the  bargain  price of $10 each, would drive us within a few miles of the show. Being in the middle of nowhere, being driven to god-knows-where, by two locals -- felt like I was in Deliverance or something. Anyway, after what felt like an eternity, we were dropped off closer to the show. A few minutes of walking, and we were ready for another ride.  Amazingly  enough, another ride was available. Could hear Runaway Jim in the distance. After setting up our tent, having a few drinks, we started the walk to the venue. Didn't get in until last song of first set... I didn't care. We had made it in!   Bought a green coventry phish long sleeve shirt.  It was getting cold, and I figured that I should have some warmer clothes.   Met three Canadian girls on the way out.  They were pretty friendly.  I couldn't stop myself laughing whenever they said "eh" or "aboot".  HEHEHEH!  Also laughed to  myself when I said called Canada Canadia...  LOL.   Anyway, lost them before the second set.   Went to get another beer, and then headed into the show.  Second set was pretty good.  No Complaints.    Third set was fun,  especially when I called two of the songs.  IG started calling me "The Oracle".  Highlights was the stash > free  Sunday woke up, and started drinking soon after.  Met up with GN, and tossed the frisbee around a bit.  Was pretty wasted by the time we decided to head down to see the first set. Show was pretty good.  Loved the Down With Disease, and the Wading in the Velvet Sea.  I admit I even shed a few tears.   Called the Story of the Ghost, and that there would be no rain. Was a little ticked off at the Bruno and Dickie crap.  Come on guys, this is your last set.   Play the great stuff that got you here, not gimmicky joke crap.  Who out there would rather here this then say.. Divided Sky, or 2001, Freebird?  Not a soul!   Hippy Chicks No Longer Hot?  Yes, I believe this is true.  I used to think the girls at these concerts were so hot.  Wearing baggy shorts and backless shirts, totally used to be my thing.  At Coventry I didn't get this feeling, not even in the least.   I used to dream an escapist fantasy, where some crazy female spirit visits me, and leaves as quickly as she came.   However I've found a something much more grounded, and much more fulfilling in CW.  The experience that is devoid of emotional connection no longer represents my fantasies, and hardly seems to resonate at all.
