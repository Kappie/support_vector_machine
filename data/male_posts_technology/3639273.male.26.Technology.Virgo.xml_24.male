The book focuses around the problem that we fight battles that many times were not intended for us to fight.  That many times we come into a situation or problem and try duking it out on our own without consulting GOd.  The problem with this is that we loose out and many things that GOd has intended for us are lengthened and therefore it takes longer to get where we need to be.  This is what it means by choosing your battles wisely.  We must realize many times we cannot save the world and most importantly that we cannot please everyone all the time we must also come to terms that we will offend some and some may not like us for various reasons.  This if we are living in love and sprirt of Christ should not be a concern of ours.  When jesus was accused of being satan in Mark and when he was captured and spit at.  He did not spit back.  Why?  Because he had a purpose and plan and knew that he must follow the ways of his father so that his death would not be in vain.  The Father has purposed everything through his son.  Being the Son was the God in the Flesh.  So.  In being all this it is easy to see that the Lord himself did not involve himself in things he was not called to deal with.  Why not us as well.  The Lord spoke "It is finished" upon his last breath on the cross.  This signified that all was done and his will was done.  The idea that the Lord himself did not involve himself in many situation and took no haste in situations that he knew were in control.  For instance the fact that Jesus waited Days before going to heal Lazarus after he heard of his death.  The Lord knew that time would not matter and as he spoke upon healing.  He waited do that his glory would be shown.  Lazarus was basically confirmed dead and all rituals had been performed that man could solidify that he was indeed dead so that his rise from the dead would be more miriclous and show the healing power of our Lord and savior,  Whom which time has not matter.  So being the children of GOd we realize that we have a purpose and plan and many things arguments situations and problems are not ours always to fight.  I am not saying to be a pacifist.  What i am saying as a famous General once said.  Save the bullets for the real war".  The lord himself in his nature was not a pacifist but as Jesus a man of change (not of himself but of that around him), patience, kindness understanding and authority.  We must realize that when we argue or fight about pety things that the enemy is trying to have us focus on things that are less important so that he can get past us and cause confusion in our camp.  The ememy for those not christian is the Devil (Satan).  The one who sould purpose is to Seek, and Destroy all in his path.  However he may.  Don't loose the battle by fighting with your own soldiers or fighting a battle that your Commanding Officer (GOD) has not called you to.  It is difficult for me as well.  I simply can say that a majority of all my issues and problems were brought by not understanding this sooner.  Also that when God speaks to you.  You better listen.  The Lord is full of Grace and Mercy for those whom he loves and has chosen which by biblical word is all of humanity conditional of only accepting the death and diety of the Son (Jesus Christ). (If you have any questions (Watch the Passion or even more importantly dust of your bible and read it.  Ask the Lord to give you understanding and let him work in you and you will see the GLory that is Him.
