I thank all who responded to my mail.  Technological Challenge, it is the phrase which frightens u and me day to day.  I read an article in which how top tech companies invent technology and how people experiment the same! Here are some samples.  Compaq is considering changing the command "Press Any Key" to "Press Return Key" because of the flood calls asking where the "Any" key is.  A Dell technician advised a customer to put his troubled floppy back in the drive and close the door. The customer asked the tech to hold on, and was heard putting the phone down, getting up and crossing the room to close the door to his room  A customer was asked to send a copy of his defective diskettes. A few days later, a letter arrived from the customer along with the photocopies of the floppies.  Hope u enjoyed!  till then! Bye!  Sri Prasath Venkateswaran
