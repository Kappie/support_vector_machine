I was putting my arm out the door around the corner and trying to get her and she thought that was pretty funny.   Grandma got Karissa strawberries and yogurt for breakfast.  I have never seen anyone eat as many strawberries as Karissa can .    Today we went to the space needle.  Karissa said she really wanted to go up in the space needle so we went.  They have really changed the space needle since I went in it last.  We had our picture taken as we went in kind of like they do at Disneyland.  I held her in my arms all the way up in the elevator and she really liked looking out the window.  Once we got up in the space needle I was shocked at all that has changed.  I used to bring first dates to the space needle but now it is a complete tourist trap with a starbucks in it.  Karissa and I went out on the observation deck on the outside.  She like looking around but once we were up in it she was done.  We then went down and they drop us off in the gift shop.  We bought the picture.  Karissa really likes the picture so I got her one.  After we were done She wanted to ride the rides.  It was sure cold maybe it is me I am after all from Texas now but Karissa rode the kiddie rides and loved it.  She also wanted to go up in the ferris wheel with me.  I took her up there and she really enjoyed that smiled ear to ear.  She was even more crabby at bedtime about brushing her teeth.  I just don’t understand what happened she used to like brushing her teeth.
