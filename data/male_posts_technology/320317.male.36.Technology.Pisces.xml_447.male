  urlLink   I am interested in  urlLink the Notebook Optical Mouse . Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be wireless. I use to have three wires coming out of my laptop at any given time (network, power, and mouse). I got rid of the network with my Wi Fi (802.11b) wireless PC card. Now I'd like to get rid of another with the mouse.
