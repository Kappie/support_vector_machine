It's hard to read expecially since I have the damn resolution so small on my work computer.  Eh.  It's spring.  Another season.  Time for a new look.  and yes.  I will go ahead and rip off someone's code and change it a little.  I am truly lazy.  I am also not in the possesion of my own domain so Meyh.  So I read A Modest Proposal again today after forgetting if I did read it in HS.  Crazy stuff.  I didn't give a shit about that thing back then but now I understand.  Crazy.  More Kundera to Read and then Ayn Rand's Fountainhead.  Thanks to the girlfriend.  Thanks baby!  Yeah, I wish there was more I would share with the world today but I don't feel like it right now.  Yeah.
