Last night I dreamed that I was fishing, first, in a deep clear pool or lake.  I could see the fish I was trying to catch.  In my mind I kept refering to it as a long-nosed gar, which is odd because that fish lives in the muddy Mississippi river, not clear deep lakes.  The other thing that was odd was that the fish I could see, although it did have the long snout you would expect, was a pearly white and had a blow-hole like a dolphin.  I was fishing for it with a white plastic jig.  I saw the fish take my lure but when I tried to set the hook, it came flying up out of the water.  The tail of the jig was chewed off and what remained seemed dirty.  Next, I was fishing in a muddy pond.  I had an enormous lure on my line with a single hook.  As soon as I cast it out, I had a strike.  I set the hook and battled the fish ashore.  I knew it was a big fish by the way my pole bent over.  When I finally got the fish out of the water it was covered in weeds.  I pulled the weeds off and revealed the biggest goldfish I wave ever seen.  It was a redish-gold color and was hooked quite soundly on the single hook.  What stands out most to me is the incongruity of the fish in this dream.  They are too big, the wrong color, in the wrong places, they take the wrong bait.  Any thoughts on an interpretaion?  Fishing seems like an obvious motif.  I'm looking for something in my life.  But why all the odd fish in odd places?  Am I looking in the wrong places?
