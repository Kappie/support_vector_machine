I created my blog on the 1st of August 2002, after some persuasion by Diana, a net friend of mine, who however doesn't blog anymore. But I didn't really care much about my blog or updating it regularly until a month later, when certain events occured in my life that affected me in a really bad way, so I turned to blogging for a cheapo form of therapy.  But once I started I didn't really wanna stop, cos it did make me feel a whole lot better and also I felt the idea of expressing my thoughts into words rather liberating.  Cos I am sure there are times when everyone feels the need to express their thoughts or emotions to someone else, especially someone who is willing to listen.  OK now let me get back to my porn movie.
