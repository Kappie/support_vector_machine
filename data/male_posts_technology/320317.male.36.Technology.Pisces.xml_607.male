The company has expressed significant doubts it will continue producing a browser for the Macintosh operating system, echoing a growing problem for third-party Mac developers as Apple Computer steps up its own application development efforts."

 Steve Jobs is a control freak. As cool as Safari is, that's what Apple's new web browser is all about, and Opera's reaction is the fall out. As a designer I understand Steve's need for controlling everything that ever goes into using a Mac. From a business standpoint it’s just plain bad. He needs high-profile third party developers now more than ever with the release of OS X.
