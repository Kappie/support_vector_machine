This also simplifies modifying the program, should the value of pi change." - FORTRAN manual for Xerox computers   "Programming graphics in X is like finding sqrt(pi) using Roman numerals." - Henry Spencer   Real programmers are surprised when the odometers in their cars don't turn from 99,999 to A0000.    Any sufficiently advanced bug is indistinguishable from a feature.   COBOL programmers understand why women hate periods.   Computer interfaces and user interfaces are as different as night and 1.   If God had intended humans to program, we would be born with serial I/O ports.   There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.
