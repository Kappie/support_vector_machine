We've probably all seen these cool digital picture frames, where you can load a bunch of pictures on a CompactFlash card, and the frame will display them one-by-one.  But Nokia is announcing a digital frame that can be updated by infrared, from a phone. And, sometime soon, there will be one that can be updated by MMS (text messaging). So you get one of these camera phones, and then you can instantly send the photo to a picture frame halfway across the world!   Can you imagine, taking pictures (using your cell phone) while on your trip to the Grand Canyon, and instantly sending them to a picture frame located 3000 miles away at your parent's house? In real time? Wow!   Update 12:30PM:  Russell covers the mobile market well, and is interesting to read. But he doesn't want people like me reading his site, so I will stop.
