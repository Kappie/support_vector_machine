In case you didn't know, a one-man company called Eolas has a patent that covers a "system to access and execute an embedded program object" inside a browser window, which pretty much covers all embedded ActiveX controls and plug-ins (Flash, PDF, and any embedded multimedia like audio and video). They successfully sued Microsoft over the issue, and won a judgement of $521 million (plus $110 million accrued interest).  The whole Internet, including the W3C standards body, pretty much protested the patent, and it looks like it's now being reviewed. I think the patent system has to change. Amazon.com has been granted a number of patents which seem obvious, and I thought patents were supposed to apply to non-obvious things. I can understand patenting a drug... I can't understand patenting "one-click ordering", since it is so obvious.
