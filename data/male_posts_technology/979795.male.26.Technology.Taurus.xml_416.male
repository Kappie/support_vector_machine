Apparently she needed us to be around over the weekends. It's the 150th Anniversary of the CHIJ schools in Singapore (12 of them) and there's going to be an event held at CHIJMES. They needed help for the photo-taking and the money collection. I was thinking that I might have to burn my training at ARCC but I still felt pretty happy to help out. Anyway, it seems like I should have just about exactly enough time to travel up and down anyway. Mrs Liew was very nice about the whole thing. Very motherly lady... hehe  Suay today. It was sometime then that I realised my pants was torn. Lo and behold, a nice line which seemed like a fine cut. Sheesh... anyway I still had to hang around for a whole day so I gave my dad a ring. Luckily he was around the neighbourhood. He lompang me back home, I changed then we grabbed lunch near my school and I made my own way back afterwards. Checked the cut at home and it seemed way too fine to be a normal tear. Might've caught it on something without realising. Worse of all, I never even realised just how long the cut has been there. Yesterday was Friday, for all I know it could've been there since the start of the week... *pengz*  Anyway, turns out I had to be at CHIJMES the next day between 1-3pm. Told Tracey I might have to leave about 2.30pm because it was last minute and I already made plans. She said it was fine. Over the afternoon, noticed that Marcus Fam was online (back from Aus for a 2 wk holiday). Spoke with him for awhile and found out there was an informal gathering of some old 56SAB personnel. Well, I contacted Tang and we think we can both make it right after Aikido.
