What I don't understand is why the candidates have a lot more freedom when it comes to placing signs everywhere than businesses do.    I am sure that many, if not all businesses in the Lower Mainland would love to be able to buy 5000 signs for 10 cents each and place them at every intersection and down the side of every major street.  If they were so brazen, they would be smacked with hundreds if not thousands of dollars in fines.  Nobody seems to mind that the political candidates do it, and do it to extremes that are now becoming quite silly.  In a democratic society, it is important that every voter knows all of his/her options.  Posting signs on the street definitely lets you see the names of your candidates at a reasonable cost to them.  I am not against these signs in general, but we need to enforce some common sense because they are obviously incapable of doing it themselves.  In a 20 meter stretch of road I have seen 20 to 30 identical signs.  What benefit does anyone see to having a wall of signs posted on both sides of a street?  We have some of the most beautiful scenery in the entire world here and these signs simply take away from the greenery that we all love to see.  If the signs are designed correctly, a driver should be able to glance at it for 1 second and completely understand the message that the sign is supposed to deliver.  The only real message I see on any of these signs is "Bill is the Liberal one" and "Jimmy is the conservative one".  Since everyone knows the colour red is used by the liberal party, and the conservative party uses the colour blue this message is very simple to get across.           There Aught to be a Law  We should have a rule that I will call "The Line of Sight Rule".  This would state that a political sign may be placed anywhere that you cannot already see a sign from the same party.  You should be able to stand beside any one of these signs, and not see another one.  This would have 2 benefits that I see; we would no longer have these ugly clusters of tens of signs right beside each other, and it should encourage creative placement of the signs to ensure they get the attention desired.   Am I the only one that sees a problem with all these signs?
