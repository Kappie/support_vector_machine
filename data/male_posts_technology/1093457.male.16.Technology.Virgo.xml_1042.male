I spent half an hour last night sitting in front of my christmas tree thinking about my final art piece for Starky, based around Autobiography. It can be anything so long as you can somehow link it back to you. My link is that my father was a firefighter.  My piece will be based around those firefighters lost in September 11th. (By the way, I releasied this in general studies last week, the Americans go on and on about what a tragedy it was for all those firefighters to die. Fair enough. But what about the paramedics and police? They died too. They all do the same life threatening job. Just in different ways.) What I will do is construct a war cross (American war cemetryes which I have visited - a plain white cross). I will not paint it white but photocopy headlines and pages from books about September 11th and the firefighters. I will cover my cross in it and then create rubble around the base. I want people to remember. I want people at the art exhibitiono to go: 'Wow. I remember that. That piece is really good, I'm impressed.' I remember at last years exhibition someone did a 9/11 piece. It created many a comment.
