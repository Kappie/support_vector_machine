It definitely feels different on the second time round - there are things here that I know and not everything is new to me - it almost feels like I've gone interstate, except that I've had to travel halfway round the world and I'm in a seriously different time zone.  Coming back only came with one minor hitch - somewhere along the way my guitar got lost but we were soon reunited last night when BA dropped it off at Somerset. Unfortunately my new Room isn't as selubrious - on the first floor it comprises of just one studio wich includes my bed, wardrobe, lounge and kitchenette in the one room. Fortunately my bathroom is separate ;o) In addition when I tried making myself a gourmet dinner of baked beans on toast last night, the microwave sounded like it was about to explode.  Anyhow, because my apartment isn't up to scratch, it's given me greater impotus to look into a proper apartment. Talking to some of the others here, it looks like I can get a fairly nice two-bedroom apartment in the city. Funnily enough, the major thing I'm looking forward to is having a gas stove to cook on! I think I need to start watching what I eat and start doing some exercise.  Well it's time to go home now so I'll post again soon.
