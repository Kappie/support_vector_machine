Make yo feet stank!  I cancelled my subscription to Majestic.  Just wasn't getting much out of it.  I thought it was beginning to get a little cheesy.  Mike, Kendra, Shintaro, I hope you're all found safe and sound, and someone figures out what maniacle shadow government destroyed your software company.  I made a CD of "Commercial Music" yesterday.  If you'd like a copy email me at work.  I plan on making a disc two sometime soon too.  Aaron, send me your damn resume.  Until tomorrow...
