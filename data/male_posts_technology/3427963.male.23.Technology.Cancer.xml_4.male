Dun worry i will ask raymond to go watch it wif u.....if u like my sassy girl, u will definitely like this one. HY says its better than my sassy girl but i dont agree....y? its not as funny lah although its has its fair bit of comedy in it.....but its definitely more touching than my sassy girl. watch out for the ending scene.....i'm not going to reveal too much cos it will spoil the whole show. PPL, go catch the show....worth every cents, especially if u watched it wif ur special someone ;) the next movie i'm actually looking forward to is actually Brotherhood...also a korean movie. no not spiderman2....such lame show....well the koreans sure make good movies nowadays huh?? wonder wat took it so long for them to surface in singapore!!!   cheers, Teddy
