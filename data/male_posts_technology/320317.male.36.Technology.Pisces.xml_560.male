Bust out the DataReader and bind it to the control...BAM! You're done. No looping through script to build the table cells or any such nonsense…. When you really start to grasp OOP, it gets even better. I just launched a rich-text editor that puts all of the IE editing functionality into one line of code, and the fact that you can do that really blows people away. That was never something you could do with ASP, PHP, or Perl.”
