But Sam got his shot blocked by a gal who was like 14 yrs old so at least that was some consolation haha ... But i got a feeling that I'm gonna wake up tommorow all tired cos never felt so exhausted in a long while !   I better get prepared for my interview at NTU tommorow by Sun Microsystems, sigh thinking of the journey to Boon Lay by MRT really makes me feel damm sian i tell ya, I mean theres a Sun office in Chai Chee why didnt they just call me go there instead ! But well see how it goes tommorow !
