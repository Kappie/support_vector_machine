You want to read about how I react to things?  How about I let you in on a little secret - I'm not just some alcoholic for you to laugh at, I have some god damn feelings like any human being does and they've been in more than a bit of turmoil in the last few weeks.  It's not like I want to hang myself or anything but jesus FUCKING christ I seem to have a lot of pent up distress and it's really starting to get to me.  Wondering if it's a big deal to me, are you?  WELL YOU'RE GOD DAMN RIGHT IT IS.  On another subject entirely, why is it so HORRIBLY HOT on the upper floor of my house?!  It's like the fires of hell are burning just below, the heat from the flames rising through the vents, leaving a balmy sheen on my skin and causing my thermometer to burst in frustration.  Air conditioning, you say?  Well, my roommate's vent in the neighboring upstairs bedroom seems to be specifically shaped to divert as much of the cool air as possible into his room.  I'm getting nothing here.  ISN'T THAT CONVENIENT?!  One of these days you may see the confusing remains of my corpse featured on one of those Discovery channel specials about the mystery of spontaneous combustion.  Though this can only happen if they can spare a half an hour in which they don't show some fucking horrible reality show.  HAVE I MADE MYSELF CLEAR?  THE BARON HAS SPOKEN.
