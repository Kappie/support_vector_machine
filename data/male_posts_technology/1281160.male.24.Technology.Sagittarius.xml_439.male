The more I get to think about your question, the more complex the situation becomes.   As I had quipped yesterday, if I had the chance to speak to our juniors, I would have stressed upon:     Know your core competencies  - You have to concentrate on what you do best or like doing best. Some might be interested in moving up in the IT segment and some in management.     Improve them  - Once you have identified your competencies, try to orient yourself towards it. Learn more about the areas where you would be best suited to.    Prepare a resume in line with your competencies  - Most people try coping a resume format from others. Break away from that line of thinking. Sit down and think of the job you are applying for. Write down what aspects of that job you are suited to. Prepare a resume that tells the employer that you are the best person to do the jo the job     More on this later.
