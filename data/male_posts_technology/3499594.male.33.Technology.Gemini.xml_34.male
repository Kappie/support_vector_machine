I had to take 1/2 day off that morning because my wife had to be in 3 places at once. She can usually pull off 2 places, but this was a bit much. I took my son to therapy, toting my daugher with me at the 9:30 a.m. Note I cleaned up the house prior to because I had to wait till 9 to start that way. My wife had already left at 6 a.m. for work to get as much done as possible.  After therapy, I then proceeded taking the kids to a Dr. appointment for them and my wife ( 10:15 a.m. ) as the three did that, I ran over to a nearby barber to cut the hair. We then met over, across town to a pizza place to meet with my wifes dad to have lunch, (11:00 a.m.). We had a good lunch together the I took my son home ( schools out for the summer ) as my wife took our daughter to her dentist appointment (around 12 p.m. now). OK we get home, the boy and I. He wanted to play play play (he's 5) and I basically say, what movie you want to watch, Dad's gotta go to work ( I work remote out of the house, gotta love the net). I start the Power Rangers movie for him and start checking my buisiness email. Man, of course everyone wants something, yesterday.  Needless to say, I was there till 8 p.m. My wife came home around 4 p.m. and brought dinner with her. She then took our daughter off to T-ball for an 8 p.m. game. The boy stayed with me because he did not feel well.   I hate days like these, non-stop action but man it gets old.  My boy fell out (asleep) before my wife and daughter came back and I threw our daughter into the shower into bed as soon as they arrived home at 9:30 p.m.  That was my Tuesday and yes, it flew.
