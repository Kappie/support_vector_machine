Orrin is a flatpick guitarist and mandolin player and mainly plays bluegrass and folk tunes.  Big Al went with me.  I don't think she was too impressed, but I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The show was sponsored by the  urlLink Fiddle and Bow Society , which I aim to join the next chance I get, but the turnout was not so hot.  I think there were 16 people there including the guy making coffee.  So it was intimate and that was cool, but I think Orrin was dissappointed.  It's not good when the featured act is noticeably dissappointed about the turnout.  Maybe I read him wrong.  Orrin played the guitar for most of the show and was joined onstage by Jeff Foxall on the mandolin on most of the numbers.  Jeff is a local guy who plays with an unnamed bluegrass outfit at the  urlLink Dixie Classic Fair  and teaches guitar and mandolin out of the  urlLink Music Barn  in Greensboro.   I talked to him a little after the show about taking some lessons but I haven't called him yet.  Best music part of the evening:  Jeff and Orrin wore out a rendition of  urlLink Red Haired Boy , one of my favorite fiddle tunes.  Best non music part of the evening:  Orrin did a little storytelling between songs, one of which was about a lady he knew who lived in a tiny town in  urlLink Alaska  where the male to female ratio is something like 3 to 1.  Orrin asked her about the obvious opportunities she must have given the gender ratio to which she replied "Well, the odds are good, but the goods are odd."    Saturday, Valentines Day, Ali and I hung out for a while in the morning.  I finished up reading Dan Brown's " urlLink Angels and Demons " and then we went out to lunch at a pretty cool restaurant out towards  urlLink Clemmons  called Cities.  After that we went to  urlLink B  to spend a gift certificate Ali's grandparents gave us for Christmas.  The gift card was for $50 and we spent $130.  Ouch.   We should be in books for a few months now.  That night we watched Gangs of New York, on of our  urlLink Netflix  selections.  Well, I say we watched.  I fell asleep with about an hour to go and Ali turned it off soon thereafter.  Needless to say we didn't care for it much and never watched the last hour.    Sunday, Ali went to Carrboro to go to the  urlLink UNC  vs.  urlLink Maryland  game with her sister.  I went to the  urlLink Wake  vs.  urlLink Cincinnati  game with my buddy Marty (after a little pre game warmup over at Cobalt's).  Both UNC and Wake won and then later that evening Duke lost to NC State capping off the perfect Sunday of college basketball.  AND  urlLink Dale Jr.  won the  urlLink Daytona 500 .  During this sporting frenzy it started snowing and by nightfall we had a couple of inches on the ground and roads.  WFU did me the favor of calling a 4 hour work delay for Monday morning so Marty and I stayed up super late playing guitar and drinking.  Today it's about 65 outside and everybody's thinking spring.
