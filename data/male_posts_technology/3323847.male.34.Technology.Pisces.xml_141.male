Just when I started wondering if Bill was gonna go square on me, he does something cool like this. :)  I'm not all that moved by  what  he's saying.  What the hell do I know about the black community?  No, what strikes my fancy is his un-wavering position.  He's saying what's on his mind, and even though he got loads of shit for it, he's doing it again.  It so damn refreshing to see someone who not only  has  convictions, they actually stand  behind  them! :)  About  what  he's saying: Like I said before, I'm an unemployed white dude in a white house in Whiteyville, WI - I have no idea what's going on in the black community.  If what Bill is saying is true, and not just a short-sighted stereotype, that can't be a good thing.  Either way, dad sounds mad, and even though it doesn't necessarily concern me, even  I'm  listening to him.
