French is gonna suck big time, i am gonna fail that, but neva mind it's only french eh? i had an orthadontist appointment this morning, i dont eva have to go back again, i still have to wear my brace at night but only if i can be bothered to. There again if i dont wear it for a while longer my teeth will go back to how they were before i got the brace ! And i DO NOT want that ! Tom blog boy, we need to know all the details bout ur holiday! well thats all form me the wisdom woman
