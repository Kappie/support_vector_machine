 Anyway, i brought a coffee machine to our building. The vendor installed the machine for free and we pay only 2 NIS ($0.40!) for a cup. When Amir saw it, he was happy, and i saw a very rare spark in his eyes. "Aharoni?! A coffee machine? Who brought it? Did you bring it? How much does it cost? Where did you get it? A coffee-machine!!!!!????!!!!" 
 He, too, can be human.
