One of the things I'm pondering is turning some of this stuff into an email newsletter.  If this sounds interesting to you, let me know via the comments.   urlLink Good  article about how the face of people going to food shelters is changing - now its mostly single mothers with children instead of homeless people.  World Relief  urlLink write up  about the earthquake in Iran.  50K people dead so far...  Note that Iran is one of Clive Calver's favorite churches in the world.  Interesting, what REALLY is going on here?  (One of the questions I keep thinking of after reading parts of _Waking the Dead_ by Eldrege)  On the Urbana front, wow!  Lots of good feedback, 23 people went from GCC, most if not all loved it.  I did some of the intervewing of some of them to the Body at large on Sunday morning and hosted a party for them on Sunday night.  The GCC MTF donated about $2500 in scholarship funds, very cool, the real deal.  The party was so great, loads and loads of fun and it was really good for them, they just needed to talk about it and share.  The more I think about it, it was a debrief that needed to be done.  So very good.  And Deanna and I just loved hearing them talk about it.  Very fun, and some very funny stories.  We made up some campy questions too that they had to answer, like "Describe the most interesting person you met that was not from Grace.", stuff like that.  Wow, it was a long day.   I think these students are on the cutting edge of what missions for Grace, the whole model of missions at Grace is going to change....
