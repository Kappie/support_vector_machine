Reflecting telescopes are cheaper than refracting telescopes of the same aperture and perfectly adequate for the amateur (or professional for that matter). Invest in as big a tube and as sturdy a mount as your budget-manager will allow. I work on an 8" Newtonian Reflector on a German equatorial mount with dual axis motor drives: above average amateur equipment, but just below the unhealthy obsession threshold.  Warning: A telescope is a scientific instrument so why would you buy one from a toy or department store? I strongly recommend you do some research into what separates a good telescope from a nasty one before parting with any cash. The link below is a good place to start.
