A thought just occurred to me. What if one of the major reasons for invading Iraq was to break up the OPEC oligarchy? I mean, a handful of the major oil producing countries  conspire to fix oil prices  every month, keeping supply lower and prices higher. What if Iraq quits OPEC? Iraq could then produce as much oil as they want, and sell it as cheaply as they want. It would seem to me that other oil giants, like Saudi Arabia, would be forced to lower prices (and thus increase production) just to keep their income level steady.  I know 2 million barrels a day will not automatically mean the death of OPEC -- countries like Canada already produce oil without being a member. But it would be another brick on the camels back and could someday lead to the end of fixed oil prices. The U.S. will save billions every year just on lower oil prices.  Something to think about.
