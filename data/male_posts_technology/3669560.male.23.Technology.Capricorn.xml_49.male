It's the sum total of non-crappy pictures I've taken since I got my wonderful Canon A80.     urlLink Be Gentle .    I want to find a way to do link the pics similar to the way  urlLink Smacktooth does . It's a cool style I think. Except I'd probably have the pics across in the header. Actually, I think I'd just like thumbnails of the (x) most recent posts linking dynamically to the (x) most recent pics. Mike, any ideas?  Anyone else?
