Try to take fear away from the fearful, and they get angry.  There is a fierce pride in fear:  the fearful perceive fear as a sign of intelligence; those without fear are deemed stupid or ill-informed.  It is smart to be afraid of labor unions; it is stupid to be afraid of corporations.  It is smart to be afraid of our nuclear arsenal; it is stupid to be afraid of public health care.  It seems nearly impossible to make any decision free of fear.  Fear appears to be not an emotion, but rather the inescapable, invisible framework of human experience.  Without fear and our reaction to it, we are nothing.
