Basically Karissa wanted to swim in the pool and I had some yard work that needed to be done so basically I put her in the pool and worked in the backyard with her.   I got quite a bit accomplished. Now I just have to hope the garbage man takes the stuff I put out for him.   I added the new webcam to the site it is pretty cool in the daylight hours as you can look into the back yard and see the pool. Of course not much fun at night in my dark back yard. I need to fix that someday as well.     SFW   called to talk to Karissa I think she had the phone up to her ear long enough to say I don't want to talk to you anymore. In a way I know that is wrong and I tried to tell Karissa about being hung up on and stuff yet at the same time it is so fulfilling to have   SFW   get a shot of what I have been getting for 6 months!
