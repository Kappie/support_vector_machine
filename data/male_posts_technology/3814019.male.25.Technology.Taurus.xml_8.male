[cue slow deep gravelly voiceover]    And here we are -outside the warehouse - and its coming up to late morning. Hopefully this will be a perfect time to see the creatures we will be examining in their natural environment.  Thebuilding is hometo many species of animal, a whole multitude of creatures living in almost perfect harmony. As we walk through themain door, we are immediately confronted by a common creature to these parts,the common or garden buyisoffus  or 'customer' as the localslike to call them.They are asocial animal and like to congregate ingreat herds around the counterwithin the reception area of thewarehouse, they communicate using eithercomplexhand gesturesand randomly raised voices, or by occasionally pressing the buzzeras a way to gain the attention of other creatures in the area. as we passswiftly through into the warehouseitself, amyriad of fauna andplantlife caress the senses and can easily disorientate the careless traveller. A quick journey over to the 'goods in' department and we see - armed with a primitive weapon - the  mucho pocketus.  Although not a solitary creature by habit, he is seldom seen outside 'goods in' and communicates by shouting random words at people. Next we come to the main bench, where the king of the jungle  arsus maximus  resides.He rules his domain with an iron thumb (his real one had been chopped off in a fight with some racking) He lets the creatures of the area know he is about by emitting a high pitched screeching noise. He liveson a diet of ready made curries and the souls of the weak. He also preys on the opposite sex with a blase disregard for manners that set him apart from his fellow creatures and can often be found sniffing round female  buyis offus .
