Good on him, I guess, for creating a little shitstorm of publicity around his site and a little cult around his blog.  I wish I had a cult...heh...  This situation forces me to think a bit about celebrity and why people are so enamored of it.  We love the mystique and the aura that surrounds our famous people, and as a society we need them.  We love to make fun of them, to watch them fall, to adore them and help them rise.  Some people love to walk around feeling superior to them and look down at them past their own insecurities... "Well my life may suck but at least I'm not a nutbag like michael/a cradle robber like demi/a bad actor like so and so".  We also just love to see someone we consider "just a normal person" make good and become bigger than themselves.    The thing society seems to forget is that these people are ALL just normal people, and that we turn them into the things they become.  I have to wonder...would Michael Jackson be the freak that he is if he hadn't spent the majority of his life being surrounded by people who never said "boo" to him?  If someone had pulled him aside when he was like 17 and starting to get a little odd and said "Hey Mike...your cool enough now dude, don't fuck with your face, and by the way...sleeping with children is not cool man.  And hey...instead of buying the elephant man's remains why don't you start a little foundation for people who's daddy's are assholes and treat them like shit, much like happened to you.  And one last thing...here's 450 bucks...go live for a month in some little fleabag rental unit and see how the rest of us have to exist...not only will it ground you again, but it will probably give you some kick ass songwriting material."  Back to Rance... Good on this guy regardless of who he is.  Whether he (she?) truly is some famous or moderately famous actor or just some humorist with a brilliant concept or even, as one person suggested, a writer using his blog as grounds for a book...none of that really matters.  His blog has now become bigger than he is just because of that mystery.  Regardless of who he was before, he is now a famous person; a celebrity and we all will fill with glee at the thought of seeing him rise or fall.  His 15 minutes is here as a blog writer, regardless of whether or not he has another 15 minutes in another guise, and thus he has achieved his goal with the blog.  So everyone who reads this (both of you) go check out his blog and add your little piece of DNA to the organism he has created.  Props to this guy.  My thoughts on who he is (heh...me adding MY DNA to the organism):  IF he is truly an actor my money is on some Canadian expatriot...he writes like a Canadian, or should I rather say he does not write like an American who isn't a writer.  Not that there aren't any American writer/actors, just that there aren't that many and I don't know that any would have the time or need to come up with this little publicity machine.  But...having said that I don't know that I believe he is an actor.  Or she.  I suspect it may be someone who is somehow involved in the entertainment industry, but more as someone in the wings, not one of the front and centers.  But then what the hell do I know.  Heh  Here's his website: http://captainhoof.tripod.com/blog/
