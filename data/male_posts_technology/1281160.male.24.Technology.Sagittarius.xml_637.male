Pooor girl! by the way, it seems many of us had a grand diwali except few like vijay, manny.... Ofcourse i did have a great time with dresses pouring from all sides along with wishes. Ya Diwali collection was around 2500rs/-  Need to plan to spend it properly. Since i have got a bit of work, i couldnt blog and will keep in touch later. jax thanx for helping me change my mail delivery options for the group. Ram post the snaps soon and can send us soon. till then bye
