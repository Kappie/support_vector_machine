I am trying to describe the state where the mind rotates from being lost in thought and being lost taking in everything around oneself. I go back and forth between looking at the trail and the Provo river, and my own head, which holds the thoughts of the day and rambles like the Provo river does.  I go back and forth between the two because my body just doesn't stay quiet for long enough for me to be just thinking for an entire run. There is something gratifying, though, about realizing you've gone two miles and you haven't even noticed, until you're there.  The run today was a good one. I ran out from work onto the parkway trail, scurried around to the sidewalk, and ran by riverwoods. A girl and a guy were sitting on the grass by the road, eating sandwiches and frozen yogurt from Hogi Yogi. I ran to the intersection and then I ran across the street and headed up the parkway again. The parkway was comparatively shady, and I smelled the trees and spring in bloom. The air in the spring is sweet here in Utah. I enjoyed my run better because of it. I need to talk more about the introversion/extroversion later.
