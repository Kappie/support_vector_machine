I have never seen Baghdad like this. Today the Ba’ath party people started taking their places in the trenches and main squares and intersections, fully armed and freshly shaven. They looked too clean and well groomed to defend anything. And the most shocking thing was the number of kids.   A  urlLink blog from an Iraqi in Baghdad . For our soldier's sake, I hope the majority share his views, even if they aren't able to express it freely yet.
