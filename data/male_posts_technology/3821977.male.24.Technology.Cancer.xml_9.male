With the ability to access your phone from a website and making customizations remotely,  who wouldn't want a phone like this. I currently have over 20 different wav tones to signal when a call is coming in. very cool. Anyway very nice today as it's friday. I'm going to see my parents this weekend and spend 4th of july with them. Dad is going to take me to the lake to fly rc planes. should be a nice weeekend
