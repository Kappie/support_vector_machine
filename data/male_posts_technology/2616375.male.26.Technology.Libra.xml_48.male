Obviously only Bangalore MVPs can access the amazing console right now, these will be rotated in various locations across the country. MVPs across the country will be able to experience the magic..  What's unique about this offer? XBOX is not yet released in India!! So this is your chance to preview and write a review on the device of the decade!!  In Bangalore, the XBOX is available starting July 2, 6:00 PM. MVPs could come and unwind at the Kasturba Road office with a coffee / coke and play some cool games.  I can tell you the force feedback is soooo cool that you can feel your neighbours arms shaking while you are racing with him/her. And the graphics are too good... goes without saying :) I have already spent around 4 hours since morning playing the XBOX.. ahem!! it is that addictive...  Currently, we have Gotham City Racing 2 and Crimson Skies games available on the XBOX.   And here's a challenge.. Best me to the car racing and i treat you!!  And is there some MVP who would like to donate some XBOX gaming controls from the cool MVP bucks?? :)   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.
