Although I had a decent sessio at UB all in all I got very few cards.  Had I not caught quad 10's on the limit table on UB I would have been struggling there as well.  As it turned out, I flopped the quads and had 2 guys fighting over the pot so I just followed until the river where I made sure to cap and they both were playing an off pair from the flopped 10's.  Lucky me!  I made almost my entire result on that hand.  I think I'm playing a little too tight in these limit games but will continue to try and make some adjustments and hopefully can begin seeing better results soon.  I guess I shouldn't complain as I am at least ahead of projections, but I feel a little underwhelmed none the less.  One day soon I'll wish I wasn't complaining.  Oh well, Until next time......  Enough for now.  Until next time.....
