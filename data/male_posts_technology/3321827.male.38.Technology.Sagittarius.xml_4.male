Well, I'll break it down for you (albeit simplistically).  To answer the first part of the question, I have voted Republican in Presidential elections because I felt they have the most realistic opportunity to win...and I feel that liberalism is destroying this country.  I despise everything the Democratic party stands for and they'd be the last party I'd want in control of anything (I'll save details on this for a later rant).  Unfortunately, as I discovered with this administration, there is really little difference between the two parties.  What are the differences between the Libertarian Party and Republican Party?  What are the basic differences in philosophy?  To distill it down to bare elements, Republicans feel morally responsible or a moral obligation to the public in some instances (personal behavior), whereas Libertarians use a more objectivist or pragmatic point-of-view.  The Libertarian view is personal responsibility.   As Ayn Rand wrote, "The only proper purpose of a government is to protect man's rights, which means: to protect him from physical violence....The only proper functions of a government are: the police, to protect you from criminals; the army, to protect you from foreign invaders; and the courts, to protect your property and contracts from breach or fraud by others, and to settle disputes by rational rules, according to objective law."  Obviously, most Republicans do not agree with that philosophy.  One example of this is the "War on Drugs."  The so-called war on illegal drugs is a total and abysmal failure.  You might have some in law enforcement that tout their increasing drug seizures, but they won't be objective because the war on drugs has been a cash cow for law enforcement.  Government doles out billions of dollars to fight the war, puts thousands of cops on the street, and seizures of cash and property help fund law enforcement in the war.  I might add that the seizures are without a trial I might add...only if you're found innocent at trial, do you get your property back...so much for the 4th amendment.    -- ADDENDUM on the foreiture issue: A good friend of mine, a former police officer who worked undercover, informed me of the following: "Forfeitures are contested only after posting a bond to get your own property back.  Then you are offered a civil trial in forfeiture court.  If the amount forfeited is over a certain amount there may not be any bond.  However the bond is quite significant considering it is your property.  You could still win your case with no conviction and lose your property.  civil vs. criminal     preponderance of the evidence vs. beyond a reasonable doubt"  This makes the State's actions even more heinous than I originally thought. --  Tell me, has this massive effort really stopped anyone from taking drugs?  Illegal drug use has remained steady or grown the last 30 years.  Some drugs have become more popular (ecstasy), some have fallen (LSD), while others have maintained consistent levels (marijuana).  Statistics for the last 30 years can be found  urlLink here .  The only dip in usage  was during the mid-80's "Say NO to drugs" campaign.  Why?  Demand fell.  As a teen in the 80's, I can attest that drug usage was not cool.  Of course that changed when a pot-smoking President was elected (sorry...had to throw that in there).    Do you think supply dipped?  Nope, and it has nothing to do with drug seizures.  In fact, the amount of drugs seized has  urlLink grown over the last 10 years  and during the last 5 years has grown or  urlLink remained steady .  All those seizures had zero affect on drug usage.  During the 80's it was cool to say no to drugs.  Cutting demand by teaching the hazards to kids at a young age works far better than attacking the supply.  Demand CREATES supply.  That's economics 101.  What are the additional costs besides law enforcement?  Prison of course!  Does prison for drug abusers and dealers act as a deterrent?  Nope.  Addicts will continue to seek out drugs because, well...they're addicts. Dealers will continue to sell drugs because there's so much money involved.  How many people are in prison for drug-related offenses you ask?  Well,  urlLink 54.7% of the prison population or 86,165 prisoners  are in prison for drug-related offenses.  As you can see from the earlier drug usage charts, this so-called deterrent has not worked.  In addition, violent criminals are paroled early to ease prison overcrowding.  The result of more drug offenders in prision is more violent criminals on our streets.  Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.  Does Prohibition ring a bell?  As everyone knows, prohibition gave rise to the Mafia...and alcohol was available to anyone that really wanted it.  Back then, the Mafia had a code of NOT involving ordinary citizens in any shootouts.  Today's gangs have no such code.  They are well armed and organized an will shoot anyone for almost any reason.  Our streets are not any safer today due to the "war".   It's more than apparent to me...as it should be to you...that there is a certain portion of the population that will always do drugs.  We all know the detrimental effects of drug abuse.  We can attack the demand by teaching kids the hazards.  I'm NOT talking the D.A.R.E. program either...it has had  urlLink zero effect  on drug usage.  You can't tell kids NOT to do drugs, you have to SHOW them what they do to a person or otherwise make it cool to NOT do drugs.    You can take your children to local police department's jail for a tour and ask the guide who in the cells are drug addicts.  I took my son when he was 6 and the Police Officer pointed out what each criminal was in jail for...out of 6 cells, 2 were for drugs, 2 for alcohol, and 2 for stealing something.  It made a strong impression on him. Another example of what drugs do to a person is  urlLink here .  I had one example of 13 years of mugshots for woman beginning when she was 19.  She starts out smiling and looking good, but by the end, she looks 50.  Unfortunately, I can't find it anymore.  If anyone can find this photo, please comment with a link...she's a blue-eyed brunette.  In fact if you can find any collection of mugshots of one individual over time, please comment with a link.  Finally, the hypocrisy of what is legal and illegal is quite annoying.  Two destructive drugs are available to anyone of age (and illegally to those not of age).  What 2?  Alcohol and nicotine.  Of course, we're all familiar with the problems of excessive alcohol consumption and the addictedness of nicotine, so why are those drugs legal?  Simply put, money.     What about prostitution?  It's the world's oldest profession so it's safe to say it isn't going away.  In fact, it's gotten easier for anyone with internet access and cash.  Simply do a google search for Escort and your city and you'll come back with tons of hits.  I believe our neighbors to the north (Canada to those of you geographically challenged) got it right, require them to register and receive regular blood tests.  Does jail time ever stop them?  Nope, too much money for a few hours work.  You might say, "what about the poor girls doing this kind of work?"  I'll respond...personal responsibility.  People choose their own paths.  What about abortion?  Though I'm personally opposed to abortion, I'm not about to carry any child for 9 months either.  I do feel that Roe vs. Wade is bad law, but only because the Supreme Court legislated from the bench, rather than it being a states-rights issue (similar to the sodomy decision last year).  Because it is NOT my body, it cannot be MY decision.  I'm going to beat a dead horse on this later...personal responsibility.  The difference is that Republicans view the fetus as a separate entity...again, a moral issue and to many, religious belief that the soul enters the fetus upon conception.  I am vehemently opposed to late-term abortions (abortions after the 6th month) because those "entities" can live outside the mother's body.  In those cases, because those fetuses can live outside the mother's body...it IS murder.  Yes, I know that it's technically outlawed by Roe vs. Wade, but late-term abortions can and do happen...all they need is a doctor's opinion that "it's for the mother's health" and it's ok.  Personal responsibility is a major difference between Democrats and Republicans...Libertarians just take it a step further.  Stay out of my house...it's my body and my life.  Let me live it the way I choose...so long as I'm not hurting anyone else.  If I choose self-destructive behavior...it is MY choice...and MY responsibility.  Conversely, if I choose to work hard and be a success, it's MY success...and I shouldn't have to share so much of my earnings with the government (this year, the first 5 months of the year go to taxes of one kind or another).  Protect our shores, protect me from miscreants that would harm me or my family,  and protect my property.  Government nowadays does none of those tasks especially well...because they've got their hands in too many places.  That includes the one place I hate the most...my wallet!
