I caused Armageddon, am on my way to becoming a mafia kingpin, watched a spider battle an octopus, dined at the end of the universe and for a brief moment in time owned all of London.  Like I said it’s been a hectic week.   Spidy 2 is surprisingly good. Of course it’s a corny flick with a shallow story and unwanted melodrama best enjoyed with a large bag of cheese popcorn. But who says that’s a bad thing? The Fx are great, the emotional scenes are short and there is more web slinging action than ever before. The movie even elicited a couple of laughs from me which was an unexpected though pleasant bonus.  Played monopoly after a long time and enjoyed it. The fact that I actually won (For the first time in my life) only added to the fun I suppose but it would have been almost as good if I hadn’t. Or so I keep telling myself :-)  Rise of Nations rocks, Thrones and patriots rocks even more. For the first time in any game I have played I can have Delhi as my capital. It sounds silly but somehow since I started playing with ‘Indians’ my defence is a lot grittier :-). Unfortunately I kinda lost count of the number of nukes we traded and Armageddon ensued which was a real pity cause I was seriously wailing on his arse at the time this happened.  Finished reading ‘Restaurant at the End of the Universe’ which along with its predecessor goes straight into the ‘I need to read that one again’ pile of books. It is rather interesting though in an eclectic sort of way and has its own esoteric charm. Now I can divert my full attention to ‘Children of Dune’ which I shall hopefully conclude this week.    Unless of course my gangland activities come in the way. There is vicarious pleasure to be had in Tommy Vercetti’s spree of lawlessness in Liberty City and I partook whole heartedly. More on my life as a gangster shall be forthcoming as I make my way up the criminal ladder.
