I cant disagree, I've always felt like my eyes are 'open' and if you know me you're thinking 'mm the heart thing, the cancer thing.. near death experience.. appreciate life' but the truth is I appreciated being here long before that, actually from around about the time I first fell in love. I learn who I was as a person, and I like myself, I like what I stand for, I like my strengths, and I dont beat up on myself about my weaknesses.. this means I dont wake up wondering what the point is, I seldom get bored, and I have maybe 2-3 'down' days in a typical year. Woohoo! arent I just fucken spectacular!!! ahahha pfft.. it shouldnt be anything out of the ordinary - we should all be in the same situation, because we all make the choice every day, as to wether we're going to be happy or wether we're not. Time is your most valuable resource, asset.. hell, time is what you've really got, thats it.. you cant ever get any more.. Sure, some of what I do with my time some people would consider wasteful,  but I enjoy pretty much everything I do, if I dont enjoy it, chances are you wont find me doing it. If I spend time talking to you, it means I appreciate you etc etc. Life is good. Friends are good, and family is good. I've got all three, so I'm a happy little munchkin. I cant wait to fall in love again, then I'll be just plain irritatingly smiley... and you all, can deal with it, or join me. I hope this aint sounding too Christian.. bahaha.. I think I might spend a bit more time off the computer, and get some of the other things I've been putting off done. I'll keep doing this nightly tho, and I'll reply to emails. Ka Kite Ano.
