Saddening in itself, it highlights a major problem with Southern African economies. We're all still way too reliant on monopolies. This pseudo-capitalistic 'privatisation' of state-owned subsidies, is not the answer. So governments no longer own 100% of the parastatals - instead, the trend is now to hang on to 51% - giving them just enough leverage to control the entity as they see fit, yet also spread some of the risk to other poor slobs who'd like to professionalise, for example, the telecommunications industry. Meanwhile SNO's are snowballed by government (after all, they have a rather selfish interest in seeing their 51% investment generate profit...) and the monopolies just continue to exist. I know firsthand. I worked for our (Namibia's) Telecomms parastatal for one whole uncomfortable year. The level of incapability and just sheer flat out  slowness  in accomplishing anything, was frightening. And it came from the rather top-heavy higher-rungs,  not  the bottom. Innefficient management is the prime cuplrit. It's way too tempting to maintain the status-quo, after all. So, Africa, you'll excuse me if I don't buy into this whole 'look at us we're partly owned by the private sector!' PR crap. Same old monolithic, rustic monopolies, same old crappy service - just hidden under new, and false, pretences.  We need complete privatisation  now . If it doesn't happen soon, it isn't going to happen, period. Take a lesson from every other greedy, corrupt little African nation, SA - if monopolies are allowed to continue to exist, they will do anything they can to hold onto their status as sole-providers. It merely stunts economic growth. Rather struggle  now , with costly infrastructure development and whatnot, than become yet another progress-crippling dinosaur.  Commentary has a good article related on the issue of privatisation  urlLink over here.
