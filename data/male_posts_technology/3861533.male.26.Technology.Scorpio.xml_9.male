Kerry said: "Israel's fence is a legitimate response to terror that only exists in response to the wave of terror attacks against Israel ... It is not a matter for the ICJ". Apparently the White House takes the same stance.  urlLink Link .  I don't have any grasp of the legal issues involved. My gut feeling though is that building the barrier is wrong. I'm not saying that Israel doesn't have a valid fear of terrorist attacks, it may well be so. But I don't think it will solve that. It may work to begin with, but I'm quite sure that those performing the attacks eventually will find ways to circumvent the barrier's intended purpose.  I was very pro-Israel when I was younger, being impressed by their battlefield prowess and survival against all odds in the three wars between them and the Arab states. The first eye-opener to another point of view came when I read  urlLink The Lost land by GÃ¶ran Rosenberg  in late 1997. The Israeli treatment of it's Arab population has been appalling at times, forcing people out of their homes, turning them into refugees. Israel has, in my view, squandered much of it's right to the goodwill of nations just as the Bush-presidency has with it's response to 9/11.
