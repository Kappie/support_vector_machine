I hope to retain my position as chief toilet paper stocker here in building, but who knows....maybe i'll be promoted to soda machine filler...I have my fingers crossed.  I'll let you all know when I get back from Chicago ( urlLink You can read more details here ).  On a serious note...those who re-org this often ought to shampoo my crotch....they also should be served up a huge steaming pile of  BEATDOWN!   See ya on the flip. ~e
