       Ritz with Tuna and Mayo 

    

    

       Unusual feeling in Lower Abdomen 

    

     

 

 

 I had a dinner of tuna fish mixed with mayo on Ritz crackers.  Maybe 10 crackers total.  It went well, better than I expected.  Now though, I have a strange "uneasy" feeling in my intestines.  I can't describe it, and it isn't too severere, but not being able to get a handle on exactly what it is makes it seem worse.
