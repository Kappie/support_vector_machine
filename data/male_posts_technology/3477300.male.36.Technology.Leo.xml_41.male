It'd take me weeks to earn that kind of dosh and I bet he'll be done by Thursday.  And he gets to drive 'round outside in a Bobcat all day catching some rays.  Ben's impressed by all the trucks. However he started to blub when the back patio got ripped out.  He liked to drive his Jeep on there. It's going to be a swanky woodern deck soon.
