Although my father has flown many times before, its going to be my mother's first time. For her and others jittery of getting on the first flight, here are some  urlLink helpful tips . As for myself, I've always liked travelling. I like flying better than taking a bus, car or train because flying gives me time to do things - read books, listen to music, sleep, watch movies. Normally, I tend to experience motion-sickness if I try doing those things while in motion but flights are calmer. A mind that's relaxed helps to make travelling that much stress-free. :)
