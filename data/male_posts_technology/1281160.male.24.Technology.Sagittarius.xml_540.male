I'm going to help my department as well, in their web site maintanence  get credit hours for that......kinda fully loaded myself, for this semmester......   Kicha good job done....but i have some strong strange feeling that, the guy/gal is one among us....He seems to know all of us.....Since he had the access to our groups, he shld have easily laid his hands on all 45 IDs...then why did he pick just a few IDs  send them that junk again??....What so ever, we've witnessed, one of the ugliest disadvantage of electronic mails....Hope this does not happen in the future.....
