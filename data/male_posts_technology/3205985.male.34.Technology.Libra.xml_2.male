Emily was ill last night with (we think) the stomach flu, so we were up with her most of the night. Poor thing didn't know what was going on. It's the first time since she was a baby, still being breast fed, that she'd thrown up. And she couldn't stop, I think she vomited 4 or 5 times, about 1/2 hour apart. She's better this morning, and starving, but still obviously not feeling well.  As for me, another successful week. -2.4 lbs. I did a much better job of staying on program, and used my activity points wisely. I havent' started DDR yet, I really need to get in to gear with that, but I've tried to keep up my daily afternoon walks. I don't predict any challenges this week since we're home and Maegan's been doing a lot of cooking (thanks sweetheart!) I'll try to post new pics soon.
