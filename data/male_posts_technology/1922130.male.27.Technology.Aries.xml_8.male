For starters, two of my good buddies from Nashville, TN were in the area to play a couple of shows.  Matt and Phillip want to be professional singer songwriters when they grow up.  I had my doubts about them making it in this line of work when they moved to Nashville to give it a go four years ago, but after hearing their recent work, I've changed my mind.  They pretty much kick ass now.  They can play circles around me on the guitar now and their songwriting has improved 100 times over.  They played a coffeeshop in Greensboro (The Green Bean) on Friday the 17th to a relatively packed house and then  played a benefit concert on Thursday the 23rd.  The benefit show was for a scholarship fund set up in honor of my old high school glee club director, Duane Best, so it was for an excellent cause.  The guys even let yours truly join them on stage for a couple of numbers  (though I didn't get to practice with them much ahead of time).   The venue was the theater at Rockingham Community College, it's a really nice place to hear live acoustic music.  They have nice equipment and acoustics are excellent. I enjoyed playing and singing in front of people again and really enjoyed the other guys sets.    On Saturday the 18th I was supposed to participate in a glee club reunion concert at my high school.  The concert was the latter part of a ceremony dedicating the auditorium at the high school to Duane Best.  It's now the R. Duane Best Auditorium or something like that.  They also took donations for the previously mentioned scholarship fund.  I didn't get to the rehearsals in time to participate on Saturday, so I just volunteered as a stage hand.  It was a good thing too because there was a fair amount to do behind the scenes.  It was a nice ceremony and the chorus sounded good considering there were only 3 rehearsals.  I'm glad Mr. B is getting some props in retirement.  I also went to the Apple Festival in Eden for the first time on the 18th.  Lots of mullets, lots of deep fat fried sugary things, lots of cheesy country music, nuff said.  This past Friday (the 24th) I went up to Pilot Mtn. to go to open mic at a coffeeshop that specializes in live acoustic music.  It was a pretty cool place, but it was empty.  The biggest group of people there was the group that I was with:  Matt Phillip, Kim (Phillips GF), Ali, and me.  I'd say there were 15 - 18 people there total.  The place is apparently very bluegrass oriented, which I really dig, but I'm not sure Matt and Phillip were too hot on it.  They played a long set of their "country" stuff, so they didn't stick out too bad.  I think they were well received even though they didn't do any bluegrass.  I may even go up there sometime and try to get in on a little bluegrass picking sometime.    Saturday the 25th I got up early and drove over to Elizabethton Tennessee to go trout fishing with my coworker, Bill, on the Watauga river and the Southern branch of the Holston river.  It was a gorgeous drive, the leaves are looking good this time of year and I got to see the sunrise in Boone for the first time in several years.  I got to Bill's about 9 am and we headed out to this little campground right on the Watauga where you can park for $5 to fish.  We fished from about 10 until 1:30  and when we came back, Bill's pickup wasn't where we left it.  We figured somebody at the campground screwed up and didn't get our 5 bucks and consequently had us towed by mistake.  So we found the owner of the campground and asked him if he'd had anybody towed that day.  He shook his head and told us he hadn't even checked the lockbox with the money yet that day.  Turns out Bills truck was stolen.  We were dumbfounded.  We called the sheriff's department and reported the truck stolen and had Bill's wife come pick us up in her car.   That'll ruin a weekend of fishing like nothing else.  At least I caught a couple that morning, a small rainbow on a blue wing olive and another small bow on a pheasant tail nymph.  My boots (which I'd had since college), my new gore-tex raincoat, and my rod and reel cases were gone along with a few other things in the truck.  Bill lost his expensive sunglasses and his wallet, so he had to cancel his credit cards and everything.  I'd like to get my hands on the guys who did it for about a half hour.  The really crappy thing was I had left my keys in Bills truck and had no way to get into my truck that I left at Bill's place.  Of course, all the locksmiths I called could get me into the truck but none of them could make me a key for it until Monday morning, so Alison wound up driving up to Elizabethton on Sunday just to let me into the truck.  Bill and I did fish a little more on Sunday morning on the Holston, but I got skunked and he only caught one.  It's a little more challenging river to fish than the Watauga.   Ali and I stopped in Boone to walk around and eat dinner on the way home, which was cool.  We haven't spent much time there since college.  I really miss that place.
