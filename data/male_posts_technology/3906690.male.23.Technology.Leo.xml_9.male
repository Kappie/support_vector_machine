I guess I could go with A #A #D #D #D or whatever...but that doesn't bring out the...err...feeling *L*. Anywho, I just got back from the corral, smelling a bit like manure. Last night the bulls broke out of their pens. The Brangus tried to get to the Brahma, to play or fight, whatever it is bulls do. During the process I guess the Brangus broke down a couple of the re-bars that kept the Brahma from the main pen, or it might have been the other way around. Didn't see this until this morning when feeding the "aminals." It was dark by the time we chased the "aminals" back into their correct pens yesterday evening. So I was there working on that this morning. I guess I could pull the welder down there and weld them back together, but it's not my corral and I don't want to do anything to it without my uncle's consent. So I used bailing wire and twine *L*. *JIN JIN JINJINJINJIN JIN JIN WIERWIERWIER JIN JIN* *L* that's all I hear I tell ya. If you make this out you can actually bring/sound out the distortion. *L* I'm just being a dork. I'm listening to Korn and Black Label Society.  Yesterday I was informed that my former boss might contact me sometime today. No word from him yet. Right now I hear it's really busy out in the field. This guy is cool, I mean most people with supervisor/owner positions around this area don't go out into the oil field and work, get dirty. People with those positions usually overlook a project from a distance or through one of their main peeps. They're the type who sits in their office chair and do whatever it is they do all day, and around here it's usually just kicking back and acting "BIG," which amounts to nothing. My former boss, now he's way different. He's the opposite of these "BIG" peeps. Since he's the opposite of these peeps, and it's busy out there, I know I won't hear from him until the end of the day...between 4-5. So in the meantime I'm going to wash this manure smell stuff off and afterwards head down to my cousin's. He wants me to take him to estimate a roof...might end up helping him with this project.  "Its like a grizzly bear sleeping. Its been poked in the face enough times with a fuckin stick. Its ready to start killing people now..." *Zakk Wylde on Music*
