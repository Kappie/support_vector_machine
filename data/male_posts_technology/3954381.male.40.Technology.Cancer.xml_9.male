In fact, it is he whoinspired me to start my own blog;I eagerly await to read his daily updates. The first couple entries of his thatI read I couldn't understand what the big deal was...but I gradually came around to his side. He is 32 and has, up till now, led a traditional heterosexual life. I on the other hand, came out when I was 20 and really knew no other existance.    Memorial Day, 1985....The local Gay and Lesbian Alliance was having a barbeque (if you read my earlier post, you will understand that the fact that they were serving food was definitely a perk). Anyway, I digress, as I do far too often. I attended the picnic, well actually it wasn't that breezy..I drove by about 12 times before I had the nerve to pull into the driveway. The local Gay and Lesbian Alliance holds their meetings at a Luthean church, so I guess my first major fear was that I would burst into flames upon setting foot on holy ground. Having alleveated that irrational fear I did pull into the driveway and parked my car.    There is something profoundly disturbing about acknowlegding your sexual preference particularly when it is not considered mainstream, traditional or normal. I suppose my generation had it particularly harsh since the AIDS crises was just coming to light. Of course I took it personally, as though a higher power deemed that I should not be allowed to fulfill my sexual destiny. I made my way to the front door of the church andlooked around to see if anyone driving by could see me walk in. Luckily the coast was clearso I opened the door, walked in and didn't look back.    The lobby sign indicated that the BBQ was in the meeting room on the first floor, aftermilling around the lobby, reading every flyer on the Community Bulletin Board I gradually made my way to the meeting room, lest I appeared overeager to join in the fun.    The room was setup for a meeting with the steel folding chairs you would expect tofind at a school auditorium. There were only a couple people there, primarily because I was a half hour early. I made my way to the back of the room and sat down in a chair in the last row. So far, so good I thought, this wasn't so bad.    As the next 30 minutes progressed more people filed in, occaisionally I felt them glance at me, the new comer, but mostly they chatted amongst themselves like friends do. The realization that I was an outsider in an millieu that I was unfamiliar with caused me increased anxiety.    There was a brief meeting with information given out and updates on upcoming events...none of which I listened to as the blood pounding in my ears caused a slight hearing loss. Thirty minutes later the meeting broke and the evening turned social.    I was approached by Friendly Gay Man # 1, who it turned out, lived about a mile from my house. I never saw him again but for that brief moment I felt likeI had a gay friend, or should I say "sister"? I was leaning against a stack of folding chairs facing him and we chatted for a while. I confessed it was my first time there. A couple minutes passed by and we were joined by Friendly Gay Man # 2, at which point I had to repeat it was my first time. After a couple more minutes passed by Friendly Gay Man # 3 joined us and again I had to relate that it was my first time there. The ventilation in the meeting room was pretty poor, and the heat and humidity from what we traditionally consider the start of summer was becoming increasingly oppressive. It was, I suppose, about this time that I realized that three gay men were surrounding me in a semi circle, not in a predatory fashion but just as any little clique would form a little hen party.    The sudden realization that I was among my peers should have made me feel welcome and comfortable and secure. I mean, I was with my own kind....right?    In actuality I felt very stressed, hot anduncomfortable. It was then that my vision started to fade a bit, going from slightly gray to near black and I felt my legs buckle under me. I didn't lose conciousness but I was unable to hide the fact that there was something seriously wrong with me. I reached my arm out to grab the chairs behind me as my legs were giving out. For the three men not to have noticed would have meant their combined IQ scores would have equaled the postedspeed limit outside the church. I understand it isn't socially acceptable to look away during these times, after all it's a good samaritan to come to the aid of the needy. But I really did wish they would have had the good grace to act like nothing out of the ordinary had occured.    They all reached to help steady me, and I feebly offered the excuse of the heat...I excused myself asI unsteadily but persistently headed for the door. Once outside the ample quantities of fresh air helped to further "sober" me up. I ran for my car. Seconds after getting behind the wheel, Friendly Gay Man # 1 appeared in my driver window and asked if I was alright. I assured him I was, thanked him profusely and left.    It would be months before I would return to any meetings. But I did go back. Well...maybefour times in the twenty years since.    Looking back on that experience, I am very glad I went. Not so glad it went the way it did, but we can't rewrite history. Sadly I couldn't appreciate the one aspect I look back on now with fondness...which is the fact that three Friendly Gay Men were simultaneouslygenuinely interested in hatever it was that I had to say. It's true when they say youth is wasted on the wrong people.
