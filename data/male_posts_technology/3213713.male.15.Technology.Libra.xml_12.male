Ahsan called. He was sounding as if he had just won some lottery or something... or as if he was on 7th heaven. I referred to his chakar with anum in a previous post. Well, he had just chatted with her. And she had told him, that she liked him... infact, really liked him. And, Ahsan had been feeling the same way so he told her the same too. Wow! He was so happy that i cant tell u. He told me the full story in 45 min on the phone. I was happy for him. He got wat he so much wanted. Lucky Guy!  Neways, apart from the story, I made 2moro's plan with him. He and a few other friends are comin over. After the call, I called Raamish, but he was sleeping. Then, I called Fasih, and told him to come. There was still time b4 jogging, so i came back online. Made a few posts. Chatted. Just then, my mamu came. I had to show him something on the pc. While i was doin that, Deeya came online. She messaged me. I said i was busy. But, i guess i did it in a rude way. So, she got naraaz. I didnt notice at that time. Neways, after my mamu left, Hamza came and we went for jogging. When i came back, she was again online. But she was very angry with me. After much difficulty, i was able to get her mood right. I said sorry but she wont listen. She was really pissed. Neways, then i went to the forum and posted some more. Had dinner and watched TV.  Then, I came online. Hassan was also online. So, I decided to add the buttons we had talked bout to the forum. I added them. Then edited them to change their color. After that, I chatted a little. Just then, I remembered that I had to make the changes to the software. So, since then, ive been doing that. Meanwhile, ive also been chatting :p and waiting for someone. Neways, I just rememebered that I had to blog. So, now ive been posting here. Till 2moro... ciao!
