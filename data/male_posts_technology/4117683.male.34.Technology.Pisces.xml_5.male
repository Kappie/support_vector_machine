When I took it this morning, after about 2 hours later I was dead tired! I didn't feel alive until this afternoon! Well all in all I don't feel anything yet.. But I was told that it would take 2-3 days.. So we will see..  So I am just waiting from my parents to come in... So the next time I post it may actual be from my own laptop!!!!  Oh well... nite ya'll! lates!
