A half full beer bottle was on the table in front of him, the condensation was already dripping slowly down the sides, and the label was beginning to peel.  Above the building directly across the street, he could see the last bit of sun slowly disappearing for the night.  The few wispy clouds in the sky glowed pink and red, and he thought about going inside as the evening coolness began to set in.  He lifted the moist bottle to his lips, taking notice of the water ring it left on the table.  The beer was starting to warm, but it was still good enough to be refreshing.  Setting the bottle back down, he glanced at the trail of ants again, still seemingly busy and still not getting far.  Several of them were carrying little bits of dirt, heading somewhere with a look of senseless urgency.  They seemed to be determined, climbing over the little rocks and each other, going where ever it was that they needed to go.  He stood up and carefully stepped back, making sure not to step on them.  Thirsty for another drink, he walked towards the door, and after stepping inside, he closed the door behind him, leaving the ants to their work.
