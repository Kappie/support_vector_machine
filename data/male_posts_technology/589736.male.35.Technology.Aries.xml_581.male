Come to find out, she was having contractions and did not even notice them.  She is only 26 weeks, so no one wants to see these babies born yet.  They gave Julie some medicine that did not stop the contractions.  They then tried a different, stronger, medicine, and it did not work either.  By 5 o'clock, her very reserved doctor, was visibly concerned about the situation.  Finally, around 7, the contractions slowed. and have, as of an hour ago, stopped.  Julie will be in the hospital through at least tomorrow, depending on how she reacts to being weened off the medication.  After that though, she will be on mandatory bedrest.  So, that means my availability for any of the group stuff (Road to Glory, dinner parties, movies) are highly suspect for the immediate future.  I will let you know what changes.
