Very very sian. 1st paper on Wed was good. Really good. Half the paper was exactly the stuff I revised that morning. I should quite easily secure a pass. How good I do depends on how much sense the lecturer makes out of the crap I wrote in extra. The 2nd paper (yesterday's) was terrible. I'm afraid of failing this module now. Seems like the opposite. It's such a broad area that things I wrote in might not be complete or they are wrong. To make things worse, I might not have remembered to write all the points I studies before. Argh!!.  What makes today top the icing on the cake is that I have a 5 min demo for my VR project at 5:30pm. Even Annie who took her exam from 2-4 came home before me. And I haven't even left the house at that time. It takes me 1hr to walk to and back to the house for a measly 5 min demo! BASKET!  Decided not to take my dinner at home. Probably grab some unhealthy fish and chips later on the way back. Might take some time to practice my bokken and handstand to ease the mood before I start my revisions again. Damn the day. Even the weather is all wet and windy. ARGH!!!
