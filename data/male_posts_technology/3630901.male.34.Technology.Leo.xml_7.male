I responded to them last night.  Maybe something will happen.  It was funny, after 10 winks, match started telling me that maybe I should send an email instead.  Am I ready to be in a new dating relationship?  Or dating casually, at all?  I don't know.  It's all a very new concept to me.  It's hard to imagine myself dating at all.  I see myself in a relationship -- not dating.  It's funny how some profiles say, "I love to have fun!"  No shit, who doesn't like to have fun?  It's a matter of what is fun.  For me, a bike ride or a hike is fun, a picnic on the beach can be fun.  Playing wiht my kids is fun.  I struggle with the idea of figuring out if a person is compatible with me while portraying myself in a good light, and oh yeah, having fun, too.  Maybe I'm just a pessimist, or a skeptic or a doubter.  Is physical attraction that important?  I'd like to say it isn't that it's what's inside that's important, but chemistry is important.  I don't think I'm really ready to portray myself as romantic and sexy and attractive, though.  I think I just want friendships now.  Sex would be great, too, of course.  My therapist says I shouldn't ask out my swim instructor or my yoga instructor because it will complicate those existing relationships.  Dean says fuck that - I can get a new instructor if I have to.  He doesn't know what he's talking about.  With swim, it's all about trust, and I trust her now - I don't know if I could trust someone again.  My therapist thinks I need to heal before I date again.  I need to be comfortable with me.  I need my divorce to be resolved.    What I need is to get back into heroin.  Shoot up.  Hello bliss.  Goodbye world.  Hugo said I shouldn't be in such a hurry to get into another relationship.  I'm 33 now.  Let's say I live another 35 years ... why rush into sharing my life with someone else so soon.
