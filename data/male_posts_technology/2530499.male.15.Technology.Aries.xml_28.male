But, alas, if I were to have a post as short as this, then it would be a true first. I think I've finally come to accept my place as the one who talks too much. Wow, now I almost wish I had something to say. I have a problem...an indecision if you will. South Carolina is calling my name, and it's only a matter of time before I'm asked to pack up my things (which, ironically enough, I just finished unpacking last night)  I'm not even entirely sure I've told Ben yet, nor have I told many people at all, excluding Sara/Cera, Rosalie and a few others. But, do I really  want  to leave? That, my friends, is another question entirely...one which I'm not sure I know the answer to. Along with that, what if it's just another scare like last time? This time last year I was tearing my hair out wondering whether or not I'd be moving to  North  Carolina. But, then again, David and Mom weren't engaged, he didn't have a job oppurtunity waiting for him that can be taken as early as two weeks, and every other little factor that has served to contribute to this awkwardly silent massteria raging inside of my mildly insane little head. Oh well, I suppose the best I can do right now is go on like I always do, making it from day to day without exploding. That  is  the best I can do, right?
