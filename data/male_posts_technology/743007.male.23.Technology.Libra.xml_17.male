THEY EVEN HELP YOU HANG IT. okie, so our MP is coming this area this national day.... so they must beautify the place nice nice to impress the MP.  my block is maybe the MOST PATRIOT BLOCK in singapore now. wif flag flying high outside every unit. but I'm just wondering, do i need to hang the flag to show that i love singapore?  I served my NS without chao kenging I report for my ICT when the SAF100 come. I contribute my skill to the country to make singapore a better place to stay. I am loyal to singapore, and i'll report with my FBO if some joker wanna invade us.  so why would i need to show everyone i love singapore by hanging the flag? hanging the flag doesn't mean u love the country. not hanging the flag doesn't mean u don love the country.  i rather choose to show my loyality thru a more meaningful action.   hanging the flag takes 5mins. is tis mere 5mins enough to show your loyality and patriot? if so, loyality and patriot has been devalued to something that anyone can do in just 5min a year.  I don need to hang the flag to show my loyality. my daily action will show my love and care for the nation.  and yet the words of the RC member still lingers in my mind.... "Hang the flag to show your love and loyality for the country"  yeah..... as if loyality is so simple.....
