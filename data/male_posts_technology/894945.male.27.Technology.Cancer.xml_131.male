I had my belated 21st birthday coach party last night and it was a blinder hehe, well it was until we got to Tam's Bar down St.Brelades bay, where they subsiquently gave me the birthday bumps.....twenty one times into the bloody sea!!  We all got dropped off at the Splash (best club in the island), by which time I was nearly dry, and that was sound too. All in all I had a totally good time, and I even met up with my X, I still reallly like her but we have to see what goes. Well I am gunna go catch a flick later so I'm off.....Baity signing off...
