Poos. So no progress in that department.. but I can note that my belt, on its smallest setting, is now too loose. Gotta be a good thing eh? cept that I've gotta buy a new belt. Poos. Wrigleys Extra Sugarfree Drops - Wildberry, are quite nice, just walked to the 24hr service station to get them, freez0red my hand hooves off. But hey. That and some sugar free redbull, I'm starting to think with all this engineered sweetness that my chat-up lines might start getting a little more synthetically sweet, and a little less genuinely sweet.. but cares, because I'll be closer to looking F.I.N.E - right? :D bahaha I'm about a hundred lightyears away from Peter Andre Abs, or Vin Diesel upper body. On the To-Do list tomorrow, I've got to get me some bloody scales, because I refuse to let myself have a few food splurges till I know I've earnt them.. I cant see how eating what I have that I will've done anything else -but- lose weight, but ya never know, the body is a fickle beasty. Oh yes. Mike is off to the snow with his gf tomorrow, and my cheap shitty digicam, hopefully it'll come back with some hillarious pictures of them near-killing themselves in makeshift tobogghans. I'm all for people proving Darwins theory, by taking themselves out in ridiculous ways. I'm thinking seriously about starting the davinci sleep patterns, of 4 hrs awake, 20 minutes sleep, 4 hrs awake, 20 mins sleeping.. etc etc.. cuts your overall sleep time to 2hrs, and productivity goes -way- up.. mostly out of mild interest, to see what happens, if it works etc. I estimate getting very bored, and quite cranky, but I cant imagine it being worse than if I was 'on the rag' ;) My cousin Allan is in town, staying with us, makes me want to write a rant about 'family obligation' but I think it'd roll on into a full 'omg dads side of the family are so small-town' kinda thing, and really they're lovely people, just a little... lost? maybe. I dunno. Not auckland material at least. Allan used to make model planes, he's very christian, has a little asian fiancee, aviator shape slightly tinted eye glasses, lots of facial hair.. always seems to be smiling. I guess you'd have to. Or something. Here's a first for me, I'm looking forward to the rugby tomorrow night.. odd.. but there ya go. Couple of months to sort my car out, for the mini nationals, so I better get sanding :/ I hate sanding.  *whinge* Ka Kite.
