I am also going to try to add pictures to the site every week.  Ann and I have joined the YMCA and I want to go at least three times a week.   Like I said, that is the plan.    Have you looked at the rest of the site yet?  Check out the link to the right...wait....check it out after reading.  Once you do you will see the new pictures from my digital camera.  Pretty awesome, heh?  Now that resolution isn't looking so hard.    The fourth resolution is to convince Ann I do not look good in a chinstrap beard.  I know I don't and you know I don't, but to get her to believe it I am growing one for the next week.  Maybe that will be next week's picture?
