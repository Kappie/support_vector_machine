Being accountable means being willing to take the blame if things go wrong, and being there when things go right. Oddly enough though, it seems few people are willing to be held accountable in this day and age. At least, unless it's part of the job description. It's nigh  impossible  to find someone who will willingly be held accountable for something, voluntarily. Where am I going with this, you may ask? Well, this weekend saw a certain LAN take place, a LAN where the biggest grouping of gamers in our fair little town ever, occured. 35 people fragging it out in Counterstrike and Warcraft with a little Quake3 and Renegade thrown in for good measure. The surprising twist - the organiser didn't really organise. Granted, securing a venue and a smattering of networking equipment was step 1, but that alone was not enough. I had informed the organiser of my intent to assist where possible, and in the end I ended up doing a hell of a lot more than I thought I would have to do. I organised a switch when it became obvious that the 2 hubs were not enough  and  just too damn slow (props to Frans from  urlLink Logical Networks  for the loan unit!). I organised the Warcraft  and  the Counterstrike tournaments (I was only supposed to do the Warcraft tourney, but it became painfully obvious to me that the guy I was depending on to set up the dedicated servers , to take scores etc etc hadn't done his job - fortunately another came through in the end and set up the dedicated server and helped immensely with the administration of the Counterstrike tournament - thanks  urlLink Kevin! ), I spent hours checking that everyone had registered and organising teams for those who hadnt managed to get themslves set up into 5 man CS teams and 2-man Warcraft3 teams, I walked around checking that there was no cheating going on..and so on. In the end, my entire Saturday was spent on my feet trying to keep people happy. I also donated around 15+ games, some of them pretty new, all in mint condition. What did I get out of this? I got a little satisfaction. Mostly, I got nothing out of it - a few words of thanks from certain valued people. That's it. I don't feel I need to have gotten anything out of it. As long as I raised the bar for lanning in this little backwater city. Sadly though, this is not the first such LAN I've had to carry through. I don't want to sound like an egotistical jerk, but it seems I am one of  very  few people here willing to take the ball and run with it. And I too would like to, one day, just sit down at a LAN and play - but I know that if I don't pitch in, no-one else will. And that pisses me off - it's hard fuckin work keeping a medium to large sized lan from devolving into utter chaos, it needs a dedicated group of people willing to make sacrifices for the good of the gaming community, it needs a bunch of people like Mayhem in SA, and this is what I want AGN to be, one day. But when I look at AGN and see that , out of the 12 or so members, only 3 people have so far really tried to help in even  small  ways, I realise that gamers in Windhoek just don't give a shit about gaming.  Despite this, I will continue to try. Maybe, some day, some of the gamers here will actually see the effort that some of us put into making lan's they come to enjoyable. Maybe they will be inspired to help out or even better organise their own large-scale events. Maybe one day big-lan gaming will be elevated to the same level that it is in South Africa and further abroad. But only if people are willing to Be Accountable.
