I went to Bromley south shopping centre today at lunch and who else but Jordan was signing her (much hyped??) autobiography... the place was full of the kind of people that really should never be allowed to congregate in such abundance.. i felt scared. I didn't actually see her but there were lots of people taking photo's and shouting her name(s). There was a real mixture of people there, obviously lots young men and boys but also a lot of young, scantily clad Jordan lookalike girls too. Are they looking on her to be a role-model with her story of how lots of people have manipulated her over the last 5 years???  still, she's bloody rich for it... Though i do wonder how her back will be in 10 years though.
