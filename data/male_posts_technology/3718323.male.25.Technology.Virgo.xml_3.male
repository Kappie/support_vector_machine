So far though, I've already been more successful with this than any previous journal attempt.    I think that writing allows me to harness my thoughts, and gives a certain focus to them that otherwise likely wouldn't be there.  Most of the time, I typically keep my thoughts closely guarded, and I think part of the allure is that in writing they can be let out.  Some of them at least.  It is a place to give my thoughts an anonymous voice, and where no judgement can be passed, or at least none that will affect me.  The thought of someone somewhere reading what I write and relating to it is satifying.  Of course I'm only surmising all this based on my own feelings.  I'm sure everyone has different reasons.
