Its very nice once... read it and njoy....       Regards,     Prakash            Your Mindset Determines Your Life   by Sopan Greene   To keep at the top of your game you have to keep a clear head. You can't  afford to fill up on news and negativity. The world's overflowin' with it and  the only way to be a winner is to be in control of your thoughts.    Your thoughts become words, your words become actions and your actions become  your destiny. Someone else came up with that, but I've always remembered it  because it's true. Our actions show who we truly are and how shallow or deep our  character is.    Where you are today is a direct reflection of the words, thoughts and actions  you took days, months and years ago. No matter how much some people blame their  parents,teachers, where they grew up, television, the government or anything  else, the truth is that nobody got them where they are today but themselves. The  longer we choose to not take responsibility for our lives, the longer we'll  living uninspired lives that we don't love.    I've heard 40 year old adults who complain about their lives and take no  responsiblility for what they've created. Give me a break. If you think you're  on the recieving end of life you're mistaken and too lazy to do anything about  it.    Simply think about the pictures you've seen on TV of people in third world  countries. When I start to get mad about having to stand behind two people in a  line at the grocery store I remind myself that a lot of people don't even know  where their food will come from tonight. This shifts me from anger to gratitude.     The next time you notice yourself getting frustrated or angry about something  in your life I invite you to shift your focus onto what's great in your life. It  doesn't matter if you think you don't have enough money or you're mad at your  dog for chewing up a shoe. Remember how much love you get from having your dog  in the first place and how your weekly earnings are more than some people make  in a month or year.    Keep your focus on what is working - for you and for others. We are bombarded  with negative input all day long. We need to watch what goes in because our  livlihoods depend on what we creatively crank out. Our heads need to be full of  positive inspiration or free space where we can dream.    A recent study revealed that the people who watch the most television news  are the most fearful in our society. Crime has been going down in America for  over a decade, but since the news focuses on it and repeats it over and over, a  lot of people are receiving multiple messages that the world isn't safe. These  people end up being less confident and less successful as a result of being  emotinally paralyzed to a degree by their fears.    Remember the old phrase "garbage in, garbage out"? If you were asked to be on  television based on the person you are today would it be on Jerry Springer or  Oprah?    Yeah, I know. You're probably laughing or snickering right now. I can  practically see that questioning look of disbelief on your face.    You may even think that you wouldn't be on either one. Just imagine that  there's a guy at your door and he's going to put you in a limo right now and you  have to pick one show or the other to be a guest on or you'll be locked in your  house for a month. (It's silly, but you get the point, I want you to get into  it).    There's a definite difference between Oprah guests and Jerry's guests.  Oprah's guests radiate confidence and have taken responsibility for their lives  and have created lemonade out of lemons. Jerry's guests radiate low self esteem  and think they're victims of life. Even worse, they think they have a right to  inflict their negative self-defeating attitude on others.    Oprah people know that they're on the creative end of life. Jerry people  choose to think they're on the receiving end of life. And the truth is that if  that's what they beleive then thats what they get. It's an easy cop out to  settle in life and a lot of folks do it.    It's important to keep a positive mental attitude nomatter what your life is  like because nothing is more important than your thoughts. They determine how  you'll experience the next minute, hour, day, week, year, decade and century.  Rid your life of people and circumstances that don't inspire and enliven you.  Life's simply too short to put up distracting drama and complainers who never  change anything.    We all throw around phrases about how life is too short, but we don't live  that way. Take at least one action today to reaffirm that you're creating a life  you love.    Fire a friend who drains your energy. Read from an autobiography of a person  who inspires you. Turn off the TV and write your goals and values. Take a walk  in nature or with a friend who supports the best in you. Write a note to someone  who has impacted your life in a positive way to let them know you're grateful  for having them in your life. Rub your dog's belly and watch a doggy smile of  ecstasy come out to greet you.    You're building a powerful future. Study successful people and you'll notice  they all surround themselves with other inspired and successful people. Your  life is your show, choose to be an Oprah person and aviod the Jerry people who  show up in your life. Or better yet, treat the Jerry people you meet like they  are the Oprah person buried inside them so we can all shine together.    Let your positive mental attitude infect everyone you meet and we'll all  enjoy better lives.
