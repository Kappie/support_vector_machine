Who knows whether the phone voting is "adjusted" or not but the geographical block voting spoils the entertainment value as it limits the possible winners and eliminates any come-from-behind possibilities. It has increased the chances of us getting nil-points which was funny last year.  It used to be a bunch of bitter and twisted old european countries (and greece and cyprus) that didn't really want to give any points to anybody. So they used the "music" to help in "Making Their Minds Up". Of course there used to be political voting, but that made it interesting and different every year, depending on current european affairs.  Now we seem to have a bunch of new happy-clappy countries that actually    want   to give points to their neighbours  for some bizarre reason (and greece and cyprus), giving them no incentive to use the "music" to assist in their decision making. This year has seen the worst bunch of songs ever in the top five (this is Eurovision, consider what that means).  Also the phone voting is producing the expected nearly-naked dancer increase, which is fine but doesn't make Eurovision any funnier, whihc is surely the whole point of it. Kudos to the French for the stilt walker, totally inspired insanity.
