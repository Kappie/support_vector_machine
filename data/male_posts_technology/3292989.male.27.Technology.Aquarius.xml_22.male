So if there is anyone out there who stumbles on my web page and knows of anything - grab my resume on the side please.  Went to Fort Worth Weekley music festival Sunday.  Flickerstick was awesome of course.  Also heard another cool band Spoonfed Tribe.  Monday went out to the golf course.  Today I have an interview for a management position... wish me luck.  It is supposed to rain all day today, i think
