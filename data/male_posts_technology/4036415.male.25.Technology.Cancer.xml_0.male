Too often we hear the use of the term 'chicken and egg' to describe a dilemma or paradox, where the occurrence of both A and B are dependant upon the existence of each other as a pre-condition. Not very surprisingly, too often this term is also used as an excuse in manyloosely constructedarguments.   Which one existed first, chicken or egg? Like it or not, there is actually an absolute answer to this question. It wouldn't be so hard to realise thatthe world must have had an eggbefore we had a chicken if we think logically, carefully and scientifically.   Modern science theories tell us that all living things today areproducts of generations of evolutions from single cell organism. The first chicken on earth, like any other creature, must have come from a close species, probably some kind of bird-like being. Let's name this 'bird' a 'pre-chicken' for the sake of this discussion. The difference between a chicken and a pre-chicken is arbitary and is of no importance. Regardless ofthe criterion we use to differentiate a chicken from a pre-chicken, there is always going to be a boundary that we have to draw between these 2 species.   Now, one day a pre-chicken must have produced a chicken egg, beforethe first chicken in the world can be hatched. Of course, you can argue that this egg might not necessarily be a chicken egg. However, such argument would have ignored the fact that a non-chicken egg would have produced something else, probably another kind of pre-chicken,instead of a chicken. Based on this simple yet conclusive deduction, we can very confidently claim that an egg must have existed before a chicken.   Chicken and egg, it's far from being a dilemma!
