Im gonna have to think about that one. If its going to be organised so late that its gonna be during the half-term, I cant come because I will be in America.  P.S: Tom seems perfectly fine. I passed him on the way to geography today, and we both made a strange noise when we passed. Insane as usual. I think he is just doing his homework and coursework, which reminds me....english homework has to be in tomorrow! Aaaaa, look at the time! Byebye.
