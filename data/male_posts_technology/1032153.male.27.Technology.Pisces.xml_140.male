Probably quite relevant to the discussion of men in leadership. If I'm being to cryptic, do tell me.   People  It's all about people. The Christian life that is. For how can we become more like Christ, develop the fruit of the Spirit, and live for others if we do not demonstrate these things in our relationships.    Touch  Twas a great game of touch last night. Some beautiful tries. Jono scored a most impressive one, as did Mark. Also impressive was the speed of Methane Ethan. The defence however was lacking...... at best.
