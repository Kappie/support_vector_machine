Prep work seems almost complete but both will start running from next Mon onwards and stretch on for quite a period over the Jun holidays.  Sis will be visiting her friend in Philadelphia. Wish I can join her and drop by Gary's but too bad lah, boh lwee and boh si gang (no money nor time). Parents going China tomoro onwards. Woohoo ... nopw govt for another 10 days or so.  Most woulda noticed the new look to my blog. Think I'll need to do a complete revamp of my homepage to match my blog soon. But I doubt I'll be free to do this over the next few months. Love the new look Blogger adopted though. Best feature is that they now have their own commenting feature, but that'd mean that my old comments are gonna get scraped. Gee ... anyway, that's kinda why I'm only posting my blog on 1st of Jun, so that I can republish only my index pages and not the ones before. Hope I can retain those.  IT monitor camp is starting tomorrow. I think I'm as ready as I'll every be, but I'll probably wake early to run through some things and the whole program for the day in my mind... just to be sure. Daphne's taking the P2-4s while I've got the P5-6s. Hope I can make this as enjoyable and be as friendly as I can, no point spoiling everyone's mood by getting to mad with them. Just hope they don't push the teachers around too much and go overboard. Give and take lah girls (if anyone is reading this).  One of the P6 actually said they came across my homepage. Like Daphne mentioned my homepage has a lot of personal stuff. Not sure if it's appropriate to speak my mind and be as flamboyant about my thoughts now. But hey, it's me ... I don't think I'll change much on this. Even if they do see my page, maybe some of the things they read will be able to help them understand somethings about the way I do things. Oh well, honestly not giving this much thought. Err ... but it does mean that I now ahve to watch my language online. Geez ... what a hassle.  Been procrastinating my training for the AHM and Singapore . I think after this camp is over I better start planning my training regime and stick to it. Been meaning to do my regular runs a long time ago but everything just seems to get delayed. Ar well, it's my fault lah. Problem now is I won't be able to start until Wed (Vesak Day). If it's physically possible, I may do daily runs just to make up for lost time. Not sure if I can clock up enought distance in time but I gotta try.  Been looking around for the AHM 2004 details. Only managed to find a  urlLink website  which says AHM is on 1st Sep. That can't be right, 1st Sep is a Wed. These kinda stuff always falls on a Sun. Anyway, I'm guessing it's 4th Sep. Hope so coz that week is the kid's 1 week term break. Might actually do myself some justice by taking the Mon off/lve to rest and recover. Also been to the  urlLink Singapore Marathon  website but it doesn't seem like application has started yet. Anyway, I gotta check back on this coz I want to be able to meet the early bird registration. I wonder if both routes run past the Nicoll Highway (after the collapse).
