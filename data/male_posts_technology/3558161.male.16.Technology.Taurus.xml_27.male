Christine Cate being one of them. She's proven it.  I wrote this before I found this all out.  --------------------    The End          Fuck   you and your shallowness Break open  my  smile  , See what's really inside. It's all I have left.   Everything I ever had Is stabbing my back Spitting in my face Watching me drop to my knees Letting me cry Laughing at me.   Everything I ever wanted And everything I ever   loved   Is everything I've always hated And everything I ever fought against.   Every promise Has been broken Every ethic Has been torn Every moral Has been soiled All for a shallow dream.   I'm sorry I can't be just like him I'm sorry that I wasn't the best rebound for you. I'm sorry I don't have the looks you need I'm sorry I'm not good enough.   But when it comes down To brass tacks, I know for a fact What your future lacks.  You lack sense You lack will You underestimate And you take for granted.   You don't have me Nearly like you think you do. And you make me   sick   to my stomach With your hypocriticism.  And your disgusting ways.  I finally found out What I never thought to be true. And I never broke   one   fucking promise I made to you. I always told you it'd be you instead of me  And I was right.   March 10th was the day the plan of my ultimate downfall was enacted.   March 10th is a bad day.   I will remember this, for the rest of my life. Forever.    Just leave me the   fuck   alone.
