Well, you may all be aware that I have new teeth, I am practicing taking them out, turning them round and putting them back in place only using my tongue. My uncle passed away last month and I had hassle from work getting two days off to travel to England for the funeral.  Weird one that was, I don’t think I have ever heard of a crematorium where everyone was laughing.  (Long story and you relly had to know my uncle Bill) At least it’s the way he wanted to go.  i have been entered in the swimarathon for 3PM on Sunday the 14th, so Come along and support me you vegetables! Its at Les Quennevais and if your not going to sponsor me (by finding me in the budda bar at eight, Saturday  night) you could at least come down and cheer my podgy belly along through the water like a fat boy through lard.  Oh yes, you read that right, I am out on the lash Saturday, Its me mate Steve’s birthday and he is joining me on the old fart lists. You can all smell my poo! For I shall be drinking beer with dentures!  Anyway, Something that has kept me occupied recently.   urlLink Red balls, Blue Balls!    Finally, Post something or you all shall be my bitches!
