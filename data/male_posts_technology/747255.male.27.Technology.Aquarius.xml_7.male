It would have made a great country song if I had changed the details.My girlfriend completed a rather drawn-out breaking up process, my roommate wenthome to South Africa, I lost a great job, and my Datsun's transmission failed on the way home from Tucson (where the now-ex-girlfriend had given me the boot). I ended upmoving back into my parents' house, which had shrunk in the 9 months since I had moved out, and walking the five miles to work at the Wards department store in the mall.  Things dragged on, and steadily drifted downward from there over the summer. I had abrief affair with a girl I didn't like, which alienatedmy best friend because he DID like her. My parents anxiously brooded off-stage, hoping I would pull my head out and grow up. Basically, Icould do nothing right, and wasn't surehow to turnit allaround.   I still had my dignity, though. Well, maybe not. But, as thesong says, Ob-la-di Ob-la-da... and something about a bra. I mustered what professionalism I had, and tried tofigure out how I was going to pay for another semester of schoolby working in housewares. The job itself wasn't bad. It was a step and a half up from the bottom-feeding drudgery of telemarketing, or the series of grocery stores I hadbeen workingat for seven summers, and I was able to deal with people cheerfully day after day.After a while, Ibecame the "problem" guy, which didn't mean that I was causing trouble. Any customer thatone of my co-workers couldn't handle would be thrust my way as though I had some imaginary authority. If I may brag a little, I was good at it.    One lady, for example,was a regular problem; she would bring in all of thejunk mail she got every two weeks like clockwork. Because she had a store card,a large portion of that mailwas from Wards, and she seemed to think that we were personally stuffing all ofthe envelopes there in our housewares department and sending them to her as some kind of personal attack.   She was wheelchair bound, immensely fat, andalso avictim of throat cancer - which had left her with one of those voice boxes that generates a horriblemockery of human speech. Her husband acted the part of the tall, gaunt, and silentvalet who propelled her wherever she wanted to go under a fusillade of unintelligible, computer-generated barks from the voice box.Whoever was at the counter when she arrived would be met with his blank, fishy stare and her robotic tirade compounded by the added assault of stacks of unopened fliers, circulars, coupon books, pre-approved applications, and full-color advertisements being hurled at the counter top. Ivariably, they sent for me, because I could understand her.  One afternoon, while helping two flamboyant homosexual men in matching ruffled leisure suits select throw pillows for their couch, I heardthe bi-weekly cyber-attack starting upon Michelle, our newest employee. "Chintz!" I said, tossing an armful of pillows at the indecisive couple, and whirled to Michelle's rescue, leaving them to argue in lisping Spanish over magenta versus burgundy.    "NGETUZ OVF YERR GODDAMNG NGAILING LISZT!" I heard, followed by the soft thump of mail on formica.    "Let me help you, Mrs. Foster," I said, smoothly. She wouldn't be happy until I"called corporate" and set them straight. I dialled Gary, the owner of the tobacco shop next door, and told him in no uncertain terms that if he didn't remove Mrs. Foster from our mailing list, I would testify in court that hewore women's undergarments and abusezoo animals. Or something like that.Mr. Foster nodded solemnly and eyed a pile of toaster ovens.    Meanwhile, a man had wandered over from thelighting departmentwith a set of almost-matching lamp shades. I tried to ignorethe brewing stormas Michelle began to argue with him about the price that came up on the register.I had my hands full appeasing the Robot Queen.   "You got the cyber-twins over there?" Gary was asking on the phone.    "Yes, sir," I replied in my sternest tone, "And if you don't stop sending them our fliers,we will lose their business forever!" (They had never bought a single thing from us that I was aware of.)    "Hee hee, thanks for the warning!" Gary said. "I'll take my breakbefore they get here! Idon't feel right selling her all thosecigarettes!"    "But the sign says '20% off', and it's sitting there with these shades," the man wasinsisting to Michelle.    "Well, it's ringing up at $10 each, that must be the sale price," Michelle said. She was casting me anguished looks, begging to be bailed out.   I hung up the phone, and turnedback to the Fosters. "If you get any more mail from them, you let ME know," I told them, and sympathetically dumped theirletters into the trash bin. They rolled away,satisfied until the next mail delivery.  "Help me get rid of this guy," Michelle whispered at me behind her hand.  "Whydon't you just give him the discount?" I asked. "It's only two bucks."  She paled at the suggestion. "Not on MYaccount! Won't they fire me for that?"  Not wanting to argue in front of him, I turned to the man with the shades. "Wherewas the sign, sir?" He showed me; it wasn't supposed to be there. It wasn't even one of our signs; somejoker had brought it over from one of the other stores. This guy didn't care about that, though. He by-God wanted those lampshades, and he by-God wanted a deal! I just wanted him to goaway.  So, I logged in on a register, rang him up - with the discount - and took his money. "You have a nice day, sir," I said, as sincerely as I ever say it.Just between us, whenever I say the word "sir", it has a special meaning in my mind; an acronym suggesting a profane act combined withcriticism of the mental capacity of the one being "sirred." Unless,of course, I respect you.  The man smiled, and cocked his head to one side. "You know," he said, "that showed a great deal of professionalism and leadership. Have you ever considered a career in the military?" I demurred, without laughing.He handed me a business card. "I'm an Air Force recruiter down at the Processing station in downtown Phoenix. Give me a call sometime, andwe can talk about getting you out of retail." I politely tucked the card into my breast pocket.  Dad picked me up from work that night, and asked how my day went. I was dying for a cigarette - nasty habit I had picked up in my wild days ofbachelor living - but didn't want him to know I had ever so much as seen one lit. I reflexively brush the breast pocket of my shirt, where my smokes had formerly resided, and remembered the card.  "I was offered a job in the Air Force," I said, laughing.  Dad didn't laugh.
