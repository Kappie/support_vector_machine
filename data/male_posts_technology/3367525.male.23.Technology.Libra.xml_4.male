She is showing a little more everyday.  She told me the other day how she could see either a foot or a hand pushing out.  Apparently you have been very active.  I could have sworn the other day that I felt you kick.  One of these days I will catch you in the act.      Your mother picked up your changing table a few days ago.  It's a beautiful piece.  Also, we picked up your crib as well.  It's one of those 5-in-1 pieces that fold out from a crib all the way into a full bed.  Your mother has also had a baby shower at her work.  She came home with a lot of really neat stuff for you to wear and for us to read.  She received a book that my mother used to read to me when I was a child.  I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.      We have at least one more baby shower coming up so we'll see what else you get.  All of our friends and family have been so excited about you.  We are all waiting so eagerly for that day in October when you will be born.      You are always in my thoughts.  I love you, Tristan.  Ariston Collander Tristan's Daddy
