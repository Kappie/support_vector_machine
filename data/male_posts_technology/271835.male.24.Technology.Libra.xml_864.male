Someone has taken some of the Apollo 11 pics and processed them through photoshop (tm blah blah!) and has found stars  are  visible in the sky.  So was it faked? This  urlLink guy thinks not  but a really convincing argument that it was faked can be found  urlLink here . Just don't let  urlLink this bloke  hear you saying it!  And whilst we are on the subject of the moon here's a couple of cool lunar panoramas:  urlLink 1 , urlLink 2  (need QT).
