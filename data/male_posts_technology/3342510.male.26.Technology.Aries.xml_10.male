It's a great, in depth story with a wide variety of characters (yay Miho!) so you can find the one who is most like you (apparently Piro according to those "Who are you" tests).   There's great humour (Largo's apparent indistructibility, but continued bad luck springs to mind immediately), some romance (okay Piro ask her out already) and oh, did i mention the story.  Great writing on the part of Fred "Piro" Gallagher.  Wish i could actually get to one of the cons so i could meet this guy.  Visit the comic  urlLink MegaTokyo - relax, we understand j00   I recommend it (if ya hadn't noticed)
