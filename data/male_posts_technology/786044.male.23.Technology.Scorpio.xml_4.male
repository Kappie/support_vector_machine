But then I always forget to write them down and when I finish a book or an album it takes me forever to come up with the name for a new one. I use this time as an excuse, or a sort of hiatus period, for not actually working on my next masterpiece. I'm at that point right now... Eventually I'll start writing again even if I haven't thought of a title, because that's just what I do.  Fan P talking...
