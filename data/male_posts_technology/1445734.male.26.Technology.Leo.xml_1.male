I've found many answers and yup, we do need those institutions (Read IIM's et.al.) that embed the qualities that make a difference in the professional world that we are living. But some can be groomed on the job. Some cannot. Some come by experience. All I am saying is that at the end of the day how productive are you to the company, and how much are you benifitted after putting in your efforts, is what counts. To me an MBA with an engineering mind is the best bet in today's IT scenario. I don't have an MBA but I do keep my eyes open and try to imbibe those qualities which may not be existent in an engineer. I think an MBA without an engineering mind is like seeing stars while your tent is stolen. I got this in my inbox which depicts what I am trying to say, rightly...  A MBA and an Engineer go on a camping trip, set up their tent,and fell asleep.  Some hours later, the Engineer wakes his MBA friend. " Look up at the sky and tell me what you see."  The MBA replies, "I see millions of stars."   The Engineer asks "What does that tell you?"   The MBA ponders for a minute :   Astronomically speaking, it tells me that there are millions of  galaxies and potentially billions of planets.   Astrologically, it tells me that Saturn is in Leo.   Time wise, it appears to be approximately a quarter past three.   Theologically, it's evident the Lord is all-powerful and we are small and insignificant.   Meteorologically, it seems we will have a beautiful day tomorrow.   What does it tell you?"   The Engineer friend is silent for a moment, then speaks.   "Practically...Someone has stolen our tent".
