Frank is either leveraging Jacques desire to drive a championship car, for little in salary, to make Ralph Schumacher cave on his ridiculous salary expectations, or legitimately negotiating with Jacque.  As mentioned before, Frank is the key poacher of high quality talent that is championship grade at low costs. Villeneuve is probably going to join the ranks of the other greats who signed on with Frank to be with a racer. The other greats all went on to championship status soon after signing with Frank. Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost and unfortunately Ayrton Senna were all grateful to be driving Franks cars.
