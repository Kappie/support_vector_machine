Today I purchased a game called  Ballerburg  - its kinda like Tanks but with base building as well.  It is amusing, and has good music.  It also cost a mere Â£1.  Gotta love Poundland.  Annoying, another game I bought not so long ago,  Project: Nomads  was also there, for exactly the same price, which was between a fifth and a tenth of what I paid.  The  Commando V3  write-up, as it is currently known, is coming along well.  It also reminded me of how good  GURPS Special Ops  is compared to  GURPS Covert Ops .  The former has lots of descriptions of special forces units, missions and tactics and a reasonable amount of gear.  The latter has loads of gear mainly covered by other books and surprisingly little else.  Both books have roughly the same page count.  Back to CV3.  FTL travel has now been finalised... for example, it takes about 90 (subjective) years to get from Sol to Altair.  The crew would experience about 9 of those, and probably less if they are in suspended animation.  I also expanded the timeline a little, but the whole thing is very "rough" at the moment and needs a lot of polishing.  My cat seems better today... I only hope he makes it through Monday's ordeal.
