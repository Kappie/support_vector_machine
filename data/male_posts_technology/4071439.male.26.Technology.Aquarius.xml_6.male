It also means it'll soon be time for me to leave the French Riviera. It sucks. I just know it's gonna rain when I get back home. But on the other hand, it's gonna be great being back in Sweden after 2 years in France. I didn't think I'd miss it, but I do.  This weekend I heading up to Paris for a weekend reunion with some of friends from the  urlLink Esstin  Engineering School. I've known these guys since I was a  Godfather  for one of them(Guillaume) when they were  urlLink Erasmus  students at my  urlLink uni . We haven't seen each other since we all started our internships in February, so this is the last get-together before graduation. We're gonna stay  Chez Remy  cuz his parents are away for vacation leaving us their suburban house.  We're gonnna party like it's 1999 .  Next week my sister is coming over and we're gonna spend 6 days enjoying the good life: sunny beaches, rowdy bars and hip clubs. I'll have to watch her closely though, cuz young blonde Swedish girls are a favourite pray for the don juans of southern France (Hey, she's my baby sister and only 20 years old) . This will be my first vacation since last august and I wish it would last a little bit longer, but I have to finish school.  And yeah, It'll be a while before my next blog, since I won't have access to a computer before I get back to Sweden. And it might take me a while since I'm driving the 2000 km in my  red  Renault Clio. Wish me luck.    Hold on, Stay Strong!
