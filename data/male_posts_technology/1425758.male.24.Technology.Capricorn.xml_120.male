His music is very good -- Hebrew, English, and instrumental too.  urlLink Give it a listen ! Clearly influenced by Bob Dylan and Pink Floyd and Radiohead to some point, but very original and varied. We swapped emails and i hope we will meet after my vacation. 
 It will be particularly interesting if i could hook him up with Eran and Miron...
