I was told I should have kept on applying the antibiotics despite the discomfort I was feeling. OK No choice, each time I just suck it in and bear the pain during my first application. At least the goodnews is that I only need to apply it every 2hrs now instead of 1 hr. My next appointment will be on Wed afternoon. Meanchile, I'm going to just make myself comfortable in bed.  Had to email Marcus and Ivy that I won't be able to meet them at the airport on Wed morning coz of the eye thing now.  Oh yea, imagine my pleasant surprise when an old poly classmate just emailed me on Friendster. I immediately forwarded it to our class members. Maybe after I recover I'll ask him out for coffee or something.
