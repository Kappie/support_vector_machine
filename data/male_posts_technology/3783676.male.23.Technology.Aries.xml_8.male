These guys fly Delphi Developers down from Joburg to Durban everytime they need something done. Now, from the sounds of things... I may be able to get my foot in the door here and get put onto a development contract with them. I'm meeting them on monday to see what they do and if I can do it. I'm pretty confident that I can do whatever they need me to do, which is great. Extra drinking and smoke money ;-) Plus I saw an old friend of mine from my ex-company... who's currently doing contract work up in Joburg... He reckons he'll send me the numbers I need to get setup, and I'll be well sorted! This is all sounding too good to be true, but I know only one or two of them will pan out. I ain't worried about that though... I've told myself that I will never work for anyone else ever again. I must make it on my own... no matter how tough it gets. I reckon I can do it, I believe in myself enough to do something with my life. I was not born for mediocrity, or so I keep telling myself :-P Anyway, long story short, things looking up on the business front now too!! Heh heh :-) I didn't call any of my personal interests today, I slept the whole day away... I pretty much did what I felt like doing today. Which is a great feeling. Tomorrow is Sunday, will be going to see the Spiderman 2 premiere at Gateway. Maybe I should call one of my shags for a celebratory shag afterwards? Hmmmm, yeah, I think thats a good idea ;-)
