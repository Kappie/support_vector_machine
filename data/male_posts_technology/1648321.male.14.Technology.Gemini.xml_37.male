       
      For Martin Luther King Jr. weekend, the Knudsons and the Myers are going up north to a cross-country ski resort called Maplelag. This is a yearly tradition and I won't have any new posts to my blog until at least Sunday night (I'll probably have it updated on Monday maybe). Well I hope all of you have a great three-day weekend and have tons of fun!
