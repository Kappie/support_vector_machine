Running as a web application in any JSP 1.2/Servlet 2.3 compatible web container, Pebble maintains blog entries as XML files and serves up blog content dynamically. All maintenance of blog entries, blog properties, themes and so on is performed through your web browser, negating the need to telnet/ssh to the host and making Pebble ideal for anybody who is constantly on the move, or accesses the Internet through a firewall/proxy server.
