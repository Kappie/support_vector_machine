On top of everything else, I am in the middle of a fucking gout attack.  How great is that?  I can't miss work either because I have to work Saturday.  To get a bonus day's worth of pay for this Saturday, I have to work 5 consecutive, at least, 8 hour days.  Now that's some shit.  I am in some serious fucking pain right now and I really can't stand being at work.  I don't know if anyone out there has ever had gout.  In my case, it's like having a million needles peircing the ball (not heel) of your foot everytime you move it.  Gout is like that, well it's actually crystalline induced arthritis.  It sucks.  Crystals form in the joints of one's lower extremeties and as two joints "rub" against each other, the whole joint gets inflammed.  With gout also comes a slight fever as well as a general lousy feeling.  I feel really shitty right now, kinda like a lazy, sleepy state where I don't want to do anything except lay in bed and just wait this gout out.  It's not going to go away anytime soon.  I already took a couple of pain killers as well as shit to help reduce the saturation of uric acid in my system.    Uric acid is what starts gout.  Remember those chemistry kits that you had when you were a kid?  The one where you could make crystals?  It's like pour the liquid in a jar and put contents of this package with it, wait a week and at the end of the week you will have crystals.  It's pretty much like that.  Too much uric acid in your system will cause gout.  Crystals will form in your joints, you feel lousy and shitty for a couple of days (maybe longer) and back you go.  It could be from slow metabolism or a huge intake all at once.  I think it was from this past weekend.  Actually I'm pretty sure that it was.  Friday we went to 602 and had a few beers.  That's no big deal but Saturday in Milwaukee and Sunday's dinner was what probably did me in.  Saturday was a huge drink feast.  I probably had about 3 pitchers all by myself while I was drinking with Jerry's family.  They drank a whole lot too!  Probably more than I did.  So that's number 1.  Too much beer.  Another factor was the beer nuts.  Yep, there was this huge thing of nuts at the bar and we just kept getting more and more.  It was the one that had the shells and you had to crack it open.  Yerah those, it was good.  So in Milwaukee, uric acid came in the form of beer and nuts.  I knew I was going to get this gout too!  I called it.  After the Cubs game and the 2nd bowl of nuts, I figure I was going to be dying sometime this week from gout.  Well I am pretty much dying right now.  It hurts like a bitch.  See red meat also has a lot of uric acid.  Guess what I had for dinner Sunday?  I had a nice huge steak.  Yeah.  So I had steak yesterday for breakfast and for dinner last night.  SHIT!!!  This sucks.  Yeah, I was just writing to get my mind of the pain for a little bit.  Man, I just know that this is just the beginning.  Tonight will be terrible and tomorrow will be unbeliveable.  on a pain scale of 1-10 with 10 being the worst (meaning you can't even stand) right now I have a 7.  It hurts but I can still do it.  I know as the day goes on it will slowly reach 8-9 and by tomorrow a 10.  I probably won't even be able to put a sock on.  God I wish I had a girl here to pamper me.  That would be great!  Sorry to bore everyone with a very ridiculous entry about gout and feeling lousy but this really sucks!
