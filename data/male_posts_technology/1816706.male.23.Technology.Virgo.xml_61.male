After that we went to Ke'e beach for a little bit, and then we went to hike the first mile or so of the Na Pali coast or Kalalau trail on Kauai which was cool, reminded me of traveling again.  Ate lunch back with the relatives, then me and Andy drove and saw spouting horn and then went and drove all the way up to Waimea Canyon which I believe is the Grand Canyon of the South Pacific.  Pretty cool day.
