The Weekend seems very enjoyful especially for Hong Kong people, I read their blog and found that they could have a lot of plans and places to enjoy. Compare to Malaysian's blog, they are more on blogging they thought and daily bored story (might just like me). Hmm.. does it mean that KL is just a boring city to Malaysian indirectly? Again, it is depends. Malaysia is having Mega Sales, which it is a GOOD NEWS to girls or people who like to shop a lot. I went to Mid Valley today, it is soooooooooooo crowded. Although every shops has air-cond but it is defeated by the people there. Some of the shop even take out Stand-Fan to ensure their employees wont fainted by the crowded air however. Jaya Jusco, Metrojaya, Carrefour, U2, Padini, SEED, Watson, MPH, Vincci, MNG, Guess, etc... even TOILET also good in business.. :P Wonder where are these people comes from arh... Hmm, but i am sure they definitely enjoy in their weekend. :) As for me, i wish to travel myself to a place which can give peaceful feeling, eg Genting Highlands, or places like beach side. To release stressssss and pressuresssssss that have been collecting within this 3 months.
