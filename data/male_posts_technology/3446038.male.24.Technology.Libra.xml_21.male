Resolutions to attend all classes, that in a week's time will dwindle into a struggle to keep afloat above the 75 % attendance mark...  Anyway, in this thadaal optimistic mood, I actually shook myself awake so I could attend the first class of this sem.... The female who was to handle the course is supposedly a stickler for punctuality and things like that, so me, ultra-carefully showed up some 10 minutes before class... Was nice standing and walking around in the CRC corridor, so just hung around there...  Time passed, no one showed up... At 9, 5 minutes past class time, 3 others showed up and well, waited out there without a word... We soon had more company, but not in a quantity that would really have made me happy about forgoing my sleep... Some 8-10 of us were now standing in the corridor... Anyway, at 9:20, halfway through what would have been the class, me decided to take a small detour from my stroll on the corridor and passed into the classroom...  There it was... Written on the board in large, friendly letters -  AM 566, Signal Processing, course starts Monday. No class on Thursday and Friday
