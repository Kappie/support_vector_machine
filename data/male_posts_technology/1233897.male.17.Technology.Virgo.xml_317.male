Because of this I'm not going to write the long and envolved post about it that I was going to, but'll save it for later.   Wow, I type so much slower with just my left hand (LOL)  *added Sunday March 21st*  Yeah about that party... I did more schoolwork in the 24 hours before it that I'd ever thought possible because my mom wouldn't let me go unless a certain amount of back work was done. ...That was crazy... well, so was how much I drove in the hour before the party: It started at three and I left the house at 1:55... 'Drove to the Beaverton/Tigard border, bought gifts, drove to Steven's house a bit deeper into Beaverton, drove all the way around inot greater Beaverton (Farmington area and such) to avoid a huge traffic jam that I'd seen before... drove  all  the way into Hillsboro to pick up Cam, stayed a bit the wrap presents and watch part of a movie (?!? lol) then brove back to Aloha to arive at Melissa's house at just after 3:10.  Certain parties whose names I will not mention made the whole thing more of a pain than it already was by continously cracking sick jokes and egging eachother on... That was really annoying. Cam, Melissa, Jen and I finally went outside to get away from it, and finally locked ourselves (minus Jen, I think) in my car. That sorta backfired because the people we were trying to get away from followed us outside but we decided to to protest because now they weren't inside and everyone could go back to watching to movie or whatever it was they were trying to do...  Finally after a while, we succeded in getting just Cam, Melissa, *will insert name of Melissa's friend when I ask Melissa what it is later...* and I in the car by ourselves and drove off for a while.  A bit after that, I turned my car around so the back was facing the basketball hoop and started playing music... That was fun, we just hung out outside doing whatever for a while.  Then, after the sickness had finally died down, I went back inside to watch everyone play Dance Dance Revolution on someone's Playstation2. That was pretty funny.  After all this came my expirience with the rosebush... that was when almost everyone was leaving so I didn't miss out on much because of it (lol) You know, looking back on it from over a week later, I'm realizing that that was the only reason Gwen talked to me that night so I guess I should be thankful for it in some weird was... (LOL)  Speaking of Gwen, let's talk about social networking at the party and such: First and formost, YoungHee's bro. apparently goes to TVJA and from that YoungHee knows Jeff, whom she brought over to do some magic tricks... Now, Cam, Andrew (who wasn't there, but has been at almost every other activity) and I had always been somehow led to believe that Jeff was someone to shy away from and because of such, never relaly talked to him. But now, in the closer envirionment of the party, he seemed like someone interesting to get to know. The second person whom I know almost nothing about is Richard: When we came, Jen, Gwen and Adri were hunkered away in Melissa's room practicing a song that they sang on Friday, so I got a chance to talk to Richard a bit, not long mind you though because the girls got out of the room almost immediately after we got there... From then on, Richard and Gwen were pretty seclusive, mostly cuddling and spending time in rooms apart from where everyone else was... I think that's in part the fault of the two people that were annoying everyone else that I talked about earlier. Oh well, I don't know what to make of it. Sux for me (LOL) but that's life.
