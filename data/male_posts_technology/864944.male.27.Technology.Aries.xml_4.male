Its no Jamaican Blue Mountain.. but I save that for weekends.    So whats happening in life... lets see...   my buddy  urlLink Jay Brewer  has done a re-design of his site.  Kinda creepy.. but deffinitely cool looking.   Make sure you stop into his movies section.  All sorts of no-good there :)  ---  My plans for Mt Washington have been coming along nicely.   We have further documentation about the route.. nice maps.. and a gread guide.  The Appalacian Mountain Club (sp?) has a guide the the White Mountains that is very nice.  Excellent trail descriptions.  It should be quite an adventure.   If I live, I'll be sure to post plenty on it :)  ---  Tonight is the loved tradtional Drinkin' Wednesday.   A bunch of my pals and I like to gather at a local bar and have a few while we enjoy each other's company.  It has been a few Wednesdays since we have done it, so it was about time.  This week looks to be the Cambridge Common.. always a good time.     ---   I am reading about J2EE architecture at work.  If you dont know what that is, dont fret.  J2EE is a platform upon which you develop software.  Basically a set of specifications to design Java code to.  I am VERY glad to be moving our product away from the old-style ASP that we have been trapped with since I started.  OH HEY.. on that note.. my YEAR has passed!  *happy vesting day*  YAY!!  We'll see ifone day that is worth something more than a nice lunch :)  So the herculean design effort continues.. with the herculean developement effort to follow close behind.  ---  Gmaing stuff:  urlLink Mafia  is a FANTASTIC game.  It plays a little like  urlLink Grand Theft Auto 3 , only mafia feels more like a movie that you play, where GTA3 was a random running amok in a virtual city.   Someday we can talk about my views on violence in video games in further detail, but for now, lets just say that I think the violence does not bother me in general.    Mafia is a mobster game set in the 30's, in the height of mob rule.  Authentic cars, and period city streets abound in a virtual city called Lost Haven.  The plot is driven along as you play out the role of "Tommy" a taxi driver, coerced into helping mobsters in a getaway.. then deciding later to give the life of crime a try.  The cinematics are nothing short of stunning in their presentation.  The game plays out as Tommy recants his life of crime to a detective.  His plan is to get out of the mafia for good, and he intends to turn over evidence to convict the don, Salieri.  As Tommy flashes back to his life and how it is what it is, you jump in the drivers seat to play out car chases, and shootouts that Tommy is referring to.  All in all.. great characters, great gameplay, and great graphics.   Solid game, and I reccommend it.   Ok.. thats it for now.. BACK TO J2EE!!
