A man (played by  urlLink Jim Carrey ) is chocked to discover that his girlfriend, played by  urlLink Kate Winslet , has had her memories of them erased. Depressed by this, he decides to have her removed from his own memory. Mostly taking place within Joel's mind, the movie follows his memories of her as each memory is replaced. But in the middle of the process, Joel realises he doesn't want to forget her, so he starts trying to put her into other memories where she originally wasn't to keep her from being erased...  This is another awesome story by screenwriter extraordinaire  urlLink Charlie Kaufman , responsible for movies like  urlLink Adaptation  and  urlLink Being John Malkovich .  The one main drawback is that the movie is a bit too long. Some of Joel's relived memories could have been skipped. Apart from that, I cannot find any fault with this film. -->
