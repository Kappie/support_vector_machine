I needed a serious nap between 1pm and 2pm, and that never happens to me.   But, I'm not going to quit yet. If it works, it is worth it.  urlLink Hunger is an illusion  I suppose -- it's a trick your body plays on your brain. For 33 years, that little trick has caused be to go down and grab a snack at 3pm or munch on some chips or popcorn at 10pm. You can be hungry simply because you're bored. My body has been trained to expect a snack 'whenever it wants it'.  Here's the rub. In the last two days, I have been eating nothing but healthy food. I had a lovely dinner of carrots, broccoli and hot dogs (without the bun). OK, there are those who would argue that hot dogs are not healthy. But the body needs meat -- in my case, all I ever usually eat is meat. Hot dogs are as good as a chicken breast or a slice of lean beef. Let me tell you though, those hot dogs were the best tasting hot dogs I've ever had. You don't understand the tastiness of food unless you subject yourself a bit of hunger every now and then.  I feel like Homer Simpson... Mmmm... Hot Dogs...  But I digress... I have been eating carrots, cottage cheese, string beans, beets -- man oh man. This is so not me.  Mmmm... carrots...
