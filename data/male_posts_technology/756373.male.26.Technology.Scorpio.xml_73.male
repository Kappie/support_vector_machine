It's rare that I agree with any proposals the Namibian government makes, but on this issue I have to agree with the government's request that the  urlLink ivory ban be loosened . ( urlLink another link ) At least, to a degree. Looking at the Etosha elephant population, over the past couple of decades, conservation efforts have been successful to the point where  urlLink elephant herds are now overpopulating  Etosha to the point of decimating the park's flora. Many now die of starvation, many more have to be culled to prevent the park from turning into a wasteland. Relocating the excess is simply not an option. As a result, elephant ivory is being stockpiled by the conservation effort instead of simply left to rot.  Using this natural resource to perhaps alleviate some of the locals' abject poverty, possibly even lend a degree of economic empowerment/independance to a people so reliant on government assistance, is far from immoral, in my opinion. Would loosening the ban promote poaching? It's possible, but considering we have massive stockpiles currently, I tend to doubt. One thing is for certain, it will have to be carefully regulated and controlled. Locals would have to buy the ivory from the government at very cheap rates, lest they be tempted to poaching instead. What I don't support, however, is for government  itself  to export ivory en-masse to international markets. This resource should solely be provided to licensed locals - artists and the like. This would vitalise the tourist trade, forcing foreigners to come  here  to acquire the white gold, and would be a better long-term solution as opposed to exporting the raw ivory in bulk to China.
