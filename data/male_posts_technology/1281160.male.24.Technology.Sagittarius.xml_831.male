To anwser Xavier's  Kavitha's questions: I'm starting on Jan 11th.....My last leg is from Germany to Chennai  the flight's arrival time is, 13th, January, 12.00 A.M.....Kavi, I'll be there in Chennai for the next 13 hrs....My train to Karaikudi, is at 1.00 P.M on Jan 13th... But i would have to visit Chennai atleast three times, i guess....though the dates are not decided....  Had i got my tickets in British airways, I would have met Sindhu....unfortunately, could find a convinient one, only in Lufthansa!!  Congrats Kicha......Keep Going man....You still have lots in store......  My boss gave me a gift for Christmas!!!.....A cool hand-knitted colorful woolen scarf.....The gift itself was wonderful  getting it from her, was even more joyful....  Yeah, so what do you guys think abt the get-together...Does that sound feasible?....If you feel it's feasible, please do e-mail Kicha, so that we could finalize our venue.   That copyright issue.....was indeed an experience!!!....we have had lots of inputs about copyrights......Mahendran kalagam nanmayil mudindhadhu!!!  The book review was great Vijay Babu.....  Enjoy your hols  Merry Christmas, once again!!!
