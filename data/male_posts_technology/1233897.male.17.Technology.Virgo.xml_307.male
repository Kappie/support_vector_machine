We stopped for gas and Adri's mom called (file that information away for later) and then were on our way again. We got to Becky's house a bit afterward (prolly something like 1:00), stayed there for a while, then got a ride to the closest MAX station. We rode that to the zoo, but there Adri's mom called and got mad at her for not calling and telling her when we were leaving Becky's house. Because of this, Adri's mom came and picked her up (go  here  to read Adri's oppinion about that - lol). My mom had gotten home before this, discovered I was gone, and had begun a day-long endevor to call as many people as possible and trash-talk me as much as possible in hopes that it would bring me home faster (F*** you, mom...) Anyway, she had gotten around to Adri's mom, and Adri's mom had kindly offered me a ride home, but I refused it saying that I hadn't come this far just to go back home when my mom told me to (...again).   Anyway, long story short, Becky, Steven and I had a great time at the zoo, though it was close to closing time and I don't think we saw  every single  exibit, but yeah, we had a great time. Afterward, we went further downtown (without paying MAX fare since we were only three stops from Fareless Square - o.O) and ate linner / dunch at Pioneer Place.  We finally headed back to Hillsboro on the MAx and arrived at the end of the line around 7:00. Becky's dad came to pick us up, but informed me that my mom had called and instructed him not to, under any circumstances, give me a ride anywere... That was odd, but whatever. Yeah... anyway, Steven and I just ran the ½-1½ miles to another MAX stop, got on, went to the Fair Grounds, got off, ran another 1000+ feet and met up with them at the Burgerville (lol... I'm still not sure why we went there... oh well, whatever). Anyway, we said goodbye to them and decided to head back. On the way back to Beaverton Transit on the MAX, two random college girls came up to us and started majorly hitting on us... The conversation went something like this:  Them: So, what'cha doing later tonight? Us: Um... going home... Them: Aw come on, it's Saturday night, night before break, let's go have some fun! Us: Um... all last week has been break. Them: Yeah, wait, wha...? how old are you? Us: 17... Them: Serious, no way! (to eachother: ooo, ooo, jail babe!) *We kinda just look at eachother right about now, wonder when they're going to go away* Them: (to eachother again: Well, they're kinda cute anyhow)  This kept going on for a bit, but you get the gist of it...  When we finally got to Beaverton Transit, we boarded a bus heading for my house, had an interesting discussion about the controversial restraunt  Hoooters  with a complete stranger, and finally arrived at the bus stop just over a mile from my house. Steven called him mom, who came and picked him up once we got to my door, and I went inside and greeted... my sisters. Turns out that my mom was gone to a bridal shower and my dad was gone to... something or other else.  Anyway, once my mom and dad both got home, they sat me down and mom listed her punishments for me (My dad had no punishments because in his view, I really didn't do much wrong... just needed some time to get away for a while.)  Punishments are as follows: 1. The doors to my bedroom and the office have locks installed on them, I am not allowed access to them for two weeks, which, in theory, negates the possibility of internet usage. 2. I am not allowed to drive for two weeks, though mom did return my car itself. 3. No activities whatsoever outside of school (this includes extra Calculus help after school...)
