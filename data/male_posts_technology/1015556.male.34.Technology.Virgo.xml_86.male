And yes, Katie has been camping outside, once in the backyard... I remember the first time I did it with her when she was probably 18 months or so.  It was probably the most impactful time I have ever had with one of my kids.  That was the turning point of her toddler years, the point where I was no longer her father, but her dad.  I still think about that sometimes, what a profound influence time makes in relationships. You can see some pictures of Camp Sheng  urlLink here .
