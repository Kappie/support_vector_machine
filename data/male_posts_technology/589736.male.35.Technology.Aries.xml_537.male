"I took [the anti-depressant] Paxil for a few months and it helped. [But] I was dropped from the state insurance plan because they could not locate me (homeless people can be hard to find), so I no longer have the means to obtain the medicine."     urlLink http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/10/14/homeless/index.html
