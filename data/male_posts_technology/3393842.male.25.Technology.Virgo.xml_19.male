It took me an invitation to  urlLink Gmail  to correct my thought, thanks  urlLink Ajay . In one of my earlier posts I've said Yahoo's 100MB is fine with me. That still holds, cos it could take a long time for me to fill it up (hopefully), my habbit of not retaining forwards would stay on for some more time inspite of the space. I am digressing, back to gmail now. Apart from breaking the mental barriers we had about web based e-mail, this sets the expectations on web apps to come. I did read about the auto contact lookup and stuff, but seeing it work is a different thing altogether.  As of now, Its been close to an hour since I got the account which is too short to give a fair opinion (on all its shortcomings). Buf if the saying "The first impression is the best impression", gmail comes with a bang. Folks, if you've not got it yet, I tell you its going to be worth the switch over.  Ok.. so e-mail is finished what next ?  Music player.. yes that's another application I'd not live without in a PC. If someone could come up with a web based music player, nah.. not the plugin based stuff that we have already, and without the delays seen in streaming multimedia content, it would be another killer app. But the problem with music unlike email is that it does not come under the free speach category. Hmm.. I'd love to stick to  urlLink FireFox  and the web apps if only all the apps I use became experiences like this one just did.
