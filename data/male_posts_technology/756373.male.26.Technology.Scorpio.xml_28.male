And what causes it?  I was walking back to work today after getting some takeout for lunch, and the simplest thing - the lazy sun caressing my face as I strolled along - caused a feeling of contentment, a happiness to merely be  alive , a feeling I am (and I think many of us are) quite unused to. Walking back to the office, I remembered the real golden days of my youth. Junior high, Friday afternoons, a pocket full of small change and a world of arcades to pay homage to. Myself and a friend would routinely spend our afternoons off from school just walking around town, between arcades and shopping malls and book and toy stores. Just the two of us, and three hours of sheer bliss. Not a care in the world. No worries about being alone, about money, no worries about what had to be done tomorrow. We'd walk slowly down our town's main street, revelling in the loving dull-heat of a winter afternoon's sun. We'd watch cars and people going by just for the hell of it. We'd slake our thirst with an ice cold Coke - and in that  moment , that Coke was our whole world..and that world was perfect. Laughter and smiles and jokes came so easily then. Ever since, my favourite times of the year have been Friday afternoons in August. Here in my home town, August afternoons are just perfect. They seem to hold so much promise, they call to you to enjoy the contrast between the lingering chill of winter and the welcoming warmth of the coming spring, they whisper temptations to skip work, lie back, and just contentedly  be .  The late winter afternoons of the late eighties were the best of the bunch - no worries about peer pressure and girls yet, and school was simple and easy. What happened to those days? I'll tell you what happened. 1)We stopped caring about the  moment . 2)We started working, and Friday afternoons were lost forever to the corporate money-making slave-machine that is capitalism.  Today, all grown up, scarcely a minute goes by without a fear of some future event, without worrying about what's going to happen next. There is constant apprehension about when we have to meet a deadline, or when we are supposed to catch that show on TV.  When young, time was our friend. We knew how to enjoy our spare time, how to have real fun with the time we had. Today, it is our enemy. Even when playing a computer or video game we are constantly worrying about some future detail. Like, when should we log off to get some sleep. Or when you have to halt your game of Warcraft 3 in order to meet up with someone, somewhere, sometime. Or when we have to check our mail , check up on the forums, check up on our IRC contacts, etc etc.  Add to that just how  little  spare time we have now compared to then, and it seems futile to even try and enjoy ourselves.   Our adult lives are filled to the brim with responsibility to others, to friends, to family, to a job. We have lost the capability of prioritising a responsibility to ourselves. Gone are the days of just saying to your best bud, "Whaddaya wanna do this afternoon", and him saying "I dunno, let's go play Golden Axe." Not being able to live in the now anymore is a real, personal and profound tragedy. I really miss those days.
