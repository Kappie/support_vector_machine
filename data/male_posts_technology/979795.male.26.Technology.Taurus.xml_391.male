I even had time to grab a dinner at MacDonald's before going for class. When I arrived, I caught a slight glimpse of the seniors sitting in seiza and I could hear Williams Sensei explaining aspects of weapons work (bokken to be specific) to the class. I was both flustered and puzzled at the same time. I thought I was late and class had already started. So I quietly slipped away from the door to the toilet downstairs to change into my gi. When I came back, I waited at the door and saw Williams Sensei (for the first time), explaining or talking to the class. Next thing I noticed was that everyone had a bokken in their hands. Pengz ... I didn't bring mine because I thought weapons wouldn't be taught. Geez ... first I was late, second I forgot my weapons. Thought I really deserved to sit at the back of class to watch instead of joining in.  While I sat in seiza (which I later changed to cross legged coz of my strained left ankle), more and more people started arriving. That's when I checked the clock in the room and realised it was early. I did arrive early. (Whew!) and I noticed a stack of weapons on the left side of the dojo. So the class didn't bring their weapons either. (Double whew!) Just as class was about to start, Williams Sensei left the seniors and came towards us, the new arrivals. Frankie Sensei introduced each and everyone of us and he shook hands warmly with everyone. That really struck me. He was such a warm and friendly person. He carried himself in a very casual manner but the words he used often carried a certain 'oomph' that it always made us think. I do feel that I did manage to pick up some things. I only wish I can constantly remember his teachings. He was very relaxed and casual with the class. There were some laughs here and there as well. We started with warmups and he corrected us on a lot of technical things as well. Some of which were certain co-ordination exercises (musubi). As there were a certain no of seniors about to be graded on Sun, the lower kyus had to train separately instead. Still Williams Sensei came over to teach us. First thing he wanted to do was check our rolls. I picked up a lot about forward rolls. I only wished I could put into words what I had learnt that evening about my rolls. Suffice to say, I intend to spend regular and a good deal of time correcting the finer points of my roll. Williams Sensei was always kind with his words and he was always very encouraging to everyone. It made everyone feel like his praises was as sincere as his critiscms. Despite being pressed for time, the patience he displayed in class was extraordinary. Though he was constantly explaining things to the students, it never felt 'boring', 'tedious' or anything like that. On the contrary, everyone seemed to hang on to his every word and advice. It was one heckuva experience.  Today, I went down to ARCC for class and Williams Sensei conducted the class. Again, some of us came very early. We all hoped to join the class early and learn as much as we could. Prior to class, Williams Sensei showed everyone a VCD of his daughter taking her SHODAN (1st dan)!!! She was veeeeeeeeery good! Her movement and strategy was similar to the lady in the video Gary showed me once before (nidan/sandan grading I think). Even Williams Sensei commented that she was pretty good but her performance on that grading wasn't her best. He's seen her work much better under preassure and he pointed out some aspects of her techniques or weapons work that 'should improve when she gets more serious with her training'. And guess what? She only just turned 13!!! .... I wanna pengz liao. If that's the standard for a 13 yr old who isn't 100% serious with her training ... I can't imagine how she's gonna be like when she gets older. Anyway, even Williams Sensei did comment that he sees a lot of potential in her. There were tons of randori against 2 ukes. Her weapons work was also extremely good. Everything was smooth and flowy whether her ukes were kyu or dan grades. I was like ... speechless man. I only wish there's some way to make a copy of the VCD.  We started with warmups followed by some co-ordination exercises before beginners were split up from the rest of the class. Again, this was to facilitate the seniors training before the grading tomorrow morning. But this time, as there weren't enough ukes. They asked me Tony and I to join the seniors to help out as ukes because we were 5th kyu Aikikai. It felt great to be uke today because I did learn a lot as well. Each Senior (to be graded) would call up a senior and a junior kyu as ukes. The training went so good today that we will be helping out in tomorrow morning's grading. I saw Leong videoing down yesterday's and today's sessions. After the grading and Tuesday's sessions are over, I'll have to ask for a copy of the videos. It's too good a class not to share it!!  I'm really looking forward to the grading at GWCC tomorrow morning. But after that I'll need to rush off down to BVCC for Hattori Sensei's seminar with AFS. I'm feeling a bit guilty about sacrificing more than half of the seminar but I think I really don't have a choice. No regrets so far anyway, I'm sure whichever I go I'd still be enjoying myself thoroughly.  Williams Sensei ended today's class with a talk on how Aikido is applied in our daily living and such. A lot of good advice and pointers today. Tis been a truly Aiki weekend so far.
