Proper revision starts tomorrow though, when my sis has no more hordes of friends round (thank god!). But, at least we have glorious weather! Mum and I sat out in the garden this afternoon, we are both as white as sheets so we have decivede that we needed to tan! Unfortunatley I'm still as white as when I started, but hey, I'mm looking after my skin and I 'm not gonna look 40 when I'm 20 (me hopes!!). Anyway, gotta go, people to go, places to see.......bye!
