However, we do have MTV, whichI though would be quite good asI do have a passing interest in some music (mostly classic rock and metal). However, i turn it on and it's a show called CRIBS. It's "Throught the Keyhole" without the guesswork basically, and the person taking you on a tour is the owner of the house. Two people who don't exist as far as I knew, who are somehow famous, except no-one knows who they are. Next up "Making the video", pretty self explanitory. Up next, MTV News, reporting about people who are not yet famous, and people we thought had died years ago. Next, More CRIBS, followed by "Newlyweds, the series." Big brother for the famous.  For over seven hours i flicked back and forth hoping to find the one thing playing I got the channel for, Music! There was none to be had. I checked the TV listing on the net, and lo and behold, Music was to be played at 8am the following day. I double, and triple checked the listing, with no change. There was music on at 10pm that day, right in the middle of sky one's more bearable shows. I decided to try the 10pm music show, only to be appaled at the low quality of the actual music. Techno-club remix hour, followed by "The Osbournes".  Two hours of music a day on a music TV channel. Un-shagging-believable!  So nowI am forced to find some way of getting VH-1 and VH-1 classic back. I hadn't actually watched MTV in over a year, so i didn't know what had happened, but it's all been religated to it's spin-off channels and the prime channel is nothing more than some shallow, pop-culture, trash pile. I mean come on, who realy want's to know what the contents of Julian Markhursts bread bin are? And more to the point, who the fuck is she? Anyone?  Even MTV news has gone to the dogs. It used to bring tour-dates, cancelations, new gigs and music releases. Now? Madonna has stubbed her toe, and will be cancelling her european tour, also, Britney has a new man in her life! For twenty minutes, whilst tour information is religated to the website now, unless it's by someone realy populare, like Christina Agulera's body, plus whatever outfit she's wearing this minite.  Have people become that shallow and vain now? Please, surely the human race hasen't devolved that much in two years. All the good stuff in now on channels costing almost twenty pounds a month for the 2 channels, which doesn't seem fair somehow. But then life isn't fair is it.  Rest in peace MTV's soul, for the corporate trash have forever buried you.
