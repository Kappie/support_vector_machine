"There, there now G-Dubya. A little worried about the outcome of the elections?" If we'd used the National Guard for it's intended purpose (guarding the nation) instead of spreading them across the global oil fields, we might not need this precaution. But then again, if we use the same tactics to win as we did during the last election, things are going to look mighty fishy... Activists for democracy all over the nation went into action writing their congressmen and women, airing their fears that we'll have an unelected president again... or still... or whatever. The fact remains that Dubya's party is still in power... and that would look fishy too. We  need  an angle. Car bombs on Wall Street? " Never before have we collected this kind of complete intellegence from the terrorists".   ORANGE ALERT! Plastic on your windows!More to come from the Dirctor of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge... HERE COMES THE FEAR!
