When I was in 7th standard my father arranged a person to come to our home and teach me guitar. His name was Johny and he taught me the basics of Guitar. Later, continued my guitar lessons from Baby Kallingal, who is a professional guitarist.     During the time, I started playing guitar in functions conducted in my school. By the time I reached the age of 18 I went to many masters for guitar lessons. Apart from Mr. Johny and Mr. Baby who taught me basics of guitar lessons, Mr. Chinmayananda, Mr Saju, Mr. Benny and Mr. Thej became my guitar teacher. All of them taught me different styles. I learned the Indian karnatic style, Spanish accoustic guitar style, western style and western classical finger plucking style from these masters.     When I joined my B. Tech degree programme, I stopped learning guitar from my masters and started self learning. I used to play guitar in the choir troop in my dioces and neighbouring dioces during that time.     Now, its a pure hobby for me. I spent atleast half an hour with my guitar daily and really enjoy it. When ever I am alone, or feeling lazy in my home, I will start playing guitar and then my mind will get refreshed.
