That was great fun; we dragged the dancemat, PS2, TV, DVD's, laptop and some other stuff downstairs to muck around with. In the morning, I got up and went down to the newsagent to get a copy of PCZONE UK, which has previews of Max Payne 2! Yay!  On my way home from Daves (I has to walk from Selsdon to Caterham) I thought to myself "Ah, I bet im gonna see somebody I know walking down Limpsfield Road, I bet it'll be Robert". Sod's law came into play; so yes, I saw Rob with his boyfriend walking down Limpsfield Road. At the bus stop just before I saw Rob, I thought I saw Nicki.J at the bus stop, and as my eyesight isn't very good, I couldnt make out who the person was, but I thought it was Nic. It turned out to be Robs mum! :-/  Hey! I walked through the park today on my way home! It was about 12:00 ish. When did you lot get there?  I can't resist posting this: (Sorry Nic!) :D    YUMMY!!!   My plan of the week: Saturday - Cry because Nic is going away for the whole week. Sunday - Nothing. Monday - Thorpe Park. Tuesday - Nothing. Wednesday - Nothing. Thurdsay - Nothing. Friday - Cry because i'm so happy Nic is coming home! :D Saturday - Talk to Nic. Sunday - Go to park with Nic!!!!! YAY!!!!!!
