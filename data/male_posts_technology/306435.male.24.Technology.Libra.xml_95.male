He was playing bad songs and then cutting them off half way through.  He also kept telling everyone he was from Kiss 107 like this dance was gong to make us start listening.  There was lots of drama...you know typical dance stuff.  Over the weekend Ann's family came to town and I spent a good chunk of time with them.  Judy is a big fan of the Ryan.rules.it ... so far that is two shout outs!  Ann graduated.  It was a long service.  We placed bets on when it would end.  Mary won with 2:25 or something close to that.  Justin also walked which was surprising.
