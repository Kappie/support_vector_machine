I tried to explore the area to look for somewhere to grab a bite. After walking around in the rain for awhile, I decided the closest spot was too far and I turned back. By the time I got back to the gathering pt, almost everyone had arrived except for a few laggers here and there. Finally the event was cancelled but breakfast had to be consumed as they had already been indented (ordered, to u civilians out there). Me and some of the guys wandered around looking for somwhere to hang out and decided to goto the Kallang Leisure Park. 2-4 of the guys played bowling while I just watched and napped. After that we all went back home. Kinda a waste of the morning, was looking forward to trying the Dragonboat thingy since I was already there. Damn the weather. Anyway, Saw RSM just now. I decided to join in the 9 Div Panthers road relay as a reserve. Going to go back to Selarang (my old and previous camp) for training the next few Suns.  In the afternoon, met Darren (Uni friend). We went down to sign up for the same Japanese language class. It's going to cost 200+ for about 10 weeks, 1430-1730hrs every Sun. Hopefully I can pursue this longterm. I think it starts 26th Oct. I might've remebered wrongly but it seems to be clashing with the Panther's Run.
