The Marlins went on to score eight runs in the inning and win the game."  I have only one thing to say about the Cubs disappoiinting loss to the Marlins... They were up 3 games to 1 in the series. They only had to win 1 game out of the next 3. They lost all 3 games. What does that tell you?  Stop blaming an innocent fan who was trying to catch a foul ball. That one play did not impact the game at all. The real problem was with the Cubs -- they sucked. The better team won.
