W00T.  Anyway, yesterday was 'Canada' day. So for all you Canadians out there. Happy Canada day! (It's I forgot day, and since I forgot Canada day, does that make it ok to mention it?)  and in case I don't get out of this working coma, Happy Independence Day!!! Let the fireworks begin!!! W00T  Peace out- T
