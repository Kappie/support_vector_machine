But I really hate it coz I think I'm also usinga lot of excuses to slack. Especially when it comes to my school work. I'm behind schedule on my final year project and also my essays. Really need to catch up at this point in time. I have tonight, but I think my Aikido is probably gonna tax me up quite a fair bit for me to work efficiently. Maybe if I don't use too much strength or energy and see how things goes...  What's this tag board thingy  urlLink  you were talking about? My friend jsut sent me an email on something he called a 'commenting service'. That wouldn't be the same now would it?  I've submitted a mini-project for my VR module. I'm gonna make a virtual dojo webpage. Wah a lot of things I need to look into. Musn't be too difficult and and interfere with my final year project schedule, and musn't be too simple that I can't get a decent score. Really troublesome. But interesting lah. Just wish I had more time to work on this instead of cramping everything in now. Think when I go back Singapore I might look for some kinda course or books to do my personal project andhost it on my website or something. At least with a VR website, I can probably escape Geocities' stupid pop up on the top right corner of my pages. Spitz at them... ptuiz.  Anyway, I got about 4.5 hrs to work on my final year project now before Aikido leaving for Aikido tonight. Hope I can accomplish something today. Gambatte kudasai!
