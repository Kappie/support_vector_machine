Today I got a mail from  (name censored)  who told me in  his/her  own way that I'm trying to act smart by that last mail that I sent to msitmmb and that nobody else kidded like that. Oh...Boy..!! Has our people lost a sense of humour... or rather, lost a sense of differentiation between humour and something else... I've mailed a one-liner reply to that person saying  "But I thought you had sense of humour."   If that person gets to read this post of mine and that of valli's (I wish  he/she  does),  he/she  will get to know, the very informal and cheerful culture prevailing among us... if that person doesn't like this, then we can't help it...
