Ahhh, I feel sooo much better.  Ahh...  That's onomatopoeia?  Went to Tuttle Mall yesterday with Sue, Josh, and Hanz.  I don't know how to spell Hanz.  Oh well, I'll ask Susan later.  Got some new clothes at the swank new, Express for Men, Incorporating Structure...  Ugh, poor Structure.  It's kind of like how DJ Rob Engel has to play at liberties now...  So sad.  But there did seem to be a lot more people in there than normal.  I bought a book on Worst Case Scenarios.  I like the way it's setup... kind of reminds me of my Boy Scout manual when I was a kid.  Except each book seems to be one of two extremes, either too benign or too amazingly daring.  The Worst Case book would be the latter.  I don't have much else to say about yesterday.  Eric is like 95% moved in now.  Jeremy is still missing his cell phone.  Tani doesn't have much left in our apt anymore.  Rocko still lives with us.  Danielle was partying at some drug infested rave at a house two doors down from me yesterday.  That bothered me a lot.  Later.
