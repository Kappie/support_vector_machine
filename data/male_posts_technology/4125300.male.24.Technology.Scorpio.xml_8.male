Little bit apprehensive I suppose.  Listening to NPR today, I noted lots of talk about Sudan.  For those that may not know, something similar in nature to the Holocaust has been and continues to occur there.  Apparently a government backed arab militia is going around killing, raping and generally destroying a certain ethnicity.  First response is horror.   I genuinely don't understand how people can be so separated from their humanity as to do such a thing.  Second response is horror -- this time over the World's inability to do anything about it.  In recent history Western nations (i.e. Europe, U.S.),  seemed to be the only nations with the military strength and moral credibility to do such a thing.  However through ill advised war against Iraq has robbed the U.S. and parts of Europe of their ethical high ground.  A military prescence in another mostly muslim nation would look very bad about now.    A quick note on the reporting of the Sudan issue.  The reporter called himself NPR's Africa correspondant.  One reporter for an entire continent seems insufficient if you ask me.  Note to self:  donate to NPR soon.
