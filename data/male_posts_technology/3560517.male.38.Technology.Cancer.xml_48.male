Of all the items in the below poll, they choose Arrogant as the headline where Bush and Kerry are within the magrin of error.  52% of voters say Bush is arrogant...barely over half and they choose to run that as their headline !  Since more people say Bush is wealthy versus Kerry I worry about where these people get their info.  Bush is worth about $15M and Kerry around a BILLION.  I would say that Kerry is the wealthy one.   The Associated Press has a new poll that lists seven adjectives and asks if they describe George W. Bush and John Kerry  "Decisive": Bush 67%, Kerry 45% (Bush by 22%) "Arrogant": Bush 52%, Kerry 44% (Bush by 8%) "Wealthy": Bush 90%, Kerry 85% (Bush by 5%) "Likeable": Bush 66%, Kerry 62% (Bush by 4%) "Honest": Bush 53%, Kerry 53% (even) "Compassionate": Bush 59%, Kerry 60% (Kerry by 1%) "Intelligent": Bush 63%, Kerry 83% (Kerry by 20%)   The poll also asked, "Who makes you feel more optimistic about America's future?" Fifty percent said Bush, 44% Kerry, 1% both and 4% neither.   So what headline did the AP put on its dispatch about the poll? "More Voters See Bush as Arrogant."   The wire service did change its headline on a later version of the story: "Bush Seen Decisive, Kerry Smart."
