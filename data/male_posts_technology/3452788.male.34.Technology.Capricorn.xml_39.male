Due to the draconian laws of the Soviet Republik of Kalifornia, I cannot get my  original  birth certificate, only my revised b.cert. with my adopted name.  My mother was 17, I think, when I was born.  She was the daughter of an Air Force family, I think, so it's possible she moved somewhat frequently.  I have a picture from the high school yearbook in 1969, and yes, there is a strong resemblance.  I even mailed everyone in the country I could find with the same last name (only 400 or so, not that common).  But it seems like I can't find her.    I have decided to make a stronger effort to find my mother and see what happens.  Believe me, I have been over the pros and cons many times mentally and with family.  I realize it may turn out badly for one or both of us, and she may not want to meet me.  I have gone through the possibilities, and I am prepared to deal with whatever happens.  Whether or not we develop a relationship, there are a few things I want this person to know.  I want to thank her for giving me a chance at life.  I had the opportunity to live and experience everything, good and bad, because she made a conscious decision to give me a chance.  No matter how messed up I am, not matter what happened to me between 3 days old and today, none of it is her fault.  I have no anger or ill will whatsoever toward her, just gratitude.  I hope she does not feel guilty, and I hope she has not been sad about me, although I know it is likely she has.  I cannot imagine how painful it must be to give up your own child to someone else.  I want her to know that after all this time, I can tell her she made a good choice with the cards she was dealt, and it worked out just fine.  BTW, in no way is this a political stance one way or another on abortion vs adoption.  Neither should be a political issue, and I think everyone should shut the hell up about it.  Men should have learned by now that it doesn't work to try to tell women what they can or cannot do, because women run the whole show.
