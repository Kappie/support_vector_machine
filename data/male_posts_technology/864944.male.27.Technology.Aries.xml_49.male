Saturday I took a bikeride along the Mystic River, which as it happens is right next to my house, and makes for some wonderful nature trails.  Its like finding a great little surprise in the land we just bought.  Chris and I are loving it.  Later on Saturday I went to Paul Drapeau's wedding.  It was a good time, and I have to say it was nice being at a wedding that I wasn't in.  Much more laid back.  I hope they are having a great honeymoon.    Sunday I ended up doing some work from home.  Boo.  But it wasnt too bad.  All in all, it was a pretty busy weekend.  And it was mighty nice.  Im looking forward to the rest of summer :)
