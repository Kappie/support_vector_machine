The other line from this song that I really like is: "She likes the Godsmack, and I like Agent Orange, Her CD changer's full of singers that are mad at their dad"  What an apt description of much of what passes for modern rock these days. Don't get me wrong -- I love aggressive music. It certainly has it's place. But the likes of Disturbed and System of a Down belong on the underground scene -- not on mainstream radio!! There is nothing that can turn a bar full of drunks ugly faster than spinning one of those songs at about 1:00am (and THIS I know from personal experience!)....
