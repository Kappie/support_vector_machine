So I had a dream about the future with you again last night.  It was nice.  In my dream we were living together (I'm just going to merge the two dreams together since they were the same).  We had our own place and we didn't have to live far from each other.  I don't exactly know what time of year it was but I know it was nice outside.  I also don't know where the heck we were.  Eh, that's alright.  So it was nice enough for us to be able to go outside and have a beer (well I know you would be drinking wine since you didn't like beer) but we were inside relaxing on the couch.  I was sitting up on the couch and you had your head on my lap and I was playing with your hair.  We were talking.  We were talking face to face like how we would be talking on the phone.  Relaxed and easy going.  We talked about going on vacation.   Either somewhere nice and warm with a beach or some winter place for skiing / snow boarding.  We talked about unberable Lightness of Being some more.  Hmm, I suppose after all this time that book is still a conversation peice in our lives (at least in the dreams).  We talked about different philosophies.  Since G.W. Bush was on TV talking about Iraq that somehow made it into my dreams as well so we were talking about that.  We each shared stories of early childhood and stories from family gatherings.  We talked about things we did together.  Yeah, it was really nice.  We lived in an apartment that had big windows, a balcony with a view and contemporary furniture.  The walls were white and so were the ceilings.  We had a his and her's laptop on a table.  It was a plain old table with a white top and white legs.  Our stuff was by our computers.  It was positioned that they were facing opposite directions.  Yeah.  Maybe we played some computer games against each other or together.  Yeah, geeky couple.  We also had this abstract sculpture thingy that was flowy and twisty and yeah.  It was black with a single ceiling spotight directly above it.  There was also art on the walls with spot lights for each peice.  Pictures as well.  You were wearing a white tank top and a black/ dark gray sweat pants and I was still in my work clothes.  I guess I work at a place where it is business attire for work.  I was wearing gray pants with a white shirt and no tie.  during the first night of the dream, it fast forwarded to the next day and I was at work.  You went to work or class, not really sure which on still.  and I decided to check your blog since I haven't done so for a while.  I read it and there it was, you were talking about me, you were talking about us.  It was nice.  The second part of the dream everything was occuring much slower and I was able to talk around (in my dream) and check out more of the place.  I didn't really go full out on the snooping.  Yeah...my dream for the past two nights.
