In large part I find this to be a valid criticism.  However this criticism is only really valid if you consider weblogs as some kind of news media.  Most of them are not intended to be that way (mine sure isn't), so of course they lack in that respect.  If you look at weblogs as a way of keeping in closer contact with people that you don't see very much, then they start to make a bit more sense.  I have not yet decided if this is stupid or not.  It surely isn't the revolution in information distribution that some self important bloggers would claim they are propagating.  Anyway, enough semi-topical, semi-intelligent conversation.  I have to get into the driveling trivialities soon or this won't be appropriate material.  My car is better!  Two weeks ago I was in a fairly minor accident.  Nobody was hurt.  The other vehicle, a GMC Sonoma, wasn't even damaged aside from a slight scrape on the front bumper.  My poor little car suffered 2000$ in damage.  I just got it back from the shop.  I'm not sure that it is shinier than it was when I got it new, but it is looking pretty good.  It is a relief not to have to drive the shop's loaner car anymore.  It was a Buick Regal.  A true monster of a car.  I hate large vehicles with a passion (there should be a special circle of hell for people who drive SUVs and do not need to).  Suffice it to say that I wasn't exactly the happiest person in the world driving the Buick around.
