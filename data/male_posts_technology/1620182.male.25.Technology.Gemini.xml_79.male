There are people who work here on Long Island during the week and return to their families in Minnesota on the weekends.  That's insanity.  It makes my semi-monthly trip to Virginia look like a trip to the grocery store.  Nonetheless, my trips to the Old Dominion can be quite taxing on mind, body and soul.  Actually, taxing is probably not the word.  The return trip is taxing.  The week of work between trips is taxing, but the trip down and the time I spend there is not taxing in any way.  In fact, it's refreshing.  Enlightening.  Moving.  Thrilling.  Whatever adjective you want to use (positive ones only, please).  
 
 Last week was hell, so a quick jaunt to VA was well appreciated on my part.  Saturday was spent watching the beautiful people at  urlLink Foxfield .  If you've never been, it's basically a really big  urlLink UVA  greek tailgate party set on the infield of a horse track.  Everyone get dressed up (guys in their ugliest pants and shirts with ties, girls in their sun dresses) come to the track and sit around in the sun, drinking heavily, getting their first really bad sunburn of the season.  It's tradition.  Consider yourself lucky if you glance the rear end of a horse as it sprints past you.
 
 Sunday was spent at the  urlLink March for Women's Lives  on the Mall in DC.  The march was originally planned as a Pro-Choice rally, but it quickly snowballed into a " urlLink Bush-must-be-removed-at-all-costs-to-improve-everyone's-lives-world-wide " rally with a women's theme.  Not a bad place to pick up a cute, intelligent, empowered woman if you have the guts.  I don't really have a strong opinion on the abortion issue as it doesn't really personally affect me, but I thought I'd go to experience my first rally.  It was worth it.  Some people project that there were over a million people there.  To say it was massive would be an understatement.  Definitely a good life experience.  I keep telling people that Bush is creating a world-wide political environment that could potentially be more explosive than it was in the 60's.  Just watch.
