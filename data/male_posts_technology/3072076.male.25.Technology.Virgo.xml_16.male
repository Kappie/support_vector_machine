This time though I had a taste of it at the office of the registrar where I had to pay a visit to get my marriage registered.   The deal  The deal was simple. One fine day, I went to this office to enquire about the things which need to be attached with the registration form and I was not amazed to find a person being too polite to me. He was even kind enough to come all the way down to the shop where I paid 30 bucks for the registration form.  Next week, while Kalpana and I were leaving to get this job done I asked her to carry an extra bit of cash as we might find it handy. Needless to say, she was already ready with it in the anticipation of what was coming our way.  On reaching that place, I was asked to see this *Madam* on the first floor who would be helping  me out with the next level of proceedings. She was also very kind and at that time I had a  feeling that this endeavor is going to cost me a fortune.   Not to my surprise, the *Madam* asked the same old chap, who I found the other day, to  accompany me towards the ground floor where I was supposed to pay the *official* sum of  15/- bucks. While I was coming back, he asked Kalpana to take a seat, thinking the 'poor girl' need not know what's going to happen next. Well, I must say that was a  blessing in disguise for her. She was already tired pushing one corner to another with  me and I could see that she was more than happy to take the seat.   Climax  While in the middle of the staircase, the chap told me. "Look sir, when do you want  to get this done. I understand this is Urgent, Right!", putting a little more emphasis on the 'Right'. I knew what was coming and I did not want to get into any verbal disputation, so I placed the 150 bucks I had in my hand quietly into his. Needless to say, I was a way too nervous as this was the first time I was doing anything like this. I assumed the story would have an happy ending here but something he said drove me out of the imagination-loop. "Kitna Hain (How much is it)?". "150", I shot back. "Well, Madam  ko bhi dena hain .. who manegi nahi (you need to give some to Madam otherwise she  won't agree). No need to mention as to what I did next.  So there I was, in front of *Madam*, with the registration form and other stuff in my hand and the money tucked under them all. I was so nervous that I just did not know what to do.  *Madam* stared at me for sometime and then started to look into the case of another couple. Then she asked another person to look into my matter which indirectly meant that I had to give the money to the new guy. What a network!  Nervous I was, I did not move, did not even say anything. The new guy waited for sometime and I feel he understood that I was new in this trade. He told me in front of  everyone, "You have to give a fee, Sir". There you go! I handed him the cash in front of all told him that I wanted to take the certificate by evening and bingo! my job was done.   After thought  If you look at it now, there are approximately 5 people coming every hour for getting  the registration done. So assuming that Madam works for her full quota of 6 hours, she can expect 5 * 6 * 200 = 6000 bucks everyday. Lets assume she donates 50% of that to the other shit heads, she still earns a healthy sum of ~90,000 untaxable income per month.   What does the Govt Loose?  The rule is that with every marriage registration an NSC for 2000 bucks from a post office needs to be purchased by the couple. So, going by the same logic, 30 registrations per day would have given the Govt a revenue of 2000 * 30 registration  = 18 Lakhs per month. As this is just a small office, 200 to 300 bucks per registration is peanuts. I fail to imagine the stakes involved in the big *Page 1* scams!  Well, I never wanted to get involved into all this and by paying a 'fee' I count myself as a criminal too but then do you think with a system where corruption creeps in from the lowest level of authority, I would have wanted to wait for the next 'n' number of years just to prove to the authorities, which happen to be the same kind of people, that I  have married Kalpana Palaniswamy!!  I feel that's a waste.  Anyhow, God bless *Madam*!!
