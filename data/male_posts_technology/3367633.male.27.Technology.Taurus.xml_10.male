I don't know what was going on but it would just blank screen right after the post.  I think I am going to give up on dating for right now until I either pay off my debts or until I move. I just want to be able to focus on the guy when I do. I picked up a Cisco network cert book yesterday. I think I will study for that for the next few weeks and see if I can get my certification before the job in Huntington opens up.   I worked a little on a desk that I got over the weekend. Its a really nice desk that just needs to be sanded down and re stained. I picked up the stain but I think I will need some more sand paper, LOL its a big desk.   How do I feel today? Good question. I am not too sure. Some times I feel like crying some times I feel like running away, but through all of that I know I cant and I wont. Some times I feel like taking off of work and hitting a bar or crawling back into bed. I wonder if they will notice if I crawl under my desk and take a nap. I guess above it all I feel the twinge of wanderlust hitting me. Its sort of like that tom petty song "last dance with Mary Jane". I think I am plagued with the curse that most Americans have of indecision and impulse. I cant make up my mind until face with a shiny new object.
