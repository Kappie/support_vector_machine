The urlLink State Department's  web site provided some good information about what to do. I didn't know that you can get the pictures taken right there at some post offices. The main post office is right around the corner from me so that was pretty easy.    I woke up really early and I'm having a REALLY productive day so far. I also got some of my clothes in to be altered. I've been avoiding that for some reason. Just been lazy I guess. That costsome money, too considering how much I trimmed down mywaist since I lost weight and have been working out.    The truth is I went to the doctor yesterday to get tested for STDs since it's been a while.. no symptoms or anything, it's just that Jon Capar mentioned this article about them that freaked me out so I wanted to know.    Excerpt from  urlLink Men's Fitness article :    "Perhaps most shocking of all, in the era of safer sex, is how herpes infections have increased by more than 30% since the '70s. At the same time, a startling one in three college-age women are infected with the human papilloma virus (HPV), while the National Institutes of Health estimates that 60 million Americans have genital herpes, and another 500,000 people will become infected each year (80% of those aren't even aware of it). And then there's chlamydia, the most widespread of all STDs in the U.S. Chlamydia rates have soared by 37% in the past five years...But perhaps the most significant factor is that many of the infected have no symptoms, so they're passing infections on and don't even know it. "    Well, I'm all clean (or I probably wouldn't be posting this to the world, hehe), but we also talked about me justfeeling lazy / less motivatedlately and he thinks I might be depressed. Not like a sad all the time depressed, but more like a ehhh depressed. I mean, I get shit done... just not as much as I usually want to... my drive has been off. I thought about it for a bit and I have some ideas about why so I just started attacking them and I'm feeling great today! For one, I have just been avoiding paying bills andhave not beenfinancially responsible lately. I think it's been wearing me down on a sub-conscious level. Things need to be cleaned up in the areas I've been avoiding in my life. I know what I need to do to make tons of money... I'm just not doing it.    I'm considering the possibility that I like to live on the edge or... something like that. I have something really huge to tackle here, and I'm intent on it.
