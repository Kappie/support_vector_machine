This was an accomplishment in that it was the longest outdoor run I have completed.  Glasses didn't matter so much as good ankles did.  Is anyone else really anxious for this garbage on the sidewalks to melt?!  After sliding across the sheets of ice, I fought my way through the Rocky Mountain models (as Consuelo so affectionately calls them).  All in all the run was great.  My legs felt tremendous considering the length of the run.  I did feel (and still do feel) some aching in my shins and calves.  Throughout the run, I felt some tension in my knee, but nothing that caused me to have to stop.  I ended up running all the way to Hyde Park Square and back, mostly along Madison.  I've never clocked it in my car, but with all the side streets the run included I would guess the run was just over 6 miles.
