I studied Tamil as my second language until my 10th grade. It is those Tamil classes in Montfort that have brought about my special bond with TamilNadu(i'm a mallu by the way). I associate myself toChennaipattinam more than I do to mallu land.    Tamil classes were always fun. Mr.Guruswamy aka Guru was a hilarious man. He would talk about the most outrageous topics in class much to our amusement. He would talk about anything from dirty women to dumb%$#% phoreners. I loved his class in every single way except for those times when i would not have completed my hand-writing homework.The look onmy face would seem like I had seen a ghost. And for some reason I always thought hedidn't likeme. Nevertheless, I enjoyed his classes..    It was around the end of September when we were back in school after the Quarterly vacation. The first few days are anxious days because that is when you get back your test papers. I was enjoyingmy fun-filled Tamil class as usual until I heard an angry voice call out my name. I rushed to GURU's desk. He looked terribly disturbed and furious. I was this skinny little thing back in school. Back in my 10th grade I stood at 5'3and weighed around90 lbs. You can imagine.    Anyway, I was already terrified by the look on GURU's face. A million thoughts ran in my mind. Did he get to know about that I have been making a fool of him and slacking with my hand-writing homework. Or did he hear all the !@^*#^* teenage comments that we had to pass on everything that even remotely looked feminine. Forgive us but then what else do you expect when you are in an ALL BOYS school.Our only source of JOY comes from Debonair, Fantasy, Filmfares,etc. Glory be to God!!! I can feel the pain of all the poor souls who are deprived of the of the god-given gift known as woman. May GOD show some mercy to these poor souls.    Well, there I was standing in front of GURU. His very look would have burnt me alive. Yes, he was fuming with anger. There was this sudden silence in class. Out of nowhere he yelled, "NAAN UNNAKU ENNADA PANNINEN" (what did I ever do to you???)..... "NAAN SAAGURADHALA UNNAKKU ENNADA LAABAM" (what do you gain from me dying???"). All this made nosense to me. There I was standing with absolutely no clue as to what was going around me. To make matters worse, he got offended because I did not react to any of it. The truth my friends was that I had not the slightest of clues as to what was going on but he mistook it for arrogance. Then he showed me what In had written for one of my answers in the exam. All of a sudden, it all made sense to me. React I did, but then ended up cracking up. However, realizing that the situation demanded me to act like I was sorry, I did. So then i had to defend and I remember pleading "Sathiyama illa saar"(I swear I did not mean that) .. and the it went on..."Ennada Sathiyamma....evlo dhil unakku" (what guts do you have to write something like this....").    This was what I had written on my answer sheet..."Raman, than guru irandhadhaal, ekkathudan pallikku sendran". To be honest I was even proud that I had written a good sentence in Tamil. WhatI meant was that "Since Raman's teacher(guru) had passed away, He went to school with a heavy heart" . People of the world, please tell me what wrong did I do here. But my GURU thought this guru in the sentence was him. Hmmm... needless to say, he threatened to take me to the principal and what not. I was not only the laughing stock of the class but also dreaded Tamil classes for the years to come. But he still remains one of my favourite teachers.
