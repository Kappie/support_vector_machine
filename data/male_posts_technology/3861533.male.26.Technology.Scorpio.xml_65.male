A brief description would be "A thirty-two year old male teacher falls in love with his seventeen year-old highschool student", but that gives of the wrong impression. This is a movie about two troubled individuals finding something in one another. The movie is very gloomy and there are very few upbeat moments. There is very little information about this movie on IMDB but I managed to find  urlLink a review that describes the movie very well. . While I don't agree with all of the conclusions of the review, I do agree with the gist of it.  -->
