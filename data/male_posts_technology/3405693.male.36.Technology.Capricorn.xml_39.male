I'm not sure why but I felt an unusual sense of anxiety this evening, to the point where at one point I noticed my heart was beating like 130-140 bpm...pretty high for a nice leisurely walk.    It was the usual crowd of skaters and urchins on granville, all the non conformists non-conforming together in the same way.  There were a few people begging, nothing unusual there.  It was grey and cool, comfortable temperature, and the reddish concrete of granville mall felt like drying blood.  As I crossed Smythe street into the cold concrete of the driving part of Granville, the urchins and skate punks turned into grumpy looking guys of unknown racial descent wearing headbands and facial hair, a permanent scowl etched into their frustrated looking faces.  I passed Tom Lee music and the guitars in the window called to me to go in and look, play.  But I ignored them and moved on.    At Nelson I turned North and headed up the hill.  I saw one rather incongruous gang banger wannabe who kind of made me chuckle.  He had the regular scowl, ultra short hair, some attempt at a goatee and the head band.  He appeared to be native or south american.  He was a little chunky, but not fat...just...soft in the middle.  The thing that was unusual is he was wearing a very effeminate pink sweater preppy style over his shoulders and tied in front by the sleeves.  I wanted to say something to him, but he had that angry look to him that I see more and more these days.  So I smiled inwardly and walked on.  I passed a couple of quebecois squeegee kids, laughing about some person who cursed them out for not taking no for an answer.  I thought about it a bit, and this is part of the problem today...people just don't want to accept responsibility for their actions.  It was all the fault of the person in the car that they got mad, of course not theirs.  They were just trying to make a buck.  I wanted to tell them it's pretty hard to make a sale when you intimidate the customer, and most people aren't necessarily going to buy anyways.  I also wanted to tell them that if life is soooo difficult for them here, they should get back on the greyhound and get their separatist asses back to Quebec.  But then I realized that the first would just insult them and the second would insult them and be an incredibly racist thing to say.  At this point I thought about the difference between Tourettes sufferers and the rest of us: we all have thoughts that are harsh or even downright mean, and mainly out of character, but the Tourettes person doesn't have the ability to stop those thoughts at the mind.  They travel down the various ganglia and medullas and shit until they end up at the mouth and come out, usually causing embarassment, anger, or sadness.    I digress...back to my walk.  I crossed Burrard street and a car ran the light, almost hitting a couple of pedestrians (me being one of them).  The classic styled stone walls of the two big old churches stood majestically, ignoring all the noise and bottled up frustration around it.  Behind me, now, the cool blue super tower of the Wall Center(tallest building in the city right now)looked on somewhat arrogantly; expressing it's superiority (hence it's inferiority) like a small guy with a BMW.  The guy who ran the light got honked at by the people in cars who he ended up blocking, being stuck in the intersection.  More than one Trudeau Salute was offered to him, and I was strongly thinking about offering my allegiance as well.  Up to Thurlow, everyone I passed looked pissed off or sad...I hope I didn't as well.  I entered Nelson Park just as some girl was complaining to her boyfriend about all the junkies and hookers hanging out in that park these days.  I agreed with her completely and wanted to say something, perhaps form some kind of vigilante allegiance with them to rid our neighbourhood of these scum.  But, that doesn't solve the problem it just moves it.  And besides...it's a fantasy I have, not a reality that could ever happen.  Throughout the park, the aforementioned junkies were sprawled out in various poses of undeniable uselessness, just waiting for someone to come and end their miserable lives or change it in some way.  Of course, they will never do that for themselves, and societal thinking (mine included) doesn't help their case at all.  I had a brief fantasy of going up to one and coercing him to reveal who his pusher was, then finding the pusher and kicking the living shit out of him telling him to never return to this neighbourhood on pain of death...but in reality I'm a coward and a wimp so that would never happen.  It saddens me a lot to see Nelson park so full of such dirty garbage; it truly is a beautiful piece of green in the downtown core, the bike path crunching under your feet as you walk thru it, the dogs playing at certain times of day (it's an off-leash park).  It would be nice to see our fair city fathers do something to clean up this particular bastion of west end life, but it's going to take something serious to happen before they do that.  I got to Bute St and still, no one was smiling.  By now everyone I saw was either intimidating me or angering me; I was in no state to be in public, and it was making me feel pretty crappy; mad at myself for having such dark emotions.  I got home and felt like shit; I called Sylvie to tell her I wasn't going to go to walk her home from work, but she didn't answer.  I went out on the balcony to have a smoke (my heart rate seemed normal again), and promptly fell into a bizarre sneezing fit; I must have sneezed 8 or 9 times.  After that was done, I felt fantastic, so I decided to go walk Sylvie home after all.    All in all it was a wierd walk home from my work today; it started to hurl me down the steps of depression, but I sneezed my way out of it.  Go figure.
