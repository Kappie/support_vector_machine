Psalm 56:8,10 "You have seen me tossing and turning through the night. You have collected all my tears and preserved them in your bottle! You have recorded every one in your book. I am trusting God - oh, praise his promises!"  Satan knows how important and special you are to God. He has always tried to kill the youth. Remember after Jesus was born how he tried to kill all the boys two years and younger through King Herod? He is still at it today, through abortion, drugs, suicide, abuse, eating disorders and alcohol just to name a few. One of his great lies is to make you think that you are the only one going through the problems and no one would understand or he tries to make you think that people would think that you are a bad person. Never think for one minute that whatever it is that you are going through that people do not care or that there is no hope for you. Psalm 9:9,10 says "All who are oppressed may come to Him. He is a refuge for them in their times of trouble. All those who know your mercy, Lord, will count on you for help. For you have never yet forsaken those who trust in you."  I hope everyone is listening to this because ... It's darn important to realize!!! If you are struggling with these kinds of problems PLEASE e-mail me or go to a christian counselor such as your pastor.  There is an excellent resource for Teens that are hurting at  urlLink Teen Hope Line .  I encourage you to visit if you are having problems (any kind).
