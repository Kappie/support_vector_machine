But I can't devote the time right now, and so I'll have to try later. Here's some stuff that you can read if you want to know about his life:   - urlLink Pitchforkmedia News.  Pitchforkmedia is a great site, because it has a great news staff for music, and you can tell that these folks have listened to a lot of music. It's one of the sites I check often. - urlLink Really good KCRW show.  This is a great tribute show from one of the most prominent REAL music radio stations, and you can listen to some of his music. - urlLink MTV Article.  Oddly enough, it's a good article. It wasn't what I expected from the corporate juggernaut, MTV.
