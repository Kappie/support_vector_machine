Maybe that's a good thing, but I felt like I was letting at least myself down as a result.  Anyway, I played 2 Sit N Goes on PokerStars.  One was a normal $5 SnG and the other was what they call a Turbo SnG with the blinds escalating at a much faster pace, every 5 minutes.  That one cost me $6.  I bombed out of the first and ended up 4th in the turbo for a total loss of roughly $3 for the day.  I will post accurate numbers this evening which will reflect where I am towards my goals.  In addition to those I played a freeroll on PS for an entry into a tourney on Sunday with a guaranteed $300K prize pool.  This cost me 500 frequent player points and there were 206 entries which meant that they would be giving 4 entries into the big tourney.  I ended up in 15th place, but was really never a factor after the first hour as I was simply playing catch up the rest of the time.  When it was all over I had looked at 18 flops in 187 hands and had won 15 of them.  The cards simply weren't there.  Then at the end I had KK cracked by a flush.  Oh well, it was interesting and a nice change of pace.  I really just wasn't very interested in working my game yesterday.  I probably would have been better off reading a little bit and giving myself a break, but sometimes find myself feeling obligated to at least giving it a shot.  In the long run this attitude would get me in a lot of trouble, I'm sure, but I generally only sit down if I'm focused on building my bankroll and playing good cards.  It was another good lesson and fortunately not an expensive one as most are.  I will just need to keep this in mind the next time I sit down to play when I don't really feel like it and pull myself away and find other ways to occupy my time that can help me on my quest.  That's enough rambling for now.  Until next time.....
