This time it was Clare. I was about to describe my experience of ramping solid state detectors and why you had to do so when she cut me off mid-sentence, telling that what I was about to say wasn't important.  That left me fuming; so much so that I had to get out of the building to blow off some steam.  I guess what infuriated me was the way in which she was perfectly able to discount my experience as being totally irrelevant to the question in hand.  And what was that question about?  Ramping the power to our detector.
