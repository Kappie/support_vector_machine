My house has no garage, so we have to park our cars on the street in front of our house.  This is a very intricate arrangement because we, according to the damn flyer that the mailman keeps putting underneath our windshield, must allow enough room for the mailman to pull in and pull out without having to back up or do any real "driving".  We have two cars that we have to park in front of our house and if we want to get mail as opposed to a windshield flyer we cannot be in the way.  Also, we have to try to allow for enough room for our neighbors to get their mail delivered - meaning we can't be close to their mailbox - so we have to park between two mailboxes and allow enough room for essentially a semi truck on either end.  When it is all said and done, we have about 25 feet to park 2 cars.  This was very aggravating when we first moved into our house for a few reasons: 1)  We were never told about this rule so we found out by flyer and out neighbors didn't get their mail because of us. 2) 2 houses down there is a mailbox on the porch of the house and the mailman gets out and delivers the mail to the porch.  WHAT THE HELL??  You can't back up your crappy ass van, but you can get out and walk 50 feet?  I swear to god I want to drive off with his mail truck next time I see him do that.  Not really, but I feel like taking a joy ride when I see that - mail flying out the back of the van.  One time after he left us a flyer he looked down the street at me and smiled while he was doing his special delivery.   I asked him about it a few days later and he gave me some B.S. line about that house being grandfathered in.  The reason this is all on my mind is because today was garbage day (and all of the garbage cans have to be 4 feet apart in order to be picked up - another thing that pisses me off but I'll talk about that later), meaning that our normal 25 feet is about 15.  You can't park 2 cars in 15 feet, so my act of defiance is to put them right in front of the mailboxes so the mailman has to get out and deliver OUR mail for a change.  What's he going to do, tell me I have to put my garbage somewhere else?  Take it up with the city, punk, I'm entitled to my utilities so why don't you eat my... never mind.  So today he delivered our mail and then apparently intentionally backed into our garbage cans (according to my wife).  I have to think of something else to do to make his life harder.  This will become a silent war and most likely the defining event in my life.  Does anyone have any suggestions to make his life harder?  One thing that I am going to do to make my life easier and hopefully his a little harder is to move the mailboxes to the very corner of the lot so that in order to deliver the mail he would have to stop and be in perfect T-Bone position with the alleyway to the west of my house.   Hopefully this will add stress to his life - thereby reducing his health significantly to the point where he has a stroke and retires.  I'm in this for the long haul.
