I have always been quick to call people I like my friends, probably because I don't have many to begin with. But events that happened the past year made me really question the meaning of friendship.  And right now I have to admit I probably have like only 5 people I would consider real friends right now. Ok ok 3 if I dun count my 2 dogs.  But I am not on good terms with one of my dogs now , damm asshole peed in my room so I am giving him the silent treatment until he apologizes.     My Lack of Social Skills    Yup ok I known for a while I was socially inept but only in the past year did I realise that my social skills were only slightly better than a horny spastic monkey.  But man this was a really hard lesson for me to learn. ...sniff    Career Goals    I was always sure about what I wanted to work as when I graduated, but now I have no freaking idea.  And it's kinda scary cos I'm already 25.     Women    K I think I need to stop thinking about women who are way way out of my league.  So goodbye Uma Thurman, and hello kopi tiam auntie! Yes she's really not that bad looking, and there's this undeniable sexual tension everytime she hands me my kopi-o in the morning. Think it's time for me to explore that.   Ok so all in all I would give this year a 4 out of 10. It was mostly bad, but there were some good things that came out of it. Met a few really wonderful people that I am really glad to have the pleasure of knowing....err what else.....well i think my dick grew like a cm longer thanks to all that time at home watching porn. Oh and of cos the ability to spend relatively carefreely was also quite nice to have.   Goals for next year   1. Get laid. 2. Lose weight. 3. Get laid after losing weight. 4. Expand my social circle.   5. Watch less porn.
