Karma is growing too fast... she's almost 3 times the size she was when we first picked her up from the shelter.  She's still a helleion  in the morning (hasn't outgrown THAT hat quite yet) and has a thing for waking up everyone at about 7ish... We love her though.. its impossible to open your eyes and look at her and be angry when she is *just* chasing her tail on your bed.. i mean.. she obviously just wants to be close to her daddy. right? :) awwwww...   She is starting to do Cat things though too.. loves to sit in the Window and look down at the city below.  I wonder what she thinks about.  I think it's time to move on...  I got to play with Reason while some friends were visiting in London.  Shisha Fiend, NOT just the best DJ I've ever met... he is, with out a doubt, the best DJ I've ever heard - spent some time with me going over the Program (For those that dont know Reason check it out).  In minutes he produced a catchy beat, a cool synth loop and a very excited Jer.  I've not been as sucessful but AM learning the basics and might even have something for you to listen to in the next blog post!    urlLink www.Dyngnosis.com  I've talked about my site before.. it's in the works again.  I've totally removed what I had before and implemented DotNetNuke 1.2.1 with YAF as the forums module...  I've still got a few editors rdy to pump out articles, moderators to run the forums (most of them) and a Book Review deal with  urlLink www.Security-Focus.com  that should bring some traffic to the bookstore.   urlLink www.Anti-Online.com  Tutorial authors quickly joining the Dyngnosis.com ranks to develop the Tutorials section which is very, very cool. Im open for suggestions and ideas for the site so leave a comment!    urlLink www.gmail.com  - OHHH have I want an address at gmail.com - if any of my readers have a spare invite puh-lease send one my way. I've been so close to getting an account so many times... did you hear?  Some whackjobs are selling invites on EBAY?? HA! Wait.. thats not going to get me an invite is it?   ...they've been selling for a bout a dollar... come on.     VRRRrrroommmmmmm......    ...is NOT the sound my car is making these days.. more like *PUT*PUT*PUT*STALL* but hey.. it's just got to last me the summer :D By then I'm either high-tailin` it out of Canada...pfft.. North America. and heading East.. South East. OR I've got a spiffy new salery and I'm driving my a)dream MX3 or b)a mazda3.  Or I've somehow met the love of my life and i've gotten domesticated ;) HA!   That pretty much sums up whats going on in my life (minus the private secret details that only YOU know...shhhh)
