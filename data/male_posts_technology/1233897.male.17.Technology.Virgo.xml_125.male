Gwen’s on a several-week long mission trip up to a Native American reservation up in a southern province of Canada with her church. She left around 6:00 am, Friday morning, and is getting back mid-July. I was hoping to spend a while talking to her on Thursday night, but it didn’t work too well: My dad had previously decided that if my room wasn’t clean in the morning, I would have to forfeit phone usage that evening. That was... kinda fine with me, but that’s beside the point. I had told him the night before, that even if my room wasn’t clean, I still wanted to use the phone because it would be the last time I’d be able to talk to Gwen in three weeks. He agreed, but I eventually did get time to clean my room anyway. The next morning, he said it looked “clean, but it could use a little more work later.” Then, that evening, about ten minutes after Gwen called me, he yelled down at me from the landing above our office to get off the phone and that he had told me not to be on it. I tried to call up to him that that wasn’t what he had communicated to me several times beforehand, but he wouldn’t listen… He kept telling me simply to get off and not use it again the entire night, and when I would ask him why he would just reply by yelling louder at me. I started yelling back at him and this went on and on for a while, until he just turned around and slammed the door behind him as he stomped into his room. I realize now that I prolly shouldn’t have been yelling back at him, especially with Gwen on the phone still, and I need to apologize to her when I talk to her again. Anyway, she and I resumed talking again, but less than ten minutes later, he picked up his phone and demanded why I was still on: launching into this entire campaign about how rebellious I was being and that we had agreed that this was a punishment for not keeping my room clean (something we have, in fact not done) and just generally going on and on about how bad I was. Finally I convinced him that I was going to get off and he hung up. Not more than two seconds later though, he picked up the phone again and started yelling at me again that I wasn’t off yet and that he needed to use the phone. After a little while, he got off again and Gwen and I said a rather awkward goodbye, and that was it. Well, that’s my dad for yah.  2. I went JETSKIING all day Saturday with my uncle. :) :)  I got up around 8:00 to be ready to go by 9:30, but my mom randomly came up with an hour-an’-a-half worth or work to do before I could go (vacuuming the entire house and such), so we actually got going around 11. We walked around downtown and went back to his house where we listened to some Red Hot Chili Peppers on his 15 grand high end stereo system (fricken’ purest tone I’ve ever heard from a recording). Later, we met up with his girlfriend’s family on the Columbia River and enjoyed a LONG afternoon from 1 till past 9 of jetskiing and wonderful Russian fish and stuff. (her family’s all Russian). After sundown, the river (more than a mile wide) was sooo calm. We could push 50mph for an easy 2 mile stretch without getting bumped around too much.   3. I went to Cameran’s house after church with Steven and Brady today (well, now actually yesterday). We mostly juss hung out, swam, played Halo and jumped on his trampoline. ‘Twas quite fun. Toward 8 or so, we walked (me and Steven barefoot) over to my best friend, Goody’s house and sat around outside for like twenty minutes and walked back. Later, my mom and my aunt picked me and Steven up and took us to home after Taco Bell. We were talking about this one abuse support group that Steven and I are thinking about joining, and I’m finding myself more interested in it day by day. Whatever… we’ll see what comes of it… Oh yeah, and there was some huge issue that went on at home today again, that basically necessitated my mom leaving and hiding out somewhere from right after church (like 1-ish) till when we finally got back home (like 11:00). Man, I wish more than anything that my family problems would just disappear and that we’d be a normal healthy family, but I don’t ever even see that as a possibility until way way after I’ve moved out. It saddens me.  Goodnight all, and sleep well. (especially Gwen)
