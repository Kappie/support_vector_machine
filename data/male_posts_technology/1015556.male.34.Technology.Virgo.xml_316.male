Principle-Relevance to the culture is not optional *-Shengs will engage culture via active watching of movies *-we will have a line item in family budget for culture (movies, entertain, music, etc.) *-SPACEcrew meetings might evolve from just launch planning to including ideas and concepts about being active in mission (this is hard to articulate)  Principle-every NT church had heresy and immorality because they had prebelievers involved in community *-we will articulate that friends of students have an open invitation to every Launch   Principle-Mission is why the church exists *-how many students can we get involved in Launches and Mission trips? can we shoot for 50% within 3 years of starting SPACe?  Principle-Faith and safety are closer tied today than faith and risk. If you have faith, you will be successful -> false principle.  *-what things are we attempting that can only fail unless God accomplishes (God accomplishes relationships, tasks, thoughts - SPACE involves relationships of people, getting tasks done, acting upon thoughts) *-can we attempt things that can only fail unless God accomplishes them?  Principle-We need to live lives that are active in listening for God's voice and call. *-are we spending time in God's word and listening for His audible voice? Not only the leaders, but the people/students we lead. Does the worldview we teach to students include this aspect of spiritual growth?  I'm not sure I'm totally done with this, but I think its a good start...
