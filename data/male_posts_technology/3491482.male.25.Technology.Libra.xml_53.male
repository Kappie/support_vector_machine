Let's see, the basis for damage in this suit is that Coors aired commercials that are "glorifying a culture of youth, sex and glamour while hiding the dangers of alcohol abuse and addiction".  And somehow, her son, being the brainless puppet he was, translated that implicit message into a command to become incoherently drunk, drive somebody else's car without a license, and slam that car into a light pole at 90 mph.  Hmmm.  Yep, that's a perfect personification of the culture that Coors was trying to associate its products with, so I'm sure they're as culpable as heck in this matter.  She'll make out like a bandit.  And since the courts will prove that Coors was the cause of her son's death, she won't have to suffer any pangs of conscience over what she might have done differently to raise a more thoughtful and responsible son.
