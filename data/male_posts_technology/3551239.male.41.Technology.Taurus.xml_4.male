She has been so good to me and we've been working around the house together which has been such a relief. Just being around her can change one's demeanor. Now if only I could get my mind back to Phoenix as well.  TOBI is an amazing discovery. The boys told me how great he had become but I think that even they still have no idea of his depth. Jude shared some thoughts with me over the phone yesterday about how it seems that TOBI is just as anxious to be ready for launch as we are. It's so strange to be talking about "him" like he's a person, but when people put as much into a project as the boys have, it's difficult not to see parts of them in it. I hope everything goes smoothly with launch and that Jude can make a trip out to Phoenix to visit with Virginia and I...I know she misses him dearly.
