Yay! Then it's off to Rochester for the weekend.  Work has been going really well in the last week since I've resumed work on parts that actually make it look like I'm making headway instead of munging around on well-concealed internals. Today was pay day as well. It sucks to see 30% of my bi-weekly paycheck going to "deductions" ranging from taxes to 401(k) contributions. *sigh*  Anyway, good night world! I'll try to put something else up this weekend or shortly thereafter.  I'm going to continue to try to end my posts with something to think about. I read about a study today about sex education versus non-education with advocacy of abstinance. The study showed that among sexually active teens, both groups had the same percentage of STIs,  however,  those who never received sex education were significantly more likely to not know they carried an STI. This got me thinking again about why we as a society shun sex, while we revel in violence. Any given movie can have dozens of people shot to death in it and only garner a PG-13 rating, but reveal a breast, especially two and you're slapped with the second worst of all ratings: R. I guess it's little surprise to me that a society that deems the human body and sex to be more dangerous to its youths than murder, finds itself swimming in violent crime.  (This is *not* to say that I advocate censorship of violence from the media...I like to consider myself to be against censorship in all of its forms. Rather, I advocate re-analysis of the true danger that these topics present to the youths who are permitted to see them.)  ------------------------------------- Peace cannot be kept by force.
