That probably does not include plastic surgery, elegant clothes etc. We spend a great deal on trying to make ourselves more attractive. That is of benefit to ourselves and, of course, to others.   How much do we spend on having a beautiful mind? If you are physically attractive but have a boring mind, that is a great waste. If you are not exceptionally attractive in a physical sense you can always develop a beautiful mind - if you want to. As you grow older your physical aspects may not improve but your mind can always get more beautiful.   The latest book of "Edward De Bono" addresses this issue. It is published this week in the UK and is called "HOW TO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL MIND".   It is available from bookstores in the UK or through the Internet via  urlLink www.amazon.co.uk  or  urlLink www.bookstore.co.uk .  Check this out and let me know how do you find the book.
