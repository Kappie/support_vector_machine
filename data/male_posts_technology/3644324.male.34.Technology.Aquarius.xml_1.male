I thought with pleasure about all we'd done today and the other four times I'd been here.    "Well, Kevin, thanks a lot. I feel so much better now.", I said as I got up to leave.    "No problem Glenn. I guess I'll see you...." Kevin paused expectantly.   "I'm sure it won't be very long before I'll need you again." I said with a chuckle.    "Remember what I said about tomorrow night!" were the last words I heard as I walked out the door.    And exactly what were those words?    I should go to the Ultimate field tonight, put on my cleats, warm up with the team, and then when they go out to play, I should practice running and stopping, running backwards, jumping, and moving side to side to get my calf used to doing all the things I'd be doing in a game situation. Kevin really is a good physiotherapist, I highly recommend him and all the folks at the Metrotown Orthopedic Sport Physiotherapy Clinic. So, I probably won't be playing too much tonight. I may jump on for a point or two if things feel really good.    So since this is almost certainly the last week I won't be participating full-time, I suggest that we go out there tonight and unleash a devastating torrent of Ultimate whoop-ass on the team that is scheduled to beat us tonight. I say we show them the Swarm like they've never imagined. I want them to have nightmare's where all they see is Pete catching hucks in the endzone with the soundtrack of us shrieking "Cindy to Cindy to Cindy to Verlane to Cindy to Paul to Cindy to Lindsay to Lisa to Cindy to Pete" as we march down the field. I want them to remember the smell of their Loserdom, or maybe their Loserhood, or possibly Loseritude.    Okay, I really just want to know where we're going afterwords, that other stuff was just me talking big for no reason.    See you tonight.    Scorned Peon
