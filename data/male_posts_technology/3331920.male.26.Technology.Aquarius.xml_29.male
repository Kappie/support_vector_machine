Tim showed me this kickass little par 3 golf course that has an awesome driving range and practice green.  100 drives later i'm a little sore, but i drained some 25-30 foot putts on the practice green, so i'm pretty pleased.  Went for a walk today as well with Angel, we're finally getting some sun, so it's a good deal to get out an soak some up. Angel's doing tons of work to the apartment, putting out some of our wedding gifts and the place is really looking up.  I'm out.
