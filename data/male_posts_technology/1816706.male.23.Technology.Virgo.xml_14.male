After that, me and Thomas attempted to do what sounded like this awesome secret tunnels hike.  You hike about 2 miles to these old abandoned tunnels, then through the tunnels to some waterfalls and stuff.  Well, we were planning on doing the Na Pali coast hike tomorrow, so we didn’t want to screw up our only pair of shoes, and they don’t sell hiking boots on the island, so we talked to a local and they said that it wouldn’t be a big deal to go in sandals, or barefoot.  Well it took a bit of maneuvering just to get to the hike, we had to go on some dirt roads and do go off roading a bit, but we made it.  About 1 minute into the hike we were covered in mud and losing our sandles.  We decided to go without the sandles.  We hiked for two hours, some of the time, up to our knees in mud (check out the pictures).  We eventually saw some people who said we had a ways left to go and at that point we realized if we finished the hike, we weren’t going to make it back before sunset.  So reluctantly, we took a little dip in a river near by, then trekked our asses back through the nasty mud and thorns and rock back to the car, having not seen the tunnels, having not finished the hike.  We were quite thankful that neither of us hurt our feet worse than we did.  Lots of nice cuts on them and all over our arms, but nothing broken, and nothing serious.  I don’t recommend this hike to anyone.  I love hikes.  I love the challenge, and the reward, and the toughness of them.  The only reason I will do this one again is to say I did it, to see the tunnels, and to show it who’s boss.  If you ever do this hike, wear good hiking boots and be prepared for the muddiest hike of your life.  We did get to check out Opeka’a Falls on the way to the hike which had some good views of the Wailua River also though.
