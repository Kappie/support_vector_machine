Anyway, wanted to share some more info on stuff that has been happening during the day. Went to Collector World at the Señorial Plaza Mall during my lunch hour. I had bought from them two DVD-Rs of shows that I haven't seen since I was a child. The purchase was made last week. I returned cause both DVDs were defective. Didn't run right.   I am a big DVD fan and have like five o six DVD players and DVD-Roms. I tested each DVD in every DVD player I could get my hands on. The DVDs only played correctly in one of the players.   The people at Collector World were very surprised when they told me to test the DVDs in another player and I gave them the names of all the players I had tested the DVDs in.  They kindly agreed to get me replacement copies, which I picked up today but haven't tested yet. Now, I'll let you in on something. I recopied both DVDs into new DVD-Rs and the things worked okay, even taught one of the films had a very noticeable error after the credits. The real problem I believe was that maybe the actual DVD-R used to make these was of an inferior quality. I will have to see how good these replacement DVDs turned out. I examined the data side and the texture color seems different from the others. They could be from another brand of blank DVDs. I hope so. These two DVDs contain something that to me is very important.  One DVD is for the old Starvengers movie in spanish. In case you don't know, around 1980 there was this show called Force Five. This show was actually five "giant robot" anime series that were edited and dubbed for the American market. These shows, produced by Jim Terry Productions, had a spin off movie that was basically a summary of the entire series. Usually 100 to 120 minutes, they were like the best moments reduced into a movie. And they were pretty good. My favorite of these movies were Grandizer and, of course, Starvengers. All five movies, plus the original english series, are very hard to find. That is, unless you visiting eBay at least twice a day looking for these items. Of course, by doing this you can get these movies in english, but not in spanish. So I was pretty lucky to find this version, even taught it was a digitalized version of a very bad VHS copy of the movie. Still choosers can't beggars. The spanish audio was very good, so I can't complain (unless this replacement DVD also has errors).   The other DVD iimpossiblele to find in eBay or anywhere else. If you happen to get your hands on a copy, consider yourself very lucky. Its a live action sci-fi movie based on Go Nagai's Mazinger Z manga. Yes, you heard me right... LIVE ACTION. If you never knew this existeded, don't worry. Many people, even Mazinger Z hardcore fans, don't know about this. It's very old. I think the movie was produced around 1978, but I could be very wrong on this, so don't quote me. The movie was dubbed into spanish and played in select local theaters for a couple of weeks due to the huge popularity the Mazinger Z cartoon had in Puerto Rico.  I didn't get to see this movie in the theaters, but I did see it when it was released to video. The video version is very rare and it's usually a priced item among local fan's anime collections (those that are lucky enough to get it).    I had a bootleg copy of the movie in VHS. A copy that went AWOL. So, I was desperate to get it. Many years ago I was in Florida and had an opportunity to buy a VHS copy of the live action Mazinger Z in english, but didn't cause it was $60 and I already had the bootleg. Man, was I kicking myself after I lost the bootleg VHS. Anyway, finding the DVD, which is basically a bad VHS copy digitalized into a DVD - R with some crummy chapter stops, made me very happy (until I saw encountered the errors). I really hope that the replacement copy is working.   I'll let you know if these suckers are working later.  Also, in case you are interested, Collector World also offers the entire Mazinger Z series with spanish audio. The guy who produces these DVDs recorded the series when he was a kid and then mixed it with the video from a Hong Kong DVD release of the series. He took out the japanese audio and inserted the spanish track. Pretty neat, huh? Great quality image and a crappy spanish dub. Don't complain, it's the best of both worlds. No other way to get these in spanish. The DVDs are 10 episodes each for around $20. It's a little expensive, but if you are a collector and a Mazinger Z fan, this is a good item to get. If you are interested, let me know and I'll pass on the Collector World's information (number and emails). If you live close, they have a booth in Señorial Plaza Mall.   Sailor Ecchi
