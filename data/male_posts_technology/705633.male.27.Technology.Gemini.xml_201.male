We need another night out lads.. let's organise a shirt night this Saturday at the Splash and get wasted. All those in favour ??   Grist sent me this one.. I think i've met this girl..  An Englishman, an Irishman  a Scotsman are having a game of golf with their wives.  The Englishman's wife steps up to the tee and as she bends over to place her ball a gust of wind blows her skirt up and reveals her lack of underwear.  "Good God! Why aren't you wearing any knickers?" her husband demanded. "Well, you don't give me enough housekeeping money to afford to buy any." The Englishman immediately reaches into his pocket and says, "For the sake of decency woman, here's 50 pounds. Go and buy yourself some underwear."  Next the Scotsman's wife bends over. The wind also takes her skirt over her head to reveal that she too is naked under it.  "Hoot, lassie! Why d'ye have no knickers?" She too explains, "You don't give me enough housekeeping money to be able to afford any." The Scot reaches into his pocket and says, "For the sake of decency here's 20 pounds. Go and buy yourself some underwear!"  Lastly, the Irishman's wife bends over to set her ball on the tee. Her skirt blows up to show that she is wearing no undies.  "Bejesus woman! You've no knickers - why not?" She replies, "I can't afford any on the money you give me." He reaches into his pocket and says, "For the sake of decency, here's a comb. Tidy yourself up a bit!"
