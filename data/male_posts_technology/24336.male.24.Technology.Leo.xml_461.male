You can still get the latest one  urlLink here .  People buy the CD to support the project, and that's it.  No one that has the technical knowledge to need/want/use OpenBSD would be unable to make their own CD.  To all the people that bought this trojaned CD, installed it and got 0wn3d, you deserved it.
