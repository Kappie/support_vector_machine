(3:20-21)  We stand fast because He is doing a work in us.  He is actively transforming our bodies to be like His glorious body.  (See also Rom 8:28-30).  What does it mean to be standing fast?  Paul lists three things that should characterize this lifestyle: 1.) Rejoice in the Lord always (4:4) 2.) Be anxious for nothing.  Through prayer and thanksgiving make your requests to God (4:6) 3.) Whatever things are true, nobel, right, pure, lovely, admirable, if anything is excellent or praiseworthy, think about such things.
