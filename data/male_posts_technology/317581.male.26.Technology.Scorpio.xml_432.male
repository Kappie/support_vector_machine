Of the things I know in this life, which aren't many, I know this for sure... I want to find someone to Love and to be fully Loved in return.  That's what I comes down to. I often wonder what I should be doing to find that special someone... What I might do to make someone like me... What happens if I find her and I've already screwed up my life so bad that she doesn't want me?  Why do we have a desire to be accepted? Am I a bad man? Am I a good man?  Adam is going to Iraq on October 31st. This reason enough gives me enough pain/emotion to hate my president. To realize that one of my best friends may die, and there is nothing I can do about it. Who is Saddam Hussein to me? What is Iraq? Why are we there?   I started taking piano lessons. Self improvement or masturbation?  That is all- Tim
