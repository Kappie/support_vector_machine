The day Google released GMail account for testing, I posted a message for getting an account. But then didn't get any reply back.   GMail not just only provides you tremendous space but also increases your efficiency. Google has kept its tradition of keeping the interface simple and focusing on functionalities.   There has been much hue  cry about the advertising procedure of google, but I don't see any specific reason which makes me feel negative about that. In my view they have actually created a sound business model based on which they can provide cheap(in this case free) services to large number of users and also earn revenue. And now its upto a user to decide weather he wants to use it or not.  The way advertisements appear along with the mail, doesn't block your view and don't make you feel itchy. The advertisements just appear once only during when one opens an email for reading. On the contrary email interfaces of other providers have a lot of flashy advertisements, pop ups which at times itch a lot.   GMail has made the response for the service quite fast and massively reduced the number of clicks for checking email. Overall its a quite good service, not just because of the 1G space, though its an important part but also in terms of the actual service.
