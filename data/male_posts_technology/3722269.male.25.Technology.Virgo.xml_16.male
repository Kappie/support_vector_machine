There's a few things I want to add when I get around to it... I've got a few pictures I've 'fiddled' in photoshop that might make you smile, I'll set up links to the homepages I host for other people here on the-g33k.com, probably put some other sock-worthy links to things like strongbad and happytreefriends. There's some girls on irc trying to track down pictures of peoples 'bits' to catalogue and judge, or something, so that sounds mildy amusing, however.. I'm not sure what winning would do to ones self esteem - to be sexually revered amongst geeks.. you'd just kill yourself, wouldnt you? It goes something like this, IRC is infinately better, at most times, than TV. TV, in rotorua is infinately better than going out... unless I can find my swandri, work boots and black nugget. It's not a bad way to spend a cold evening. I could hook up a webcam, but I'm pretty boring to watch, I think I'll put more of a focus on media too.. there's shitloads out there.. someone needs to coordinate it so that we all get illegal copies of what is rightfully,well, not ours, but that we want. And that makes it ok! meh.. till tonight, ttfn
