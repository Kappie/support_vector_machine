Now, I'm not defending this guy or anything, but if he had killed a family member who was a rape victim, it would've been called an "honor killing"  and he would've been well within his rights to do it . That is just messed up.  Astute reader  urlLink Charlie  points out that this is only legal in Syria, however while it is publicly abhored by their government, it is a culturally accepted practice.
