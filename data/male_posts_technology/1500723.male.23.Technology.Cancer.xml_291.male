Ambani Chairman, Reliance Industries Limited  'Honourable Finance Minister Yashwant Sinhaji, respected Dr. Kurien, chairman of the jury Shri Deepak Parekh, Shri Amitabh Bachchan, Shri Samir Jain and Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to thank The Economic Times for this prestigious award. These days an award for a positive achievement is 'news' by itself. Coming from a leading newspaper it is a great honour indeed. A leader focuses on the positive and encourages it. And Economic Times, we know, is the leader.I would like to thank the jury and The Economic Times for bestowing this honour upon me. This award has been earned by the entire Reliance family. It consists of thousands of employees who work with total dedication. Managers who are 'owners' of operations under their charge. Business associates who share Reliance's commitment to customers and investors. And millions of investors who have unshakable faith in 'Reliance'.  'They are the pillars of my achievements. They are my family. I am proud of this family. With great humility I accept this award on their behalf. I accept the award as the son of a village school teacher from Gujarat. For me, this award has one simple message. For those who dare to dream, there is a whole world to win. Today, I would like to share this message with all young Indians: Dream and dare. My message is very simple: Let no one demoralize you. Do not allow any one to deter you. Pursue your goal, even in the face of difficulties. Convert difficulties into opportunities. Keep your morale high, inspite of setbacks. At the end, you are bound to succeed.  'Often friends ask me, Have I achieved all that I wanted? The simple reply is : No. There are many more miles to go. What has been achieved is history. I only believe in looking at the future. I still cherish several dreams: The dream of assured water supply for all our villages. The dream of a manifold increase in our agriculture output. The dream of connecting all our villages with the rest of the world. The dream of giving world-class education. The dream of providing millions of jobs. The dream of winning a war against diseases and malnutrition. The dream of employing the latest science and technology. All for the people of India. In short, I dream of India becoming a great economic super-power. Undoubtedly this dream has yet to become a reality.  'The question is : What should we do to realise this dream? First, we must know the problems. However, it is even more important to know the solutions. Let us acquire knowledge and then apply it. Knowledge is the key to greatness. Second, we must respect creators of wealth. Unfortunately, creators of wealth are ridiculed in our country. A farmer is dismissed as an 'illiterate'. Lip service is paid to him only because he is a voter. A worker is condemned as a troublemaker. Businessmen are labelled as crooks. Those who do not produce wealth discredit those who create Wealth. This attitude kills the productive spirit. A society, which condemns creators of wealth will always remain poor and miserable. Acquisition of knowledge and creation of wealth are part of our culture: That is why we worship Saraswati as well as Lakshmi.Third, we must learn to trust. For several centuries, Indians have been brainwashed to distrust other Indians. This saps national energy. Distrust kills initiative. Distrust compels people to maneuver and manipulate. Trust and transparency stimulates entrepreneurship. If India wants to be a great nation, we must have the courage to trust. This is my sincere belief. We must learn the difference between a mistake and a crime. We must have the wisdom to correct and encourage. Fourth, we must always go for the best. Do not compromise on quality. Reject if it is not the best not only the best in India, but globally.  'Friends, These principles have guided me in my life's journey from a village school boy in Gujarat to the metropolis of Mumbai via Aden.I have trusted people and they have put their trust in me. I have encouraged youth, and they have never let me down. I have asked my people to take initiative and to take risks. It has paid me rich dividends. I insist on excellence. This helps us to be leaders. Reliance is built on some of these principles. I sincerely believe that these are the principles that can help us to build a greater India.  'Ladies and Gentlemen, these are exciting times. Times of change and transition. We cannot afford to be complacent. These are times of big challenges. These are also times of great opportunities. Let us seize them. For this, we must change and discard old attitudes. We must forge a new partnership for a great India. A strong and constructive partnership between industry, government and society. We must learn to work together and reject the negative mindset. We can then prove to the world that India can do it. That Indians are not afraid of competition. That India is a nation of achievers.  This is the legacy I would like to leave behind.  Thank you.   urlLink Dhirubhai Ambani  (December 28, 1932 - July 6, 2002)   It's been one long year...
