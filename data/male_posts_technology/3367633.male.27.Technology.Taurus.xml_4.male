I think my office mate used to be a sailor. all he does is cuss all day long and goes on the weirdest tangents.   I saw kill bill2 last night. I thought it was very good and i cant wait for the two movies to be mixed back together. that should be a good movie.  I am going over to see my father today and visit with him before he leaves again for the summer.
