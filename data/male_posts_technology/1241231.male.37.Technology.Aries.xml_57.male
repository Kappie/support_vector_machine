I think the F1 season will once again belong to Ferrari - their car is miles ahead of everyone else, to the point that I think this year is going to be boring again.  So the best racing on TV in Aussie this year is likely to come from the the V* Supercars.  I am looking forward to next year when Juan Pablo gets a fast car. Though Raikonnen and Coultard were both off the pace this weekend.   urlLink The Herald Sun agrees with me.
