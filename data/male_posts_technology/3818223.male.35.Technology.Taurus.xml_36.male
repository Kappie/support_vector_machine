Today I encountered her twice in one day, once while coming in late, then again while taking an early lunch. Both times happened about a mile away. I'm beginning to think she's moved into my neighborhood, which is not good. I don't even like her working in the same building.  Oh, well. Looks like the violence may become less random.
