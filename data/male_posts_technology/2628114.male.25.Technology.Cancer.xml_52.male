We are both intent on training together as much as possible since we plan on sticking together in the NYC.  We couldn't have picked worse conditions in which to run.  This time of the year the bad conditions will rarely be related to the weather.  Today, for me, it was a combination of very little sleep, a long run the day before, and a big dinner that we ate just an hour before our run.  Nothing beats that combination to leave you tired, panting, and with a throw-up feeling in your stomach and throat (Mmmm!).  We hammered through the miles talking all the way regardless of what pain we felt or how much we felt like throwing up after that meal.  Don't get me wrong, the meal was delicious as it usually is when we eat at Heather and Brad's.  It's just really hard to follow that with a run.  I let Brad go on at the end and add a couple extra minutes.  I had nothing to prove since I had just done a pretty lengthy run yesterday.  It probably goes without saying that I was feeling pain throughout my body.  I noticed most in my knees (as usual anymore) and my quads and calves (oddly).  All was well though because we made it.  For a final thought today, I will return to one from before regarding how I felt during the run. Suddenly, agony, filling me, killing me!  Suddenly, out of breath, what is this?  Is this death?  Have a great week!  It should be gorgeous.
