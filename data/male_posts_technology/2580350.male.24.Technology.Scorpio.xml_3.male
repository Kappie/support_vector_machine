The female actor has a non-curable disease, falls for a womanizer, womanizer turns into nice guy, falls in love with the dying lady, some drama and finally a long climax.   Cenrtal Park at NY had been captured beautifully in the movie although this is not the first movie which tried to capture the entire park.   Some characters like female lead's grand ma don't add much value to the movie.  Overall a recommended movie ut I would advice to keep some tissues at hand.  These guys are better than the Indian directors and story writes who for the sake of making audiances happy make an really impossible operation successful and even bring back life to characters in the movie after they have been declared dead. The funny part is it's not the doctors who revive the actor. Most of the time it's other actors' hue and cry that brings back life to the character. If that does not work some deity would be kind enough in the movie so that it grnats life back to the character. The actor gets up from the death bed and goes and kills the bad guys. Great ending.   Actually these guys are also not at fault. The movies where the lead character dies in the end have not been successful at the box office. For instance Dil Se was a disaster at box office. But it was one of the best movies I ever got to see. More about Dil Se later...
