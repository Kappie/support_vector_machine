I didn't want to touch the car anymore because they may be able to get prints, or atleast that is how it is done on TV. As I waited for the Cincinnati Police to arrive I started thinking about the things I had left in my car. The first thought was my cd player and cds. I was almost sure they were gone. Then I realized that I had left my baseball glove was on the passenger seat.   I quickly went back to my car and was relieved that the glove was on the floor of the car with every piece of paper that had once been neatly placed in the glove compartment. After the police arrived I was able to go through and see what was still in the car. All baseball equipment was fine. My cd player, cds, ash tray, and coin holder were all taken. The car also reeks of cigerette smoke. My doors were unlocked and the police officer said that was a good thing because he didn't break the window. Of course, none of the other cars on the stree got broken into. He didn't find any prints because the car was wet from morning dew.   You can see the picture I took on myMoBlog.
