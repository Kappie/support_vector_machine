But I still need to check one more lobang before I know if its possible to make the trip. Chamz. Was estimating my budget and I may not have enough to go both places. Haiz ...  Maybe if I can sell a few more phones I might be able to make it. But I think if ultimately I really can't. Then I might just stay on in UK to do an uchideshi program here instead. Need to get my Sensei's approval of course.  So much details to check out and confirm before I can start making a choice. Ma fan!!!!
