I called e-trade yesterday and after some discussion, we settled on:   re-finance original loan for $295k, 5/1 ARM (interest only), 5.375% initial rate. Also, HELOC will be reduced to max of $50k (from recently increased $100k), with a balance of roughly $40k. Payment will be $1321 interest and $376 escrowed taxes and insurance, for a total of $1697. Payment on the heloc will be roughly $180. Total is about $1900. That's not bad at all -- my current payment is about $2100. I thought for sure I'd be paying more.   But the catch is the 5/1 ARM. After 5 years, the interest rate will jump a bit. So the plan is, either re-finance or sell within 5 years. I'm sure my picture will be considerably clearer within 4 years.    The Long View   Sept 05 - Kid1 starts K, 1/2 time in daycare.  Sept 06 - Kid1 starts public school, kid2 starts K, 1/2 time in daycare.  Sept 07 - Both kids in public school   So I'll pay strictly interest for the first year, maybe the first 2 years. Then I'll be able to start making significant payments toward the principle. I'll also be able to start putting money into my retirement again, and start building the kids college funds. After a year, I will also look into making improvements to the house, with the idea that I'll stay there longer than 5 years.    Plans for the house    Put in a shed beneath the front steps   Get a jungle gym for the kids   Tear down the deck, have it re-designed with meandering pathways and rebuilt with eco-friendly materials.   Get central air conditioning   Build a patio at the side of the house, complimenting the deck   Build a room below the deck as an outdoor / 3 season patio   Build a gazebo, steps / pathways going down from patio and/or deck   Get a hot tub and a small in-ground pool in the patio   Build a treehouse or playhouse for the kids   Re-paint the outside of the house   Get better storage options for inside garage, get outside door installed to garage   Get professional landscaping   re-decorate the living room - paint the walls, get some art   re-decorate the kitchen - hardwood floor, new counters, new sink   enlarge master bath, remove walk-in closet, put in 2-person jacuzzi tub and larger windows   If nothing else, the house will be a great investment opportunity. Wow, I look at that list, and start envisioning my house in a few years and I really like what I see. Why would I want to sell?
