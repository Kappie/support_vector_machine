Worth knowing the whats of our great religion and makes me feel something good about my identity... if u have time have a look at this  urlLink link   Also, a bit of news that i found was as follows...  "Some liberal religious historians have raised the possibility that stories of Jesus' birth, ministry, execution, and resurrection were copied, at least in part, from Krishna's life."  To see what they say in its entirety abt this issue have a look at this  urlLink link   Ur views are welcome...  Regards, Mahen
