It's well written,"  Bush told The Associated Press in a brief interview just outside his home in Crawford. Asked what he was gleaning from the report, he said, "I'm gleaning that was a well-thought-out plot by the enemy."  yeah, is suppose it did, george.  i'm sure it was chock full of twist and turns and surprises for you concerning the events that led up to the september attacks of 2001.  must have something to do with you being on vacation for over 40% of that time period, rather than GOING TO WORK AND DOING YOUR FUCKING JOB.  and i don't want to hear any whiny, tit-for-tat crap about how Clinton should have done a better job in regards to terrorism.  HE'S NOT PRESIDENT ANYMORE.  bush IS.  bush is responsible for what happened on his watch.  if he'd focused on terrorism and al-quaeda  at least  as much as his predecessor (or at all, for that matter), and the september attacks had happened anyway, maybe i would've cut him some slack.    but we'll never know, and i find his performance on this issue completely unsatisfactory.  anyone who doesn't (no matter what else we may disagree on regarding bush) is maintaining a interpretation of the facts that apparently my tiny brain can simply not manage.  or you're simply biased; whichever.
