The only thing that has happened in my otherwise banal life, is that my son Ciaran who is only just 4 had his tonsils and adenoids out last week - poor mite.  Been quite an awful week in that respect because we have had to dose him up with pain relief, and take his mind off it all , by putting on endless videos.  Now we have to wean him off the TV!  Rowan isn't that interested in TV, so is another kind of handful for poor old mum - I'd never want to swap the job to be a house husband!
