If genius means a thousand times more entertaining than another renovation show.   That said, I'm just about counting down the seconds until Australian Idol 2 and the subsequent chance to go and see the next bunch live in concert like Kaia and I did on Friday night! Did Kai tell you how she cried when Pete the Pig Farmer sang 'Burn For You'? No? Well, I thought I'd share it with the INTERNET. It's okay Kai, you can tell the nice people how I welled up when Guy-dol sang 'Angels Brought Me Here'. Oh, wait.....
