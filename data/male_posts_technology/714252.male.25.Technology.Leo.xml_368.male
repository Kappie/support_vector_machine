This unfortunate incident occurred in a sewer pipe on the Island of Tihi.  The deceased was reported to have shouted 'Well, there goes the rest of my day...' just before expiring.  Michael Gargan is survived by Gladys Happyfoot, a trained chimpanzee.  Funeral services will be held the 5th of next month."  Bubbles, how come they got your name wrong? Although I kinda like Gladys Happyfoot, I think I may just call you that from now on.
