So, here I am, if I give up on the fact of having the sex again within the next 10+ weeks, I think I can become a game testing GOD! Or at least secure me a blue badge position? I don't know but I think I SHOULD use my amazing computer abilities for good, but sometimes it's so easy to be evil :)  So, I ended up only working 15.8 hours this weekend:) Gotta love the OT. I hate that I cancelled my 7am run, but am glad that I'll still have a run tomorrow night.  I'm lost in a sea of wondering and hate the fact that I have heartache. I want to have it removed, but I don't know how.  Peace from the sleepy- Tim
