Appertif:   One bag of Vegie Chips eaten in the car between Glenferrie Rd Coles and Westgarth High St.   Entrée:   Two loaves of Garlic Bread (Coles homebrand)   Snack:   7 Mini White Twix, 3 Mini packets of Maltesers   Dinner:   3 baguettes smothered with cream cheese, lovingly sprinkled with the pepper mill, scattered with one of the 4 jars of capers we have accrued in the name of Caz’s special pasta sauce and never eaten and a fuck load of smoked salmon.   During Dinner Snack:   A large chunk of Tilba Trilogy cheese, a four pack of dip (nice, different and unusual) and a packet of water crackers (Coles homebrand).   To wash all of the afore mentioned down:   Approximately 1 litre of DeBortoli Red Wine (Coles homebrand) per person.  To get the complete McLachlan St experience one should enjoy all of the above with Sex and The City episodes, early Kylie Minogue and some vintage Australian Idol tunes.
