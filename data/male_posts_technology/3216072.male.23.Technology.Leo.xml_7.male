Actually I am just tired of them piling up next to the Martha Stewart catalog. I guess one day I just decided to stop being left out. I mean every one else is fucking me why shouldn't I have a turn.  So I called this lawyer. Let's say his name was Bob. Yea Bob the lawyer. What a guy. He said he could walk me through the whole process. Hell, he would even throw in the first consultation for half price. Half price? "What is half price?" I asked bob. "Well" he says in a southern drawl, "Full price of a consultation is 200.00 dollars and that's the best deal in town!". That's the best deal in town? "Well, Bob what's one of these darn things normally run a fella like me?" I had to ask.  Well after he told me the price, I just had to ask one more question "Well that doesn't sound to bad there Bob, but can I roll that into my bankruptcy along with my other bills?". Needless to say I have to find a new lawyer. Guess ole Bob the lawyer didn't see the humor. I imagine I am going to have to approach this a different way. So I picked the next blood sucker in the list and reached for the phone.
