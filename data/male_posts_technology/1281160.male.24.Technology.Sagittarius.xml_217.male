By way, Valli, its true I also experience automatic refreshing of the bottom pane of the web page where u edit the blogs. I think its blog's facility to update us with recent postings even when we type.... and hope Jax cant do anything regarding that....  Talked to Sweet... she is here for an interview...Hope she will do it good... and , blrmsitmians.. list increases....  By way, tommorrow planned to cut office and accompany my aunt to my relatives home nearby....  Hence, if there is any meeting within blr gang, it will be nice to schedule sunday for my presence...
