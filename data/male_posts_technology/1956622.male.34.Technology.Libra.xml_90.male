Karissa was not interested in talking.    No biggie it is par for the course.  It used to really bother me that she would not talk to me or whatever but I realize now it is the age and forcing her to talk to me will only cause issues down the road.  So I am back to work for 4 days and I forgot my sweatshirt so it is freezing ass cold in here.  I might have to run home later and get it.  I would have ridden my bike in but I need the derailers fixed or replaced.
