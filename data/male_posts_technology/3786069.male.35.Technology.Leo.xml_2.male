Got the website somewhat configured and setup this blogger account for everyone to keep track of my experiences.  By reading some of the other guys logs who are overseas it seems that this serves as both a therapeutic and time passing activity. I'm hoping this logging will sooth some of my anxiety and apprehension about partaking this contract.  These are my final days here in San Diego with my family and friends. Been running around like crazy trying to get paperwork, finances and personal items needed for this what seems unimaginable journey.  Saw most of my EDS pals today, probably for the final time. I'll miss those guys.
