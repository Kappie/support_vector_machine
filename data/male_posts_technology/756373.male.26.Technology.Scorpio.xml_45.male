Stressing out about some or other problem at work , some pointless task , worrying about deadlines or your boss shitting on you... it all means so very little. On Saturday, the family dog was hit by a car. Sure, it was only a dog, but that animal was like a member of the family. He had his own quirks, his own personality. While I will miss the bugger, it was my folks who were hit the hardest. While I'm not teary and an emotional wreck like my mum, the dog's death nonetheless caused something to click in my brain. A realisation that you should be spending your life enjoying it. Chasing money and material possesions, chasing a career that you despire..it all means nothing. You could be run over by the car of bad luck tomorrow, and what will it all have been  for ?
