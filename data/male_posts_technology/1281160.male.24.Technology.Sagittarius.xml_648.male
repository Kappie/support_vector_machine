I'll be going home tonite... heard the weather is not so good in many parts of Tamil Nadu... nothing different in Bangalore too... last 2 days I was down with high fever and diarrhoea... and feeling better today... its an erratic weather here... y'day morning it was raining heaviliy... then there was 3 hrs of bright sunlight in the afternoon with virtually no clouds on the sky.. and in the evening it started raining again... at the moment, the clouds and the sun are playing hide-and-seek...
