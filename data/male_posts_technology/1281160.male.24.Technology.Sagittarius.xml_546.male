Hi,           Boddu will be removed from msitmmb soon... but he seems to have found another way to work around.. He sends to the individual IDs... to stop receiving this stupid mail block his ID by clicking on the "Block" button...  Latest in Raghu Boddu's hit list are these IDs...  mvinitha@rediffmail.com, jxavierroy@yahoo.com,  chatchander@yahoo.com, yourskganesh@yahoo.com,  vallichidambaram@yahoo.com, tilaka666@yahoo.com,  rini_1978@yahoo.com, funvijay@rediffmail.com,  karthi_nov26@yahoo.com  As u notice...
