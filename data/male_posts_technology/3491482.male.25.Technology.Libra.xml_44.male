Okay, in a  urlLink previous post , I said it's too bad the DPRK government can't get their economy to produce something the world really wants to buy.  It seems they actually do provide something the world wants, it's just something the world wishes it didn't want.  But if DPRK didn't have this to sell, they'd just have to fall back on  urlLink WMD and counterfeiting  to make ends meet.  Since we're not willing/able to do much about Kim Jong Il (though their  urlLink propaganda  about it is a hoot), we may be in the unpleasant position of deciding which pernicious habit is least offensive to us and turn a blind eye.
