She's really cool, She listens to "trance", I don't really like it but she has such a passion with her music it reminds me a lot of mine.  She's really out there, she's hillarious and really smart, a lot of the time she makes fun of me, but I don't mind, hell, she's talking to me at least, and I think she's just teasing anyway.  I like to talk to her more than anything in the world, She just makes me feel so great whenever she's around.  I always get really nervous when she's around and I really like freak out sometimes.  She's really cool at least to me.  She's kind of athletic, but doesn't really seem to be really tired like the rest of us.  She's just so fresh and blossoming every day like a spring, on a good day.  She's either really nice or really, really mean.  Depending on what mood she's in.  I "had to" sit next to her in English, which is why I am trying really hard to get into AP so I can be in the same class with her again.  I always try to pass it off like "Oh great now I have to sit next to you", but I think she knows how I really feel.  I asked her to prom last year, and I fucking HATE DANCING, but she wanted to go, she said no but it was under wierd circumstances, and I'm going to give it a shot once school starts.  If anyone has any advice please go right ahead I need it.
