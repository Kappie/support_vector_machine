Well, Abi did it, I left patches so she is giving my side of the room a second coat....  I have been reduced to giving the skirting board and the archetrave a coat of primer - and nothing else! I am however still expected to clean all the brushes at the end of the day, even when I have not painted! The injustice!  Dad is down this weekend to help tile the kitchen - he has the know how, and more importantly all the tools.  I will, when its all done, post some links and photos on my website.  urlLink visit me   ciao
