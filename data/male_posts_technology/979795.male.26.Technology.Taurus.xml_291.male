Naturally we lost, 18-0 hehheh. Anyway, the rest of the Bde had to stay as supporters. I became the ball-picker instead :P  I had to rush down to Aikido after that as there was no transport out. I was just on time. Managed to settle payment for the mat fees at the CC (been owing for quite awhile), and rushed on to change into my gi. There were 2 adults watching (father and son I think). I got slammed more than a few times today. Was getting into it, but I realised I tend to fall really hard. More than once, I landed weird on my back (hope no permanent damage was caused :P). Somewhere in the middle, I managed to fall really soft for some not-too-soft-slams. Dunno how I did it, but I seem to have a vague idea. Really need to try it out again at slow-mo to be certain in future. Today's training was great! At least I left feeling like I've brought something away with me.  Oh yea, 2moro guard duty. Sianz ... gonna miss the ECP run. Hope to make up for it this Sun at Selarang training run.
