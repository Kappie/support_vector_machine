Well, I gave her all of my reasons, but then she pressed on why I can't just simply quit smoking like I've done before. I gave this talk about all preps needed to quit smoking like time period, having something to do and such.   But then, it struck me like  BAAAM!!! . After tinkering with it(having restless sleep in the process) last night, it was me who was holding back on it. The will is there but there is no courage to pursue it.   Here I am contemplating how to better my life in this world, yet this  ABOMINATION , this act of burning money to quickly release yourself from this world is hindering me back. Thanks Fidah, today I'm gonna finish my last pack of ciggies (only 3 left!) and I'm gonna quit after that. But I'm gonna do it hush hush, not like before. After 2-3mths, then I brag about it :-)  Met with NM yesterday, sending her to MidValley to meet with her housemates for some shopping (can't separate the girls from shopping!!!). Tried to tell how I feel for her, but it wasn't the right time. Maybe other times but it better be quick!  Till later....
