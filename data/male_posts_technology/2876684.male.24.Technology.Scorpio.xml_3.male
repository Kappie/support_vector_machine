I woke up at 5.30am yesterday to get a good start on the day, had to get in around 8.30am but I didn't want to chance being late because of late trains or whatever. In the end, I was 45mins too early, and my contact at NRMA HQ didn't show up till 9.00am. You do the math on how long I waited. I realised something while I was waiting in the lobby - one of the security guys there was the same guy who didn't let Christine into Minc! What a coincidence... well, maybe not really because Minc is right across the road.  As expected it was a long day, with a host of problems I had to deal with (which I won't go into detail because there were just that many...) and I worked from 9am till 5.30pm non-stop. Again, so much for the job being simple! Ray (my cousin) it's all your fault! But yea, it's been good actually apart from the workload, never thought I'd do any IT work before. And according to Ray, I've done well because the client and his own engineer were happy with me so I guess maybe it's a sign for a promising future in IT? :P  I was pretty beat after that, thoughts of skipping training flashed briefly into my mind but I'm glad I made the effort because it was a great class. There were only 4 of us so Shihan took a bit of a different approach to the class - he made us do all the cruel and unusual bag drills that I love so much, like lifting the punching bag onto your shoulder and throwing it onto the ground! (My feet are bruised from all the kicking as well, but that's another story in itself...)  Shihan made me recite the dojo kun (dojo oath) and I am very embarrased to admit that I didn't know it by heart - it was a huge wake-up call for me really... for someone who loves his karate so much, how can I not know the very principles that it stands for? After that, Shihan gave us a little talk on the dojo kun and what it means to him, and I found it very profound because after the grueling physicality of the class he ended it on such a different note. I almost couldn't hold back the tears... it reminded me yet again of the depth that Shihan has. People tend to write him off as a brute because he's a very physical man (and Maori too), but let me tell you this - you don't get your 6th dan in karate or any other martial art for just for being a brute. Last night's class was a perfect example. Anyways, here is the dojo kun for those interested:  http://www1.masutatsuoyama.com:850/dojokun.htm  Today was pretty much the same as yesterday, but the pace wasn't as full on and I actually got to have lunch with Mey who was in the city to pick up her necklace. Well most of the issues have been resolved and I might go in tomorrow just to mop things up. It won't be too soon when I finish though - if I see another computer with Windows NT on it I will scream!! (But yes I will sooner than I can imagine most probably...) Made it to kickboxing class late because I got held up at work but the guys are looking sharp for Friday, they're gonna kick butt all over Belmore RSL!!!  Oh, and I walked home in the rain. Luckily I had my raincoat. ;)
