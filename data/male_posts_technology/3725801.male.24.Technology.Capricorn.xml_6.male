Developers today have too much on their hands, than to sit and work out BI Solutions, unless there are in the business.      From a developers's perspective, One should consider the following.        Appropriate BI Knowledge     Effective use of BI Tools like COGNOS,BUSINESS OBJECTS,MICROSOFT BUSINESS ANALYSER and other products.     Listen to the customer , their Team Architects and Leaders as to how to go about a BI Solution thats right for them.(The Customer).     And most importantly is Training, A crucial area in any part of I.T. .     Well for more info, I will be covering Business Intelligence in detail in future posts.    So watch out for them.
