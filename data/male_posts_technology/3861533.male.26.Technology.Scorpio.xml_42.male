A lot of great actors in this one:  urlLink Cate Blanchett ,  urlLink Julianne Moore ,  urlLink Minnie Driver ,  urlLink Jeremy Northam  and  urlLink Rupert Everett .  To summarize I'll quote  urlLink James Berardinelli's review :  An Ideal Husband is a delightful parfait - an irresistible concoction of brilliant dialogue, sumptuous set design, top-notch acting, and a plot littered with Machiavellian twists. Possessing a light tone tinged with an acerbic accent [it's] an exquisitely crafted movie that can be appreciated from start to finish.  -->
