And they scream things I can't hear, because I'm deaf, too. They scream that I need to find my way out, even though they have the keys. They scream that it's my fault, even though it's theirs. They scream that There's nothing they can do, even though they have the world in their hands. And I'm left to die. They watch for a while, and eventually get bored of watching me stumble, blind and deaf, starving, and they find better things to do. I was tricked into this box with a wink and a tantalizing kiss.  I was tricked into this box by a wry smile and a look in the eye that lets you know you're wanted and loved.  I was tricked into this box, and like always, I'm left to die. And every time I fight myself out, without anyone else, silently battling away at the thick walls that are my problems.  And the box is closing in. And this time the walls are thicker. And the ones I thought would be there left, and they betrayed me.  Will I finally have some help now? And if I do, will I be dropped back in the box after I'm bailed out for the first time?  What does tomorrow bring? What will you say and  mean ?  Will you read this and understand me?  Will you unlock me?
