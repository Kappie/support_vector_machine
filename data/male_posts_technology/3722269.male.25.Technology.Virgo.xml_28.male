It's a fascinating concept, and one that confronts me daily, reminding me just how small the world is. They say that it isn't so much -what- you know, but who you know, and I think this is quite valid, we all know of people that have been put in jobs, flats and even met there current Signifigant Other, because of who else they knew... I'm pondering at the moment, what sort of party could be arranged if all the people that I know, first hand, and all the people -they- know first hand, were to fan out and pool resources. The last time I put any such effort into a party, complete with planning ahead, was a pretty good success, pool table, arcade machines and a good time was had by all. I'm thinking more of the -human- component at the moment however.. I suspect NZ being the size it is, that it probably wouldnt be too much effort to rustle up some decent celebrities (at least by nz standards) although if someone fronts with Ben Lumis, I will kick them, repeatedly, untill they die. I love parties.. what better way to celebrate life than having fun with your friends, all together with a common goal of approaching alcohol poisoning! Some of you will remember the geek parties of old.. the flat 31 parties and the like. Most of us have gotten a bit older now, so the parties are bound to be a little less incestuous and shocking, but as GIR's halloween party showed, the spirit is still alive and well. I vow here, that once I'm back in Auckland, I'll do my bit to stir up some of the spirit that seems a bit thin on the ground at the moment. I say regular dennys meets, pool meets, waiwera and parties. Road trips, video nights... why not? how many lives do you get. Besides, I'll have one heck of a lot of catching up to do, seeing as I've been trapped down here in rotorua for so long by then :D I'm committing myself to do some webstuff tomorrow, so I'll probably get the 'links' and 'contact' button working on here, and might look at some other bits and pieces too.. that means if you think you know of any things worth linking to, that you should let me know in irc, or via [ comment ] on here. Cheers Ears.. now back to my hackslashbleeddiedie movie, that thankfully has no pies or gooonies in it. Kia Kaha
