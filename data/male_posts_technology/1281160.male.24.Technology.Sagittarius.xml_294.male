"It's about the search for identity, the struggle of life, trying to find out the mythical themes of the messiah, of the lovers, of the teacher, of the shaman. It's such a great platform for how we can sometimes think about our own lives."  Sangeetha has joined us in this blog.   Welcome to the blog, Sangee  . Waiting for Sangee's first blog...  The blog strength has increased to eleven. I have added Mahendran. Is mahendrapallavan at yahoo his mail id? If I'm wrong, someone inform me asap.  BTW: the above quote was given by Keanu Reeves when asked what the Matrix Trilogy was?
