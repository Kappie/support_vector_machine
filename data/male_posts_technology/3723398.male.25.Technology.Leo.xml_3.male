It's been good so far - still nothing earth-shatteringly new, but it's been good to get information "direct from the source".  However, that's hardly on subject with this post.  ;)  having not much else to do, i went down to the hotel bar tonight, and seeing on of my favorite beers on tap (and feeling splurge-like), ordered up a draught of Guinness.  so there i was, minding my own business, sipping my draught, when the older fellow to my right asks, "So - y'like your Guinness, eh?"  hell if it wasn't a native irishman sitting right next to me!  he, oddly enough, was working on a Budweiser (which i later learned, was due to the "when in Rome..." reasoning).  a lengthy discourse, covering a variety of topics, from beer to sports to politics to beer to travel to work to beer... ensued.  said discourse was later joined by the two Swedes from my MIMI class that happened in.  So There I Was (tm) - me, an Irishman and two Swedes - in the suburbs of Houston, Texas - discussing life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and various themes thereupon.  it reached truly sublime levels when Latin American bartender Sergio joined in.  did we all agree all the time?  of course not.  did i gain an understanding of how closely [european] football is followed?  Sure.  did i get the chance to explain baseball to two Swedes who knew next to nothing of it?  Sure.  did the Irishman and I debate social policy - with the utmost respect for the others' opinion?  Sure.  the above, to me, is the true joy in travelling - sure, seeing new and interesting sites and scenery is all well and good, but the real joy is the people you can meet along the way, if you take the time to talk to them and just find out a little about them.  i can only hope that i will soon approach that magical 3 weeks of vacation - which, as was discussed tonight, is quite sub-par in Europe (to the extent of actually being illegal, at least in Sweden) - such as to be able to travel more, and continue to meet yet more people from different places and see more things.  if there's one thing that i, as an admitted cheapskate, would continuously spend good money on, it's travel.  i can only hope that my future career - in both monetary terms and "vactation" terms - will afford me the opportunity to do so as often as possible.  daniel
