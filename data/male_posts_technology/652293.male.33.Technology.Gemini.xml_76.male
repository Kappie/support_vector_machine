"I guess it's because I act like a child."  Ah, and a new foible with my Web site.  I cannot FTP files.  So the only updates that are being made are this blog.  For som reason the app I use for FTP (RBrowserLite) can connect to Verizon, but not display any files.  I tried fetch too.  I know the files are still there, but I have no access.  And I have long forgotten how to access through a command line processor.  I am able to log in through Apple's Terminal app, and do a dir command, but I can't remember how to do the ftp.  Ugh.  And Verizon says that the Web site is a free feature through my DSL, so they don't offer support for any of it.  Only that their engineers are aware of the problem and are working to fix it.  @whee.
