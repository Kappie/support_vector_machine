I havent seen any demo or screenshots yet, but yes, I came across this beautiful blog post by Kumar Mittu who has posted a snapshot of Java's answer to Longhorn  Looking Glass . I would also like you to see a demo on  urlLink this page .  Long Live Java!!!  [Resource-Type: Weblink/Demo, Category: Java/General/OS, XRating: 5]
