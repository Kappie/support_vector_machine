It wasn't that long ago that MC Hammer was the biggest name on pop radio. He even did a show in Penticton. It was great... I mean... I heard some guys walking down the street once talking about it being great. Anyway - around that time I gained the self imposed nick name MC Shauny Boy. And this was super cool (in a ghetto Surrey white-boy rapper kinda way). In fact - it spawned a cartoon series - MC Shauny Bee - all copies of this have been destroyed... a tragic trash bin fire in the 90's. There was a rash of them around that time. Now I have a new name in the rap world... Shaundiggity. Still a little 90's - but with some black hair I make it work. Now the black hair is fading and it's time to come up with a new nick name. DigitalShaundiggity is kinda catchy but will it last. I need something a little more classic rock. Something that stands the test of time. Something that tells a tale of what an exceptional lover I am. OK maybe not that - that's something I sort of want to keep to myself. I need something that whispers sweet nothings into the ears of beautiful, young women as they lay on the sand under the scorching sun. OK - whoops I lost my train of thought there. I sort of enjoyed that, but I must continue. Is it fair for me to come up with my own nick name? Shouldn't my friends do this? I leave this question with you...
