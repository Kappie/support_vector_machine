Last night, Jim McGreevey  urlLink resigned , and my reaction was, "Just because he's gay, doesn't mean that he's not a crook." Living in downtown Philly and having gay family members, the homosexual angle to this article was almost a footnote to me. The real issues were that he was saying that he was quitting because he had an affair and that he was really quitting because he (along with many of those around him) is corrupt.  This morning when I got to work (in the "Republican suburbs"), the resignation was, of course, the talk of the water cooler. Much to my surprise, the homophobes weren't even worried about the appearance of political correctness. They were planning to print out pictures of the governor and plaster them around one "liberal's" desk. They didn't even see that there was something wrong with being appalled that McGreevey is gay.  We've got a long way to go in this country before we reach even an approximation of equality.
