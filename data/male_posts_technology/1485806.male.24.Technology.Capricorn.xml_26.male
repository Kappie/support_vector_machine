Then i have to learn that the girl that i kinda like , is seeing someone else. Man does that bite.  Boy am i glad that..i started off with her as a friend...but still it bites pretty hard...but then having done nothing that is considered pursuing ...is short of anything.  But there are some small joy, in seeing some of the mailing i did , that is to the Star got published and hopefully it will get some attention. And then i just send a mail to the Chief Executive of the Human Resource Development ministry and i pray that will spark a reply.   This whole week, i can see God really providing me things at a time when i am broke literally in terms of finance. When i needed a game , He (God) provided me the funds from friends. When i needed a drink, He sent Melissa my way and Gavin, his uneaten chicken. God is really awesome in every sense and what amazes me is that friends are not just gifts from God ....they are manifestation of God....meaning they showed the characteristics of God. God is a friend who does not mind what background you come from and take into mind the situation you are going through and be with you .  I attended cell last nite and lo and behold, food is poured on the tables rite in front of me...Incidentally it is the combined cell for pot bless and a farewell party for Karen Lim ( Emillia and Daniel) eldest sister. I have come to cell on the intention to look for young adult cell and i come with the thought that i know no one and vice versa but in fact most of the young adult knows me quite well.   Have fun in that cell and that lifts up my spirit and the energy to just go on with life...God strips away bit by bit , the things , the comfort and wonderful things i hold dear....in order to prepare me for the wonderful things that He Have prepared for me. Look at Job, Joseph, Paul...the heroes of faith...most of them are stripped of the things that they hold dear ...but when God uses them and blesses them, the blessing a hundred fold....  Knowing that , lifts up my spirit and encouraged me to pray and prepare myself for God's usage...A lot of people came and critisize the way i trusted things to work...and suggested ways to get out of the situation.But it is not i trust the way thing to work but i trusted God to make things work.  So i challenge you to pray with me not for my situation but also for your situation , pray that God will not move you out of the situation you are in , but pray that God will help you to overcome that situation. Consider it pure Joy to really walk with God just like God walked with Adam in the Garden of Eden. To talk with Him and fellowship with God without any shame and guilt with ever boldness and faith,.
