With that preclude, I'll start with a run-by-run of yesterday and today. After I finished school (½ an hour after my last post) I took Melissa home and headed home myself, intent on swiftly cleaning my room and getting ready for that night. In reality, I got sidetracked, and didn't really start cleaning my room until almost two hours later. Close to 3:00 I started removing some stuff from my old car that I wanted to keep so that my dad could get rid of it later that day (it never actually happened, he's now debating doing something else with it). Anyway, that took a while and then I had to go back inside and mess with my annoying DHCP server to get the office computer (and then later Penguin, my Linux box) back on the net. My mom suddenly came in and informed me that I had under half-an-hour until the Beaverton Florist closed, so I got in the car and made my way over the get the corsage. On my way back I was going to stop at Blockbuster on Nimbus and rent the Hudsucker Proxy for the after-party, but at the intersection before it I realized that it would take me an extra 10 minutes minimum to get it, adding in traffic time, so I turned around and headed back home. Before I got in the shower I called Andrew and told him that I would be picking him up at 5:45 instead of 5:30 like originally planned (since it was like, 5:20 right then and I wasn't even home yet. I got home, jumped in the shower, grabbed the fastest car and flew over to his house... then we took like 20 minutes to get back out the door again. I got back to my house at 6:20 (Cam and Kelli got there at 6:10), ran around the house simultaneously changing into my suit, finding invitations and directions and eating a quick snack. Then we all got in the van and went to Adri's house where we picked her and Melissa up, but not without first stopping for pictures etc.   By this time it was about 7:00, and after some minor confusion about names of highways (it's highway 26 to I217 to the 405 to I5, no wait, it's I217 to highway 26 to, no wait...) we were on our way. Once we got downtown, we passed a parking structure and I was thinking about turning in, but then I decided that it would be safe to keep going and see if it was actually the Hilton the next block (I thought it was, but I wasn't sure). Then we got stuck in the valet parking line (which we should have used... it was $6, not upwards of $30 like we'd been told before. finally I got sick of waiting behind parked (literally) cars and cut into the bus lane momentarily. After that we circled around and ended up parking the place that I was going to park in to begin with, but didn't (lol). Oh, I can't go on without mention the weird on a streetcorner a few blocks from the Hilton, we were stopped at a stoplight and all just kinda watching him... he had stopped a couple in the middle of the sidewalk and kept getting in their way as they tried to pass. We couldn't hear what he was saying, but judging by his elaborate gestures and body movements, he was trying to ask them form something. Then as the light turned green and we drove through the interestection, he randomly ran over the the nearest wall and did a backflip off it. The couple took this opportunity to head off the other direction. (lol)  We got in and checked the time... 7:25 - amazing considering traffic and all the other delays. Exploring we went... looking for ways took kill the half-hour+ until the doors opened. We discovered the 23rd floor has a sweet viewing area, and a couple other people (Emily, Rachael T and others) discovered that there was some type of high class ball in the ballrooms (by crashing it... well, just taking the elevators down and walking through the middle of it, but they called it crashing it :) ). Turned out that we were in the first 10 or so people to arrive.   The doors finally opened at I-don't-know-when and we got out raffle tickets etc. and went in. It was really nice, all elegant and stuff, and a 12 (I think...) person jazz band played. We spent the next almost-2 hours sitting, taking pictures, eating and really really wanting to dance. Oh, in regards to dancing, our school's faculty (um, no, just our Principle ... the teacher wanted to dance too) won't allow it because we "have to be allowing of all denominations" or something... I wondering what group of people outside of the Amish still consider dancing something to be looked down on... It's sooo stupid. /tangent    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink     urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      Once we were done sitting, we... stood. …and stood some more. Actually we all went perusing the hotel some more and got our official pictures taken. Close to 11:15, my mom arrived from her concert at *I'll ask her where she was playing, later*.     urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      After some confusing about who was taking which car, taking Josh, picking up Steven and getting the movie, my mom left in my car (which she had driven, so knew where it was parked) with Cam, Kelli and Andrew and I left (in her van again, blasting Country music) with Adri, Josh and Melissa. While they were getting the movie, we picked up Steven and we all convened at my house at 11:45. Andrew went downstairs and obsessed with Ninja Guiden and the rest of us started watching the Hudsucker Proxy. Cam and Kelli had to leave at 12-something and Josh left a bit afterward. Andrew came up eventually and finished watching the movie with us. Then, after waking Adri up (lol), Steven, Andrew and I took Adri and Melissa back to Adri's house (at 1:30). I'm not sure of exact times but I thing I fell asleep on my floor at 4:00, woke up again at just before 5, removed my contacts, and drifted in and out of sleep until 9 or 10.   After breakfast, I took Andrew home then went to an eye doctor appointment (with Steven still with me), came back home, made a tiny pizza, took Steven home, and here I am now, typing this.   ____________________________________________________   I approached the thought of the banquette with the idea that the best way to get through it happily was to ignore (i.e. to not think about; pay attention to, not shunning or something) Gwen and Richard, but that had already become impossible before we had even entered the building. Get this: Without my ever having seen his car before, out of all the 1000+ parking spaces in all the garages and all the streets around the Hilton, I managed to park  right beside  them. Heck, if the elevators weren't so small, we'd have prolly taken the same one down. And then I managed to pick one of the one tables directly behind then so any time I looked up at the band (or speakers etc.) I was looking right at them. I realized when I got home that they're also in the background of quite a few of my pictures. Grrr... I just can't get away from it. *feels like... *realizes that he can't 'feel'** Mixed emotions bring me sorrow, to put it lightly.   ____________________________________________________   School is troubling me... It's looking like I'm going to have to scrap my SOS Spanish class 'cause it's getting increasingly difficult to work with (stupid things like giving me a picture of a hideous woman and asking if i think she's beautiful (granted, in Spanish) I answer no and it grades me wrong... and how on earth are you supposed to tell someone's eye color when you can barely tell the color of their hair?? (Yeah I got both of those wrong too). I'm still wondering whether or not I'll be able to go to Vegas too... Even if Char says yes, I'm wondering if it's a good idea to skip an entire week of school.    ____________________________________________________   My family situation's still quite messed up too. Twice in one week has my dad absolutely blown up at my mom again, and once again have the police visited our house. Oh, and now it seems that he finally wants to leave his church because he's fed up with their continued harrassment of my mom (er... go figure...), but he's under the oppinion that he can arbitrarily decided on a new church home and that my mom will want to follow him to it. It's looking a bit more like he's going to give her new one a chance, but I'm not sure. LOL at this point our five person family is divided amoung four different church bodies.  I have a headache... I want wine. (LOL)
