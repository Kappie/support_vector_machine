The only chance encounter was a cheap copy of the second book in the Resident Evil novel series.  Its written by Perry, who has done some good work in the Aliens line, so I have high hopes.    If only I could get through my other books first...  I  almost  bought the Visionaries DVD, but decided against it for now.  I'll get i eventually, get all nostalgic and then wonder why I liked it in the first place.  I'm doing that with re-runs of Ulysses 31, Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors and M.A.S.K on Toonami...
