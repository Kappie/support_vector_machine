Considering that he’s the only person reading this pathetic blog I’ve decided to appease him by updating my blog.   Laziness just breeds more laziness!  For the past couple of months, I’ve been stuck in one of these lazy streaks where I’m lucky to even make it to work.  Well summer is here and I need to start getting out of the house and actually enjoy the weather.  This weekend was one of those weeks where I actually got out and did something for a change.   Saturday, I went out to Jason’s house to play some eq out in the backyard while having some drinks. Yesterday, I went out to the beach and had a really great time.  Let’s just hope I can continue to enjoy this summer.
