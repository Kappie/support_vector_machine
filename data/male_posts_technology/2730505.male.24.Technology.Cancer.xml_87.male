The place seems like a trashy dive bar.  I'm sure other people don't share this sentiment but I thought it was trashy and a dive.  I was loving it.  It was still somewhat fun.  There wasn't a single person who knew how to dance there.  There was this one guy, if you can imagine the Thriller video by Michael Jackson where he's doing the "monster" sratch dance.  He was doing this to the tune of "Blow my Whistle Bitch"  Yes, it was retarded and funny to look at.  It was kinda like driving by an accident and you can't help but look at the carnage.  You know it's going to be bad but you still go ahead and look anyways.  I had no beef with this guy.  He was out having fun.  It was okay that he was dancing bad because he wasn't being pretentious about it.  The food was cheap.  It was a buck for cheese nachos.  It was a buck for a hotdog.  It was $2.50 for steak on a stick.  Yes beef tenderloin steak on a stick.  There was a band where the "kitchen" was.  The band was some sort of Phish/Greatful Dead tribute and cover band.  Not really my thing but they were still easy to listen to so that wasn't too bad.  Downstairs is where they had a club/dance floor area.  I don't know why but everywhere that I walked and hung out, I would get some sort of liquid to drip on me.  Yes, gross.  It was soon apparent to me that the bathroom was directly above where we all were standing.  Gross.  Beer was $3 a bottle.  Not too bad.  Maybe it was the band that was there because I remember the last time I was there, there were more girls that were easier on the eyes.  This time around, I can count how many good looking ones were there.  It sucked.  I did mange to take a picture of something.  I guess it wasn't a total loss.
