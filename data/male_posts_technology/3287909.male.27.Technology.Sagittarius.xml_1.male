I met with my father and an associate to discuss the new company i will set - up. Our targets are realistic and may father being a salesman for 35+ years will be of great assistance. I slept at 00:15 and got up at 12:07. I needed that sleep.  Today I fixed Helen's (my girlfriend's) car and just sent (FINALLY) the update to my client in Rhodes island, since I didn't have the time to send it earlier.  I will start two projects. One is a software project I have been designing for a long time now and the second is a secret project (sorry can't disclose details if it goes on well i will release it in public).  The software project will be L.A.M.P. - J. based (Linux apache MySQL php with a littil bit o' Java) and will for the basis for all the intranet projects i will undertake from its completion and on. The goal is to create a SAP-like base which will be transformable to any data manipulation project the client will need. I already have a crude first version available but i will start from scratch so as to cure all problems i found in the course of the first experiment.   I will have an e-mail for communication about my blog and what i write in it, since i don't want my primary email to be flooded with spam ( no offence for any one legitimate e-mailer no matter what he says in his email, i mean these stupid people who try to extract emails from such pages so as to send their useless and annoying ads ).  Today i picked up the present for Helen. (The saint who has her name is celebrated at 21st May. In my country it is a tradition to celebrate one's name the day that the corresponding saint is celebrated, i don't know if this happens in other countries too...)  I still wait for a few parts for my paintball gun. I will describe my Spyder in a later post, when i receive the parts i wait for. Too bad i don't have much money to buy a better board for it, to brake the 13bps limit. I think i will get the T-board. Or should i take the IS-board ??? But only when i find some money ... I will definitely get a Q-loader. I believe that it is really innovating and worth a look. It is cheaper than a Halo B and feeds more than 30BPS !!!  SH** !! i need to get some more money! I may start teaching programming ... or maybe put a classified ad in the papers to find some more clients for network servicing ... Tomorrow is the supermarket day. Got to go shopping for home. Helen is passing an "Entry" examination tomorrow in English. If she passes the test with a good grade she will be able to go for the "Proficiency" diploma in six months if she doesn't get a good grade she will be examined for "Proficiency" in a year. Good Luck Helen ...
