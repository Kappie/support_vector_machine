A designer, who I might add, I previously looked up to. Mo here is advocating the continued suffering of Iraqis because America is not perfect. Nothing America has ever done over the last 228 years to it’s own people, however horrible, compares with what Saddam has done in his thankfully short rule. I am disgusted and ashamed as an American by this attitude. As a follower of Islam   he   should be ashamed that he is praying for the mass murder and subjugation of his religious brethren in the modern age rather than see them freed by Americans. That is, after all, what opposing the American liberation means at this point.
