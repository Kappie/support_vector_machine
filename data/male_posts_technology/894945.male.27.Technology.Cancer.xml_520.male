So I for one am going to start posting on a regular basis again (I'll do my best) and it would be great if the rest of you joined in. I know, I know you all think that you are too busy or some of you jump straight onto Ever Quest, or I for one do other stuff, but that is really shite.  So a general catch up on the life of Baity, hhmmm.........................  Ok so where to start? Well I hit the grand age of 22 last Wednesday (July 2nd, so you don't have to waste time looking for the calendar). The Toaster Crew all went out on a big piss up at Chicago Rock and Liquid. It was quite a night for all and I for one was wasted! Dougal and myself did a dodgy run into the former VIP lounge in Liquid, which is now an over 25's lounge on Wednesday night (I mean for fuck sake!!!). The bouncer asked us for ID and we simply stared at him with one of the looks that say 'You must be bloody joking!' As it happens we both had big glasses of champagne in our hands plus other drinks and he decided to let us in haha! Most of the others came and found us and we all chilled out there for the rest of the night- all that is with exception to Toaster, whom unfortunately didn't pass for a 25 year old (more laughing and nudges Adam with a wink!). Anyway the rest of the night is history apart from saying that it was pretty good.  Thursday I took a trip over to Guernsey to meet some friends over there. Yep I have at last gone out for that big piss up with the Gaias Web Crew, and it was awesome!!! Now just a quick thing I want to say to anyone over here that has that Jersey animosity towards Guernsey- 'Quit being a sad bunch of fucks!' The fact is that Guernsey may be a little behind us in things like waterfront projects and multi-story carparks but they are so much more up for the crack! By that I mean that they are much more up for a social and entertaining night out, plus they don't hold a sacred obsession with the fucking fashion industry! I could at least head out around the town feeling myself in a pair of casual trousers and a punk top! Not like over here in Jersey where if you don't suck Hugo Boss' cock then you don't fit!!! So basically give them a break and go over, you may actually realize that it's a good old place (Preach over).  So anyway, I went out with the Gaias Web crew and they showed me a real good time (cheers guys). We basically drank at a cool pub called 'Nix' I believe and then went out for a superb meal at a place called 'Bistro Valentinos', who serve a great steak by the way!. Then we finished the night in a bar called Bahloos (don't know if I spelt that correctly). Now in Bahloos the sell what is called 'The Big One Hundred', this being if I remember correctly- 2 gallons of cocktail, 3 Bottles of champagne and a load of shots! SWEET!!!!!!!!! Also they sell the best 'Rocket Fuel'- 8 shots topped with orange juice. So the night ended with me staggering out of a taxi at Lyndz's house and doing what I do best- Projectile Vomiting! Then Lyndz and I crashed on the sofa watching Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves lol!  Got home on Friday and milled about hung over. Then in the evening I headed out to my cousin Richard's birthday piss up! (so many piss ups!!). We ended up at the Q Bar as they were running another 'pandemonium' night- loads of heavy metal yeah!!  Saturday night saw the annual return of Baity's Coach Party Bonanza! Plus a visit from Lyndz! Yup me and 30 odd other people headed out on a mission to get me cuntoxed, dropped in the sea and generally have a good time. The pub list was as follows:  Post Horn, The Foresters, Mont Fellard Pub, The Trafalgar,  Tam's Bar, and then the SPLASH YAY!  Lots of interesting things happened that night. In fact I can't remember them all as I was totally wankered for most of it! The top 5 things were:  1- Getting Speedy to eat his own chunks of sick after we broke him with two shots at the second pub! 2- Jenny giving all the drivers behind the coach some naked cheeseburger action!! 3- The ritual kariokee singing of bohemian rhapsody at the Trafalgar!!! 4- Me getting thrown rather mildly into the sea at Tam's, then me going for a swim in the dark, and throwing      Psycho in too!!!! 5- Me almost knocking myself out at the Splash due to falling on my own momentum and landing on a fire    extinguisher square in the back!!!!!  So that was the night and I really cannot remember anything from the Splash other than my fall! I am just about done now, but I shall post more soon, and photographs will appear on the site as I get them.  Post you bastards! Baity signing off............
