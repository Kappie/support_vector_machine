I can't wait for the next race, Monaco, the most hardest racing circuit in the world.   Last weekend, I read two stories. One, " urlLink The Pelican Brief " by John Grisham. It was made into a  urlLink movie  starring Julia Roberts  Denzel Washingon. It is amazing to know that many of this books have been made into movies. The only other author (if you discount Shakespeare) whose books have been made into a lot of movies is  urlLink Michael Crichton .  I read the other story on the net. It was an interesting story of love between the Devil and a woman. An interesting idea for a story.  urlLink Read it here .  For those interested in Business stories,  urlLink here  is an interesting one I read a short time ago.   That's all folks,
