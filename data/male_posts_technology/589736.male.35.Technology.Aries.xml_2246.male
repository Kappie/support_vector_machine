That said, I don't consider the two goals (affordability and high quality) necessarily to be mutually exclusive -- but that, as with most things, is a matter of individual conclusions drawn from the available data.  And yes, I do indeed subscribe to a number of absolutes -- while accepting that acting on those absolutes is not entirely effective in all cases, despite the times when I do anyway.  They're also subject not only to change, but to wide variation based on past and future conditions.  I try to adapt and accept that any given conclusion I form may be wrong, but I don't often succeed.  The curse of consciousness:  the only universe I will ever truly know is the one I perceive, physically, mentally, emotionally, or spiritually.  If anything is a recipe for godhood, that's it.  Fraught with unseen dangers, human consciousness is.  That said, I wish there was a Republican I could vote for.  But conservative ideology has replaced judgment; guiding principles have become a careening, unthinking thrillride.  I'd say the same of a Democrat if such was the case; but so far, Kerry has not alarmed me.  Perhaps he will.  To be fair, very likely he will.  We left the altruistic politician (of any ideology) far behind some 200+ years ago (if he or she ever existed at all).  Until either party stops trying to stir its base into a frothy frenzy, the only option available to me is to do my part to keep the pendulum from swinging too far either way.  This administration has swung it too far, too fast.  Any party could have done it.  The pendulum's arc needs to be tempered.  Lacking a leader I can trust, I will opt for tempering until something better comes along.
