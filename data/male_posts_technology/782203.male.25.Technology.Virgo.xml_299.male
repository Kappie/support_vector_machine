And i should have known better because it happened to me once before not that long ago. I think from now on, I am gonna treat all news/opportunities/gals that fall into the 'too good to be true' category with a large healthy dose of skeptism.  That way you don't get too disappointed if it doesn't materialise.  Listening to :  Bjork's  urlLink Vespertine , Slipknot's  urlLink Self-titled , Jimi Hendrix's  urlLink Are You Experienced?
