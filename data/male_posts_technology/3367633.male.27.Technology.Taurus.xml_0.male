Dress me Up (English Version) sung by: Olivia  Why are you looking at me like that? I do not feel a very good vibe Why are you pushing me away? (Well) Now It's not like I really want to stay  Oh I, I might be small but it doesn't mean I can't reach the sky I, I might be weak but it doesn't mean you can knock me down  Don't Dress me Up   I'm already dressed Do you like my shoes? Why are you turning away? You haven't seen nothing yet Don't Dress me Up   I'm already dressed Do you like my shoes? Why are you turning away? You haven't seen nothing yet  Why aren't you giving me a chance I have a way of my own Why are you being so damn crude Hey Look! You are a human being like me  Oh I, I might trip and fall but it doesn't mean that I don't know how to stand tall I, Don't look like her but I am glad as hell I am, who I am  Don't Dress me Up   I'm already dressed Do you like my shoes? Why are you turning away? You haven't seen nothing yet Don't Dress me Up   I'm already dressed I've something to say You don't know what I can do And you don't know who I am  Don't Tear me Up Into many pieces You can't touch my soul You better get used to it Cause, I'm not going no where Don't Dress me Up I'm already dressed Do you like my shoes? Why are you turning away? You haven't seen nothing yet  Don't Dress me Up Dress me up You haven't seen nothing yet
