So who is the  urlLink gay Simpsons character ? "Speculation is already running rife across fan websites about who will be the mystery gay character, ranging from Mr Burns' devoted sidekick Waylon Smithers to one or both of Homer's sisters-in-law." All I can say if it's Smithers it's not much of a bloody mystery - even my 10 year old daughter  knows  Smithers is gay.  My money's on Neddy boy but only because of his big gay moustache. But if it is going to be a mystery it's going to have to be harder than that. So I'm going to go for Mr Burns who will disappear into the sunset with Waylon.
