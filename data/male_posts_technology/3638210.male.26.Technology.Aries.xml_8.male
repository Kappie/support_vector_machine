Say what you will about the quality of food, tell me all of the urban legends about roach eggs you want... but that's some tasty Americanized Mexican and hella-cheap to boot.  Don't get me wrong, I love my authentic south of the border fare, where every dish for some reason is served on a platter-full of refried beans and the chips and salsa flow like milk and honey.  However, when you're in high school or college and living off the change in your car coin holder, the Bell is the way to go.  To say I ate there every day for the last two years of high school may be stretching it, but I can almost guarantee that the number of missed meals was only perhaps a fortnight's worth.  Though the frequency decreased through college and up to present day... I can safely say my stomach is currently clad in lead with a soft gordita shell coating.  As an aside, "gordita" in Spanish is an affectionate term meaning "little fat girl".  Who the hell was sitting in on THAT menu brainstorming session?  Anyway, my two noteworthy Taco Bell stories stem from my high school days of patronage.  I usually ordered a beef burrito and a soft taco back in the day (though now I'm more a meximelt/beef baja gordita kind of guy... sort of like growing up Presbyterian and scooching over to Methodist except with tacos rather than God).  So there I was, eating the usual, and a guy from the back comes around and asks tentatively, "Is uh... everything all right, sir?"  I look up between mouthfuls of burrito goodness and respond, "Yeah."  "I mean your burrito... is it... O K ?"  I still respond positively, though with much more of a question mark of my own.  "How about I bring you another one.  In case that one's not good."  Now mind you I was already halfway through my first.  Thoughts of stray hairs, him dropping his class ring, and everything down the fast food gone awry list came to mind.  But then, the two most beautiful words (which incidentally combine into the most beautiful phrase) in the English language surfaced:  Free.  Food.  "Ok," I said.  And another beef burrito was out and on my muted tone Santa Fe-inspired plastic tray in under a minute.  The second burrito was as good as the first, but the question of WHAT!? still lingers to this day.  Fortunately my second Taco Bell story was not related to the food.  A young mother and her two children walked into a side door that passed by the dining area.  I didn't really notice them until the little boy (about 7-years-old) did a double take and stared at me.  I looked up briefly, but didn't really think much about it as he scurried off to rejoin his mom.  Well, once they had ordered and rounded the corner, the boy leaned over to his little sister (maybe age 5) and whispered loudly.  "See, there he is... that's Daddy."  I slowly turned my head to search and yeah, I was the only one there.  The sister perked up immediately and squealed, "Daddy!  Daddy!"  The mother was already bent down and shushing fervently.  "No dear..." she said, "shhh... shhh".  This did not help, the boy was staring at me wide-eyed, and the little girl was now reaching out, all the while I craned back in my booth probably with a deer-in-headlights look and beef dripping from my burrito.  Fortunately they had their order to go.  The mother took her daughter's hand and half-dragged her to the opposite side of the dining area and out through the door, muttering a half "Sorry, sir," between shushes on her way out.  Once again... WHAT!?  I suppose I can imagine a backstory there, but being blindsided with absolutely nothing to go on is probably more entertaining (and less sad) than the truth.
