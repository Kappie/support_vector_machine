Major activities of the day consisted of handling adhoc tasks, avoiding sleep ;), reading articles (I will post an interesting link at the end of this post), and did I mention lunch at subway.  Resuming after 40 minutes…  Ok its 6 pm now yaaaaaaaaay time to rush home, though it doesn’t feel good when u want to run away from office and head home. It gives an impression that something is wrong, u aren’t interested in work anymore or not comfortable with environment. May be it's because of a strong inner feeling that I am not doing what I always wanted to do. Anyways time to go now.  Cheers  PS: check out this link  urlLink http://www.popsci.com/popsci/computers/article/0,12543,592948-1,00.html . Its about a simulation game which predicts states of different countries in future. One of its subjects is Pakistan yes our dear land. Do read its fun ;).  Adios
