Yes, i realli enjoyed the movie thru and thru, with its fair share of violence, culture, touching scenes, CGI, etc..... Its realli worth every awards available. I can say its not totally a war movie, its jus that it all happens during war period and how brotherly love is shown. Like wat thomas said, its worth every dollars and if i realli onli have $8.50 left, i wont regret spending it on this film. Out of 5 stars, i rate it 4.5 stars.  After the movie, went Mac for dinner with edward whom i watched the movie wif. And we complained to each other bout work til ard 12 plus.....ha ha complain this complain that.....haiz.....life realli sux. And after we part our way, i walked all the way from PS to pacific plaza and took a cab home from there. Such long queue outside CB.....  And during the walk, i realli feel so down that i realli feel like killing myself lah. Saw so many ppl, couples and grps of frens and i'm walking alone along orchard rd. Thot so much....and i dun know y i feel so down also. Was it work? Was it her? or was it Life and everything?? Life realli sux.....Everything is so unfair. Saw a gal light her cig and suddenly feel like smoking also. And acting on impulse, i bought my first pack of Marlboro menthol light, light my first "bought" stick and felt like shit after that. Maybe i will throw it away or give it away lah.....Realli feel like toking to someone about everything but couldnt think of anyone to tok to at that time of the nite.....i really feel so down....so down.....Feel totally fucked up....super fucked up.....was wondering wat its like to die and leave everything fuck thing behind.....i know i will be sorry to my family and frens who cared bout me but they cant realli do anything to help also lah huh??  As for now, realli feel that everything will ultimately be fine after i woke up tomolo morning after a good sleep.....so tired of everything now. Out of my 24 yrs of life, I never realli felt like this before. But i know i muz get out of this somehow, and be strong like wat my ganjie says.  Hope that i will sleep all this feelings away tonite lor and wake up happy tomolo. But i will be the most happy if i can have her by my side now. Nothing beats that lah.....she's my antidote to everything now i guess....and to yan, if u r reading this, dun blame urself.....this got nothing to do wif u,..... its all jus me. I jus want u to be happy rite? Its all to my own accord that i have to go thru all this.....i brought it upon myself. Its all jus me and me alone.....  Cheers, Teddy 1L1O1V1E1H1Y1
