You'll have to forgive me, I still do not feel that great and I have been supremely busy writing essays for my class. =/ Anyhoo here are a few things I thought some of you may be interested in.  First up is  urlLink this  from BoingBoing which points to  urlLink these search reseults  for Japanese Uniforms. ( urlLink hot )  Nest, on to  urlLink The Marvel Directory . A database with information on anything from the Marvel universe. =p  Finally, I wouldn't call this news really since I heard about these a year or so ago. However, it looks like they are finally coming to market.  urlLink These virtual keyboards  are projected from portable devices onto any smooth flat surface and a miniature camera senses where your fingers are. Pretty nifty eh?    -intX    What? Behind the rabbit?
