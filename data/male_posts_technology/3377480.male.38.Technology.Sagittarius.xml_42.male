Pool kit                      4730.00 backhoe/skid steer            1050.00 sand and sand gravel          1200.00 pipe/wire/concrete             250.00 laboreres once                 190.00  total to now.                 7420.00   I still need 300 in sand and 150 in bobcat rental=  450.00 concrete                                            100.00 gravel/pea                                           60.00   also going to upgrade to a salt water chlorinator for 704.00  this does not include the 200 for concrete mixer.  The only tool I didnt have. Also, I borrowed a wheel barrow froma friend along with 2 of his shovels, his wheel barrow is cheap plus he has helped so I am going to buy him a new wheel barrow.  also borrowed several digging tools from my sister in law, one , the pick ax is dang old, so going to buy her a new one since they loaned me all there shovels etc.  One good thing, is my bourbon drinking has gone way way down, you dont drink and work on pool, that is all you should drink is water so i have saved a few bucks there.  my goal was under 8,000   without the salt water chlorinator i would meet that, but i do want it as it will save me money in the long run.  a pooll this size built by a co. would cost about 25,000 to 30,000.   so we have alot of sweat payment to ourselves!
