They are seeking high impact leaders to plant high impact churches all throughout Europe.  Here is their definition of a high impact leader:     * pursue a vital relationship with God over their lifetimes     * maintain a learning posture in all areas of life     * seek a biblical perspective on life and leadership     * cultivate personal integrity and authenticity     * develop healthy relationships with family, co-workers, and the community     * pursue their life purpose and calling     * develop dynamic mentoring relationships     * discover and develop their own giftedness as well as giftedness in others How do you rate?  Is there a low impact leader, and what would that look like?
