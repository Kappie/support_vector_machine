I passed my latest exam towards my MCSE (exam number  urlLink 70-216 ) at the local pearson vue testing center. I studied quite hard for this one actually. I found that it was quite a bit more difficult that the last one I took ( urlLink 70-218 ).   I did have a nice break from studying on sunday. I helped Pat move his gun-safe -- a refridgerator sized box that weighs 1600 pounds. There were about 10 guys there to load it up into the truck but only 5 to load it out of the truck. We ended up pushing the safe along to it's final resting place on cut-up broomsticks just like the egyptians.  ok, so now i have to go back to work...  apply my new knowledge :-)
