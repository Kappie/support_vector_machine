This, of course, is an excellent name for a blog, and since I have had a terrible time finding the motivation to update my home page in the past, I decided to put my acronymic pseudonym to work. Of course, the odds are still pretty slim that I'll continue to find the necessary motivation, but at least this way there's a chance.
