I can't stop playing Steppin' Out by Kaskade, over, and  over, and over, and over... you get it.          Not much going on lately. Well, there is one  thing, but I'm NOT going in to that here. Let me just say one thing,  Foley's are NOT for the timid.          I can't think of 10 new songs to place on my "What  I'm listening to" page on my website, so I'm not updating that this week.  But I will say, download "Da Hype" by Junior Jack when you get a chance.  Nifty little tune there.          Went to Picnic With the Pops on Saturday evening  with "The Gang". Loads of fun. TBDBITL was the guest band, and they  rocked, as always. Then we went to... ah... um... a bar called... aaah...  I forget. But it's in an office building, and it kind of reminds me of the  Regal Beagle. I'd never been there, but had always been  curious.          Then we went to the legendary Amicons. I hope  I spelled that right. Wasn't as bad as Ed and Susan had always  described. Amicons reminds me ofthe Lobo. We played some pool  and then pooped out around 1 or so.          Unfortunately I sorta fell off my quit-smoking  wagon, so I'll have to work on that next time I go out.          Fun times were had by all.          Oh dude, I just checked my Soulseek, and I found an  Essential Mix with Junior Jack. What timing.          I'm going to go listen to music now. I'm  tired of typing, and you bore me.
