Funny place and time to meet, but one of the kids wanted to do it.  Building indigenous youth to lead.... I have this desire to do something with SPACE during Spring Break....  I think it's a great time to engage kids, especially with Good Friday and Easter at the end of their break.  So I'm thinking about something like  urlLink this   at the  urlLink Mall .  I'm thinking, just in general, of the movie theater where the Passion is playing, Hot Topic, and stuff like that... Hmm.  Anyone done something like this with students before?
