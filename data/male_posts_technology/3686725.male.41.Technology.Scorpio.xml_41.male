The doctor has not yet seen the data from Wednesday  Thursday where she got a pronounced fearful feeling and eventually threw up--this is her typical siezure nowadays.  From what he saw on Monday  Tuesdays data did not show any siezure activity, just some "pre-cursor spikes" while she slept.  The potential bad news is that those spikes were multi-focal, meaning from many areas of the brain.  If that is the nature of her epilepsy, surgery becomes far less likely a curative.  However, those may be secondary spikes...and, as I said, he has yet to review the really pertinent data.    But she is home now and life can return to normal once more.  That is until Monday when the wife starts work again.  (She was laid off but we just got word that she was re-hired last week.)
