If there's even the tiniest chance I can get an early gmail account out of this, I figure sign me up!  Yahoo might have done some good stuff as far as linking back in the day, but it's horrific now and I can't wait to abandon its pathetic mail service.  So, actual news and my spin on it and stuff.  Well I'll get the mundane bits out of the way right now.  I consider myself neither liberal nor conservative, which is fine since neither party acts according to its own supposed philosophies anyway.  I think nearly everything Dubbya and his puppeteers have done to this country has been backwards, for reasons I'm sure will crop up as I discuss specific issues-du-jour.  I'm engaged to an absolutely wonderful woman, and I wish the same happiness to everyone else on the planet, be they the same age / race / orientation / faith as myself or completely different.  I think God and religion can do wonderful things, but can be gravely dangerous as well.  I can be quite opinionated and argumentative but I try to be mindful that I certainly don't know all there is to know, so it wouldn't be very wise to have any philosophies or thoughts set in stone.
