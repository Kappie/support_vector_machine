Don't ever say that to a parent.... at least if they're like my mom is. I said that and she took my guitar and some stuff and said "Well, if it's meaningless than I guess you won't mind me taking this.... yeah... that stunk. Then the asking for it back, standing in the parking lot while she goes around singing what a loser I am and what a hypocrite I am (because of course, my guitar is not meaningless to me and I wanted it back...)  It's been a tough morning, please pray for me.
