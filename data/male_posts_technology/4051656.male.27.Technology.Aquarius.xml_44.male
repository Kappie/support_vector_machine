They're pretty dang pricy at $1,499 so you won't find one on my desk any time soon. But if you've got the money, this sounds pretty cool. Like all new technology though, I would give it a good 6 months to a year before actually buying anything. Gives them time to work out some of the more major bugs, and gives the market time to cool the price a bit.
