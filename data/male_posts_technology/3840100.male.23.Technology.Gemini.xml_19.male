Though it took me 2 hours of takes just to find the right bass line for one of the songs it was still worth it. Now that song is also complete. That makes 2 with my official stamp of approval for the  urlLink Third Rail  release.  Stay tuned as I round the bases as I come closer to making the songs finished.
