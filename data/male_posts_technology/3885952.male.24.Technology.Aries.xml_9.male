PARTY!! No not really. Actual this weekend I'm going to dedicate to cleaning up this dump. I need to finish my room and get the house toa presentable state. I have to mow the front and back yard (if i don't no one will) and clean the inside of the house pretty good. kevin already started on some of it, so it wont be too hard. saturday matt said him and lina might come into town, so we might go to dinner later on. that should be nice. I don't know with everyone gone at the assembly, I'm going to have to find another hall to go to. i didn't even know it was assembly time already. with work so crazy and me planning for the mexico assembly i didn't even pay attention to the time. i remember when i was younger, i counted down the days to the assembly. and it wasnt to pay attention to the sessions. I mean i did, but to go the assembly meant to buy new clothes, stay in hotels, chill at the galleria in houston, and to meet girls. Or should i say spend some quality time with the ones I already knew. I guess all the things the brothers said young boys do during the assemblies, we did. Well we weren't that bad. We stayed in our seats, we never roamed the halls during the session. We took notes, we looked up every scripture. We weren't as bad as we thought we were. But those times, those were good times. The Astrodome, the hoagies, the swiss miss pudding. Man I miss those days. They seem like they didn't even happen in my lifetime. They seem like I watched them on a tv show or something like that. I have to remind myself that I actually  lived  those days. I was such a nerd in those days (as opposed to nowadays). Did you know I actually had a purple suit jacket I wore to the assembly? Yup, dark purple jacket, black pants, and a matching black and purple tie. Can you imagine? A purple suit jacket! I think if i could go back in time, I would beat myself up for wearing that. The girls must have laughed so hard at me. Oh well. they were ugly anyway. hahah.... And now the assemblies are different. Different people, different country, almost different language (ok almost). But they are still great. The one last year was very nice. It was nice and small, and a bit more personal. I enjoyed it very much. I hope this year will be the same. This summer is going by so fast, soon the assemblies will be over and they will be reviewing what learned in them. I actually wouldn't mind a little cold air. It's been to hot so far, and I'm already ready for the colder season. Maybe it will snow? Maybe not. Who knows though? Weirder things have happened right? So I'm not ruling it out just yet. Maybe tomorrow I will. well I figure i'll put something i wrote on here. I don't mean just ramblings either. I figure I would try to post things that I've written over time. Somethings aren't from the happiest of times, some are. So for the first one, I figure I won't put something really deep or thoughtful on here. But then again, I wanted to put something I really like. So this one is one of those. I one time read a book on a poet named William Blake. He is famous for many poems, but one that he wrote was called "The Tyger." It happens to be one of my favorite poems. In that book it had some comments and reviews from some critics about the poem. Some went into great detail of what they thought Blake was trying to convey by the poem. But one critic that commented differently. He stated that the poem, is in fact what he called "pure poetry." He stated that if the poem had a deeper meaning, then really only Blake would be the one to know what it was. By it being "pure poetry" it might not have any deeper meaning, any special significance, any cultural importance. It might just be thoughts that he had in his head, and he decided to put them down on paper. Those thoughts appealed to me. Usually when I write, I write for a reason, for  something , or  someone . But I found the idea appealing, and realized that I had already written something like that. I had a poem that meant nothing to me. The ironic part is that I had a line in my poem that correlated with Blake's poem, look for it if you know his poem.But my poem, it holds no weight with me, no importance, no significance, no importance. It's just thoughts, words. I remember when I wrote it. It was when I was 17, I was at the computer late one night. I wasn't really thinking about anything important or anyone in particular. But I wrote it. To most it might seem childish, to someone it might not make sense, and others just might thinks it's plain stupid.Others might like it, or just say they do because they dont understand it. And you are all right. Because it's all those things. It's all those things,because I am all those things. I can be stupid, childish, and I can make perfect, and then no sense at all. Like I said, it means nothing to me, and I hope it means nothing for you to. Here it is:    so here we are at the end  not far from where we started  and although the many we did befriend  we ourselves have parted    the many that came  the many that left  they took our crown  and left us a frown    upside down, out of place,  forever lost, without a trace,  fallen down, cut on the knee,  stuck forever in a big tree,    test drove, but never bought,  thrown perfectly, but never caught,  hunched over, with enormous pain,  a highway with only one lane,    sought for, but never found,  a bolt of lightning sent to the ground,  a building, built completely of glass,  a raging storm, that soon will pass,    wind that can move a shopping cart,  a bullet sent straight to the heart,  the hero for the day, once again,  a lazy day spent in the den.    cuddling the one you love, next to the fire,  one these wings, i dare aspire,  alone, besides the company of my cat,  on my thrown is where i sat,    here once more, but not the same,  tired, tired of this ongoing game,  on faith and love it does depend,  and this last line is the end.      hope everyone is doing well wherever they may be. have a good weekend and be careful in whatever you might be doing. Adios!
