Let's just say that despite the fact that we dropped 300 bucks on fireworks, we still got a great deal. The names of them varied from super patriotic (like  urlLink Unamed Retribution ) to downright strange ( urlLink Shagadellic Mojo ). We only spent 100 bucks on our way up there. It was on the second day that we went out and spent another 200. We found this sweet place that was doing 2 for 1 and sometimes 3 for 1 on their fireworks. I told the guy that I wanted him to show me the fireworks that were so awesome, that he'd name his first born after it, and that's when he showed the Jedi. That thing was pretty amazing. Anyway, we bought TONS of fireworks, and all of it was awesome.   We got real smart and built a bon-fire, which we doused with lighter fluid, and shot roman candles at to light. It was awesome until the roman candle fireballs started bouncing back at us. hah. I guess, later on, Dan threw a couple of those huge roles of firecrackers. I'm kind of glad I wasn't around for that.   Work this week has been interesting. We had a  urlLink layoff    on Tuesday. I wasn't incredibly worried, but it still sat in the back of my mind. The chairman was suggesting that a larger number of people would go, but we ended up losing about 10%. It's kind of a bummer to see my company doing poorly. I wanna work harder for them, but you also don't want to feel like your caught up in a sinking ship, I guess. I dunno. We'll see what happens in the future.   Not much else, going on, I guess.  urlLink George  and I hung out tonight. Talked business, at Mexican, then went home. Tomorrow, we're gunna go hang out with my brother,  urlLink Casey , and work on a project of ours (finally).   I'm gunna read soon.... and sleep. word. Night.
