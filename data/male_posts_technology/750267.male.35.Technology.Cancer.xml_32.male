I believe it's even worse in the States where CDs cost C$30 (US$18). So, based on the Canadian prices, we are paying approx. $2 for each track on a CD.  Now, in the world of pop music, you simply can't listen to an entire CD. That is, there are usually only "1 or 2 good songs" on those types of CDs and the rest is filler. Pop music is just like that. This ain't Jazz and it ain't Rock and Roll. So each song really goes for $7 or $10 at the retail level. That's just too much money for 1 song.  "Compilation" CDs are a good deal -- someone has gathered the 15 top hits of the previous year and sells them on a single CD. Of course, compilations are by definition "old" music, so the record companies don't mind this. But consumers don't want to hear "I'm Like a Bird" by Nelly Fortado. That's so 2001, and we've had enough thank you.  Which brings us to file trading. Instead of shelling out $20, you can shell out $0 and get 15 top hits from today. Make your own compilation, for free. This is wrong of course, and the music industry can't continue to exist with so many freeloaders.  So what can we conclude from this simple analysis.... Currently, record companies do not give consumers what they want. Since consumers can easily take what they want, they do. Why don't record companies just try selling what people want to buy, namely: - Make CDs cheaper at retail. How about $9 for an entire CD? - Allow consumers to purchase current songs to make their own compilation? $5 for 15 songs that you can burn to a CD yourself, or download to an MP3 player -- no restrictions. The reason downloaded songs should be cheaper than CDs ($5 vs. $9), and not the same price, is that record companies save the cost of distribution and packaging.  I feel the record companies are partly (mostly) responsible for this mess they're in. I have some sympathy for them, but seriously: it's their own fault for ripping us off for so long. They rip the consumer off, and then rip the artist off, and then have the nerve to cry to us when they feel they are getting ripped off? Ha! Two wrongs don't make a right, but it sure does even the score a little.  I read this month's Wired magazine special, featuring Hilary Rosen of the RIAA. I still don't see the record company side of the issue. How can they justify their user unfriendly pricing and distribution methods? If a record industry exec is reading this, send me an email. I am serious: How can you justify the cost of a CD, and the lack of consumer options when it comes to using that music?  Scott
