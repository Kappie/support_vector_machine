A successful vote would have extended unemployment benefits.  The only Senator that didn't vote?  John F. Kerry who was campaigning in Kentucky....and he had the audicity to blame the Republicans for failing to pass the extension and to do enough about jobs (apparently he didn't read the latest job report?).  It's comical!  He doesn't show up to vote on something that's a cornerstone of his campaign...jobs and jobless benefits...he doesn't show up to vote on something he so passionately (cough, cough, choke) believes in...as if this guy has any passion in his life other than power and money. Remember, he REALLY cares about the little people in the world.  Simply hilarious.
