It's been a little hectic here at work.  Especially today.  Since there were a few things that didn't go as planned I had to do some juggling here and there.  I don't think that it will be any different tomorrow.  Regarding the LAB computer shit, I had a problem with the SHELL32.dll not having some crap as I was installing some Windows Updates.  It just craps out on me when I try to do it.  I mean this is Microsoft shit that I am dealing with.  Granted it's Windows NT, it might be a little tougher considering they stopped supporting the damn thing.  So while I was doing that the user who works on that damn workstation needed the box back so I had to stop what I was doing and work on something else since that machine will be doing some testing till about 4 tomorrow afternoon.  Whatever, I can deal with that crap tomorrow and the next week I guess.  Now with our graphics department I ran into a few snags as well.  First of, the eMac I was working on had a lost password.  It was set to auto-login and the person who set that shit is not with the company anymore.  I had to go make a new user, install some shit, show the current user how to login and move files and all that jazz.  Next, I was going to upgrade OS 9.2.2 to Pather.  That fell through since I had to research a few things regarding disk copy (so that I can make a bootable clone of a MAC machine.  See that's not a problem with Windows machines because of products like Norton Ghost and shit but for Mac I feel like I'm back in freshman year at MSU not knowing a damn thing about anything.  I hate that feeling but it's also that challenge that I can't walk away from.  I suppose I better do it considering I get paid to do this sort of shit (read="thinking").  Hmm, Vicki just called.  She wanted to go to the Cubs game.  No tickets though, she was just going to go there with her boyfriend and walk around and buy scalped tix.  I'm not about to do that.  I got a long day ahead of me tomorrow and I will probably get freakin wasted if I went.  Not to mention driving back that same night all half drunk and shit.  I got tomorrow and Saturday for that.  Speaking of which, party this weekend.  Chicago Suburbs, North Beach, Downer's Grove.  Say you are there for Gonzo's party and you get in for free from 9-11 and you get a wristband and a cup for free drinks from 10-11.  Should be a good time.  Tomorrow is Fragging Friday.  he whatever, it helps me save money and I don't have to drive drunk and all that shit.  I just want to go home.  Till tomorrow.  Holla Holla
