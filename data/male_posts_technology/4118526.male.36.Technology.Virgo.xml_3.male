Please tell them the story about the bald frog with the wig:  (My response for too long for the answer box so here it is.)  There once was a bald frog with a wig who lived in the bog.  He was a very vain frog.  Hopping around from log to log.  He looked at himself in the mirror every day.  "I am the most handsome frog in the entire bog," he would say.  "Nay Say," said another frog one day.  "I am the most handsome frog in the bog."  He then jumped onto the same log as the frog of the bog.  "I am the most handsome frog anyone has ever seen.  Call up all your friends and you will see what I mean."  It was then the handsome frog of the bog realized he had no friends at all.  And from the log he did fall.  Never to be seen in the bog again.  The End
