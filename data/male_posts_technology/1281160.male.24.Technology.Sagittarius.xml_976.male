Its up to him to spend his money appropriately for the personal/human welfare coz its obvious that he cannot carry to his funeral.  Kishore, do you think those persons who donated thousands for the Ekadasi festival will provide the same to a NGO activity??? Certainly not... But those who have collected in the name of Ekadasi, Can spent the entire amount for NGO activity?... it also cant be, coz they have their own liabilities / willingness... so they have to be spend towards what its meant (What they mean) for... Even by spending in decorations also; they have given oppors to hundreds of people's time / work.  If we keep on questioning there is no end for it.  Its upto you in deciding how u spend your money.   Note:     Millions   stands for more than your basic need... But for some, basic need may be "Mercedes E-Class" No body cant question the same!!, unless he goes against from law for earning such an amount.
