       Unease in lower abdomen, as if having diarrhea 

    

     

 

 

 I haven't eaten much today.  I've had this ill feeling in my lower abdomen all day as if I were about to have diarrhea, but I haven't had it.  It is a hard feeling to describe.  There isn't any pain and hardly any gurgling, belching, or gas.  Its just a feeling like a tingle, and a clear awareness of my intestines, that I should not be aware of at all.  Its an anxious feeling, as if my intestines are expecting something that never comes.  A person could go mad from these things. 

 As is my usual habit when I'm not feeling well, I watched a movie tonight.   urlLink The Butterfly Effect .  Not too bad actually, but not a blockbuster.  It was nice to see Ashton Kutcher in a role where he doesn't say "dude" and I think that was the whole point of this film. 

 I've just eaten a bologna sandwich at quarter to 11 at night and the belching is kicking in.  At least it's distracting me from my intestines. 

  Update:  Wow that was fast.  It's 11:04.  I just finished this post and had half a brownie and the nausea is kicking in.  My stomach muscles are cramping down about every 10 seconds as something inside is doing terrible things.  I know that I have to eat to survive, but when I get punished like this for it I never want to eat again.
