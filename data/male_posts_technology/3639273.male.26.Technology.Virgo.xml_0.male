I ready to take on the world. I feel so energized with that which God has given me. I want to be a good steward of it. I will makes sure that I stay in the Vine. John 15. That is what this week will be about. Hopefully from it will grow habit. I pray that it will. I have energy grace and love to do the things I need to do to be a good father, a good husband and a good leader primarily. Thank you again father and thank you for those who are praying for me. We all need a little prayer sometimes.   I am truly Bursting from the inside out with the Joy of the Lord and his Plans.
