I bet he wouldn't get mugged then.   o.O LOL!  ...found in  http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/05/30/2252233=thread=126=137=172 (a discussion about what geeks can do to help protect themselves and their valuables from muggers)  more comments on the topic:   In the UK, you are not allowed to own a gun, let alone carry one. Not even the cops carry fireamrs.  HALT! Or I'll be forced to yell HALT again, but louder!    --------------------------------------------------    That's not too far off from what I do. It's not jock-style, but it works for me.  I'm 6'2" tall, I have long black hair, a bullring style nose ring, a scuffed black leather jacket, a motorcycle and a visible knife clipped to my pocket.  I don't dress like I have money, and if I have to walk through a bad neighborhood, I make sure I look angry. My friends and I can walk past a gang, and they tend to part like the Red Sea.  I'm the scariest looking sysadmin I've seen in corporate america.     --------------------------------------------------    I have a friend that real life role plays. He was dressed up in his medieval armor and cloak garb waiting at a train station one day. A mugger came up to him with a 4 inch knife and said "give me your wallet". My mate stared him in the face and moved his cloak to reveal a 30 inch long sword. "I see your 4 and raise you 26". Should have seen him run.    --------------------------------------------------    I had a mugging problem when I was in San Francisco. Got mugged twice before I realized that muggers are very predictable. They like their targets to be predictable as well. I found that wearing a dirty shrunken wool jacket I got from goodwill, carrying extra bags, and yelling at people that wearen't there was a great way to avoid getting mugged.
