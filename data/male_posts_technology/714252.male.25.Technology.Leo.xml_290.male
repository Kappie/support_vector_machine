Made me think about my own relationship with my dad in a way I hadn't looked at it before and I realised that is a lot of what drives me too.  I know my father loves me.. I amn't really really certain that he is proud of me, it's something that is a lot less certain.. Everyones parents loves them (you included bubbs, much as you'd hate to admit it) but there is no built in thing that means a parent will be proud of them..  Anyway, Just a random mind dump. Straight from my head to the internet.
