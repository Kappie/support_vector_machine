She is a funny joker, the way she describes incident or tell me the news is so funny, hilarious. I miss her, I miss her a lot. What is more to say about her? I'm in love with her, I think.   Love is complicated, freaky, frightening,.. And in my age it's not a joke anymore, there are more responsibilities than before. I just hope, for my sake and hers, that i'm on the right path in this junction.  I think i made more complicated choices and decision before in my life, most of them were wrong of course and i've failed many times to succeed?! But now, for the first time in my life, i have a good feeling about a choice that i made (i.e: us, me and Ruba), I uhh.. It.. I.. It feels good.  Doubts, Uncertainty, insecurity, Fears,..    Is that what love is all about?!
