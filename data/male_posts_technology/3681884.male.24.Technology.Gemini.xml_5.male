Now, I use to watch The Daily Show... daily--that is, until I got rid of my satellite dish.  I loved it the show.  It's hilarious.  Do they have a liberal slant?  Well, as I pointed out to Dr. Givens, most of hollywood is liberal.  It's disgusting.  But they do tend to just make fun of whoever is in the news, in office, or just screwing up in general.  Right now, that's GeeDubya.  Dr. Givens contends that the "liberal fake media" makes jokes at the expense of legitimate concerns and truth.  This is true.  It wouldn't be funny if were about something trivial.  But is this a problem?  I don't think so.  It should be taken as a joke and nothing more.  It's not like The Daily Show is a legitimate news source.
