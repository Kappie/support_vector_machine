They're super aggressive, though, and the big one keeps chasing the little one around.  Luckily, the small one is pretty fast, and the big one is REALLY FUCKING DUMB.  The small one will just go through a hole in the rocks, and then the big one can't fit, and will spend like five minutes looking for the small one, who hasn't moved at all.  Wes, what kind of fish do you have in your tank?  And do your plecos poo up a storm, or is it just because there's so much algae in my tank, and he's feasting?  Tell us a tale of your tank, and then I'll tell you all about mine!  I'm totally geeking over this fish thing... I may be buying a little 10 gallon tank just as a hospital tank in case any of my fish get sick.  I knew you'd like that binary joke...  You know, every time you leave town on a trip, you should regale us at this site of a story from the road.  Like the time you were so bored you videotaped yourself taking a bath, and somehow had no nudity throughout the course of the video... or so we're led to believe.
