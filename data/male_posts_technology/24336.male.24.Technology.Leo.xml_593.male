I got a bit curious as to what my insurance rates would have been had I purchased a different car.  I used Progressive's online quote service and got some interesting numbers.   Note, the quote I got for my car was $1,439 while in all reality I pay about half of that.  For comparison purposes, I'm going to take $700 from each of the numbers I got.  That should be more realistic:

2003 Nissan 350z
