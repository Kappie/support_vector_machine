If i remembered correctly, she is suppose to watch this with her bf? Ya, since her bf isn't coming back anymore, and her friends probably watched it already, i just accompanied her to fulfil her wish.   I know... this is the substitutional effect but i just don't feel good telling her to get lost. As usual, she rejected me flat tonight. As usual, i felt i suck.. Guess, it will really take a miracle to take place if she is to accept me? *lol*  Oh well, i don't feel quite good about almost everything. Hap, this girl is special. I can tell myself countless times to forget her. I can get confused with other girls, but no matter what happened, i never seems to get away from her or get tired of her. Of coz' that doesn't mean that she should accept me..  God.. if you dun intend to give me this girl, please make me forget that i was ever in love with her... i really appreciate your kindness...  Broken heart, DJ
