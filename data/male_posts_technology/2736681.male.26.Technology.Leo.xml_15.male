In this case, this has led to the use of the term Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) for what I have always understood MDA to be: systems composed of models linked together by model transformations. I had a quick read of the MDA guide from OMG, but its 60 pages long, and its hard to get a good impression. I suspect that if you put an 'MDE' system in front of most OMG people, they would still call it MDA. As for me, I'm getting to the point where I don't really care, but intend to keep using MDA for what  I  think it means.
