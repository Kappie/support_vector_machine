Something interesting from eric today. there could reallie be something wrong with my SQL query. wrong as in, the performance is not good. for the 1st time, i heard tat there is actually a proper arrangement of which table come first and which come 2nd..... and if i were to put the table in the other way round, it would perform better.....  now..... is it because of this tat cause the problem? okie, maybe it does have performance issue.. but i'm sure it can't crash a server....  come to tink of it.... if the server is so easily crashable, isn't it something not good?
