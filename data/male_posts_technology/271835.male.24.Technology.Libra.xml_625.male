It's full of transfer gossip like this interesting(?) snippet: ?rodkowy obro?ca Bordeaux Marco Caneira znalaz? si? w orbicie zainteresowa? dzia?aczy Newcastle. Woo? Yay? Probably? New Links will of course provide translation on request via the multilingual ILuvNufc who has picked up a smattering of Polish during his exhaustive trawls of Eastern European sites whilst looking for Blink 182 bootlegs.  Of more interest to the non Polish speakers here may be the  urlLink goal videos  and  urlLink image  gallery.  Minor quibble here. They also have a  urlLink Legends  page, or Legendy as we cosmopolitan European Unionists might say, which has some real toon legends. And Barry Venison. Now don't get me wrong I liked Bad Back Bazzer a lot but he's not really a legend is he? Or did I miss something? He's just not in the same League as God, Wor Jackie, KK, Pedro, Shack, Wyn the Leap, Gazza, Sausage Packer and quite a few more. Maybe he got extra points for his lovely hair and waistcoats? ;)
