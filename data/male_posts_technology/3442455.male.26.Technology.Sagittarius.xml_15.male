However, if you are over 60 and skinny and you happen to be wearing a tucked in white vneck tshirt with red suspenders and a slick sport jacket in 80 degree weather then you are totally awesome in my book.  Today I am wearing my standard black trou with white shirt, sleeves rolled above me elbows, red striped hilfiger tie and black thrift store shoes caked in mud from my cousins wedding.  Oh yeah and I shaved today.
