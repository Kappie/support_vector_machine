But I'm finding that the events of the day compel me to speak up, and I haven't had enough time to pull together something longer and more fully fleshed out. I'll probably end up interspersing shorter topical items (like this one) with occasional longer, more developed essays in between. We'll see how it goes, I guess.]   Is it just me, or did George W. Bush tip his hand regarding his true priority in the war in Iraq? In the final question at his news conference today, Bush was asked about "the lack of proper planning" the administration had done for securing Iraq following the invasion. He indicated that, yes, "we had a plan in place." (Well, I certainly hope so!)  And what was the very first example Bush cited as an example of that plan's "success?" That the flow of oil was not disrupted. The top thing on Bush's mind, it seems, had nothing to do with securing the WMDs, the containment or eradication of terrorist elements, or any sort of humanitarian relief. No, as many have suspected all along, it really was all about the oil.  Sure, he went on to mention other aspects of his so-called plan (such as keeping the Iraqi people from going hungry), as he continued with his answer. But the fact that oil was foremost in his mind as he first formulated his response to the question speaks volumes about this administration's true objectives and motivations.
