 So I'm back from Indianapolis, slightly sun-burned but no less for wear.  The  urlLink US Grand Prix  was, as its name suggests, grand.  Here are some of the highlights.
 
 First of all, this race seems to get more run-down every year I attend.  My Dad picked up on this as well.  We've been to this race all five years that it's been held in Indianapolis.  Every year, the races are great, but we've noticed a decline in the team merchandise that's sold in the track's infield area.  Personally, I think this trend could be caused by one of two things.  Either Tony George is charging the teams too much to bring their stuff in or it's simply not cost effective to haul all their sideshows with them across the pond.  Personally, I miss seeing all the high-end  urlLink BMWs  and  urlLink Mercedes .  The  urlLink West McLaren Mercedes  team didn't even show up this year.  
 
 One highlight of the weekend was getting a chance to ride a  urlLink Segway .  After signing my life away in case of a freak accident (and so that they can get a telemarketer to call me every night at dinner time), they let me hop on one of these things for a spin.  If you don't know, Segways are supposed to revolutionize modern urban travel.  Personally, I think they're just a way to get urbanites to join in the American obesity craze.  It took some time to get my balance on it, but after three laps around the course I had the hang of it.  It's a fun toy, but nothing to replace my standard bipedal form of locomotion.
 
 The race itself was pretty exciting.  Ferrari finished one-two again, with Michael Schumacher taking the checkered flag.  Only eight of the starting twenty cars actually finished the race.  
 
 This was the first year with a significant number of wrecks.  I'm quite disappointed in how the wrecks were handled by the track officials.  There was a huge crash on turn one that knocked four cars out of the race and littered the track with carbon fiber debris.  F1 is known for red flagging (stopping) races to clean this type of mess up.  We learned why that's such a good idea in this race.
 
 After three or four laps with a safety car governing the pace, they let the field race again.  On his first lap after the caution Fernando Alonso decided to turn left instead of right at the end of the straight.  This would have been fine had there not been a wall immediately to his left.  Why did he turn into a wall, you ask?  He had no choice after his right rear tire went flat from track debris.  This wreck left even more debris on the track that remained there for a few laps.
 
 A few laps after Alonso's wreck, Ralf Schumacher hit the wall at full speed (around 200 MPH) after suffering a sudden flat tire.  Thankfully, he hit back first, resulting in a bruised back and a concussion.  I say thankfully because his injuries would have been very severe had he hit nose first.  He easily could have died.
 
 Now, as it turns out, both wrecks were caused by flat tires.  Flat tires that were almost certainly caused by running over carbon fiber that was left on the track.  Flat tires that could have been prevented if the race had been stopped to clean up the mess left from the first wreck.  I'm just glad Ralf was not more seriously hurt, or the  urlLink FIA  would have a lot of explaining to do this week.
