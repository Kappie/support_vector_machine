As I’m sitting here on the plane headed to Kuwait, I’m thinking to myself “did last week even happen?”  So let me break it down for you. First of all this was a weird week for CRC (Conus Replacement Center). CRC is where all civilians and military process to go to the Middle East. Normal processing is done in a 6 days time frame, but because of the 4th of July holiday we were short one day. Processing even on a 6-day schedule is tough but to crunch it down to 5 is somewhat insane (especially for civilians).  CRC gives you a battery of testing (medical  dental) and training (i.e. first aid, nuclear, biological and chemical and a host of others) in order to prepare you for the theatre. For military it’s not too bad as majority of them have much of this testing done prior to processing. For the civilians it’s a little different. If you don’t have some the medical or if you have dental problems you have to make arrangements yourself to take care of any these issues. Fortunately for us, ITT employees, we have a liaison that know his, excuse my language, S#%T (you can fill in the blanks). He helped us every step of the way. I call him our guardian angel, his name is Don. If it were not for him we would have been lost and stuck at Fort Bliss for another week. Not that that’s a bad thing but you see some of the guys that get left back for a week and they look like lost souls without a purpose. They don’t have to do anything but clear up their issues and wait for the next plane out which is once a week. The bottom line is you want to be validated at the end of the week for deployment to the Middle East.  So except for our first day there, which was the 4th, everyday began at O’dark something. Meaning we were up and on the move to some appointment before the sun came up. I didn’t have too much of a problem with this as I know this is the military way. What makes it crazy is we were mostly on the go all day nonstop until the sun was about to set. The medical and dental appointments weren’t bad but trying to sit through briefings (particularly when the instructor were like Ben Stein) made the challenge of staying in this reality ever so difficult. A couple of times I felt like just getting up from the briefing and going back to the dorm to sleep.  Then there’s the immunization shots. Not very fun but not as bad as I thought. The anthrax and typhoid shots were the most painful later on (about three days). The smallpox vaccine didn’t hurt but was irritating. So picture this, one arm felt as though your big brother gave you a charlie horse everyday and the other felt like you wanted to scratch it off. Quite a yen  yang effect going on there. But you think that all this stuff in the long run will save your life so you do it without hesitation or regret.  So to sum it all up we had very limited time to ourselves. I spent some of that time either calling my sweetie (I love you) or going to the PX (Post Exchange) getting last minute item because some guy who was just over there said you can’t leave without it or life will cease to exist because you’ll be so miserable. I don’t think it’s that extreme but I guess it’s better to be safe than sorry and the suckers we were we usually fell for most of those stories.
