I thought I would hold it off. But I have so many Spotlights I wish to get posted, I had to start early. I figure I can post each one on the weekend, which means I can post next week's the weekend before, so I shouldn't miss a week at all.   Bonus!   The start to the  Online Comic Weekly Spotlight  is a personal favorite of mine, and I've been waiting for the opportunity to let it shine!  So, don't delay:  urlLink go over to the Evil Network Comics site and check it out!   Go now!
