Now, they didn't all have the same kind of water, but they all had water.  Well, not all of them, but most of them.  As the world's population grows and the fresh water supply dwindles in both supply and quality, bottled water has become a mega industry.  Most every corner store sells some form of it, as do drug stores, coffee shops, etc.  So... why not open a water bar?  You could have all the different brands at reasonable prices, to go or to drink inside.  It could be set up like a wine tasting place, with different comments for the different brands and genres of water; kind of a water conneusuer joint.  Obviously, you would also need to make it a place where people want to go for their water all year round, not just on hot days, so your selection would have to include specialties as well.    If one set such a business up in the proper place (I'm thinking some place full of both yuppies and beaches/outdoor activities), it would be a winner for a period of time.  HEck, you might even create a trend...   something to think about...
