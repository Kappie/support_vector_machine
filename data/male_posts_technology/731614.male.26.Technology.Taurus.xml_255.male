You show people the need to rethink their assumptions, and confront them on everything from how they think to where they  build their houses. You might be one of the greatest people of all time. You'd be recognized as such if you weren't always talking about talking rabbits.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .
