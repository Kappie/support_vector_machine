And to be honest, he drove better than I did the first time I tried PGR.  Let me rewind a bit.  Friday afternoon, we were preparing to head to my father's house for the weekend.  We packed up everything and I snuck the XBox into the back of the van, telling my wife that I had brought it after we were an hour down the road.  I didn't unpack it until Saturday night, as a way of introducing it to my dad.  He tried a bit of RSC2, and I did a challenge.  That was pretty much it, with the exception that I did run the XBox a bit on Sunday night, finally finishing off the Amateur Career with a perfect score.  Oh, and I started the Pro Career, but just the first challenge.  DaftApeth and OrpheusSail played Full Spectrum Warrior (FSW) for an extended period of time on Saturday.  They were apparently very impressed with it.  It is on my "to get" list, but I'm in no hurry.
