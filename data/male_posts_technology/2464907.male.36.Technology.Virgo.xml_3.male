In mobility hungry Japan, the Sony HMP is sure to be a big hit.  The HMP does everything right. It sports a cool Sony chassis, built around the 3.5" TFT. The symmetric navigation-button layout includes a touch-sensitive slide, and can be operated in left- or right- hand mode (by flipping the HMP). For audio, it supports MP3. (This is definitively better than Sony's other music player, which requires MP3s to be converted to a proprietary ATRAC format.) The 20gb HDD stores about 300 hours of music. For video, it supports MPEG2 and MPEG4. You can even play back your videos on a TV, since there's integrated AV out.  If you've stored photos on the HMP, you can view their thumbnails, or view them as a slideshow. The HMP is recognized as a plug-n-play HDD under Windows and supports USB 2.0 for very fast data transfer. So, you can use it as an external HDD as well.
