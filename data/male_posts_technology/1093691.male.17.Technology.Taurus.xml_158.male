Perhaps get it highlighted and than the sides a bit shorter than the top then you can do a bit of a mohegan (sp?), a bit like Joe Armfeild, perhaps.   I had the worst night last night. I woke up at midnight because Dave text me damm him!!! 4am and 6am. I ended up getting up this morning at 8.30am. Darn it. If we were at school today I would not be going in I tells ya. I have a bloody sore throat, a stuffy erughy nose, stuffed ears (everything is muffled) and I am cream-crackered (knackered). Argh, I hate bing ill but I am going out today anyway. Lets hope I don't cough or anything too loudly in the theatre. LOL. Have a fun academic review day everyone.
