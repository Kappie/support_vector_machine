Since I can't use my modem unless I want to get raped on the phone bill here, I connect at a measly 19.2 kbs using a special USB connection to my cell phone (free after 9 PM, hehe)... but it somehow does the trick for me.  I'm excited because I just received the pictures from my sister's 25th birthday night.  Feast on the pictures:     These are my little sisters. They rock.   Kristen  is on the left and  Marisa  (the b-day girl) is on the right.      Marisa  and  Kristen  with my cousins  Jessica  (all the way to the left) and  Melissa  (all the way to the right)     Me with  my sisters      Me with my my best friend  Warren  (we've been close friends since we were 5) and Melissa's boyfriend  Alex ...     ...and let's not forget this  beautiful sexy girl  I had fun dancing with (in the light blue below), hehe... too bad she had a boyfriend :(  man, she was cool.        The most interesting thing was that we almost got into a fist-fight with the bouncers of the place due to them just being dick-heads to our whole group. They were on a power trip... or maybe they were all high - who knows. I don't think any of us will ever be going back to that place again. It was a really fun night that just didn't end well.  Actually, the drive home was really fun!  Anyways, I want to say more, but I am so tired and this is taking long because I'm still learning the capabilities of this blogging tool.
