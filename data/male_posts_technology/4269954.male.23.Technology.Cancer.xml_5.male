CAI on the other hand was pretty stagnant today.  I looked more into it, and the difference between HAR and CAI is that CAI's main percentage gains appeared in the before-market hours.  HAR had to before-market trading, so it's gains from it's upgrade in status were throughout the day.  CAI did waver within about 1% of its open price, but I got in a little too late.  We'll just have to stick it out and wait until it sells for it's 1%.  For now, I cannot update my total balance, because I don't want to "estimate" the equity that I have in outstanding stock, so I'll only provide you with the statistics of the day...   Today's Percentage Gain On Investments: 1.4% (HAR only)   -Bo
