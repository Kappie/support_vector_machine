We had a round of very disgusting shooters in the Sports Bar then ran around to B Bar. I didn't notice before but B Bar has a number you can text and your messages appear on a big plasma screen behind the bar. You can imagine the fun we had with this.. accusations of leather chaps wearing and the words like 'blow job' were flashing up all over the place. Dirty buggers.  So after that we went around to Chicago (damn that place depresses me SO much.. WHY do I always end up there??) and scooted around to Liquid at about 11. It's about this time that things are a little hazy, but I remember dancing on a stage that has appeared on the dancefloor (been a while since I did that..), Custard turning up with Hannah and Fyona serving me Tequila. That's about it..  Alex: Please tell me that cruel Chinese lady isn't going to wack that furry marmot thing with the mallet? Nooooooooo :(  The only reason to watch RI:SE before going to work - the enormously chested Zora Suleman!  urlLink [linky 1]     urlLink [linky 2]      Off for a Berocca now to ease my pickled brain.  P.S.  Bought a David Blaine doll the other day. Can't get the fucker out of the box.
