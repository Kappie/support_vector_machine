I figure 5 MB is good enough for most users in an office environment, as long as they are maintaining their mailboxes correctly.  There was much weeping and gnashing of teeth, but I think most everyone here understands the need for reducing mailbox sizes, thereby reducing stress on the server.  I have one person, though, who (1) thinks he is the smartest individual on earth, (2) thinks it should be the sustaining job (i.e., my job) to "fix" the e-mail problem for him, and (3) sends me angry messages every day asking me to fix it for him.  He's a good guy, so I will "fix" it while trying to educate him a little.  In an office of 45 people, you can't really be the Asshole-IT guy, because everyone still knows you.  I imagine it is easier being a tyrant in a larger office (100+) when most people don't know you, and you can effectively hide behind the scenes and have people do your dirty work for you.  ===  We had the big company picnic and campout in the redwoods this weekend.  It went pretty well, no injuries or arrests, no brawls, only limited drunken debauchery (and I missed that part), and a few Sasquatch sightings.  Oh, that was just Dennis.  I was in charge of breakfast Sunday morning, and it was excellent.  Saturdays lunch-dinner was good - shitloads of bbq tri-tip and potluck side dishes and desserts.  The people who stayed overnight included the potheads and the lushes, and me and family, and one other couple (who think their dogs are their kids, which bugs the crap out of me).  Ordinarily I hate these functions, but I think I am starting to act in a more genuine way as far as being comfortable and secure as myself, whoever that is, instead of being my "Work Character" for everyone.  I was worried a little - see my earlier post.  In fact I never did what I considered:    ...when the fun is over I will just collapse into the dust and drool a lot, then wake up with dirt caked onto my face...   A few other people did just that, however.  Daniel got to play Frisbee (oh excuse me, DISC) and volleyball with the adults, and he did just fine.  He is becoming a big kid now.  Nikki, who was mad at her bike for several months (after learning to ride w/o training wheels), started riding again with very little effort.
