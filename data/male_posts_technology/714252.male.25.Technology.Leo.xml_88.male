Poor Jonny must be as confused as fuck.. will have to bring him up to speed tonight when I get home :)  Anyway.. I think for the sake of me sanity\health I may have to try and cut back a bit on the old gurls.. I am just digging myself a kind of bottomless pit that I will never be able to get back out of.. (And what's worse it may fuck with my Salsa!) I hate all this crappy side of things.. I was looking for a bit of fun and instead I am in the middle of a potential girly armageddon.  Anywho, I am absolutely wrecked today.. The weekend was also breaking point for me.. I can normally handle being out every night but I think a combo of stress over various female related issues and exhaustion from dancin and not sleepin have drained the reserve power and left me in need of a serious recharge.. No all I have to do is find the time to recharge between trying to start my own business and unravel the nightmarish double-hamerlock that is my "love" life..  hehe.. "love" life.. I wish..
