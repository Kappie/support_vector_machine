A computer breaks, ask Tim, the internet goes down, ask Tim. There's a pregnant lady giving birth in the lobby, ask tim. :)  hehehe, OK so the damn thing stopped again. Windows update sucks, when it gets stuck. And another thing, we lose internet connectivity here, way too damn much. Like at least once a week now.  FUCKER, it got stuck at 964, AGAIN!!!!  Now, I'm a grumpy grape. :(
