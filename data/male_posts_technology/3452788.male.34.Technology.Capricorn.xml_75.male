       
      it's tomorrow on the edge of the continent. the silent moon radiates its cold light, highlighting silver ripples on the resting ocean. the shoreline murmurs to me like a lover in its sleep.  kids sleeping, dreaming of horses, games,  the future like an empty book without words, waiting; parents gladly worry about the details to protect their kids for just one more day.   the water doesn't ask how i feel, what i know, what i'm proud of, what i wish i could leave behind. the silver, shimmering water promises eternity, no cares, no worries, no expectations.   sleep eludes my eyes, for a while, shyly waiting as my mind lets go of the disappointments of another hour, another year, another step closer to letting dreams go (for expediency's sake)   i hear my resting lover urging me closer but my heart feels the cold lie in the warm whispers i hear her promise, but i fear the eternity of a watery tomb, crushing, silent, black.   tonight, once more, i choose the compromise of life over the cold depths of her embrace; i will see the sun once more.  but every night the choice is getting harder, her promise just a little more enticing, eternity not so long, the depths not so dark.   how long will i wait to answer her call? tomorrow, will i go to my cold lover's heart? The silent moon will show me the way.
