DOH - he was kidnapped and taken to Ireland, and that is when his faith became real. - he had a burning desire and passion for the Irish. - consecrated no fewer than 350 bishops (I take that to mean that he discipled them or something like that...)  I also heard that legend has it that he personally baptized about 10,000 people... Wow.
