Simple gold plated Watches from Titan. From the Day one since i joined this job, i never sent them even a single penny and so i thought let me get something special for them atleast in the sake of my wedding. I dont know what would be my parent's reaction, though i have told my dad before hand, its my Mom's words which i think i will have to face. so i am planning to release the gift only on the day of my wedding so that they cant tell me anything!  Ok guys i will also upload the route map to the Wedding hall on to our groups file section. So u can refer that for further details. bye for now
