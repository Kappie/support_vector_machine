One thing about the future however, I don't want to know what happens. I'm thoroughly content to live each day at a time, see naturally what the Lord has planned in our lives. We leave Wednesday for Ft. Benning. Everyone is pretty upbeat  encouraged it would appear. The circumstances that have lead us to stick around one extra day may pay off in the long run. We get that much more time to get used to each other b4 we depart together.   I've been so sleepy lately tho...so drowsy, but it will pass in time. My hours b4 mobilization were significantly different than the ones we're keeping now. I have yet to talk to my lil mama Nikki tonite. For the 1st time in a minute, I logged on and she wasn't here. That girl is so sexy tho...yal just have no idea. She has this naturally entrancing expression on her face...just makes u wanna eat her alive lol! Awwwwwww :-) well, I guess I can fantasize all I want 'cause there's a strong chance I won't get to see her even when my unit marches near her backyard. There's a lot of talk circulating around that we'll be training, packing  sleeping the whole time so we won't have the chance to leave post or have visitation...dirty rumors...  Anyways, i've got some work to handle so i'll holla!
