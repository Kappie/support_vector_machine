So to watch the Crew run roughshod over such a team (two goals by Edson Buddle with assists by Brian McBride and a goal off a flubbed DAU free kick by Kyle Martino) was pure bliss for me.     DAU had a one-goal aggregate lead going into this game based on a similar game in Panama and were obviously coming out to bunker in and not let anyone score.  So... you'd think that when the Crew tied it up, they'd stop bunkering, wouldn't you?     Nope.  This team was an embarrassment to the country of Panama.  The fact that we lost down there should be (and was, according to Buddle) embarrassing to the Crew, because Deportivo Arabe Unido was simply a bad team.  They had some good players, and it's a shame they play the way they did, because they could have been really good.  But instead they flopped around like a salmon on the shore of the Columbia River, waiting to be eaten by a bear.  And that bear was Columbus.
