I guess that explains why my entries are usually pretty short  I've not much to say.  I had a pretty good day today - makes a change really.  A good mate of mine was home for the day (he works at a hospital a good distance away), so we just chilled out this afternoon which was cool - it reminded me of what we used to do all the time until fairly recently.  I really enjoyed that.  Then went to see a couple, who I'd been best man for.  I really like hanging out with them too, they are really good mates. We went to the cinema to see spiderman 2 (which I thought was rubbish), and then hung out  had a laugh at their apartment for a while.  Anyway, all in all a pretty class day. ...I wonder does anyone ever read this? I guess I could put a counting script on, but I've given up on web development. Anyway, talking rubbish again.
