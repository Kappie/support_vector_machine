One journeyed towards present-day Iran, another towards Europe, and through Afghanistan.  Those Aryans who settled in Punjab became a very happy and prosperous people. They organized themselves around a caste syatem that described four specific functions of the community. The Kshatriyas of that system were the protectors of the land. However, in peace time many of their members framed the land and raised cattle.  These people, named Kurmi Kshatriyas, eventually migrated to the fertile land of Ganga and Jamuna, eventually reaching Bihar and Bengal. From 600 BC to 200 BC, the kings of Iran and Greece repeatedly attacked Punjab, forcing most of the Kurmi Kshatriyas (also known as the Kurmis) to flee even further south to Gujarat in Vadnagar and Charator in the Kheda district. Around 1400 AD, the ruler of Gujarat granted the uncultivated land of petland Talukas to the Kurmis as their new home.  The hard working Kurmis developed the land quickly. To maintain a record of the annual crops on each Pat ( a parcel of land) the ruler appointed a record keeper known as the Patlik. This name was later shortened to patel. There are several sub-castes within the Kurmi communities. Bhumihar Brahmins are land-owning Brahmins and they are different from brahmin that live from donations. Because of vast areas of land belong to bhumihar the kurmi work on some or part of the bhumihar land for a wage. The Kurmi, Kanbi, Patel, Matya etc of Gujarat probably followed the various land-owning Brahmin castes that went to Gujarat and other places to th south of the Vindya mountains a long time in the past.  The Kurmi's of Bihar are the same genetic stock as the various Kanbi Patel castes in Gujarat excluding the Koli Patels.   Kurmi's constitute around 1.4% of the Indian population.  Kurmi word has been derived from "Krish Dhatu" of Sanskrit.From history Kurmi are agrarian , thats is the meaning of word Kurmi.
