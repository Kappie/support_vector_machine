Speaking of Commodore, and Awesome. Check out  Machinae Supremacy  is a band with a huge download section, and one of the first (or only?) bands to make SiD Metal. That being hard (metal) rock being played along with Commodore 64 SiD Chips. I need to learn how to program my Commodore to play music, all I ever did with it was some symphony out of a book (which of course I quickly put on a disk... which I have since lost).  My days during the week are pretty bland. I get up in the morning (with a bit of trouble recently, I need to sleep more) and go to work... there I do stuff, and sit at my desk, and do stuff there, and then at like 4:30 I go home. Once there I pretty much do the same thing I did at work. It may sound boring, and at times it is, but really I'd be bored just sitting at home all day anyway (and hey, I'm getting payed for this).  Tomorrow Armaan is having a party somtime, I'm not sure when or where (though I'd assume his house). It's likely that I'll take the bus to hart road and walk up to his house from (pretty close to) Adri's, which will be fun and relaxing, and also very warm if weather holds out the way it's been (Man, Sarah must be loving it over in Hawaii... and also getting really burnt).  I've discovered the niceness of headphones at work. I can rock to music off the laptop (which has far superior sound to the PDA) and still umm... "work".  As much as I talk about not working at work, usually I do end up with quite a bit to do. Like the other day I had to change a file in every computer... thankfully I can do that over the network, but it was still tedious. Well, back to my IM's... hehe.
