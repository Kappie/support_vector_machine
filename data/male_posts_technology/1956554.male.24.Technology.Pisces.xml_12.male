Is this a mistake ?  or is this a masterstroke from Google. When I heard for the first time about this 1 GB mail service from Google, I thought, they could actually make it “unlimited space” since very few people will even use up 1GB. Moreover, if someone really wants to upload 10GB, then he will just open 10 different accounts. Lets wait to get confirmation over this.
