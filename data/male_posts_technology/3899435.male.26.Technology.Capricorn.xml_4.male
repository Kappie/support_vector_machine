I have always found it hard to distinguish each of theese terms from its predessecor or its the successor.  Mythology means story telling or relating to myths of people and tradition. Most of stories deal with gods like Ramayana, Iliad,etc. These stories also came up various assumptions or conclusions on various natural phenomenon, god, heaven, etc. Then came the so called philosophers from ancient greek and questioned everything which was part of the myths.  What the philosophers were seeking were a "rational reasoning" of what that myth-tellers were assuming. Philosophy refers to "love of wisdom", it mostly deals with the rational understanding of abstract concepts like ethics,truth, goodness,etc. There were some philosophers who tried to explain natural phenomenon. It is mostly the greek philosophy which deals with the "art of reasoning". The vendanta (or the culmination of vedas) does not have an dialectic approach. It does not give answers so you cant question them. The fundemental aspect of the vedantas indicates "walking the path is different from knowing the path", from  matrix.     Science came up with "system of knowledge" through which most of the natural phenomenon can be explained. The system explains and also predicts various natural phenomenons. There are still various areas in which science is not able to explain what we oberseve. The fundementals of science are mostly from the rational, dialectical philosophers of the west. Sceintists like galileo, einstein, bohr,etc are as equal philosophers as they being scientists. The "relativity" theory which was given a recent explanation by einstein has been a very interesting theory for the myth tellers and the philosophers. However galileo was among the first people to talk about relativity when he endorsed the copernican theory of the universe.  Technology is mostly based on the applied areas of fundemental sciences. Technology is nowadays the the specialized area of science. Each person has a specialized area of specialization. Science was for much wide-spread audience but technology is for a relatively few people to understand. This has been one of the side effects of the enormuos growth of the of knowledge.  Mythology, philosophy, science  technology are all "belief systems" which started out to explain people on "what is life? understanding its purpose?". By the time it reacched the "science  technology" phase an entirely new materialistic system was built and most of the people forget about the fundemental questions. The new meterialistic system is growing very fast and it has been said that "knowledge" is growing. But for all we know knowledge is infinite and fact is a myth.
