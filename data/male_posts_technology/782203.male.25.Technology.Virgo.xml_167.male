Spend the most of my morning doing the Excel thing from work ....still struggling with it.Have to go down to the library tommorow and borrow a book on it to help me.  I think I am going to put in a shoutbox or something like that so that at least when the comment server is down the 4 of you who read my blog can still comment.
