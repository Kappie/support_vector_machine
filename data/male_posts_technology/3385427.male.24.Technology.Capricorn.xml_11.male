As everyone knows, the United States invaded Iraq without the sanction of the United Nations.  Whether this was good or bad depends on your point of view.  The US is silently declaring itself the supreme power on Earth.  What I want to know is, what will happen when the world's lifeblood (oil) runs out?  The middle-east, which the US is so interested in, will essentially become poverty stricken.  Will China, the worlds largest country, become a new superpower?  Will the US slowly sink away, like Britain did, when it's oil empire crumbles?  Will the United States collapse quickly and dramatically?  China would also be devastated by the loss of oil, but China has 20% of the world's population.  How will we transport anything without petroleum and how will this affect global politics?  It's all very depressing to think about, and this might happen before I'm middle-aged.
