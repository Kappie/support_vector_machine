We live in such a comfortable and safe place and we take it for granted sometimes on how lucky we are. Goh Chok Tong is leaving as PM and it's quite sad to hear that it's going to be another chapter on Aug 12 when Lee Hsien Loong takes over. I respect Mr Goh immensely, not because we have the same surname, but because of his attitude. Unlike SM Lee, his attitude is soft and not so authoritarian. It's amazing how Mr Goh has retained his soft personality through years of working with SM Lee. Lee Hsien Loong doesn't have the same attitude as Mr Goh. In fact, i think he's like SM Lee, quite authoritarian. Oh well, i think the next chapter of Singapore is one ruled by increased dictatorship.  Yup, Mr Goh is stepping down. Hope he becomes number 2 when the new cabinet line up is announced. Watch out Singapore.
