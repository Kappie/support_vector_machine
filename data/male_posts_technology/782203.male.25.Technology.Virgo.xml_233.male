Specifically the part where the male vampire bites the innocent young woman on her bare shoulder near the neck, and the gal seems to like go into orgasm or something as the blood drains from her neck/shoulder? OK cos I do , and when I told a friend about it, he compared to me to his army bunkmate who collects female school uniforms and even sleeps with them in camp. Now thats weird..not to mention creepy.  So just wanna know if anyone else feels the way abt vampire bites as I do!
