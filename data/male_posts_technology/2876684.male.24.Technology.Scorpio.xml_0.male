Andrew's one was a bit dodgy because he'd been knee'd in the head twice and I'm still not sure whether the rules allowed knees to the head. Pete was fighting a much more experienced fighter though he got in some good kicks that almost buckled his opponent's leg - he did steal the show by almost throwing his opponent out of the ring when they tied up! (The guys sitting behind me started calling for chair shots... haha)  The quality of the fights was a step up from the last time I had been there, so it was pretty enjoyable - many of the fights were quite close and the final fight of the night turned out to be a bit of an anti-climax because it was stopped due to a cut sustained by one of the fighters. His opponent caught him with an awesome front kick that opened him up just above his eye, so the doctor called it off. Overall it was a pretty good night, my voice was hoarse after all the shouting though...  Mey and I had a bit of a journey on the way home, we'd caught the train and we thought it was going to Liverpool but instead we ended up at Lidcombe! So then I caught a train to Penrith from there and she caught a train to Cabramatta and caught a cab home from there. Public transport in Sydney... gotta love it.  Yesterday I went over to Mey's to reclaim my electric guitar (i.e. my baby), which has been sitting in her lounge room for ages because I thought I would be going back down to Melbourne and she was in need of some babysitting. After showing off my "awesome guitar skills" (more like "desperately in need of practice skills"), Mey and I watched this Indonesian flick, "Ada apa dengan Cinta?" or "What is it with Love?" that seemed to me like an Indonesian version of "10 things I hate about You" - even the lead actor looked like Heath Ledger (and not just 'cause of his haircut). Oh well, at least I got to practice my translation skills. Or rather I was sitting there catching the odd word here and there.  "Perempuan means woman!"  "Cinta means Love!"  And so forth...  After that Christine rocked up and the three of us watched the most confusing movie I've ever seen - it was this Korean horror movie called "A Tale of Two Sisters." (Korea's No.1 Horror Movie according to the VCD cover!) The three of us are still trying to figure out what it was all about, so I guess that pretty much describes the whole film. It wasn't that scary, but it didn't stop Mey from squirming in her seat even though she'd seen it already!   My ride home was yet again another journey... I was waiting at Canley Vale station for a train going towards Parramatta / Blacktown but after waiting for an hour I realised there weren't any coming so I hopped onto a city-bound train and changed trains at Granville. Geez, I need a car... any sponsors? :P
