Simple, the NYC marathon is 17 weeks away and I need to be ready.  Any other questions?  I didn't think so.  I did take off into the heat of the day but I had a ton of water and my course provided water at perfect points during my run.  I ran to the Coffee Emporium in Hyde Park (mmm, who else wants coffee right in the middle of a run?!) and there was a water fountain right in between my house and the CE.  This meant I could run to the CE stopping for water along the way, get water at the CE, and then get water on the way back.  This may sound like an extremely in-depth look at hydration but since it's hot, I have to pay attention to it.  The run went great for the most part.  Even though it was hot out, I forced myself to slow down since it was the long run for the week and also since it was so hot.  I probably averaged just under 10 minute miles based on my time there and back.  I only took three water breaks and I think I only had to stop to walk once when I took off too fast from a water break.  I wasn't upset at all at how I felt or how the run went.  It would have been nice to run earlier in the day before the sweltering heat set in, but this worked out fine.  I did notice myself getting pretty tired before I reached the CE and then really tired on my way back.  Dreaming of what I would eat and in what order after I ran kept me running.  Sad I know, but I was hungry.  There was a storm moving in near the very end of the run.  I can't tell you how good the rain would have felt after such a scorching run.  Raindrops teased me up Madison Road and I could see the thunderheads rolling in quickly.  I was not fortunate enough to be drenched by the rain to cool me down though.  Maybe some other day.  That's about all for this run.  One note, though, is a comment from Runner's World about hydration (since the summer months are upon us).  I'll leave you with that for a final thought since it made me laugh. "Even if you think you're drinking a lot, you're probably not drinking enough.  I know I am when I have to wake up in the middle of the night to pee." (I thought that's what getting older was like too?)  Have a great weekend!  Happy birthday to me!
