Then the good old Dennis Kucinich gave an uneventful speech.  Then came the Rev, Reverend Al Sharpton.  My oh my, this man is a great speaker.  Every time I hear this man speak I am amazed at how well he can convey his message to the audience.  He is a very moving speaker and I am glad that he spoke tonight.  Here is a snippet from the Rev's speech. "We are also faced with the prospect of in the next four years that two or more of the Supreme Court Justice seats will become available. This year we celebrated the anniversary of Brown v. the Board of Education.  This court has voted five to four on critical issues of women's rights and civil rights. It is frightening to think that the gains of civil and women rights and those movements in the last century could be reversed if this administration is in the White House in these next four years."  And again, here's his closer. "Mr. President, we love America, not because all of us have seen the beauty all the time.  But we believed if we kept on working, if we kept on marching, if we kept on voting, if we kept on believing, we would make America beautiful for everybody.  Starting in November, let's make America beautiful again." So yeah I REALLY liked Al Sharpton's speech.  Then we had Elizabeth Edwards introduce John Edwards.  He gave a pretty good speech, although I have heard alot of what he said in some of his earlier speeches.  But he did have some good new things to say.  He did outline some details about policies that him and John Kerry have been saying they will do to make this country better.  urlLink CNN.com - Key points of Edwards' speech - Jul 29, 2004   The new slogan: Hope is on the way!
