I intend to write some more ziggur's camp blog today, though there's not a whole lot to write about, except the latest 2 excerpts.  Very rarely do I ever click on an ad on a website, it's pretty uncommon for me, what with all the crap that gets advertised on most websites, half of which is spyware ridden. But  urlLink Split Reason  peaked my interest. But then again, unlike most internet sucker's who get pulling into paying for and downloading spyware, I'm a sucker for Old School Gamer Reference's and T-shirts that portray this love. So if you like that kind of stuff too, give em a glance.  I've really gotta start writing the static content for my website as well, but time never seems enough. Hell with all the time I wasted last night trying to get into a Nagafen Raid on EQ, I could've written 3 pages of static content for my website. /groan fasten your seat belts folks, rant is beginning:  Why can't people make up their minds? biggest problem we had last night was the fact that our Raid group had it's leadership rotated about 50 times in 2 hours time. The person who originally advertised the raid and had actually been there wanted me to be Raid Leader right off the bat, told them no thanks since I was still a little green with raiding. She said no sweat. Then suddenly I get made Raid Leader with no forewarning, I start to setup group leaders and begin to form a party, then someone announces the Main Assist would be the Raid Leader, so made him leader, then the Original Advertiser for the raid asked everyone to leave the raid and get reinvited by her... So she becomes raid leader again, only to give it back to the MA later, who was 2 boxing and not paying attention to his Tank, who had Raid Leadership when we were asking for it back before we lost too many players. By the time the idiot realized he had Raid Leadership(obviously the screaming at him in Raid Chat wasn't good enough) 2/3rds of the raid disbanded. So we had to call it off.  Had raid leadership stayed fixed, wouldn't have been a problem, if the MA had realized he had RL when we were screaming at him to give it to us, I could've migrated a cleric from group 3(which had 2) to group 2(which didn't have 1) which would have kept 3 more players in raid. we would've had 3 partial groups and probably could've filled the rest out.  It was the most disorganized mess I've ever gotten involved in, and it drained my mental energy faster than a mana sieve from an Enchanter. I gave up on EQ for the night and went to bed. Just not worth it that night.  I hate the stupidity of some people, I understand new people or people who haven't done something before being bad at it. But people not paying any attention, and not knowing the basic fundamentals, really gets to me, especially the post lvl 30 crowd. If you made it to past lvl 30 without knowing how to do basic group mechanics you need to either solo less, or pay attention. I like LDoN's because they encourage grouping, and group mechanics. Whereas there are many places in Norrath that people can solo, granted I find most solo opportunities either Slow or dangerous. My Necro has had trouble finding any groups except inside of LDoN's, I don't know what it is about the necro class that makes them ungroupable, but seems anytime I ask about getting a group, I don't find one, and have to go to PC's Phlarg bridge and hunt.  Anyway last night sucked, and the fact that the raid drained my energy made it where I couldn't help my buddy Kretais on his epic quest :( which sucks I hate it when I can't help even though I'm online, I just camped out, and watched a movie. Dunno what I'll do tonight, probably find an ldon group or something.  /rant off  That rant wound down quickly. Anyway, Time for my break at work, so I'm gonna go have a cigarette, do some thinking and start writing Ziggur's Camp for the past 2 nights worth of adventuring.  Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix
