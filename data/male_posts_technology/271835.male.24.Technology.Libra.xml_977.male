I'm sure the money from Playboy came in handy.  California  urlLink paid out $86m in assistance to WalMart employees  in 2001 because their wages were so low and needed assistance in the form of food stamps and health related expenses. The study was based on data from that year but as WalMart wage increases haven't matched inflation levels the report reckons it will be even worse now.  So the next time you slap your arse in Asda's with a self satisfied grin spare a thought for their employees - they might be talking to Razzle right now.
