That's why I'm here! I'm gonna feel free and post any link I see fit, within some rules (if you know what I mean.) It could be stupid, fun, BoRiNg, or related to me somehow! Let's begin then. I'm guessing after reading this long, your brain needs a rest.  So without further ado, todays linkage from here to infinity:   urlLink DeathClock.Com! Learn when you die! *Warning, You may NOT live to see the thing go "Sorry, your time is up. Goodbye."*
