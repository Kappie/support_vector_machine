Instantly, i knew that message speaks to me. For months, i have been looking for a suitable job because i hate to slack. Although freelance for IT is good money and your time is flexible, it contains no career planning or prospect. Its like the story of the chinese farmer waiting for the rabbit under the tree. I called that, "PATHETIC". I was suddenly recalled that, before every breakthrough, things seem to be at its worst. I thought, probably and went Zzzzz..   This morning, i drag myself to SSDC in AMK to have my theory 3 and 4 lessons. Luckily, the lesson was quite a breeze coz' the instructor didn't concentrate much on the books, rather he speak more of social skills in driving. At this point of time, Mr Ling called to re-schedule the appointment to half an hour earlier and thats 9pm. I thought its gonna be some kind of interview, instead, he brush the idea aside and say its some kind of cooperation. Well, i anticipate it to be more of taking advantage of me perhaps. Guess what, Hap.. Julie called!  I told myself earlier that if i get this job @ 77th street, its definitely a job that God get me. Julie, the GM called! I was offered the position!!!! And, last night when i got the message, i was "Gosh, the message speak to me... and a little hopeful". What makes me so sure that this is God's will? Well, 77th street has religious link to City harvest. Julie, the GM who stunned me @ the first interview is a beau, and i saw a cross on her. *Ya, flame me hap... i'm a guy and she is really that gorgeous, so why can't i get stun by her?* Later, i realised that the founder is from CH.. I remembered Pastor Prince say, "There is no such thing call coincidence.. everything is God's plan." Although i do not know what he has ahead for me, i believe he wants to mound and prosper me.   Hap, at this point, you must be wondering what religion do i belongs to? I dun consider myself a christian coz that would bind me to a specific belief. But, i do believe and trust God. God to me, is similar to the God in the bible. I do believe, also Buddhism and although this may seems erronenous to many people, but i thought it also stem from God, but humans, due to not expose to the other parts of the world of other beliefs, divide this belief into a separated one. The God i believes, is the God of all beliefs. I do not want to restrict myself to just Jesus, but i know he loves me and i will not allow anybody to speak ill of him either. This is confusing, i know, but He understands, otherwise why would he prosper me? Yup, God is good. :)  Another thing capture my attention to write actually. After i depart SSDC AMK, i went to the AMK library to return my chinese novel (damn touching story) and got myself another one (also romance story, heh heh). As i walked towards the exit, the alarm went off. Apparently, some idiot walked out of the library without scanning the book. The librarian rushes out and called the teenage back. The fellow, act blur, continue to walk (he din even walk faster!!!! damn stupid moronic arsehole).. Guess what? He hide a book beneath his shirt.. I was like, "Damn, you want to steal a book out of the library and you din even attempt to escape when thay caught you?!" Oh man, this is some damn bloody stupid and moronic, like the NYGH gers i know, they love to say, "Spastic".   2nd day i dun see Mandy online... i guess, she had start to avoid me.. I just hope, God also prepare my dream date for me, coz i doubt i will be walking around on the street scanning for my future wife.. Shit, im reminded of Mandy again... no mood to write already.
