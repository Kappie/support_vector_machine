We got on campus, found a LARGE map with one of those "U R Here" dots on it, figured out roughly where we wanted to go, and still got a hair lost on the way.  We back-tracked a ways and found the turn that we had missed.  We thought we knew the building to go to, but it turned out to be the Student/Technology Center. Pamela ventured a door to an Information  [I think]  area. She found a small pile of maps of the campus; we looked at it, went out front and determined we just needed to go one building over.    We went in, and started looking at the vendors booths as we had 20-25 minutes to spare. There was some really excellent examples of hand-made Indian jewelry.  Some of the outfits as usuall are stunning. The time and effort that must go into making their costumes has to be astounding.  We made our way 2/3'rds around the vendors, when we run into a mother in Pamela's Wolf-Den for scouts.  We had mentioned the Pow wow to her yesterday at a field trip we had out to the E.B Lyons Nature Center. She's from Jamaica, and was very interested.   She had been up there since 2pm'ish, so by this time she had been there 4hrs.  During the evening, when the audiance could join in the dancing, she hopped up 4 or 5 times to join in.    To be honest, I was tempted to get up and join in, but felt a little apprehenceive wearing a blue Hawaiin shirt, and how it's stick out.  There was one point that Pamela had gone off to the ladies room, that if she had been back, I was going to get up during the group dance part, and try my hand at a Friendship dance.  I tried to talk my oldest son into it but he always said no. I asked Pamela but she said the next Pow wow.  I'm making note of it here so she doesn't forget :) Time to call it a night, will give a better detail of it later today its late and time to pay Winkin, Blinkin and Nod a visit.
