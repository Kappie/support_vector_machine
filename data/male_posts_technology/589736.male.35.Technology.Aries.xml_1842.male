That "Crappy Gifts" website was a hoot if for no other reason than the expressions on her face.  Gee, I only have to wait 4 or 5 more years to see those on Katherine's face.  As for the Orgasmatron, don't count on it replacing us.  It can't mow the grass.  Also, what happens if she loses the remote control with the device turned on?
