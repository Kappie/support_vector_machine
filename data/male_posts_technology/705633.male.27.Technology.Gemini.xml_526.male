For a start I eat very little seafood so that's out, and the steaks never seem to be particularly tasty, cheap or interesting. If you don't want seafood or a steak, you're pretty much fucked.   Also, what's the fascination with fucking poodles? I don't think you're allowed to live in St Malo unless you have a mangy poodle on a lead and drag it around with you everywhere. While I'm at it, how many places do you need to buy a fucking ice-cream or a crepe from? And a cheese course between your main and your dessert. There's just no need, is there?  Look at me, I'm a right little potty mouth tonight. Anyway:   A man fell asleep on the beach one day and the wind came up and blew sand all over him until he was covered with only his big toe sticking out.     A nympho was walking down the beach, saw the toe sticking up, pulled down her bikini bottom and squatted over the toe. She humped away till she was satisfied, pulled up her drawers and left.    The guy woke up, brushed the sand away and left, not knowing what had happened.  The next day his foot itched like hell, and had a sore on it. He went to the Doctor and after an exam the doc told him he had syphilis of the big toe.     "Syphilis of the big toe?", he inquired, "isn't that rare."     The doc said "Yes, but if you think that's rare, I had a woman in here this morning with Athlete's Twat."
