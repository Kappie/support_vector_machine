 I finished  urlLink Tom Clancy's "Executive Orders"  on the  urlLink train  back from DC last night.  This has been quite a long read for me, considering that I was forced to put it down thanks to current events.  I'm one to find an escape in novels, and I can't say that Tom Clancy took me away from the "real" war in Iraq.  Despite taking a three-month break, I have to say that the quote on the book's spine doesn't lie.  "A colossal read," the   urlLink Los Angeles Times   proclaims.  I think  long-winded  and  repetitive  more aptly describe the novel.  I'm not sure, but I think this was the same book as " urlLink Debt of Honor ," Clancy's last "colossal read," with the American flag on the cover instead of that of Japan.  All in all, I have to say that I found this novel to be wholly unsatisfying.
 
 If you don't know the back-story to this novel, here's a quick reference.  At the end of "Debt of Honor," the protagonist, Jack Ryan, becomes the President of the United States after a wacko Japanese airline pilot decides to fly his Boeing 747 into the Capitol building during a joint session of congress.  Ryan, who was just sworn into the Vice President's office (recently vacated after the former VP has to step down for womanizing), his wife and kids, and a handful of secret service agents are the only people to survive.  Convenient.
 
 "Executive Orders" picks up with Jack Ryan at the head of a largely empty US government.  Reluctantly, he tries to do the right thing, rebuilding the government from scratch while fending off various internal and external attacks.
 
 Essentially, Clancy leads the reader on for about 1200 pages of twisting and turning plot lines that all involve independent factions who want to destroy Jack Ryan's presidency, and the United States along with it.  The reader has to wonder if it is actually possible for one person to have to deal with so much drama, even if he is the President of the most powerful nation in the world.  Listen to this (probably abridged) list of conflicts:
 
 * The former Vice President decides that he didn't really resign, and therefore challenges Ryan for the Presidency both politically and through dirty smear tactics in the media.
 * The Iranian shah somehow assassinates the President of Iraq and forms a new United Islamic Republic.
 * People plot to kill Ryan's daughter.
 * Iranians plot to release Ebola all over the United States
 * Iran threatens to invade Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
 * India threatens to wage naval war if the US sends their ships through the Indian Ocean
 * China shoots down a passenger jet and then pretends that Taiwan did it
 * Two militiamen from Montana build a bomb and plot to blow up the White House
 * Iran manages to get an assassin in the secret service
 
 If the lunacy of one man dealing with all of this isn't enough to turn you away, consider the resolutions to all of these problems.  After around 1200 pages of reading, maybe two of the problems have gone away.  Then, in two hundred dominating pages, the US, lead heroically by Jack Ryan, wipe all of these problems out with their smart bombs and superiorly trained army with practically no loss.  The book ends with Ryan showing a smart bomb dropping on the Iranian leader's house.  How nice.  
 
 If only the real world were so clean.  Several months after our real smart bombs and superiorly trained army dominated the overmatched Iraqi army, we can't go a day without hearing about some Iraqi ambush that ends with US casualties (usually deaths).  If only we could have dropped one bomb on Baghdad, said this wasn't about religion, wiped our hands and become good trading partners with Iraq.  Unfortunately, life doesn't work that way, which is something the diplomats should consider before throwing their hands up in the air and giving up.
