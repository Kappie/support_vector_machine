I finally went and spoke to a woman whom I had left in my past due to foreseen circumstances :-P It was so nice to see her again and we chatted for quite a while!  Now by some fluke occurrence of what I can only perceive to be fate intervening on an otherwise uneventful day, we decided to go to movies together! She owns a shop... She was working today... She normally hates going to movies... And for her to close her shop? Needless to say I was more than slightly surprised at her eagerness to join me on my midday escape to the cinema! So off we troddle to the theatre, where we happily watched Shrek 2 with about 150 kids! Thankfully, they were so engrossed in the intense story of Shrek, that they proved to be less of a distraction than I originally anticipated.  After movies we mission off to her place, where we sat for another 2 hours talking... and talking... and talking! Heh heh :-) I must say it was a very enjoyable experience to have today. I wasn't expecting it to happen... I'm not even sure why or how I ended up in her neck of the woods today. Its days like these that make me believe in fate / destiny or some higher power guiding my life in the right direction. After all, with the last few weeks I've had, the last place I expected to find myself was back there... Especially after the dodge break up we endured (we ended the friendship about 2 months back on a real sour note - again!!). Yes, we had ended the friendship before that as well... say about 4 months before this one... We always seem to find each other afterwards though, which is really strange!  Anyway, back to my original point I was attempting to make in the previous paragraph before I got so carried away in the minor details of the situation... It seemed as though my perky, light hearted and happy demeanor today really cheered her up, made her day in a way I'm sure. And she made mine :-)  I'll be sure to have a drink to Destiny / Fate or whomever / whatever is pulling the strings very, very soon.
