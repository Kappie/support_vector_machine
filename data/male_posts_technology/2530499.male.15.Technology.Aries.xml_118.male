ME: Oh, goodie. New mail. *curses sendmail...*  Anyway, that's how my morning went. I got up about 9-9.5ish and went downstairs. I made muffins. Bannanana Nut Muffins. Damn, they were good. Then, did chores until around 11:15 and then showered. Got my ass into work. Mom, Paul, Andy, and Kirk were all there. Friendly people. I guess Mark (the CFO and wannabe-IT-guy) is in Greeley today. I worked until about noon, when I got hungry, and biked over to  urlLink Goodcents  for some lunch. SIXTEEN INCHES OF PURE KICKASSNESS. (JQ and ROZ will make a very bad joke of that. Just fucking watch.) Then I was full. Got back to work around 12.5 and continued to work. Re-installed Win95 about ten times. No joke. Finally worked on the C: again and everything SEEMED peachy until Paul clicks Netscape Communicator.  "Couldn't load OLE 2.0 or libraries are corrupt."  Fuck.  I hate Object. Er...OLE. Did a find for any sort of OLE file. Found a registry key and merged it with the current reg, and then everything SEEMED peachy. All the things that were missing OLE worked, and then it was time to move onto the...NETWORK CARD. Any IT guy who is worth his salt knows that networking 95 is like explaining TCP/IP to  urlLink Kelz0rz.  (That's rather difficult.) After very, very little poking around in Hardware, saw the damn card was just disabled. Re-enabled it and re-booted. Once again. Everything SEEMED peachy. Tried Netscape. Upon loading whatever homepage there was, the Java Security console pops up, along with a GPF.  "Netscape has preformed an illegal operation and will be shut down by Windows."  Fuck.  I hate GPF's. Er...General Protection Faults. Did a find for the .DLL it was assfucking and found out that it was 4.5, or, quitting time. Instead of taking my valuable time waiting for my mother to get off her PC, (There is only two workstations downstairs, with two offices and the lobby...there should be FOUR. There will BE FOUR.) I decides to take the file home and try to edit it. Wait, why don't I just replace it?  WILL BEN THE FEARLESS IT GUY SAVE THE OLD DELL?  FIND OUT IN THE NEXT POST, AND WED. WENT...!   My IT quote of the day:  "I love IT! So much money! They call me an engineer and I don't even know how to spell it!"
