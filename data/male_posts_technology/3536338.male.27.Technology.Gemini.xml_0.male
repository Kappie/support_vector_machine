If only she knew that bowl of cereal she brought him was so much more  then a quick meal, if only she could have seen him looking at her, she  wasn't looking back, but in just being there she was more then she  thought she was.    The most important thing in a day, a missed glance, the way he felt when he knew he walked in your eyes, it's all gone, all that's left is the memories,  and ghosts just can't hold him the same.    If only she knew that silly smile was all because of her, little blonde curls  made up with ribbons and bows, a constant fight to be on time, but none the less, a childish grin because love is what made up the morning mess.    The most important thing in a day, a missed smile, the way she felt when  she knew she walked in your eyes, it's all gone, all that's left is the memories, and ghosts just can't hold her the same.    Ghosts aren't real, and we all know that these phantoms can't replace you, but it's better then nothing, and it's the only way we can hold on to the parts  of you that we all need. I get the cereal now days, and make the ribbons  and bows, but it's not really my hands that hold the bowl, and phantasmal fingers guide that brush.    The most important thing in a day, a missing person, the way we felt when we knew we walked in your eyes, it's all gone, all that's  left is the memories, and ghosts just can't hold us the same.    ~Chris~  Thats my post for now, I'm heading off to michigan for 4 days to see a friend.. have  fun all.
