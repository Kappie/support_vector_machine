The pictures and stories are then posted on the project website. urlLink http://www.confluence.org/   Project Overview : snippets from the original website   The project is an organized sampling of the world. There is a confluence within 49 miles (79 km) of you if you're on the surface of Earth. We've discounted confluences in the oceans and some near the poles, but there are still 13,042 to be found.  History I (Alex Jarrett) started the project in February 1996 because I liked the idea of visiting a location represented by a round number such as 43Â°00'00"N 72Â°00'00"W. What would be there? Would other people have recognized this as a unique spot? Another reason was that my friend managed to convince me to buy a GPS and I had to come up with something to do with it. I also hoped to encourage people to get outside, tromp around in places they normally would never go, and take pictures of it.  Project Stats Primary confluences:  Successful visits: 	4,048  Incomplete visits: 	586  Unique successful: 	3,122  Unique incomplete: 	194  Percent complete: 	19.31%  Total indexed: 	16,164  Indexed - Land: 	14,027  Indexed - Water: 	1,986  Indexed - Ice Cap: 	151   There are already more than 30,000 pictures from around 147 countries by around 4,800 people. India has 290 confluence points of which only 53 have been covered till yet.. See  urlLink map  Any adventurous people around ?
