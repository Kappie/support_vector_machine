We were talking about her work as an editor for a local independent magazine when the conversation turned to Iraq and, inadvertently, to Nicholas Berg. She often enjoys talking about this cause she has always wanted to freelance as a journalist.   As all of you may already know, Nicholas Berg was a U.S. businessman that was decapitated by members of Saddam Hussein's Fedayeen paramilitary organization. The whole incident was video taped and found it's way into the net.  When I told her about the video, she expressed interest in watching it. She told me that it's just our of curiosity (something that she claims is a characteristic of a good reporter). I told her that she could download it from Kazaa if she wished. To which she asked me to download it for her and send it through the internet so she could watch it.   Now, let me stop here and make something clear. I'm not into watching people get tortured or killed. Once a friend of mine asked me to watch Faces of Death with him. I said no. He was stunned. He could not believe that someone like me who is into gory horror movies would back out at the opportunity to see a real life gory death. I answered that there is a big difference between fiction and reality. In fact, I often prefer fiction cause it's easier to digest than reality.  I've had hundred of opportunities to download these types of video. I recall once that in the office there was this group of people huddling around a laptop, watching something. I asked what it was they were watching. It was the video where Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl is murdered. I refused to watch it. Mostly because I had seen Daniel Pearl several times on TV and the thought of watching a real person die in a gruesome way made me sick to my stomach.   Still, I ended up downloading the Nicholas Berg video for my friend, knowing that I would most certainly end up watching it myself. Which, afterward, made me think at who stupid I was to let my curiosity get the best of me after I had been so stern before about watching these types of videos. Not sure why this video compelled me into watching it, but I did.   Once the video downloaded, I immediately played it and I watched as Nicholas Berg was slaughtered like poultry. This word might seen in poor taste, but that's what it seemed to me. To his killers, he wasn't human. Just a piece of meat to be sliced without mercy. Heck, the way the decapitated him looked like the had done at hundreds of times and one more really didn't make much difference.   Now, I wasn't too shocked, cause I already had a feeling of what to expect and, do to the blurriness of the video, the gore didn't mentally scar me. It did made me think and the more I taught, the more disturbing ideas crossed my mind.   Did he know he was going to die? How long did his agony last until he died? Was his mind conscious as his head was severed and held toward the lens of a camera? His family...   "My father is Jewish. My mother is Jewish. I'm Jewish."   Words that echo into oblivion can never be forgotten.   I sent the video to my friend, but she didn't receive it cause her computer disconnected from the internet due to some odd error. I actually felt stupid. That made me decide to call up my best friend J.C. on the phone. Didn't get much comfort cause she was pissed about something and didn't want to talk. I tried to tell her about Nicholas Berg, but she said that if it had to with Iraq she wasn't interested cause she had other things to worry about than that. We ended up talking about something totally silly and trivial that night, which helped calm my nerves. That is until we got into a stupid argument about something that right now I can't remember.   The next day I talked to my editor friend. She at her work, editing a story that had her in a bad mood due to some very simple and avoidable spelling mistakes (or so she told me). I asked if she wanted me to send her the video later and she said not to worry cause she saw it in the morning when a fellow worker played it on one of the PCs.  She seemed unaffected about the whole think. Like she just saw a clip from the new Friday The 13th movie, went "yuck" and life went on.   Later that day, CNN mentioned that there was this incident involving high school students that were caught watching the video at school. The news suggested that the teachers knew that the video was being played and, probably, took part in the viewing. Wouldn't surprise me.   The report mentioned something that made me think. Someone mentioned that the video was used to teach the children a lesson. Maybe teach the children about the struggle that is going on right now in Iraq. Or maybe, just to show them that there is real evil in the world. Either way, it's pretty sick, but I guess I can relate. When I was a kid, I was taught that good always triumph over evil. No Nicholas Berg to teach us otherwise back then.  The next report talked about how horrified the parents of Nicholas Berg felt when they learned that the death of their son had now joined the ranks of Paris Hilton, Janet Jackson  and Pamela Anderson as novelties to be downloaded from the net. Must be hard for a parent that has lost a son in such a horrible way to be able to comprehend something like that. Like loosing your son over and over again.   I also thought that maybe, in some weird way, by watching the video we were making ourselves accomplices in the murder of Nicholas Berg. Watching. We are the camera. We watched him die and did nothing but enjoy the show. And, of course, this is what the murders wanted. Their message was successfully transmitted.   With all these thoughts in my head, I got a call from J.C. who sounded pretty excited. She asked me if I knew about Nicholas Berg. I said yes and confided in her that I had downloaded and seen the video of his demise. She scold me. Asked why did I tell her and I replied: "I tried, dumbass, but you didn't want to talk about Iraq and shit!" She laughed and apologized. Then she told me, almost excited, that she had just downloaded the video from the web.
