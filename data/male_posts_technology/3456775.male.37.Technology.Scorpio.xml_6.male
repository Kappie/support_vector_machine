A nice, medium-bodied smoke that went along fairly well down to about 1.5" after that is was time to throw in the towel. I was getting a noticeable 'buzz' by the time I was about 2/3rds of the way through. The ash formed quite uniformly and I could get 3/4" or so before I needed to tap or it left on its own. Once I was down to the last 1/3 I started getting what seemed to be "perfumey" aftertastes but I was quite sure what it was.  All in all I thought it was a nice smoke but maybe a bit too aggresive for my tates. I find that the more cigars I sample, the more I am drifting towards the milder end of the spectrum. One of the downsides to this cigar has been the very pronounced "cigar-breath" aftertaste. As of this writing I have eaten fried chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans, milk, cookies and juice. I have brushed my teeth and had two bouts with a Listerine clone. It has also been about 5 hours since I finished my cigar and I STILL taste the thing like I just finished it. I can also still "smell" it as I exhale through my nose.  The mild ones, like the Don Diego are like a polite guest: They know when they are about to overstay their welcome and leave accordingly. This one is more like the moochy relative who comes for a weekend and stays a month.  I'll give this one a 2.5/5 overall. SMOKING EXPERIENCE: 3/5 AFTEREFFECTS: 2/5  I'll chalk this one up to experience and enjoy it accordingly. However, I won't likely be returning this way again.
