We have crockery and a few bits and bods to throw balls at. Hopefully get a load of money to help towards our trip. The ICT exam was pretty much as expected, only one question got me was "Name four features of the 1998 Data Protection Act" which I could not remember at all, but never mind. After talking to Barry, I am on the C/B border. That's it! All over! No more exams, and now a nice relaxing extra long summer to look forward to. Andy is watching every word I type, so I better not let out too many secrets, hehe. Looking forward to what should be a very interesting party tomorrow!
