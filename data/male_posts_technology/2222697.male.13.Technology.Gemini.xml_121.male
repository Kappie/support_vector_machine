We moved and we dont own our old house anymore all my stuff is in my room in Tyler and I am typing away at my dad's office. Everything happened so fast I couldn't keep track of it. Yay! no school. 7th grade went by faster than ever, Shelby cried and I told her to shut up, she could have just seen me at Page's party.  A-kon was a blast! I got Fred's autograph and bought a hundred bucks of crap. I took pics of all the good cosplay and I will have those up soon ^_^.  I am gonna scream at my harddrive now.
