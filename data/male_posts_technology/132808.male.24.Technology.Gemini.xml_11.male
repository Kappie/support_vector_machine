The very nice robot lady comes on and says, "Your account is currently overdrawn by... sixty-six... dollars... and thirty-five.... cents."  WTF!?!  And I have no food, either!!  So I go to Safeway and buy two weeks worth of food for the retarded low price of $6.76.  Mind you, I'll be living on KD, ramen noodles and the shittiest hot dogs they have to offer for the next 8 days.  How bad do these hot dogs have to be when the good hot dogs, which are literally four times the price, contain nothing but cow hooves and anus?  That's a nice thought.  What's everyone's favorite ebonics saying?  Personally, I'm a fan of, "Belie' DAT!".  The way I judge how good an ebonics term is is by a) how completely fucking raped the english language is, and b) how ridiculous someone who isn't black looks when they say it.  BTW, The Van Damme Villain Project will have to wait until next week, since I have NO MONEY to rent any movies.  And to base it purely on Tong Po vs Bison vs Chong Li is a fight to decide the top three, not the top ten.  PS - Nex, can you PLEASE change the song?  I haven't heard anything that ugly since, "And when this team wins the cup... IT'S COMING BACK TO WINNIPEG"  Ahh, Eddie O.  Will we ever let that die?
