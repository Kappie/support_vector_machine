I wish my weekend was put to better use. Would like to put my Sun to better use than to stay home all day. But whatever I intend to do needs to be flexible and not a routine.  Pity Eileen mentioned Bt Batok dojo is not available for now. Otherwise maybe, I can drop by on and off to train.  Seriously considering Kendo again. Beginners classes are on Wed nights and Sun mornings. Timings seems comfortable enough too.
