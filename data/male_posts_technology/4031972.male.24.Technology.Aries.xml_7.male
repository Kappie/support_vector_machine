The Abu Ghraib fame woman soldier who posed a smiley face for the camera with her thumbs up, as if shooting the genitals of Iraqi detainees and with dog leashes, is back in news, and I'm afraid this could be worse.  CNN reports:        	     Quote:   	 	 	   Arthur, a military investigator testified Lynndie England told him that "it was just for fun". Arthur also said "They didn't think it was that serious. ... They didn't think it was that big a deal. They were joking around". 	        To top it all, she is 7 months pregnant.  So much for her dignity and motherhood.  Now read this ...       She is one of seven members of the 372nd Military Police Company who have been charged with abusing detainees at Abu Ghraib.  A hearing officer, Major Charles Ransome, later recommended that the charges of indecent acts and cruelty and maltreatment be  dropped .
