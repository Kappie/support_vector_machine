Jones, Senior Director, Microsoft Security  Business Unit       When we launched our first security newsletter in December, I asked you to  send me your comments and feedback so that I could be your advocate at Microsoft  for security issuesand you delivered! I appreciate the many e-mail messages  with comments and questions, and we will begin answering them this month.   One particular question raised by many of you focused around the Microsoft  process for patching known vulnerabilities. This is an important topic to many  of you, so this month I will describe the lifecycle of a software vulnerability  from time of disclosure until a patch and Security Bulletin release.   The Microsoft security response process follows the general steps of  reporting, investigation, development, test, and release.   The security response process starts with the reporting of a potential issue.  Microsoft uses our membership in the  Organization for Internet Safety   to strongly promote the principles of responsible reporting. A central principle  is the belief that the best way to minimize customer risk is for security  researchers to work closely with vendors to identify issues and fix them before  they are publicized.   When Microsoft releases a patch concurrently with an announcement of a  vulnerability, it is a result of having identified the issue and worked through  the patch release process prior to communicating publicly. This means our  customers will have an opportunity to protect themselves from malicious hackers  seeking to exploit the vulnerability. However, when vulnerabilities are  announced publicly at the same time Microsoft is notified, customers remain  exposed to malicious attackers.   Once a potential issue is reported to Microsoft, either privately or  publicly, our team immediately begins an investigation to reproduce and verify  the reported issue and to identify any associated or variant issues.  Historically, only about 1 out of 10 reported issues turns out to be a new and  unique security issue that warrants opening an investigation, while the other 9  fall into categories of known issues, non-security issues, or errors.   If an issue is replicable, a priority is assigned to it and potential fixes,  mitigations, and workarounds are developed. Weve learned over time that  mitigations and workarounds are very important for empowering users to control  when and how they manage their risk. Chartered with defining and implementing  the process for responding to reported software security issues, the Microsoft  Security Response Center works closely with the affected product group to do  this investigation, and, further, to expand the investigation to other supported  versions of products so that we can gain a complete understanding of how an  issue may affect customers.   One of the most challenging elements of this process is testing. It is  critical to our customers that whatever changes we make to a product have little  to no impact on existing installations and applications. For a product such as  Internet Explorer, for example, the breadth can be significant. Microsoft  currently supports three major versions of Internet Explorer (5.01, 5.5, 6)  across several minor versions (for example, Internet Explorer 6 gold and  Service Pack 1) across several operating systems (Windows 98, Windows Me,  Windows XP, Windows 2000, and Windows Server 2003) for more than 25 languages.  In total, to fix one Internet Explorer issue, Microsoft builds and releases more  than 400 unique packages, tested on an even larger number of combinations.   Complementary to taking these steps to help customers more ably protect  themselves from malicious attackers, the Security Response Center and Security  Business Unit offer outreach programs and prescriptive guidance through our Web  properties, through support channels, and directly through our interactions with  customers.   Most importantly, what this means to us is that, even as we are driving  urgently for timely delivery of a patch for serious security issues, we are  motivated to focus as much on the quality part as the timely part so that we  can deliver the quality and protection our customers demand. It is essential  that each patch installs properly, addresses the security issue, and does not  disrupt other existing functionality. It is a job Microsoft takes very  seriously.

Again, thanks for the comments and feedback, and I encourage you to keep it  coming. Let me know if this article helped answer some of the questions you  had.
