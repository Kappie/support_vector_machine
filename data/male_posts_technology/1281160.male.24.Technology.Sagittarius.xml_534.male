It only throws up ripples of thoughts, of our days at our 'famed' campus. 2nd trimester... when we first had a glimpse of this "mystery man" who didn't marry a punjabi girl and who did MCA, all just because his mother had asked him to do so... and who stacked up a series of degrees next to his name... all just because he "felt like" studying them.  It really amazed us when he allocated topics for our seminar in the field that  we  were interested in. Be it electrical, mechanical, electronics, political science or even  biology , he was up there with no dearth of knowledge.   We knew him in the campus as someone who would ask his students to study Software Engineering book in 3 days, or teach the 25+ chapters in ERP or e-com book in less than a month... but off the campus, we know the kiddish side of him too... someone who would sneak into Rajesh/Ganesh's room in TTS to play a game of RoadRash or pick up a CD and sit down watching movies... or get tangled up with some frivolous conversation with our guys there... that made a lot of sense to him... but was just another pastime for we people. And who could forget the adventure of "looking for a girl" to get him married... or the day when we took him out for dinner to make him postpone our internal...  Now, he is not there amidst us. May be, his only unfulfilled wish was probably that he didn't get married... But looking back, I feel, its good that he didn't get married... if you understand what I mean...  From our side.. these are the things that peep in once in a while, reminding us of the harsh realities of life... Life could be so simple and yet so complex... There's a long way to go.. after all, we are hardly getting started with our lives...  and miles to go before we too sleep...
