I did nothing but work on like three or four computers... which is really low for me... so, I wasn't very happy about that... plus, today, it was STEAMING back in the shop today.  if you are curious, I am a computer technician.......   So, right now, home alone, just watching the rain with Shebly the dog and wishing someone was with me to run in the rain with!!!  ah well, just gotta have fun alone yet again I guess...   can't you tell I love being alone!!!    Is there a job that you would never do in this whole world, no matter how much money you got paid a year???
