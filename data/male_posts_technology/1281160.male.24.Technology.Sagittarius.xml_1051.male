But that means I would have to dirty my hands with Javascript, which I don't want to.  There are already too many scripts running in the blog. One for the blogroll (which I have plans of replacing), a couple for the "recent posts" section, another couple for the website visitors and referrers. I think everyone should visit the logs. Click on the image. You'll get to know find amazing information from it.   If you want, I can sort and put the archives listing in the descending order, I'll add it to my to-do list. No posts on your "Thoughts", Have you forgotten it?  BTW, if anyone is still linking to my Quod scripsi scripsi blog hosted on blogspot (http://jaxsays.blogspot.com), please update it to the new one ( urlLink http://jaxsays.weblogs.us ) and I have deleted the blog hosted on blogspot.
