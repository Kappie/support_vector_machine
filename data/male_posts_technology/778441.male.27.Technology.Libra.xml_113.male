The design of the site looks very nice and the features that would be included on  hum*blog  sound great! I hope this effort turns into a success and  hum*blog  truly becomes the home of Indian blogsphere!  By the way, doesn't  hum*blog  have a very quintessential Indian ring to it?! ... I like it!!
