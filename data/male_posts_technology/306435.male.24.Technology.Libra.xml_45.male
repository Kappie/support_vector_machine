It makes me think of the Seinfeld episode where Jerry is going to get married and Kramer is talking him out of it.  He says, "you can forget about eating dinner in front of the television.  You have dinner time and you have to talk about your day.  How was your day to day?  Fine how was your day to day?"  A classic I tell ya.  I helped Ann, Jeff, Devon, and Stacey make the CS Banner for the Home Coming parade today.  It was pretty fun.  Tomorrow is pay day.  I think I need to write my land lord an email.  I have toured three groups today, all sating that the land lord told them they could stop by.  This is ridiculous.  I mean by law I should get 24 hours notice, but more importantly I get nothing for "selling" the apartment.  I mean I don't want to be a jerk, but I am watching tv I dont want to show you around.  Okay...don't have much here...until then..oh yeah check out the new pics I added to the urlLink  page
