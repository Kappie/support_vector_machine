One would assume that in order to achieve person goals you must be allowed personal time independent of your partner, but ideally the partner should be one in which he or she complements the abilities to achieve the goals.  The ideal partner would be one which shares similar goals.  The success of a relationship is directly related to the achieving of the member's goals.  Incompatible goals would require both parties to work independently to achieve their personal goals, which is more difficult for the individual than working together with their partner.  Incompatible goals also infringe upon time that a person could spend with their partner.  It would be more advantageous for both parties in a relationship to cease the relationship altogether and search for a partner that shares similar goals.  Obviously there are many factors that would hamper this type of solution to a problem.  If a person is consumed by some affinity for a particular characteristic of their partner, then he or she may sacrifice their goals in order to sustain the relationship contrary to their advantage.  These people are lacking in will, they have a low self-esteem, and are committing to a life of servitude for a relationship.  They are sheep.  Why does a person sacrifice themselves for their relationship?  The partner often fulfills a role that has or will become absent.  For instance, a man sacrifices himself to sustain a relationship with a woman that has similar characteristics of his mother.  This is due to a fear of the unknown.  His mother's characteristics satisfy him and since he cannot fathom any other type of woman as being satisfying, he holds onto this substitute mother.  This Oedipus complex is a very common ailment that subjects so many to a life of misery.  People should be able to perceive themselves objectively, notice their faults, and correct them by any means possible.  This would ensure a satisfactory life.  But who am I to talk.  I am in love with a woman to the point that her absence causes me grief.  Even though I know fully well that I should behave differently and I make extreme efforts to change my actions, I am compelled to continue my relationship servitude.  I would hope that you still give me some respect, I only serve because I am served by her.  She worships me with equal fervor that I worship her.  There are times when the adoration blurs out of focus and the absence of completed goals comes to the head.  At these points conflict arises and due to the passion that we feel for one another a fight of extreme measure will surely result.  Since the force of passion attracts us together, when we have opposite views the passion throws us to opposite sides of the continuum.  Only a sacrifice on both parts can bring us back together, mainly by one party acquiescing and passion cooled down.  Even though a conflict is a damper upon the relationship, after it is resolved the relationship is bound to grow to a closeness and intimacy that was unachievable prior to the conflict.
