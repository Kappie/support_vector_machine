When he's training John he works John a lot, whereas with me Shihan actually trains himself as well. I guess it's because he's easing me into full-contact fighting again after a long break, and he wants to regain some fitness as well.  Apart from that I feel a little strange training while the majority of Australia was on holiday today. For some reason I felt really isolated from the rest of the world today...  Damn Easter and all the chocolate - I can't stop eating the stuff because it's everywhere!!! *argh*
