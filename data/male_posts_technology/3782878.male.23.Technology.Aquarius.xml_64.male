So I trekked out there, only to find the corpse had already been handled. so another run out of HighHold Keep back to the plane of knowledge, and I was back to doing what I set out to do originally.  I needed to work on my pottery, the wheel has so far mystified me, course I can now make the simple ceramic container with ease and skewers are even easier, but I decided to do something challenging and useful, the smoker. It took a while, and several prototypes before I even began to make fairly decent smokers. I had been doing this because I wanted to get better in tune with the art of pottery, so I could make the dye vials I would need to finish some gifts for my friend Sazlan.   Eventually I felt confident enough to make the vials required. So off I went to Gunthak for supplies, once I got there, I spent 350 platinum on the material for 10 Prismatic Dyes, I went to the brewing barrel in Plane of Knowledge, and produced 10 Prismatic Dyes, then I walked to the pottery wheel, and made 6 Dye Vials. 4 of the vials either shattered or burned inside the kiln, I don't know what they make the unfired vials out of, but it smells atrocious, get's all over your clothing and hangs there for a good week.   I took the finished vials I had back to the brew barrel and pours the dye into the vials. I now have 6 vials of prismatic dye. I gave them all to Sazlan, who used 3 of them, and will share them with my other friend Akcron. I must say that female Vah Shir have a way to tempt the strongest resolve. The Beauty of the Vah Shir is great, but whenever I get lost in looking at Sazlan, I think of Akcron, and snap out of it, before Akcron catches me looking and bonks me on my helmet.
