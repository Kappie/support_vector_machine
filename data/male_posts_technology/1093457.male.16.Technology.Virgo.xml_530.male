I'm pretty confident I got at least a C for paper 2, because I was very revised up on that (thanks Jo!) but paper 1, I'm not sure I did very well at all on, like everybody else. So I really am on the C/D border for that. Not particually happy, but hey, either that or go live in a ditch. Yes! That's it, exams are over apart from some random ICT paper. All done and dusted. So now is the time to start planning the summer, and then at the end of the summer think about all the things you were going to do but never did because you spent your whole time going to parites or recovering from parties. My back really hurts now because the chair I was sitting in for all 1 hour and 45 minutes of that extra tireing Austria rehersal was all bent in the middle, so I couldn't sit up straight at all! Felt like somebody was poking me the whole time. Maybe it wasn't my chair and David was just being kinky. Hehe. Kinky sailors - why weren't hey in the history paper? One of my primary school buddies who I see every month-or-two was over this evening with her family, always good to talk about the good old days. Sort of miss them, but they were all snobs apart from a few of us. All at Trinity and other posh schools now. Don't care about us lot no more.  Jo - remind me about seeing her because she said something really nice you want to hear!  They have moved the 6th form timetable around a bit since I last saw it. So I am doing AVCE Media, Business  Economics and Geography. The plan is to do ICT, but I don't really fancy it, it's just the only thing I'm actually any good at. But it's either that or something else from 12B and 12D. Grrrr. I'll shut up now. One too many Cokes and a whole lot of ice cream!
