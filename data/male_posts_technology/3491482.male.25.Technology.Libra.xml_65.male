This nimrod is suing Yahoo because someone on one of Yahoo's discussion board subjected him to a bunch of abusive messages, and Yahoo's terms of service forbid such abuse, but because Yahoo did not prevent the abuse, they owe him big time, along with anybody else he can get to join his class-action suit.
