If that includes not bombing a building into the Stone Age where a known insurgent is hiding in his cowardice just because we're afraid of insulting somebody's imaginary friend in the sky, then I don't care one whit about being morally superior.  Bottom line, we've lost our tactical advantage.  We've let Al-Sadr slip away in the night and who knows if we'll be able to pin him down again like that in the future.  I don't care if the people over there think it's a magic building or not...right now it's being used as a military fortification filled with enemy combatants, and we need to treat it as such.  Do you think if things were the other way around they would hesitate to blow up a Christian church just because world opinion of them would suffer?  I doubt it.  If the insurgents are so pissed off because of the "foreign occupation" then join the democratic process we've started there already and turn it into whatever kind of religious fundamentalist "democracy" (cough, cough) you want after we leave.  It's going to happen anyways.  You're just slowing up the process of the US getting out.
