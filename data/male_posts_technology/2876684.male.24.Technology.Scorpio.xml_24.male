Thursday - Had a training session with Shihan and Michelle (who's also going to NZ) and it was a complete change from the day before, had lots of "zip" and my technique was a lot better, especially on my front kicks. Shihan and I did a run down to the chemist to pick up some supplements to help with my energy levels and the healing process.   Friday - Didn't do as well as on Thursday but training was quite different, lots of basics and little sparring. While on as physically demanding, it still is challenging fitness wise, actually I dare say even more so! Oh yea, and Shihan kicked me in the privates while demonstrating a technique. He didn't get me in the jewels, which usually makes you feel sick; instead, he got me on the top of my member and suddenly had this burning sensation I never quite felt there before. (I didn't feel any pain I guess I was in shock!) Thoughts rushed into my head like, "I'm bleeding! MEDIC!!!" But yea my gi didn't turn red or anything, so it was all good. It was scary for like a minute or so while waiting for the burning to subside!  After training Shihan and I went over to Chris' place for dinner - he's a close friend of Shihan's and also trains with us at the dojo. His mom was over so she cooked a big meal (typical greek, cooked for 3 but enough to feed 5-6 people!) and we watched a DVD after. It was 12am by the time we left so I crashed at Shihan's for the night.   Saturday - Had a bit of a lazy morning, Chris came over to fix a leaky pipe in Shihan's bathroom and we sat around and chatted for a bit. I headed off about lunchtime back to Penrith and rested in the afternoon before going to Mey's bday thing at Darling Harbour. Made my way down to the city and took me ages to find parking, which redeemed public transport for me once again (despite its crapiness).  I finally met Alan (as in fellow Bruneian, Alan) and despite what Mey and Sheryl seem to think, I don't see any sort of resemblance or qualities about him that mirror or resemble me in any way. Oh well, I did only just meet him so I guess I should reserve any final observations for now.  The Shelbourne was... um, interesting I guess. The DJs weren't much good and it wasn't just my opinion from observing the looks of bewilderment on the faces of people on the dance floor as the RnB DJ transitioned from song to song. The retro DJ didn't fare much better, he wasn't even transitioning between songs. He was also greatly annoying me with his overuse of the technique of pulling down the music to let the crowd sing along. It works well when used on a song where the crowd's really hyped - but even then not on every chorus! *place murderous thoughts here* I guess the only saving grace the Shelbourne had was that it had cheap entry and it's a hotel, not a dedicated club. But still...  Yes I'm really pedantic about music and how it's delivered - especially since I've organised dance parties and stuff before (and once upon a time live sound was my living). Did I mention the music was loud to the point where it was DANGEROUSLY loud? (I saw all the statistics flash in front of my eyes - max duration of exposure at "x"dBs, "x" hours.) I forgot my proplugs (special purpose earplugs) too, dammit.   Sunday - Basically sat on my ass the whole day, didn't help that I had a cold and felt like crap, must have been all the smoke from the night before. At least I managed to get a decent sleep for once.   Monday - Went to SAE (the college I graduated from) to pick up my degree certificate and as I was entering the front door, Lana (the so-hot receptionist) spotted me while coming back from her lunch break and called out my name. Now that's really funny because as I was walking in, I saw that she wasn't at the desk and I was thinking, "Aw, she's not around!" :P  Anyways, she graciously escorted me to the building adjacent to show me where Rene's (my ex-lecturer)temporary office is due to renovations. They're expanding the college and they've incorporated CGC (Computer Graphics College) into the building since buying it over last year. A shame really, because CGC had a great facility on William Street just 10 mins walk away. (SAE is just shit by comparison.)  While waiting for Rene to be done with another student, Veit, one of my ex-classmates walks in and we did a bit of catching up and he went into a long bitch about the state of the audio industry in Australia and how there is basically no work. (I feel better now for working in IT because I know I'm definitely not missing out.) I collected my certificate shortly after and all I can say about it is... I'm not sure what to say really! It's perhaps the most sorry looking degree certificate I've ever seen, my Certificate IV one looks more impressive. Oh well, it is just a piece of paper after all, but what a sad one it is - SAE, you've outdone yourself this time.  Onto training in the evening, and tonight I felt good. I was holding the big pad for John and usually he hurts me through it, but tonight I stood my ground and I even flustered him during the last round by hassling him constantly. He likes to keep his distance because of his reach advantage and I wasn't giving him any room... and boy, it felt good to be able to stand up to the stuff he puts out. :)  I still have a ways to go in other areas, but that one small thing made my night. Shihan was happy with it too, said I even had that "dead look in my eyes" or expressionless face that you strive to have. Reason for it is not to show your opponent anything and it sure as hell works. Hitting someone with everything you have and seeing them not even flinch sure takes the fighting spirit out of even the best of fighters.  Time to ice those legs and get to bed.
