I want to mock them properly.  I think i am in need of some more blood as the horrific sounds that came out of my speakers have seemed to caused my ears to spontaneously explode.  Wow, it starts so nice.  Then they sing.  /me sneaks back out of Nyx' realm.  P.S.  Fer all ye non-gaming type people "/me" means emote.  It'd show up as "DarkWolf sneaks back out of Nyx' realm" on other player's screens [:]
