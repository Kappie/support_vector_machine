I hope that Santa brought you a nice load of presents and that you can remember at least the beginning of the night on new years eve.     I was looking at the Toaster Files today and noted the question that you had posed regarding Cats or Dogs.  I am somewhat surprised that you asked this question as it surely is obvious that Cats = cack whilst Dogs are by far a superior form of animal let alone pet.   Why? I hear you ask. Well aside from it's just because I say it is please let me enlighten you with the following:     1) Cats are evil  2) Cats do not do what they are told  3) Cats soil my drive with cack and I am forced to stay up late at night and boot them when I find them at it.  (Interesting story here involving neighbours cat, my foot and a call almost made to the police and RSPCA)  4) You would quite happily boot a cat across the street.  You would think twice about doing this to a dog. Especially a large unpleasant one.    5) A dog will guard your house.  A cat would probably leave the door on the latch to let burglars in because they are evil.    6) Cats stare at you with unnerving evil intelligence  7) Women tend to prefer Cats.  A perfect reason to hate them and cats.    8) And finally Dogs on the whole are harder than Cats.   Speak to you soon mate.
