Let us not make unhappiness a chronic habit, therby affecting yourself and your associates.   It is blessedness for yourself and others if you are happy. So keep your happiness without condition.Do not make happiness a condition.   If you possess happiness you posses everything. To be happy is to be in tune with god.  The power to be happy comes through meditation."   --paramhansa yogananda
