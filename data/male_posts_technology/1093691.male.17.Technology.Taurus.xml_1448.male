Yest i have rollercoaster tycoon 2 and have had it for ages but i have forgotten how to delete senorios, i will have a look and let you know, I spent today watching and analysing the first ever full run of 'The Tempest' Which although is currently about 5 hours long, is seriously looking good, and as Nicki says come see it, tickets are on sale NOW, either from reception (near woodhouses office) or drama studio. and as ever i am the Technical Supervisor, have just spent £387 on the technical side of the show, and i have gotten my own way, we are having low lying heavy fog drifting accross the stage, it is gonna look great. I have a physics exam tommrow and i am going to fail, so guess what i am off to do. See you all soon.  Dave
