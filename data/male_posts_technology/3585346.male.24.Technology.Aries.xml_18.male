After all, this is one of the big match everyone expecting in Euro 2004.  I can't sleep also probably because I been sleeping too much yesterday. Start to feel the blues of Monday, weekend are so short for me. Been lamenting always, some people lament just for the sake of lamenting though.   Thinking of the receipe stolen from my mum, braised pork.....lotus stem soup and not lotus root soup...I like soup a lot and I thinking of doing this lotus stem soup some times next week at Adrian's house.  Up and coming is my friend's wedding real soon. Actually I also pretty envy couple that get married. The vows are so nice and sweet but come back to real life is really harsh seeing the increasing divorce rate in Singapore make one wonder if they really got the correct partner in life?  ** Roger ponders to sleep.............
