With some information of this nature it might be up for a day or two and then removed. Its happened many times. What I've been doing is copying that information and emailing it to myself via G-Mail. Now I can search for this stuff no matter where I am at or what computer I am using. I am also emailing contact information there that I might need.   So far I am having a great experience with Gmail. The user interface is very intuitive, the inbox refreshes automatically, and it has excellent labeling and search capabilities. "
