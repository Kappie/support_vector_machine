Since Mel and I are moving into our new house on January 30th, I decided not to put the DSL account in my name. What does that mean? No blog until that time, because the webspace given by the new ISP will be used by the account holder. The forum will still be up at  urlLink http://www.timdorr.com/spyder , so if you happen to visit this page once in a while, stop by the forum instead for the next couple of months until I manage to get my own space again. Thanks!
