Unix is much better at making use of a CPU than any form of Windows.  That Celeron 366 overclocked to 550MHz without problem on my old Windows 2000 machine.  During certain activities (mostly compiling), the computer (the same CPU now in my OpenBSD machine) would completely freeze.  This is not normal for Unix, so it must be the overclocking.  Running comfortably at 366MHz, the machine should be 100% stable.
