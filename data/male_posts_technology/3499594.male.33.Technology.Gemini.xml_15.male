Can't wait to see next weeks episode of Johnny's accident. Also looks like the blonde chick is in it for awhile on the season. She will be Johnnys new babe. I am also glad to see Walt taking a stand on Sarah, make a decision. Too bad the kids in the middle.   For those not watching the show, you missing out. Looks like this season the plots are a bit more complicated and that, too me, is good.
