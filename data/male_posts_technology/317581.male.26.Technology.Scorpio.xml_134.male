(5 days and counting down) I'm just tired all the time. I did get my CCR the other day. They're on Vinyl and I'm loving them, when I get to Cahlen's room to listen to them. Maybe I should sleep more, I think I'm falling asleep right now.  hmm... SPU starts tomorrow which means I have had some friends move back to seattle:) It's good to see friends.  Speaking of which, Steve's back in town which is always a whirlwind of drinking and partying:) Also, there's another guy I know coming up from portland this week...  well, good night, and Trav, I'm serious dude, don't you be fallin for my girl...
