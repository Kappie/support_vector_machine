So anyways, yeah about three weeks ago I went to Kauai with Andy and got to visit my Great Aunt and Uncle and my dad's cousins which was cool.   The first day that we got there, we took a this hike, which for me, was the second time, the "Secret Tunnels Hike".  It's this hike that goes through just a crap load of mud and eventually you come to these tunnels that go through this mountain (Mt. Waialeale) which get's the most precepetation per year.  Well I tried to do it a long time ago with my old travel partner Thomas which was crappy, we hiked barefoot and just messed up our feet, anbd didn't finish the hike cause it was too late.  Well this time, we got to the tunnels which were crazy (I'll add pics shortly).  I honestly felt like Indiana Jones.  I mean, we found these tunnels and they go through the mountain, well, it was innaresting to say the least.  We rented this piece of crap car, which me and Andy called "Mama" short for Mother Goose, which came from Gray Goose.  But it got us around everywhere.
