I went to a Korean Household and a Japanese Household today and guess what? Their daughters roxs! I always wanted a Japanese wife and I do not mind a Korean wife as well, they are so sweet, cute, pretty, sunshine and loving young lady.   I will be chanting for a Japanese wife while i doing OT to motivate myself! **Roger drools to work.
