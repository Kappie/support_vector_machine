I remember i have advised my friends saying "It's bound to happen" when something of this sort happens to them.But now it has happened to me. Should i say to myself the samething, yes i did. Can we say then that 'Life is all about taking things lightly'. My Answer would be 'The answer is not that simple'.Enough of those philosophical stuff.This weekend passed away for me in the same way as it did for the past few two months. Watching TV,cook , eat and sleep...and more watching TVand reading books. I read 'Fermat's Last theorem' by simon singh..really a good read. Apart from describing Andrew Wiles' passion towards Fermat's Last theorem from this childhood days in a rather simple way, Simon also provides information about the background of this theorem and how Fermat drew inspiration from Diophantus' book 'Arithmetica', giving credit to ancient Greek mythology.The author has taken much care to provide the reader an impressive read by not just dealing with Fermat's Last theorem instead providing a valuable chronological series of events that culminated inFermat's declaration that he had a 'truly marvellous proof' to the then mathematicians,the event which would keep the great minds of next 358 years looking to reconstruct that infamous proof, only toend at Andrew wiles' lecture at Newton institute in Cambridge.
