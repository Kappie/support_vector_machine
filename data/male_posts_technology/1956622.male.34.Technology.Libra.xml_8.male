We took pictures of Karissa loaded the many things in the car.  Well I made it back to Houston it is actually the 25th of April but I had to finish the entry.    I dropped Karissa off at her aunt and uncles with Lisa.  I wanted to see Jimmy and Jeremey but Lisa said they had testing and cannot stay home.  I think she just did not want me to talk to them.  I hugged Karissa.  It was so hard to leave.  I left crying I held it as much as I could but it was hard to leave her we had such a good time.  This is so wrong!  Karissa should not have to split time with her mommy and daddy.  But Lisa wants it this way so what am I to do?
