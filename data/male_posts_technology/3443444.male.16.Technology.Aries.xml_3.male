As you know, I have a blog at Xanga.com, which I will be abandoning for this one, since Google will soon take over the world, I might as well start now.   Well, here I am, my new blog!   Oh Yeah!   I've had many good memories at my old blog, but it seems that it turned into work to keep it updated. And yes, I do realize that this is the same exact thing....but its not, this one looks better, and the look of the bookmark isn't all crappified as was with Xanga. Ok, to be completely honest, I made this blog out of sheer boredom while sitting here after school with Meaghan, waiting for her mom to get here to give me a ride home. But it really is better.  Enough with that...on Saturday, we had our standard poker night, only better because it was at my house instead of Popham's. It was also improved because of the fact that I was up to $24 at one point...I started with $5. I knew I should have cashed out right then, but I really like poker and wanted to keep playing, along with my nemisis, Mitchell. It was rather even, up until "el mano de diablo" as its come to be known. In this hand, Mitchell was dealing, and he dealt me pocket 2's, a crappy starting hand, but it was better than the ones I'd been getting for the past 45 minutes, so, I played. We both call, the flop comes, 4, 2, ace. I have trip 2's. I bet $5, he quickly calls. The Turn comes, 8, no help, I check, then Mitchell bets $5, thinking he has 2 pair, I call. The River, a 10 or something. I check, he checks. I flip over my cards with excitment, only to be crushed when he reveals his damn pocket aces. I lost. I nearly died/killed him at the exact same moment. That was the biggest pot I'd ever been involved in, over $20. After anoter run of crappy cards, I eventually have a semi-good hand, and go all-in, I have him beat up until the river, in which his damn flush, beats my straight. I was angry.  On Sunday, I did nothing, I did nothing and it was everything that I thought it could be. I just layed on my bed, watched TV and/or listened to music, and talked to people on MSN messenger, and played online poker, in which I played in a Tournament on Pacific Poker, and got 20th place out of nearly a thousand people. Not quite my highest finish ever (which was third out of over 800) but I think I did quite well.  And now today, Monday the 24th, I sit at school, waiting for a ride home as you know. And am bored out of my skull, but I am listening to Eddie Izzard, so thats a plus.  But anyhow, I must be off, for the ride is due in a while.   - Lee
