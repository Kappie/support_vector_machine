I'm having a hard time alternating between loving TV, and hating it. On one hand we have amazing shows like Smallville and Scrubs. On the other hand, we have this mindless fucking  drivel  that is reality TV. Normally I wouldn't give a shit, but when my cable channel of choice boots out Futurama for Big Brother 2, I get a little pissy. Make that very pissy. Urine all over my pants leg pissy. This utter tripe that is reality TV seems to be gaining in popularity. It just keeps getting bigger...and bigger..until the amount of lousy reality TV shows are, at this point in time, pretty much on par with the amount of junky sitcoms out there on the airwaves. And guess what. Will they dump some crapass soap or lousy sitcom for BB2? Oh no! That would be asking  too much ! Nay, instead they'll be airing it in the same timeslot that all my favourite quality shows -what few there are - currently air. Uber-pissy. Thank God for alternate sources of entertainment. If I was one of those poor schlebs without a PC and a net connection... let's just say restrictive pullovers with straps on aren't my bag, baby.  In another oh-so bizarre twist, an argument regarding anorexia sprang up on  urlLink Soap Dish , a forum on Prophecy. Of course, some champion of the female cause, some avatar of raging feminism, goes completely off the deep end about an unrelated issue, like "Men aren't interested in sex" ? What.The.Fuck? No seriously.  What.The. FUCK!  ?  We  aren't interested in  sex ?. Christ lady, what fucking DIMENSION are you from? I won't even say planet. 'Planet' is not enough to convey the utter ridiculousness of such a statement! Sex is the   only   thing we males think about! The only way a guy wouldn't be interested in you as a sex object is if you look like Gwyneth Paltrow in that fat-suit from Shallow Hal! If women were as interested in sex as we guys are, the only thing we'd be doing all day every day, is shag. 24/7. If 15 minutes goes by without a straight guy thinking about porking Liz Hurley or a gay guy dreaming about shafting Brad Pitt (or something along those lines), then there's something seriously wrong with said guy. The difference comes in how some guys  handle  these thoughts. Guys today can repress it pretty well, what with all the pro-feminism crap spouting out of every media-fountain on the planet. Perhaps this fruitcake's rantings about men not interested in sex is merely because she's lousy in the sack, or something, I don't know. All I know that's for sure, as a guy and as a guy that hang's around other guys a lot(coz that's what guys do), is that we think about head  plenty . You wanna know why? Coz it's so fucking hard to  get some , short of paying for it. How are  them  apples tasting?
