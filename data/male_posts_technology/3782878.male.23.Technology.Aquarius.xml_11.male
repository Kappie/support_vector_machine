I am not even a wizard yet I get instructed by my god to assist him, obviously I have done something wrong for my god to hate me more than usual. So I meet up with the frilly High Elf, and I show him the way I slaughter my enemies with my newly found 4rd circle of spells. he was impressed, and eventually decided to show me his abilities. After a few moments of this, he achieved the enlightenment needed to use his own 4th circle of spells.   After this, he wanted to try out his area of effect spells, I decide to let him. Never let High Elves play with their new found power, they will kill us dark elves, however unintentional it may appear. And they dance on our bodies, I've never seen them do it, but I know secretly that they do enjoy this. At least he was useful enough to drag my body back to the Plane of Knowledge book for me to recover my materials. Then he made the second foolish mistake, deciding that we go to Paludal Caverns. I unfortunately being foolish myself and quite mad with power decide to agree and go with.   When we arrived we had to avoid many fiendish mushrooms and rogues, before we arrived at the Phlargs, which my ally seemed heartset to kill. the first one we took out placed a foul disease on us, and nearly killed my skeletal minion, I asked Kredien if he had the money for the coffin's we would probably need to get our bodies back out of here if we fail. He said he did, I nearly used all of my powers to kill the phlarg. Then my ally decides we might need some curative potions for disease, I agree and he leaves.   Unfortunately I got a bit carried away and did I mention I was a little power mad? thinking I could take on the world with enough poison and disease. I attempted to take on a phlarg in a duel, I lost, and it tossed my body in the river. Took some time to retreive, which I did under invisibility. Then when I got back, Kredien was back with the curative potions, and we took out another couple of phlargs, before a wandering phlarg snuck up behind Kredien, and before I could warn him, it killed kredien and began to hunt for me.I ran it and others back, and shouted to all who could hear me to clear the way to Shadowhaven, for I was running back there to survive. Apparently Kredien had just gotten in the way as I had made it to Shadowhaven, and died again. All the costs of our folly I suppose.I hope my god does not ask me to go out with this power mad wizard again, I think I've learned my lesson about being a bit less egotistical. But if Innoruuk commands it so, then so shall I serve.   Love is a weakness, it must be shown behind closed doors, Qaz
