As I pass a corridor on my right a woman I know is talking to one of her co-workers about something work related.  She smiles at me as I pass and continues to talk to her co-worker.  She is wearing a yellow shirt.  Pale yellow.  It reminds me of Easter.  I keep walking.  After another ten feet the same woman appears again, standing in the same position, as if she's talking to her co-worker still.  But he's not there.  As I approach her I don't turn my head, I don't want to look at her... it doesn't make sense to me that she could be in the hallway twice at practically the same time.  Out of the corner of my head as I pass she turns and begins to smile, but her face distorts and becomes grey and grotesque.  She grins, but it turns devilish.  The image fades.  The Rain Falls and the Sky Shudders.
