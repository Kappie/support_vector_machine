I've spend this morning writing down some of the concepts and ideas I want to incorporate into this game:    It will be a story-driven RPG, where the story is mostly linear. It will not be a powergamer's RPG, it will be the storyteller's RPG.  The player plays a ghost in a fantasy world.  I want to give the player a feeling of sadness and despair. The point is not to scare the player; instead get the player to sympathize with the ghost. I want the player to feel alone.  The player initially gets to play the character's last days alive, then the character as (un)dead.  Most of the story will evolve around an underground settlement in a world of hostile fantasy.  The story may skip in time, as ghosts and death itself don't experience time as living beings do.  What happened? What happens? Why? Much of the story and the game itself will be about finding out what and why it happened. Discoveries and more mysteries.  This settlement decays as time goes by, and the player gets to experience the same area in different time periods. Visit the same area 100 years apart. Much has changed, much is lost.  The character, both in living and ghost form, talks to himself (much like in the games Max Payne): "Wait. Was there something in the shadows?", "I feel the pain." The player will be guided through much of the story by this voice.  I want to avoid large turn-off texts. Think how Morrowind did it, and you know what I want to avoid. Keep the texts fragmented and small. Keep the player's attention, and keep most of the storytelling within the environment the player experiences the rest of the game. No large books to read.  I want puzzles involving time, death and living/dead humans and other creatures to guide some of the story. All sidetracks of the story should be connected to the main story the player lives.  The ghost may find and take over a new living host to interact with the environment.  The visuals and sounds change as the character takes on another form/host: As ghost, the vision is blury and glowing with excess fog, and the sounds are echoing with mumbling/whispering in the background. As a human, the visuals are clear and crisp. As other lifeforms, the character may get infra-red vision, black/white etc., perhaps like in the Alien vs. Predator (12) games.  The player can perform only limited interaction with the physical environment as a ghost, but has access to the spirit world (magics, spirits, ghosts, demons, horrors, etc.) Once the player aquires a host, it can interact with the environment in the same way as the host itself would do. Ie. humans can talk, cats see well in the dark, dogs bark.  The environment may also act different to different hosts. Some parts of it may be hostile vs. some (think human factions).  The character advances in skill and potency both in its host forms and ghost forms. This will allow the character to gain new abilities and new ways to interact with the environment.  Fighting will be unavoidable, but not the main part of the game.  The game will utillize a 3d-engine. See alater post on engine for spesifics and thoughts on this subject.  There will be usage of fog and particle effects to create a ghostly feeling to the game. Black fog to create really spooky areas and effects.
