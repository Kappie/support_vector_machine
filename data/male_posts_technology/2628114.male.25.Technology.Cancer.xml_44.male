I ran a little later (~10p.m.) down Madison to Grandin and through one the best retirement neighborhoods in Cincinnati.  The neighborhood (behind the Country Day school) was really neat and really scary all at the same time.  The houses were gorgeous and the overlooks were spectacular but there were no streetlights so it was treacherously dark.  I made it through unscathed and ran back to the 'hood and back home.  Everything was good, but my knee pain was still quite apparent.  How odd.  Keep the ibuprofen coming!
