I have this INSANE Computer I built and a phat pipe to play on. It'll be fun once we can play in game together again.   MY SYS SPECS  Radeon 9600xt AMD Athlon Mobile 2600+ overclocked to 2.5ghz 80gb WD 7200rpm HDD Sick lookin' case 19" monitor (flatscreen crt) Shuttle an35n ULTRA ---shitty speakers...oh well. I need a new sound card before I invest in a 5.1  Boo Yah.
