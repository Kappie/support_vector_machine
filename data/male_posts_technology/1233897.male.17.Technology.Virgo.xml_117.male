Gwen’s slightly worried that we’re going to be at each other’s throats all night, but I actually want to meet him. Whatever... We’ll see how it goes...  Josh, Trevor, Derek and I are getting together at Trevor’s house to construct some... *pop*ers for the retreat tomorrow. Oh, I tested the air horn last night at youth group: vewwie vewwie loud. :):)
