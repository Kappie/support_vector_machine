I read something that disheartened me in one of Howard Zinn's books; "Howard Zinn on War". He's talking about the Vietnam war and how it was started. It's all summed up in one short paragraph: "Congress -- with its traditional cowardice, and based on lies told by President Lyndon Johnson, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara about the supposed attacks on American vessels in the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964 -- had given LBJ a blank check for mass murder."  Is the scenario sounding a little too familiar? Those that don't learn from history are bound to repeat it. Now the question has to be; why are we back here? Why did we let Bush get away with everything when he gave us so little to go on? The frenzy of 9/11 clouded our mind at first so Afghanistan was a given. The pain was much too real yet and it gave us an enemy with a face. Something we desperately needed or at least needed to believe at the time.  Now what about Iraq though? No hard evidence, intelligence briefings that were years old, no ties to al-Qaida; there were talks between the two but Saddam looked at al Qaida as the biggest threat to his regime. They hated each other from what I've understood. Was 9/11 still so close to us that we were still blinded by rage? Are we still too close to that point and if so who will be the next target?
