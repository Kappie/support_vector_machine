Anyway, Her Boyfriend of a month isn’t talking to her, and all because her brother, who was also there,  mentioned to him that she had snogged another bloke down there. Unfortunately, I saw her snogging two different men, but I didn’t want to say anything at the time… Now I am “Concerned Councilor Gristy” WTF?  Aha, If only I had my camera, I could show Sabs Photos to jog her memory :-)
