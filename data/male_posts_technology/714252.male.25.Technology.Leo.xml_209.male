By twelve I just wanted to go home but it was little sisters birthday so couldn't really go anywhere.. Was good fun hanging out with her but OMG was I tired.. Think Sat night took it out of me to be honest.  Things are strange for me at the moment.. I trying to sort out my head about a few different things. It's strange because I am still in a good mood but I have to make some pretty serious decisions very soon or risk ending up annoying people\hurting people.  All very cryptic I know.. Sorry but I can't really say more cause I don't know quite how to phrase it but hey, I'm sure you will all think it involves people it doesn't in situations it doesn't and I'll have fun cleaning the mess up.  I love stress.
