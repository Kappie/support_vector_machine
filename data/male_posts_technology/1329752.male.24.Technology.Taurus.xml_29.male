North Japan around the year 1275. Your profession was that of a jeweler or watch-maker.Your brief psychological profile in your past life. Such people are always involved with all new. You have always loved changes, especially in art, music, cooking.The lesson that your last past life brought to your present incarnation. Your lesson is to learn discretion and moderation and then to teach others to do the same. Your life will be happier if you help those who lack reasoning.   ... die eri* die ...
