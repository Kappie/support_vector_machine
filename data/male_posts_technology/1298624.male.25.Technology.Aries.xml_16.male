Oh, I forgot to tell you thanks for lunch! That really made me full.   I think I must've talked to every employee in 21st Century today. Call after call after call when I came back from lunch. I don't think I mind though. I'm starting to think there's something wrong with my phone...in that it gives me the next call straight after the other with no time to prepare. Oh well...it's all good.  I think my jaw is getting better. I exercised for a full 30 minutes (not my regular hour). I thought I would take it easy at first and see if I could do the basics. No problem there :)
