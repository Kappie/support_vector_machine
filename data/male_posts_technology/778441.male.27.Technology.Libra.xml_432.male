The history of sport is replete with such examples that take our breath away! Every sportsperson dreams of something like this! Its perhaps the most fulfilling moment in a sportsperson's career. And a ticket to instant superstardom!!  Kobe Bryant's tying  urlLink three-pointer with 2.1 seconds left  in the second game will go down in the history as one such memorable sporting moment!  And as though repaying Kobe for getting them back into the game, the LA Lakers ran all over the Detroit Pistons in the overtime to  urlLink win the game 99-91 !!
