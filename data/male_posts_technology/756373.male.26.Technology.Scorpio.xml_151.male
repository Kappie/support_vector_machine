"“Countering terrorism has become, beyond any doubt, the top national security priority for the United States.” Thus speaks the 9/11 Commission Report, released last week. “There is no terrorist threat in this country. This is a lie. This is the biggest lie we've been told.” Thus speaks Michael Moore in an October 2002 speech. President Bush has a plan to stop terrorism. Michael Moore does not."
