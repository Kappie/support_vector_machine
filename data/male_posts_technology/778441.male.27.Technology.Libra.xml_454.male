The move is allegedly to check the spread of pornographic messages and illicit news in addition to preventing deceptive advertising. But the real reason behind this blatant attack on personal freedom is to prevent the cell phone from being a tool for voicing dissent against the government's one-party rule.  This move comes after last year's exposure of the Chinese government's cover-up of the true extent of the SARS epidemic in China. It was partly due to the text messages exchanged by China's cell phone users that the cover-up by the government was exposed to the world.  With text messages coming under the microscope, will voice communication stay unmonitored for long?
