I had hoped it would get me through college and my first year of working.  Well, now that college is many moons behind me I figured it’s about time to make good on the deal I made with myself.   So, after weighing all my options, I decided on either the Saturn Vue or the Haundi Santa Fe.  I didn’t want another car, but I didn’t want a real SUV either, something in the middle.  It had to seat 5 comfortable, be baby compatible (you never know!), and have at least 200hp (the most important part).  After driving both the Vue was the clear winner.  It felt bigger inside, rode better, had a higher level of finish, and most importantly has a silky smooth V6 made by Honda.  The Montanian in me screamed when I opted for the 2WD version.  Unfortunately I live in the desert, and there’s just no good reason to get lower fuel economy and higher insurance for something I don’t really need.  Plus, if I can get through the worst winters Montana had to throw with a front wheel drive, drum break, car, I think I can handle it with 4 wheel ABS and traction control.  So I was riding high on my new car vibe for about 6 hours, then I read about some safety test that the Vue didn’t do well on.  In fact the article I read made it sound like my car was minutes away from the tires falling off.  Needless to say this took the wind out of my new car sails rather quickly.  I imagined myself driving the Pinto of the 21st century.  Thankfully after doing some internet research and reading the report from the NTSC I figured out it’s not as bad as they made it out to be.  Apparently the local news didn’t have any crack houses or babies in wells to report on so they just dug up whatever they could find.  Tomorrow they’re running a story about how escalators can eat your children.  I did find out that Saturn is a great company, and typically dose the right thing.  In fact, if I’m not happy with my car in the first 30 days I can bring it back and trade it for another one.  I also found out that half way through ’04 they changed the suspension around, so my car isn’t even affected by the problem.   So in conclusion I’ll say this:  Saturn = Good, Honda Motor = GREAT, Going easy on the car for the first 500 mile to break everything in = no fun, having only 200 miles to go = Good, Jeremy = Happy.
