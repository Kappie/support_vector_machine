I didn't even manage to win one by default because she didn't fuck up once!  This is so not fair :(  Actually, I really enjoyed it to be honest :) I like a challenge and pool seems to be a new challenge for me to try and get my teeth into.  Also I have started putting content into my new site ;)  Looking for salsa peeps to volunteer some time to put listings of what's on where into the site. I am finding it very slow going getting all the details in so any and all help is appreciated (Just put anything you know of in and I'll approve it ASAP.. Where possible try and get the text from the promoters own sites because I don't want to be accused of favouritism by mistake when someone thinks the other promoter got a better "write up")  Also I moved into Orlas this weekend :) I have to say I am finding it very dificult to motivate myself to go out.. You know that just moved in feeling when you are in a new place and you just want to enjoy it for a while? Couple that with the desire to spend time on the couch with someone you love having a nice glass of wine and watching something (anything) on tv.. (Once she doesn't get too cranky..) and it's hard to find reasons to leave the house :)  Anywho.. I gots to go (Orla is up at like 5.30 or something ridiculous like that in the morning..) so it's of to bed for the man with no fore-skin..  Good night, and good fight..
