I don't have the denial letter with me right now (I am at work on the weekend again!) but I will post it tonight or tomorrow.  I don't think I realized how much I wanted to go back to school until Claire put the envelope in my hands.  It was too thin for a acceptance letter.  I said, "Well, crap."  Crap.  Now I am looking to go to  urlLink ISU  as a  urlLink Student-at-Large  to begin with and work toward a Masters there.  I might reapply at UIUC next year.  Not sure.  It's too late to officially aply to ISU as a Masters student.  So Student-at-Large it is.  My friend Dawn did that last year.  She works a few cubes down from me.  She even got permission from our boss to take a day class.  She still did the 40-50 week, but every Tuesday and Thursday from 11:30-2:30 she was in class.  I will see if I can do that too.  Here are the majors that are of varying interest to me (in alpha order).  I opened it up to general interests as I am not sure I want to stay with Information Science/HCI stuff.  I may still but I want to start with many options.              urlLink Accounting       urlLink Art, School of       urlLink Arts Technology       urlLink Economics       urlLink English            urlLink Philosophy     urlLink Politics and Government     urlLink Psychology     urlLink Technology     urlLink Theatre, School of
