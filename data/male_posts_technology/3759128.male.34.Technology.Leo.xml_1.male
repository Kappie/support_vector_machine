Itâ€™s a shame that it will be their last CD as it reminds me considerably of the earlier music that they produced - green album, Orbital 2 etc,  Pants, You Lot and One Perfect Sunrise are probably my favorite songs on the album, but as with all CDs I buy my opinions change over time, so (hopefully) I will be able to listen to Bath Time without cringing and skipping forward. :-)
