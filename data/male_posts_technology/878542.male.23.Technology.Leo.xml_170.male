I'm not that far from muscle beach, so you may see me there occasionally.   full of challenge, full of fun. I have had a good two days so far. I missed the superbowl commercials, but I imagine the really good ones will be findable on the internet.  ugh, too much change, not enough sleep, I'm going to bed early tonight.
