He leaves her for dead and takes the emormous wad of cash.  3. She regains consciousness, and after he ignores her order to surrender, she shoots him dead.      What sort of man smashes a woman's face in?  The sort that deserves one in the head!     In any rational country, that would earn you a parade.  urlLink  In Australia, it just might earn you some serious time.      I checked all the Australian press. Even Rupert Murdoch's outlets are spinning poor Karen Muratore as the villain.  We need Australia to be more like us, and less like Great Britian.    Brothers and Sisters, it is time for outreach.
