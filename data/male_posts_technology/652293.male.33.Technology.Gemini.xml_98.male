But, as the article states, and as we all know, he is going to need a lot of help from Outside.  Alaska is a very conservative state.  But Knowles was mayor of the largest city in the state, and a two-term governor.  He is well known in both urban and (importantly) rural Alaska.  It will be a tough battle for the seat, but with a lot of help in money and time he can win it.   urlLink S. Murkowski  is a talking head of sorts.  She's never held a statewide office, and  urlLink G. Murkowski  (her father) gave her the job.  She's already got a lot of money for Alaska industries, but most of it has been with the hand-holding of "Senator-for-life"  urlLink Ted Stevens .  And Stevens and  urlLink Don Young  are rather powerful.  They may be able to get S. Murkowski to hold the seat.  But she won't be able to do it without them.  So, Tony, get your Web site going.  Get your  urlLink Meetup  on.  Here is some  urlLink info  on The Tone, via issues2000.org.  The info is slightly outdated, but I  assume  most of it is still valid.  Also, here's a brief  urlLink bio .
