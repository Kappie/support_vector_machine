From a thesis I am reading at the moment:   "In the context of MDA, the input language [of a transformation] resides on a higher level of abstraction than the output language."   Codswallop. If you choose to use MDA that way, you're welcome to it, and its probably the most compelling scenario, but that's like saying that Java can only be used to write applets.  Once again, the OMG publicity work is probably responsible, although one can hardly criticize them for leveraging the most popular applications of an idea in an effort to advance it. Its unfortunate, though, that people seem unable or unwilling to understand the idea properly.
