That is to say, after talking on his cell phone during the previews, quite loudly, to billy bob, he proceeded to talk to his girl throughtout the movie. What I especially enjoyed, was when he pulled out his chewing tabacco. Fortunately he had snuck in a can of pop so he had a place to spit, otherwise who knows where it might have ended up. Needless to say, I didn't thoroughly enjoy sitting next to mr. "breathes extremely loud". Maybe next time I'll not see it in Woodinville, perhaps that would help.   christmas/workmas  I'm back from christmas at home. I went home friday evening around 9 pm.WEnt to a kick ass party at Amidys on saturday night. Unfortunately, i lost my voice that night, plus I had to get up at 5:30 to drive down to fuckin corvallis. Oh well, I got to see my grammie. She has alzheimers a little. So she can't really remember people. On monday my work called, even though I was in OR, to tell me the network was down, even though there was someone in seattle that was on call. So I worked for 30 mins on monday. Joy.   For christmas I got, Shrek, Episode 1, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and final fantasy. Oh and I got some clothes and a gift card for target and some cashola. Not a bad christmas, but I really need to be at work tomorrow for a full 10 hours. So I'm going now.  TTYL- T
