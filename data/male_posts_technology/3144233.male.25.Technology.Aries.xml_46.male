Johnson  orders some custom-made trousers from one Joe Haggar of  urlLink Haggar Clothing .     “And another thing - the crotch, down where your nuts hang - is always a little too tight, so when you make them up, give me an inch that I can let out there, uh because they cut me, it's just like riding a wire fence.”  “If you can't leave me an inch from where the zipper [burps] ends, round, under my, back to my bunghole.”     Some pretty funny stuff really.
