The only thing women havn't done in the us, is have one of them become the president. It will happen pretty soon. When a woman becomes president, i say that all of the feminism should stop. What are the feminist's main problems with the us of today? Let's check:  1. Strippers. Feminists hate strippers. The feminist thinks that just because the stripper is stripping, it degrades them. NO. It doesnt. They get paid REALLY well for it. You dont even have to be that GOOD of a stripper to do it! Jeez, just for jiggling your ass around for a while, you get money. Christ, i wish I could jiggle my ass around for a while to get some money. Like that's going to happen any time soon.  2. "The Glass Roof" above all business women. ...no. The only glass roof that I can see, is the presidency. Dont worry, that glass will meet it's grisly end by a louisville slugger soon.  3. Gender equality. Why there will never be absolute gender equality is because of the inherent contradictions between equality and liberty. For example, if a guy wanted to say a joke about women at work, or hung pornography in the work place, it would make the women work in an environment that may seem hostile to them. If someone at work frequently referred to women as chicks, and a woman was offended by it, the woman would then be working in a hostile environment. If a woman wants to be treated equally in the work place, then she shouldn't be offended at what guys usually talk about. I think it's unreasonable for all women to be content with whatever people do at work, and for guys to go out of their way to change their lifestyles to conform to what's politically correct. It's impossible to live your life without being offended at something. Violence, foul language, pornography, sex, religion, whatever it is, you're bound to be offended by it sooner or later. So rather than bitching about it, just deal with it and move on. Men aren't out to get women; we're not the bad guys. Besides, I'm sure that women make jokes about guys, too. I wouldnt know, because of my lack of estrogen, but, i'm pretty sure there are a pretty few jokes/shauvinist remarks about men from women. It's not like they have the inability to create them.  I'd rant more, but I want a bagel. ta ta.
