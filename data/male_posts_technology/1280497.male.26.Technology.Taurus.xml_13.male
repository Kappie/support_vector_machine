Here are the first couple lines:   Do you remember the first time that you visited an Arab bazaar or a cattle auction? Do you remember the first time that you entered the visitors' gallery at the New York Stock Exchange or a foreign exchange trading room? Your reaction to these experiences is likely to have been one of bafflement combined with a bit of amusement   On the subject of the authors' (Heinz Riehl's and Rita M Rodriguez's) perceived reader--just who the heck do the authors think I am? Yeah, I remember the first time I was in an Arab bazaar. Yes, it seems as though it was just last week, I was walking through the streets of Cairo, a canteen in my hand and an undeniable urge to scream out, "Bazaar! Bazaar!" Those were heady days, when I traveled the earth in search of bafflement and a bit of amusement. Thanks for the reminder, Riehl and Rodriguez. I would not have been able to relate to this book unless I had thought back to those experiences.
