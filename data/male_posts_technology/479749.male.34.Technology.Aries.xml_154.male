Check out the demo I did with some photos from  urlLink John 's birth with me laying down the narration track and the music of  urlLink George Winston  serving as background.   urlLink John's Birth   I've also got Microsoft's  urlLink Producer for PowerPoint  that I'm going to try a longer demo with once I get a chance. Look for the link to the demo to appear here soon.
