That shootin' thing would rock! So then, we drove to Papa's Chicken in Loveland also, ate a very-leet meal and then took off to Carmike to watch Will Smith drive an Audi in a movie based off Issac Asimov's "I, Robot." It had US Robotics, Audi,  and Converse in it, along with Will Smith and some robots killing people. It's a great movie that has to do with the Three Laws of Robotics. I hope you know them. Anyways, we got home and I re-arranged some stuff in my server room, I have to plan on getting those two old 486's (they're Vectras!) to do SOMETHING so they don't just get older...and older...and older. I could make them into print servers! (Maybe. I'd have to buy a new parallel cable, because my printers are either USB or CAT5E.)  Anyways, go see "I, Robot!"  [Music:]None!
