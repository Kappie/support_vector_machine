This has, in effect, forced me to do a lot of thinking. I've concluded that I hate the title of my blog. It's not funny. It might have been cutely self-conscious at one time--but probably not. It sucks.  As much as it sucks, it will never be as bad as the Klingon-language   urlLink bo logh  , which is probably just Kingon for  blog.  Judging by his links, the guy appears to be at least an armchair linguist. I guess he thinks that makes this kind of hobby okay. Well it's not.  The tragedy is that I might be interested in what this person has to say. Blindly clicking his links is promising. Of the ones that aren't in Klingon, there are some discussing  urlLink civilization as social construct , etc. That's not a tough argument to make, but the point remains, this might be a worthwhile individual,   if he didn't speak a fake language  .  So now we're into the realm of the metaphysical.  Just what differentiates real language from a fake? Those are just labels. Labels cause wars.  I imagine any one of the previously mentioned trustafarians saying something like this. They and the Klingon enthusiasts are in league against me.  In the end, I defer to the greater wisdom of the  urlLink Portland Mercury , whose  urlLink Frank Burres  crystalized in  urlLink Qaolin  what I suspect of most Klingon/Human hybrids:   It is, of course, a strange road that leads one to this place, to a point in life where you apply makeup and a fake forehead, speak a fake language, go by a fake name, and practice twirling a fake sword so you can go to the bars.   Yes, it is a strange road indeed, and it begins in Iowa.   At least that's where it began for Qaolin, who back then was known only as Jim Covill, a struggling Art Education student who dressed less extravagantly, spoke only earthly tongues, and only sang karaoke occasionally in English (and by his own account, he sucked).   I don't know if it's an image thing for everyone who dresses and speaks like a Klingon (or a Jedi or an Elf), but I bet the percentage is huge.  The blog has a poll with a total of 6 possible responses. Only one is in English. It says, "huh?? What??". Cute. 91% of voters picked that one. The sample is obviously skewed because the poll appears on a Klingon-language blog so obviously more voters will be able to speak Klingon. Still, 91% is not   nearly   high enough. If society is indeed a social construct, then I'm all in to do some  urlLink deconstruction .  Incidently, after reading a few  more  of the non-Klingon links (ex.  urlLink 1 , urlLink 2 , urlLink 3 ), I've narrowed my possible grad school fields of study by one. I'm definitely not going to study linguistics. These people are all obsessing over some pointless and picky-flicky minutia. I guess it was too much to hope that all linguists had the gravity of the only two linguists I've ever really read,  urlLink Wittgenstein  and  urlLink Chomsky --more naive still that I'd assume linguists didn't tell jargon-laced linguist jokes the way engineers tell engineer jokes and on and on.  So thank you  bo logh .  I have a feeling I'm going to open my blog tomorrow and it's going to be bare except for some strange tongue scrawled in paint.  It will all seem very mysterious but will turn out to just be "OMG Yr teh sUx" or "Worf for President".
