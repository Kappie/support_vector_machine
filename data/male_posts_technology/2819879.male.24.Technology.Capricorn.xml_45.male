And 2 years ago, it was the month I graduate from UBC.  Although all those things used to seems critical in my life, after so many years, they seems to be less and less important to me nowadays...  The question is... will anything happen to me... anything super special, this month?  So far, seems highly unlikely.  I'm too chicken to go after any girls.  I still can't fully make up my mind about the whole going back stuff.  I still can't c myself in 5... or 6 years...  Okay, there's one special thing - it's gonna be the first time I pay tax and fill out the forms all by myself, the first time in my life...  Not a very pleasant thing compare to those good old ones, eh?  The whole growing up thing... one has to face more and more unhappy things instead of happy ones.  Seriously, I want to write down some happy stuffs here.  But so far, the only thing I can think of ... is Nintendo's next handheld, NDS.  Hopefully, it's going to be super super super great.  But I read a stupid negative news on google about how the duel screen's cost will hurt Nintendo in many ways.  Since each and every cellphone, mp3 player... whatever, needs LCD screen nowadays.  LCD screen's shortage has made them more and more expansive.  This sure will be a big concern for Nintendos...  See? Even the happiest thing so far has its dark side...  I should give up just now...
