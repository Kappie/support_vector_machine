Here's what happened:  VacantSilhouette: AHHH!!! VacantSilhouette: I'M GOING TO BE DEPORTED TO TEXAS!!!! StormsBelle: ... StormsBelle: what?! VacantSilhouette: According to the state of oklahoma, i was never born. StormsBelle: ... VacantSilhouette: They CONFISCATED my birth certificate!!!! VacantSilhouette: NO JOKE. VacantSilhouette: I do not exhist. StormsBelle: No way..  VacantSilhouette: Because the rest of my birth certificate (sides my name) was typed. VacantSilhouette: My name was written in using a pen. VacantSilhouette: ...I dont exhist. StormsBelle: No way..  VacantSilhouette: Seriously! StormsBelle: ...  VacantSilhouette: We have this piece of paper that says "You can contact the drivers license fraud division at 425-2477 to inquire about your document" VacantSilhouette: (Can i put this chat in my blog? I'm too lazy to type it all out again.) StormsBelle: .... StormsBelle: [yea] StormsBelle: That's INSANE!!! VacantSilhouette: I thought they were gonna arrest me or something!!! VacantSilhouette: I know!! StormsBelle: and what do you mean: VacantSilhouette: I'M GOING TO BE DEPORTED TO TEXAS!!!! VacantSilhouette: That's what they do to illegal aliens. VacantSilhouette: I have no ID anymore.... VacantSilhouette: ;_; StormsBelle: Your serious?!? StormsBelle: meaning.. go bai bai? VacantSilhouette: I'm joking. StormsBelle: ... VacantSilhouette: Silly devin.  I'm serious. NO joke.  In conclusion, i fucking hate this state, this country, and all of the people in it. Except for a few. A few select people.  (My dad called the examiner lady [after we left] a cunt.)
