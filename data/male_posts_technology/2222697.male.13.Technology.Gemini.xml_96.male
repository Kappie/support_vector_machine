I never was really fond of pc controllers because they were always deformed.   I will bring out the most minor problem in my life now and rant about it, what else would help make my blog more bloggier?  Ry, the one on my blacklist... Is acting like a jerk, don't know why, but I thought about it while I was cutting out sprites. It is almost like he is jealous of me or something, but again, I am more mature than half the people walking the earth.   nehh   I am about to mow, boring as helk.  g'bye ^_^
