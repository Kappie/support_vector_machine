I haven't been able to find any resources that clearly explain how to do form submittion using the Spring MVC yet.  I am thinking of getting the MERP version of Spring Live but looking at the demo applications that he has on the website for the book, I am not convinced that he really knows the correct way either.   If anyone actually reads this and can provide some good resources on form sumbittion using Spring MVC I would sure appreciate it.  I have been struggling with this for a long time now and it is getting really frustrating...
