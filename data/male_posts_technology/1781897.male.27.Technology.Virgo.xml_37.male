Because this is the first "close" death in the family, I really didn't have an established method of mourning.  I thought that the best way to honor my grandmother's life and death was to live yesterday to its maximum potential and to celibrate it!  Here is what I came up with:  Drove to San Francisco....saw the bay...saw the ocean.....saw the city scape...enjoyed my ability to see.  Went for a long walk...smelled the air....watched people hustle around...slowed down enough to enjoy everyday life and routine.  Went for a 8 mile run.....enjoyed my health ( and did it in a personal best time!).  Smoked a big 'J'.....enjoyed my ability to roll like a cuban.  Made a really fancy dinner......enjoyed my ability to cook and spoiled my senses.  Learned a couple of songs on the guitar....enjoyed my ability to be musical.  Hung out with close friends.....enjoyed others who are on this journey with me.  I feel that my grandma would have been happy with the way I spent my day because it was all about enjoying where you're at, when you're there.....you never know when it's gonna be time to move on!
