I had a quiet day yesterday... nothing special! ... was at home most of the time. Except in the afternoon, I tried one more time to go to Fabindia to get that elusive Kurta... and guess what!! ... the store was open!!  (well, its the first time that I found it open... uptil now it used to be closed whenever I went there!!) . And I actually managed to buy a Kurta...  *LOL* .  Apart from that... ate a lot of cakes, ice creams till my tummy was screaming to be left alone. ;-)   *LOL* ... anyways... more about my day, tomorrow! ... rite now I'll take your leave! ...  cheers!
