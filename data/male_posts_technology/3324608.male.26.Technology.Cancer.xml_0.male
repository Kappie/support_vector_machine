I have sinned quite a bit but I still have a bit of room for error. My life is a tug of war between good and evil.     Are you evil  find out at  Hilowitz.com     Silly on-line tests!!!  I demand a re-count!  Some of the questions were only true because of stuff from my past, so I'm probaby less evil now, maybe 35% evil or so.  Either way, I'm more good that evil . . . so the battle is not lost.  Must  . . . keep . . . fighting . . . against . . . evil!
