But I have not given up completely, All I have to do is maintain a diet and routine for 12 days and it becomes habit after that. So the experts say. I really do need to do this. Heck, I get winded getting up in the middle of the night to take a dump. LoL Anyway, I'll update with my success or defeat at a later time.
