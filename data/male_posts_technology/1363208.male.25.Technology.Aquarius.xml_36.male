I've never made such record before -- burning the last of the candles that I have for the whole night. Yeah.. I am quite used to sleeping late but staying up late at home is different from  staying up late at work. Man... it's really exhaustive. Previously, I stayed up to 2am and I was already exhausted. Now.. much more than that.   Result:   I didn't go to work today.    What's more. The core of the payroll software is actually a shit. It doesn't work. Tho I had to modify lots of things to move the data from our Time Management System into the software; modify a lot more to make sure there's no error halting the calculation process; but still the most sinful error is the process itself. Man.... actually it churn out errors. The total's wrong. How could it be said as "WORKING"?   DAMMIT!!!
