The second was named the " urlLink Karvonen " method. It creates narrower ranges and is (supposedly?) preferred by endurance coaches.  Also there is some “logic” behind Kervonen Method. Since you are never going to have a HR below your resting HR, subtract resting HR from max HR. The HR reserve (=MHR-RHR) is the "working" HR span and HR will always fall within the HR reserve, no matter how hard or easy you go. It makes sense, then, to take percentages of HR reserve when gauging intensity. Does it?  Don’t get me started about determination of max HR for each type of exercise! ;-)
