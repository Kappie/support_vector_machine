I bought an X-Box, which BTY used up every dollar I had(and then some). I quickly remade the money. Fixed/Built a computer for this dude for 115 bucks, and got some money from some other stuff. Bringing the grand total up to around 200. And bla bla bla bla. Ohhhhhhh I saw Chronicles Of Riddick (My friend and I had a Riddick day, Played the game saw pitch black then Chronicles.) Which was an awesome!!! IGNORE THE REVIEWS THEY ARE SOOOO F***ING WRONG!!   Umm, OH YEAH. so that Indi Film I made turend out to be a flip. Special effects and casting and otherstuff. We (Neon Productions)are making a "Mocumentary" about stupid people. The website can be found urlLink  here . This one will actually happen.  thats all for now.  OH one quick note, I leave for Germany on the seventh of August. ^_^ YEAH
