Details like no. of posts posted, no. of words posted give an interesting statistic.  When you fill up the profile, you can search for bloggers who have the same interests. For example, I had quoted Alaipayuthey as one of my favorite films. When someone views my profile, they can click on "alaipayuthey" to see who else have listed the film as their favorite films.  Similarly you can click on locations, say you want to know how many bloggers are from Tamil Nadu or perhaps Chennai. So why don't everyone update their profiles. It is going to take only a few minutes.
