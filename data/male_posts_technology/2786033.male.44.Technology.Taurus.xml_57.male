They put onions on - - I said no onions."   "You forgot your world history book at home? This is a miserable failure for one 7th grader, isn't it?"   "So usually when I get to the coffee shop I get there when no one else is in line and the two women who come in after me usually yknow well today they were in front of me and I had to wait My coffee trip was a miserable failure."   "Ready for this miserable failure of a meeting?"  Write your own miserable daily statements in the comments section. Difficulty parameter added: No references to Sen. Kennedy.
