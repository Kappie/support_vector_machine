I knew there was a good reason I put this on my census form: To all the nay-sayers if you have a look at the bottom of the article you can see that Jedi is a recognised religion in the UK!   urlLink BBC NEWS | Entertainment | Film | Jedi 'religion' grows in Australia   Anywho, no more real news at the moment. Officially single in the true sense of the word again and not quite sure where to go next. Looking forward to Salsa tonight, should be interesting to see how things go with Helena :)  K, on the phone with a silly customer, blog more later.
