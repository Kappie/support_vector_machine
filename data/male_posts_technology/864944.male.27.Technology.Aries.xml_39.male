The sun streams in on weeknd mornings, and there was a decent spring breeze this weekend.  Very nice :)  What else is going on....   We have bought a new car for Christina.  Her old beauty.. (i call her Leviathan) was on her last legs, so we got Chris something new and nice.  A subaru Legacy '03.  Its slightly used, but its a very nice ride.  Poker is going well.  We had our neighbors over for the first time for a poker night.  I think they enjoyed it, though it turned out to be some night as we had 15 people.  Very busy.   Also it was Chris Schumacher's last night with us as he is moving to Anaheim to go make his way in the pro poker world.  We're all so proud of him, but we'll miss him.  Now... a cool poker story:  Last year, I went to Vegas with a bunch of friends.  This was back when the poker wave was still rising.  I had started playing, but all the friends I was with were not yet.   At any rate, I made it a point to head to Binions Casino and pop into a very high stakes tournament that was going on.  I brought Chris Schumacher's poker book with me.  I ended up meeting several poker stars, and i got them to sign Chris's book.  Well one of those guys is a player known as Antonio Esfandiari.  He had been new to the pro circuit, and I had seen him on TV.  I recognized him and asked for his autograph.  He was absolutely floored.  He was so excited because I was the first person to ever ask for his autograph.  He called his friend on his cell phone and told him right then and there that he was living one of his dream moments.  I was very happy for him, and pleased to have been the person to have done it.  So fast forward about a year.  Antonio recently won a large tournament and became a millionaire.  He was interviewed in Card Player magazine in March, and he relived that moment for the interview.  He said that it had been a lifelong dream to have someone ask for his autograph.  Well he didn't mention me by name in the article (he wouldnt know my name) but I recognized myself.. and that was cool enough.  Its like there being a picture of a famous person and you see someone's elbow just in frame.. and i can say.. "Thats my elbow!".    heh.  Well.. thats all for now.  Thank to everyone who reads this blog.. im always surprised anyone does.   We have a housewarming party soon, and we're looking foward to it!   Until next time!
