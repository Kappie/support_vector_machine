Despite only a partial quarter of sales, Microsoft tablet PCs accounted for 1 percent of European portable sales during the fourth quarter."

 Can't wait to get my hands on a  urlLink Tablet PC . However, I am waiting for second generation machines only because I can't justify spending the money at this time.
