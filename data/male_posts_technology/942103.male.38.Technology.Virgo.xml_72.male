He's a very nice person and patiently answered all of my questions about the program.    One of the best things about the program is how wide-open it is.  There's only one required course in the entire track,  urlLink ACS 881 , and everything else is decided between you and your advisor.  In a nutshell, I have to start out at the Master's level, where I'll get an MA in ACS.  From there, I'll go on the the Ph.D.  The ACS Master is two tracks:  24 credit hours plus thesis or 30 credits without.  I'll be opting for the 30 credit track, if only because I don't want to get bogged down with a thesis that ends up taking much longer to write than a semester.  And the way I procrastinate, that would be the case.  Also, the 30 credits route requires that some of the credits be in  vocational designs involving management skills .  Historic preservation is specifically mentioned.  Even if they don't accept the credits I took (nearly 10 years ago now) at  urlLink Eastern  I can still do HP.  How cool is that?   From there, on to the Ph.D. program which is an additional 18 credits (I think...) plus dissertation.  About six years, once I start the ball rolling.  He was also happy to hear I've had experience teaching (Earth science, astronomy, physics) at the college level.  He said they haven't had a problem placing students in grad assistantships up to this point and if funding stays constant, I should be able to get one.  Rock.  I was walking on clouds the rest of the day.  It was also a really pretty day and the sun was out.  Sandy had to keep hold of my shoelaces to keep me from floating off.
