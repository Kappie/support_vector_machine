Whether it is actual money in the bank, unused line of credit, or funds stashed away in investment accounts, I get a certain amount of satisfaction in knowing that I can survive for a certain period of time without income.  At the present time, I figure that I could survive just over 12 months before I will have to do something radical like tap into my home equity or borrow from credit cards. And if tapping into home equity isn't considered radical, I could probably survive 4 years this way.  So the question is, is it worth trading a little piece of mind (in the form of withdrawing money from my "unemployment fund") for a little piece of mind (in the form of less debt and lower monthly payments). I mean, what is the trade off here? What is the ideal balance between debt and cash-on-hand?  I suppose having 12 months of expenses as cash is a bit excessive. I mean, with my current skillset, and the economy improving slowly, I will never need to relive the cold winter of late-2001. But I can't help but be paranoid.  So what I have decided to do is withdraw two months worth of expenses, and use the money to pay down debt. This reduces my safety net to only 10 months. But reduces my monthly minimum debt payments by 10%. (Man, those credit card interest rates are a killer!)
