I sold a couple of things on ebay and I had to figure out how to package it using FedEx cause the buyer wanted me to use his FedEx account number.  Well, that took me like an hour to figure out...well, morning is killed.   I need to re-arrange the frames in my office.  That will kill the afternoon.  Let's call that a day.   -Mustafa
