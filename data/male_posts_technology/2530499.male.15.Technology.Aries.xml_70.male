You can save someone's life just by being there for them...for being who you are. If you throw that away, then you've wasted the most precious gift that can be given to anyone. Making someone happy is a truly powerful thing, capable of moving mountains, so please, don't leave. Never stop trying. Never give up...   Because the World Needs More People Like Us...
