It seems to me, I need to spend some time alone. Or at most, just hanging out with guys not even thinking about girls. That would seem like the only logical thing to do, especially if I don't want a rebound relationship. I think it would be best to heal. I mean honestly, I feel as though I should be alone for a while. I don't want to be one of those people that NEEDS to be in a relationship. I want to be the kind of person that if a relationship comes along I can be like, sure, but not strangle it.   It's like I would really like to be in love with somebody, but I don't want to just be in love with anybody. Does that make any sense? AKA, I would like to have someone to love, but it DOES make a difference on who that person is. I'm not just going to want to be in a relationship with any ol' girl. I think the healing process requires lots of piano and video games. Maybe even throwing myself into my work for a while.  Well, I'm off to practice the piano.  Peace-
