Had a few choice beverages, drinking with the crew from work. Mainly IT but also some ex facilities (Chia and Kylie). Discussions were afoot of the Ball and how to organize the tables etc. Then I moved on from there out to Berley's house for a sendoff for Shaz and Mikey who are heading off for two months on a trip around Australia ( urlLink http://home.connexus.net.au/~drift/ ). It was a good night, caught up with Berley, Shazzy, Gerty, Troy, Mikey and Ricky. All the usual good fun, laughs a plenty. Some of the dancing was a bit of a concern, I'm not sure Troy and Shaz should ever be allowed near swing music again :)  Saturday was involved in working for a big part of the day. It was originally looking like all day, but we did some scripting and managed to get it down to finish at about 1:30, which made us all very happy indeed.  Then I did some Shopping at JB, which is my arch nemesis, and met up with Clare for a few drinks and a bite to eat. We went to transport and sat outside on the river side. They do a decent beer and very nice chips, so we just sat there overlooking the river and chatted about various things that people chat about :) It was good (as always) to catch up and it was a very pleasant way to spend a few hours, especially when I expected to be in at work :)  That night we went to Helen's birthday celebrations. It was at Tolarno's in St Kilda, on Fitzroy st, which is the pub owned by Ian Hewitson. It's a pretty good pub, and as can be expected, the food was fantastic. We were in a semi-private salon, just us and one other group, but because of our size we were still on two tables. So I sat on the table with Prue, Aaron, Kaysie, Rex, Terri, Helen and Joe. But that was really only for the meal, otherwise we mixed it up a bit. On the other table was Rosie, Damien (Kennealy), Morton, Erin, Jessie, their brother whose name I can't remember and Jess' boyfriend who I haven't met. A good time was had by all and I downed a few beers to add to the afternoon's lot. :)  Then Joe and I headed off to Twister to meet up with Clare Peta and Nikki. However, despite the fact that the girls are regulars and were recognized as such, we didn't get in. Joe and I suspect that one of the security guys (142) doesn't like us and has decided to stuff us around. Since he's the one that knocked us back twice before, for no particular reason. Anyway, so we trooped up to the Espy and had a few beers to drown our sorrows. Then Joe and I headed off home, telling the girls to give it another shot at Twister, since we figured they would have a better chance getting in without us. It's no biggie for us since we don't actually like the place and only go there to hang out with the girls. Whereas they love the place and have lots of friends there :)  So that was it so far. Now I have procrastinated enough and need to go and change a tire on my car. It got a slow leak ages ago but now it's at the point where it's super flat and won't hold up for anything more than a day. In theory I should put the spare and the good back tire on the front and put the two worn front ones on the rear, since it's a front wheel drive car. But we all know that's not going to happen, too much like hard work :)
