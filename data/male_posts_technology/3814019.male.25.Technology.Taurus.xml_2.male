(This is a potential religion in my book, not like the sad gits that all put 'Jedi' in their census forms, you know who you are!)  Current deliberations are whether to get a mullet or an 80s style power perm, and try to make a career by performing terrible 80s rock songs as a shorter fatter version of some spandex wearing ponce, the only drawback being i can't sing, but hey this never stopped anyone! This is the way forward i feel for mine and Ricks future boy band 'Fat Guys From Oldham'. More band updates as soon as we think of them in the hours of extreme boredom we endure daily.  /Evil Monkey signing out
