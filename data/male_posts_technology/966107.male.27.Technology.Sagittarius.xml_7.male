The standard, 802.11b gives a throughput of 11Mbps (Bits) and the standard 802.11g gives a throughput of 54 Mbps. For normal end-users, this kind of bandwidth should be sufficient where the application of the wireless connection would be to access your files. emails, calendar etc in a meeting, on the move etc, for a short period of time. The response would of course be less than what the users are used to on the wired LAN, but having some access is better than not having at all, isn't it?  The main use of the wireless scenario would be access the internet. Given that the dial-up internet access still does not exceed 64 Kbps or 128 Kbps in most cases, the 802.11b standard should be more than enough for years to come. However, as noted earlier, in the office, the bandwidth requirements/ available are on the higher side, so it would make sense to go for the 802.11g standard equipments.  Also it is not required for the networking guys to enable wireless connectivity for all the users in the enterprise, the cost and other factors would be too prohibitive for that. However, we can target a few high priority users like the top managements, key sales personnel for wireless connectivity. OK now, this talks about the feasibility and the accessibility of the wireless network. We will look at the techincal part of the same in the coming days.  Till then cheers!!! Please do not hesitate to email me in case anyone has any comments on this.
