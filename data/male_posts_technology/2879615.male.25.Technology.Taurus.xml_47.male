Throught out the afternoon, the two were assited by Luke, Kimbo, and Doug E. Fresh.  There was much success especially when Doug was mopping the kitchen floor.  P.S Magic erasers are cool.  Anyway, Autumn Leezy is looking nice.  So try to always remember three main locations of Autumn Lane:  1. The garbage can 2. The sink/dishwasher 3. The ashtrays  Also, there is a coffee maker box with odds and ends that were left around so if your missing anything, maybe it's in there.  Peeeeeeace out you big black africans!  A-funk
