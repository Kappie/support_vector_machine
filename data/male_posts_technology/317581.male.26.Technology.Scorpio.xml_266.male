We were supposed to go out with Michelle and Tracy that night. We were going to see a movie. I remember how you were going to talk to Tracy about how you liked her. But that never happened. I remember walking to school and thinking how that accident seemed really bad. I remember wondering where you were. Then the principal came over the intercom and everything stopped.   From that moment there has not been a moment that I don�t miss you. I remember how we used to just chill and play videogames. How you would smile all the time. I remember how good you were at sports. You would�ve made varsity this year for sure.  It�s been one year since you were on your way to school and that lady hit you coming around a corner too fast. She�s off paying her debt.   But what about you? There is no coming back. No homework to distract you. No person to call when I have a bad day. No one to talk with about her and what she might mean. I can feel I�m losing you. I�m sorry.
