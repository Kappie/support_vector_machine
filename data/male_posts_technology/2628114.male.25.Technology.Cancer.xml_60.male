I had planned on running 9 miles for the weekend, 6 on Saturday and 3 on Sunday, but after an atrocious display of golf on Saturday I wasn't feeling up to running.  Instead I decided to run all 9 miles Sunday, but due to time constraints, I had to split it over a 5 mile run and 4 mile run.  I will summarize both below but overall I can say that two runs in a day is surprisingly cool.  After a break on Saturday, I felt fresh on both runs to the point that I felt like I could have run a marathon yesterday, just split over a 14 mile run and a 12 mile run.  I did both runs again with my iPod and even though I have to carry it, since it will pull my pants down on my hip, I enjoy the flexibility of having more than an hour and a half of music.  5-mile Overlook Run This run is increasingly becoming another one of my favorites and I did something I have only dreamed of doing thus far.  From my house, I can run to about 5 various overlooks that give you a wonderful view of the River, Newport and Bellevue, Cincinnati, and things of that nature.  These overlooks proved quite cool in the winter when the sun was setting or rising but they were no less cool Sunday.  I went through Twin Lakes Park first, then up the hill to whatever overlook is above that.  I then got a wild hair up... somewhere and decided that instead of running up into Mt. Adams my usual way, I would run up Hill Street.  Heather will be most familiar with this street considering she probably drove it many times.  I wasn't fortunate enough to have motorized transportation but I conquered that murderous hill with surprisingly little effort.  I would compare it in difficulty to Monastery (also in Mt. Adams) but way different because it's at a steeper angle.  The bittersweet victory of that hill is interesting.  You feel tremendous that you have conquered such a hill but then you have nowhere to go but UP AGAIN!  Needless to say, I took a one minute breather at the top and walked to get my breathing back to normal.  I could have run through it, but there was no need.  After that, I continued on to other overlooks behind Playhouse and next to the Art Museum and then adjourned to my house.  I started pretty slow around a 9+ minute pace but ended well below a 9 minute pace.  The rain that fell before this run helped to cool the temperature down but unfortunately, it also increased the humidity to about 22,000 percent.  Despite that it was a great, great run!  4-mile Criss-Crossin' The 'hood Run This run almost didn't happen because I was still concerned about running twice in one day and I had felt some tightness in my muscles in the previous run.  I set out anyway right as it was getting dark with iPod in hand.  All my worries of two runs in a day or tightness in my muscles or fatigue melted away as I completed the first mile.  I fell right back into pace and ran every road that connects Taft and McMillan from where McMillan meets Taft all the way West to Victory Parkway.  At Victory Parkway, I went North up that and circled back around home down Woodburn.  The temperature was great, I felt great, and the iPod helped me to hammer through the four miles in the 'hood and get back and go to bed.  I felt so good running that I started at a sub-9 minute pace and finished well below an 8-minute pace.  Nothing much else to report beyond that.  Sorry for the long post, but I was really excited about feeling so good on both runs.  I'm back at my midweek, morning (hopefully) runs tomorrow with 4 miles.  Look for more updates then.  For a final thought, a quote that summarizes my feeling when I made it into NYC. It's official, raise your glasses, 'cause this party gonna go to Damascus.  Have a great week!
