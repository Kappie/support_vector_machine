"sugar, ah honey honey, you are my candy girl, and you've got me wanting you. honey, ah sugar sugar, you are my candy girl, and you've got me wanting you."    urlLink  sugar honey - archies   umm... hehe. it's a 1950's song by the archies. my colleague asked me bakit daw puro oldies laman ng fone ko. dati daw rock and lite alternative and now 1950's to 80's oldies. umm.. well it's much better than listening to boy band musics. (no offense sa mga BB fanatic ha...)  isa lang na appreciate ko sa boy band, it's 98 degrees.   "baby I, really know by now. since we met that day, you show me the way. I felt the day you gave me love I can't describe, how much I feel for you. I said baby I, should have known by now. should have been right there whenever you gave me love.  and if only you were here , i'll tell you, yes I'll tell you..." =)   does the highlighted part makes some sense?... i guess.   work muna me. take care people. onga pala muntik nako mapaaway dito sa magallanes kahapon. umm.. di ko alam kung masama ba ko makatingin or talagang trip ako nung gago. yung kundoktor the jeep nang aano eh... umm...  siguro kung nde ako naka polo and nde ako late umm... lagot.  work muna me.   -fin-
