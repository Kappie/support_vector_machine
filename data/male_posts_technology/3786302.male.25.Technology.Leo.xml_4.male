Now, this is supposed to be a blog where I am supposed to log my thoughts. So I will see what best I can do to put my thoughts on paper...oops...keyboard !! Generally, I think a lot, a lot, a lot about things around me and happening around me. Some disturb me, some make me happy, some enrage me, some make me smile. Now let me see if I can atleast touch upon some topics out of these. Enjoy. Bye.
