The  urlLink London Theatre Guide Review  says about the play...  The Reduced Shakespeare Company, perform a collection of sketches that is sure to have the Bard turning in his grave. Shakespeare has never been lampooned with such disrespect before and no doubt never will be again. All his sonnets are reduced to eight lines, his comedies are condensed into one short sketch, and the tragedies are ridiculed unmercifully. Hamlet is abridged into a two-minute sketch that can even be performed backwards.   These days the RSC is in Mumbai and will be performing the  Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)  at the Sophia Bhabha Hall at 7:30 PM every day from 29 th  Jan 2003 to 2 nd  Feb 2003.  I would love to go and check it out!! :-)
