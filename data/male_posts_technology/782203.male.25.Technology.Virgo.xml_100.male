They could be the next big thing after Linkin Park (ughh hurts me just to say Linkin Park) but with the big difference that this bunch of kids are actually talented musicians, especially the bass player he's awesome! Well the vocalist sounds too much like  urlLink Tool 's Maynard on some tracks (like 'Closure') but then again how many bands can be called original nowdays. They are already getting quite a buzz in the US of A so let's see how long before they get heard on SIngapore radio if ever. Tracks to check out are 'The Red', 'Comfortable Liar' and 'Send the Pain Below'.
