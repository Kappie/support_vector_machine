I'm glad I had my MP3 player with me...  Its weird, If been through the Lib a couple of times recently and I havent seen many kids drunk on watered down shandy.  Maybe its because of the exams, but maybe because they have found somewhere else. Think I might have to go there this weekend, havent had sex in the square yet.
