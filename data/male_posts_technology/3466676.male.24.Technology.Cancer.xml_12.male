The papers used the titles "Returned Wallet Restores Faith" and "Lost Found and Many Thanks".  I have to admit that those titles were better than mine, but they get paid to write and I do it for free.  In a final toot-my-own-horn moment, I would like to say that neither of the papers edited a word of my post.
