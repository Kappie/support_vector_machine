My first thought was a picture must had fallen off the wall (happened before). I looked down the hall then in the other rooms. Nothing unusual or obvious. Then it struck me. The ice machine in our new fridge. The new fridge we acquired yesterday has a water and ice machine in it and I am not use to the sounds.   On another note this morning, I read the following in an email article and had to pass it on.   "Kerry for President camp just handed me the kind of story I can't keep away from. The new "religious advisor" to Senator John Kerry previously joined the lawsuit filed by atheist Michael Newdow to remove the words "under God" from the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag! Kerry's new "religious advisor" -  urlLink Rev. Brenda Bartella Peterson  - was one of thirty-two clergy members to file an  urlLink amicus curiae brief  in behalf of Michael Newdow. This is the woman that John Kerry plans to send to America's religious groups as his representative. Polls show that almost all Christians and the vast majority of even non-Christians in America, do not want "under God" removed from the Pledge. So what religious groups is she going to represent John Kerry to? Gay Unitarians? "
