Maybe I'm slightly prejudiced given my proximity to LaToya's hometown (Oakland), but I really don't think anyone else had near as much talent.  Maybe George Huff, but he wasn't really on point all the time.  I've seen some recent news reports about the voting system in American Idol, and how the tallies can be thrown off by powerdialers (script kiddies with computer applications that dial the same number over and over), as well as limitations of local phone line capacity not allowing enough votes through from different regions.  Personally, I think A.I. should go to a one vote per viewer format, so we get an accurate representation of who really is America's favorite.  AT has considered this type of system but doesn't want to spend the money tabulating the results and sorting out duplicate calls.  Lazy bums.  American Idol could truly be a representation of America's pop culture, but not until these serious problems are addressed.  To me, the only worthwhile reason to watch next season is the auditions, after that I'm through.  How about you?
