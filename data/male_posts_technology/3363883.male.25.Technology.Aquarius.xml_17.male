I picked her up and we went for a couple of beers at one of the scenic pubs in Abingdon.  This is the Nag's Head.  Probably the most expensve pub in oxford, but it's basically on it's own island in the middle of the thames and is just glorious when the suns out.  So it's pretty much worth the extra 20p a pint.  Over Dinner we talked about old times and it came out that I wrote to one of her ex-boyfriends ridiculing him for the way he treated my sister.  Honestly, this guy was laaaaaame and he treated my sister like .. .. .. .. well not respectfully in any sense of the word.  Dany didn't know about this and I think it reassured her to know that as her little brother I will always be protective of her.  If you don't see anyone for a couple of years, it's easy for your perception of them to differ.  After a casual beer we went back for a nice curry at my local curry hut, the Balti House.  We then went back to the nag's head to continue our drinking and introduce Dany to Paul and Paul, my other flat mates.  A nice calming evening all around.  The next day, Dany and I had a sleep in 'til about 9:30.  Very relaxing.  She's currently sharing my room.  She's in the inflatable mattress which has managed to take up ALL of my floor space. Still.  I can't say it bothers me to have my sister there.  Although I was a bit upset to be told the next morning that I need to see a dentist about my teeth grinding.  :- )  We were supposed to be on the road nice and early but we didn't end up leaving until midday as we were too busy downloading songs in preparation of her 30th birthday party coming up next month.  Going through listening to Peter Allens - Rio is quite a lot of fun.  It's dampered somewhat by a totally tone def sister but her enthusiasm does make up for it.  We ended up going out to stonehenge for a look.  For my description please see an earlier blog entry.  They're big rocks.  'Nuf said.  We also went to the white horse.  I live in the vale of the white horse district.  This is taken from the picture of a white horse that has been made by digging into a hill until only chalk is coming through.  This was done rougly 3000 years ago.  The view from the hill is absolutely gorgeous.  It's a shame that you can't actually see the horse probperly due to the shape of the hill.  The best way is with a plane.  Oh well.  That evening, I took dany for one of the worst meals in Oxford I've ever had the displeasure of eating.  A quick noodle bar, I asked for scezchuan chicken with noodles and received a pound of salty chicken skin on rice.  I was just flabbergasted.  Moving swiftly on, we went to the eagle and child and Dany can now say she drank in the pub where part of Lord of teh Rings and the Narnia Chronicles were written.  I offer nothing but glamour and class I'm telling you :- ).  And today.  Well, it's a friday and I'm back at work.  Fortunately we have a company meeting which is following by complimentary drinks for an hour.  Ever wondered how many pints of lager you can fit in any hour?  If it's free and your under pressure 4 is certainly possible.  I've done 5 but I'd rather not go down that route again.  This will be closely followed by some authentic mexican fajitas and burritos cooked by one of the girls at work.  This dinner party will consist of about 12 people.  At my fathers request I will get around to include a photo that may or may not include me but won't have my flat mate Paula s he's sick of looking at thim and would like to see some local "tottie".  Love ya Dad.
