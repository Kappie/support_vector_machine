Then we went to a comedy club. That was actually pretty fun.  urlLink Comedy Underground  Then we went to Goldie's, which is a "casino" here in washington. All-in-all it was a VERY mild bachelor party. Cliff drove me around for it, so I drank a little.  Funny thing is, I got home and went to bed 4 hours ago. I just woke up extremely horny like 20 minutes ago and couldn't get back to sleep. I know I need to change something in my lifestyle as I don't want to wait until I've lost my sexual drive before I hook up with a beautiful girl. I'm concerned that I may wake up one morning and not realize that I'm not hoping to have sex someday.  My thing is that there are so many diseases out there now that I'm scared to go to a bar and try to pick up a woman. For one thing, what if it turns out she's a dude? Next there's the whole disease thing to worry about. My main problem I think would be my job. I've heard jobs can be a great place to meet women. That's great, if there's more than 1 woman per 50 men.   So my friends are getting married on saturday. I'm nervous for this marriage. Anyway, maybe I can see some old friends at the wedding and try and get some dates out of it:)  Hope everyone is doing good and much less horny than I am:) Peace out-
