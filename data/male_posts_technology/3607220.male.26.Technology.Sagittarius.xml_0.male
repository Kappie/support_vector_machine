But what bothers me is the fact that by believing in GOD man has started disbeleving himself. I do not think I am speaking out of pride or arrogance and I do not claim this to be an original thought either, but the thought seems to be more correct than wrong to me.    Men seem to have forgotten their own divinty by beleiving in God and the heavens. And worse, they have started dispising themeselves, their very own self. I wonder what makes generation to generation of humans to beleive so strongly in God and the heavens but not in themselves, their very self. Great achievements of human courage  and labour are ascribed to God and the heavens, when in fact the credit should have been to the human spirit.   Is it not time for us to review our faith and see why is that we have such an unflincing faith in God but not in ourselves and our abilities?  What scourges India is not the poverty, not the illiteracy nor corruption but the lack of faith of its men on themselves. Indians will better beleive their neighbours of a few hours than years of themselves. They are more concerned about the opinion of their friends, relatives and neighbours than their own will and wish. They have more faith in sadhus, saints and godmen when it comes to divinity and sprituality than in themselves.  Hindus should not prey if they do not understand their religion, its very essence, how it has come about and what it means. Hinduism is a book that has to be read and reflected upon rather than kept closed and preyed on as any holy book.
