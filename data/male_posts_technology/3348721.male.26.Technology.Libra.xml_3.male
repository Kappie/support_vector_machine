They gave us truffles as a Christmas present last time, probably something to do with the ridiculous amount of money we used to spend in there.. Mmmmm but their Protein buzzes were so good!  I'm meeting martin afterwards. haven't seen him since the furries gig so it will be nice to have a chat and a beverage or two. it's so good not to be at work today!
