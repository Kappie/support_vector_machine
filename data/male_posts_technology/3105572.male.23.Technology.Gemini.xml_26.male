I don't always want to ask God what he wants for me because I have things that I want for myself.  Sometimes it is hard to tell if what I am doing is what God wants me to be doing.  I figure I know that I am where God wants me to be if what is happening is "good for the kingdom."  Ok, what I mean is something like this.  A few years ago I went to a new church.  I wasn't sure if this was the church that God wanted me at.  After about 2 or 3 months at the church I became involved in their music ministry.  God spoke to me through this and to others using me and the talents that he had given me.  I think that that is a pretty good indication that God wanted me to go to that church. I pray that I will pray more often asking God to tell me what it is he wants me to do. And, then when he answers me I pray that I have the strength to do whatever it is me wants me to do.  So many times I pray thanking God for what he has done in my life, but all to often I forget to ask him if this is really where he wants me, or if this what he really has in store me.
