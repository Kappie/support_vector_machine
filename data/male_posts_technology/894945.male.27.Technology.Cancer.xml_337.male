It was ok but it's always the same deal, the same band playing the same tunes, the same decor, year in, year out.. the only really surprising thing is this year I not only got up on the stage to dance, I made a Evil Knevil style jump from the stage onto a speaker stack. I lasted a good three or four minutes before the security guys came over and told me to get off.   We strapped on our jet powered rocket pants and junior birdman'd the hell out of there at 11, heading down to Liquid. It seems like the prices had dropped - I bought a Tequila  Lemonade and a Bacardi and coke, and I got change from a fiver!  The VIP lounge isn't really a big deal - nice little bar but no pole dancers or anything.   I medically need a pint of water and a bacon roll.
