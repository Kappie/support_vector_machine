So I am hesitant about maybe starting a class on it.   BTW what does your last line mean? I couldn't understand it.   I would say that both Kicha and Ganja are right in certain aspects of thier arguments. But still I would repeat what Kicha had said about reciprocivity. It makes a quite a lot of difference in understanding  the other person. It should be more of a give and take policy.
