Rather like 15minutes, except they thought of it first. Now heck, I respect these 2 guys a whole bunch - a good sense of humour and/or a flair with the written word is a lost art in todays 'Innernet" culture, where being able to type meaningless shit in haxor speak seems to be respected by the rather stupid (and large amount of) people who practice it. I ramble on. Here's the thing. Dislekcia rants about how elitism sucks. How people that rip off other people are being shitheads. How people with strong opinions on a matter , people who consider themselves better than their peers in their debatal subject of choice, are dickwads. Newsflash dis. In that little diatribe, are you not 'ripping off' people yourself? You are, in fact, ripping off people who rip off at people. Catch 22? Vicious circle? Looks like you're no different from the rest of us after all.  Us humans enjoy nothing more than trying to 'one-up' their fellow man. Be it games, at the job, among friends,  everyone  wants to be better at something than someone else. Everyone wants to be an elitist in whatever field they feel is their 'speciality'. It is part of what makes us human. It is part of what ensures our continued evolution. And I believe that everyone has a passion , a field, an area of expertise which sets them aside from the the rest. Dislekcia may not like to admit it, but he's better than average at RTS games than your normal, run-of-the-mill Warcraft3-playing pleb. Miktar denies it , but he has creative talents that most people could only wish for. They are, in a sense, elitists in their fields. Everyone is born with a gift that differentiates us from Joe Public. If this were not the case, we'd probably be a race of Borg-style automatons, all thinking and feeling the same things, all equally adept at whatever it is we do. Robots. Never trying to go 'one better', never trying to BE better, rather, just sticking to the norm, the true, tried and tested formula. Rather like Britney. .end rant.  And now for something completely different.  You know, it's funny how everyone gets their 15 minutes. Their short moment in the spotlight. In todays online culture, this seems more so than usual. I'll take for example , something I found quite funny while surfing the forums yesterday. Someone mentioned my post count, which is around 5000 posts over the space of 2 years or so. It struck me how absolutely meaningless being evaluated as a person due to a number next to your alias, is. Recently I landed in a rather stinky hotbed of piracy related politcal-correctness (read.shit), because some forum-goer had bitched that I, an oh-so-holy forum admin, had been 'fingered' as a warez-hound, pirate-game playing dirty-bird (Stephen King, how you have influenced my mind so.) Instantly everyone forgets that about 80% of everyone else who frequents said forum, is also a bit of a warez-jockey him/herself - whether said material is mp3's, games or divx rips of Spiderman. I was struck by how quickly people will find themselves a scapegoat - how quickly they'll find some poor slob to nail to a cross. I am willing to bet my life savings that the jerk who started this shitfit probably has a warez collection of note. But because I'm a so-called 'admin', I have to be a fucking  cherub ? What the fuck, people? Even us schmucks 'in positions of power', remain merely human! We retain our fallacies, our failures, our Clintonian instincts! We slip up, we make mistakes, we're just like you! Woe betide YOU someday end up in a position like mine and YOU make a fuckup. It's like the whole Dubya debacle. The man is turned into a clown for public amusement, but how quickly people forget that the guy gets results. And Clinton, wow, he was nearly burnt at the stake for somethig as simple as blowing his load on a skanky,  willing interns dress. It takes 2 to tango, folks. I'm glad that Clinton 'got off' (ahah), though it pains me that that situation turned into what it did. Evidence that society today likes nothing more than engaging on long, tiresome and overall entertaining witch hunts? You betcha. I think it was that wack-job Marilyn Manson who said it best. "God is in the TV"  Continuing on, The Life of Brian. Or rather just me. Warcraft3, or rather "Warcrack" as I like to call it (how utterly goddamn original), continues to be a bucketload of good fun. I've even managed to win a few games. One thing I noticed is how some players on Battle.Net wil take it so very hard if they lose. Ties in quite nicely with the whole 'elitism in music' thing. People don't like to lose. Even if they are innately crap at something, they'll nonetheless keep bashing at it UNTIL, through sheer cheapness alone, they somehow come up with a trump card. I played a 2vs2 with 3 other guys I didn't know. One was a pretty high ranking ZA player. Me and a rather 'lousy' player teamed for the first game. By virtue of me playing a pretty decent (imo) team game, I rescued my teamie from impending disaster twice, expanded, teched up, and destroyed one player virtually single handedly. Finally, with some backup from my new best friend, we combined and took out the 'good guy' (who wasn't that good, really. just another cheap rusher.). Of course a rematch was cried. Second time round they did the cheesiest thing possible by doubling-up and going straight for my partner and eliminating him. I suppose we made a tactical mistake. We should have known that the two 'good' players would be pissed and rush the weaker of us. I mean, what can you really expect from 'gosu' WC3 players? Honour? Not fucking likely. I guess when it comes down to it, if you 2vs2, play with players who you KNOW will be a fun game, not just another bunch of cheap rushers. It's kind of sad that a game like WC3, which was supposed to BREAK the emphasis on rushing that came with Starcraft, emphasizes rushing more than ever. Already there are debates about the effectiveness of creeping vs plain old fashioned rushing. Now, I may not be any good at WC3, but I LOVE the dynamic of creeping, trying to level up your hero , and doing hit run tactics. I love it when a game goes all the way to the late stages. I DETEST it when you hardly ever get a chance to 'play' with the higher tier units. That just feels like a sell out to me.  peace, out
