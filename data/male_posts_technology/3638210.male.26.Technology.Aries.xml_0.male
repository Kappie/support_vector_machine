I thought maybe it was just because the restaurant was some ridiculously ritzy place.  It turns out it is because of the beef being used, which is from a special breed of Japanese  urlLink cattle , and is served in quite a number of other restaurants around the US.  So, to save you the read (though as far as newsletters about cattle go, I'd say this is pretty exciting stuff) these cows are massaged and fed beer throughout their life.  The original reason for this treatment, which by the way sounds like a pretty sweet deal, was due to the limited amount of land resources in Japan.  Not a lot of room for activity so massage keeps the muscles stimulated and not much in way of grains so they are switched to a beer diet during the summer months.  It turns out overcoming one's limitations makes for damn delicious beef.  Now I'm no vegetarian by any stretch of the imagination, but who wants to pay over $40 for a hamburger that was basically gotten drunk and felt up just before it died?    Ok, fine... I do.
