    
       I wanted to make a drink. I went into the kitchen and I picked up a mug. I put four heaped spoons of hot chocolate powder into the mug. I filled the kettle with water. I put some milk into my mug. I stirred the milk in with the powder until it was a chocolate goo. I waited for the water to boil. I poured the water into the mug. I stirred it up. I took a sip. It burnt my lip. I waited for it to cool. When it was cool I drunk some more. It was nice.
