The reason behind that was that I gave up the Blogger Web UI and switched to free windows application, named  urlLink w.bloggar . What I did wrong was to choose the profile Blogger (No Title) instead of Blogger (With Title) . Before I found this solution, I had wasted 30 minute browsing through menus and asking other users for the problem. Hmm, but finally I am content and eager to post more and more...
