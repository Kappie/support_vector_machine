I hadn't been there before, and it is the biggest of all islands with a volcano still active.  Unfortunately I didn't have time to go see any much of the island, but it was nice to take a quick little trip, but then this past weekend I was able to go to Maui too which was awesome.  I had been there before, but got to hit up some of the good spots still including a black and red sand beach and jumping off a cliff again.  But what I am REALLY looking forward to is getting my wisdom teeth pulled this friday, and then getting measured for a tux for Kennas wedding after that.  And lastly, only about one more week before Andy makes his way out here so that will be nice.  And next month I am going to Kauai for the weekend to visit my great Uncle George and Aunt Marry and all their kids and grand kids.  Thomas L. - if you still read the blog - first thing I am going to do is finish that damn muddy "secret tunnels" hike on Kauai.  I'll take a picture of the end for you.
