Furthermore she is encouraged by Case Chong , her childhood fren that brought her to Simply United. She came from a Christian family that doesn't think christianity as very important and a lot of other cultures are practised such as tarot cards , fortune telling and a lot of new age stuff mixed into it and u get Erin. But besides that her enthuasiasm, her faithfulness to friends and the change that God have brought to her life have impacted me in a huge way.  Looking at this pics will tell u what joy and honour to know this sis of ours..(Simply United) .       She is now tonite going off to Queensland where she will be studying in University of Queensland to complete her degree in Business and her departure marks another closing of chapter in KL and a new Book to write in OZ..   As her stay here in KL, she have been radically changed girl with God setting her free from her bondage to new age stuff, cleansed her and changed her into a JesusFreak for God...who never compromises anything for God, is determined to do her quiet time no matter what happens. She is joyful, honest and direct with everyone she meets . Isn't afraid to confront any issues that bothers her. In Short she is the friend you would always wished will be there and honest with you..Real Genuine friendship.  Her change for the better, I think have shocked and impacted a lot of people, especially her closest friends and family. She also now provides counselling to people and isn't afraid to put God into the picture and explain to people from the blibical point of view.  I believe God have prepared this woman of God well, have prepared her for the incoming journey of serving God and blessing the people there in OZ...really now to think of it...God is sending off all the wonderful people there to bless the OZ people. In the 70, 80 and 90s, OZ people have  been sending their missionaries and prayer for Malaysia to impact the people there and i think it's high time that we are sending our best people there beginning with Erin and Wan Phing.   So Erin is leaving tonite at 7.30pm  and will be in the airport at 5.pm She currently needed prayer for the journey mercy but most of all she needed prayer in helping her find accomodation cause her potential roomate have rejected her offer and now she have to find a new place for the accomodation. She is currently Praise God staying in her dad's fren's house but I believe God is coming out with a miracle....so Erin if u are reading this...start Praising God and worship Him, Cause your answer is already on its way. Hang on to Him and Have Faith.  Let's pray people for Erin Wong .
