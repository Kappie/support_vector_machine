Chelsea, whom have been spending loads and loads of money on new players (100 million pounds so far), bought a Russian footballer by the name of  Smertin for 3.45 million pounds recently, but two days after signing him they allowed him to go on loan to Portsmouth, saying that he was a player they bought for the future.  Which would be perfectly fine if the player in question was someone young and still developing his skills, but the guy in question was a 28 year old!
