I am not a football-freak, or any kind of sport-freak, but I do get quite excited when there are big tournaments like this, and I do have my favorites amongst the teams. England is one of them... And since this was last night, I guess I can't quite call it a bad start of the weekend, but things aren't looking good today either. Copenhagen it showing itself from the worst side at the moment with rain, wind, grey skies, some more rain and a lousy 11 degrees. And according to the forecast it is not getting any better anytime soon... The plans for the weekend suits the weather: house cleaning! This is one of the things that get ignored over and over again where I live. Not that we are sloppy people, it is just one of those things you should do but is so easy to replace with other, more interesting things. Right now I am searching very hard for the positive me I know is living somewhere inside. So far this Friday has been quite crappy... I will blame it mostly on the weather, but also a little bit on David Beckham. Why did you miss that first penalty kick??  Weekends, those wonderful two days you can spend doing absolutely nothing, absolutely everything or something completely different. I think house cleaning might be ignored yet again this weekend...
