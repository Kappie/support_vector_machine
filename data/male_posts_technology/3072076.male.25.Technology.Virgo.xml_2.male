The biggest surprise, however, comes from the fact that even after five days both of us fail to believe that we are finally married to each other and would be living together for the rest of our lives.   Not many relatives from both my father's and mother's side had turned up so it was easy managing the lot. The  Devagon  and  Yagnopavita  where done gracefully and everyone had some good fun too. To my embarrassment, I had to take my shirt off during the thread ceremony (Yagnopavita) and bare my hirsute paunch to the lot. The marriage, on the other hand, was a great surprise to all. No when anticipated that the  urlLink Arya Samaj  people will no such a nice job. I think my granny really loved the stuff.  Papa left the next day as Annie had to get back to college. Mama is leaving tomorrow with granny. Kalpana and I would be leaving on the 28th for Jammu to attend the reception on the 30th. I must say I should have taken the days off from today till Friday but I guess it is too late now. I sure made a mess out of it.   Its been great fun all together, meeting old pals from college; Adapa Srinivas ( got placed with Wipro from IIM-L and he is also getting married soon ), Abhik ( he is joining IIM-A next month, would really miss him here. He has been a darling ), Deepak Alse, Vagi ( both working with Wipro ), Abhishek Katwale, Poulimi ( both working with Citibank after finishing their MBA ), Surya, Anand, Chetan Nipane and of course Sanchay; the people from office; the people from CDAC; relatives and friends.  Gosh, One memorable marriage.
