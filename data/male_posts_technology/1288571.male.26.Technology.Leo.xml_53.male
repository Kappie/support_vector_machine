Regardless though, it sounds fucking great! I can finally appreciate my DVD's and man, does having a center speaker make a difference! Before with 2 speakers it was hard hearing the people speaking if music was playing. Now the people talking comes out of the center speaker and music comes out of the surround speakers.  Quality.
