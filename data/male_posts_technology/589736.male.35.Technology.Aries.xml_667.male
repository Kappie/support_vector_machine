Bottom line, he is entitled to his opinion, politically correct or not.  The last I checked, the First Amendment was still in force.  Why does he have to resign his post?  If the Republicans want him as their leader, that is their choice.  Keep in mind that, according to a black radio show host I saw on TV the other day (Tom Joyner?), 98% of the black vote in this country goes to the Democrats.  Odds are, the voters who would vote based on only the issue of Civil Rights, already voted for the Democrats because of the perception (wrong in my opinion) that the Democrats are more dedicated to that issue.  So, what damage is there to be done by taking the black vote away?  Politically, none.
