As most of you know by now, I have been and will remain committed to public safety thoughout my tenure on the Council. So I will continue to work to ensure our Police and Fire / EMS needs are represented in the budget.   Charter Amendment  We will be discussing the potential of placing a charter amendment on the November ballot asking if the City should have the ability to place advisory questions on the ballot. This will allow the Council in the future to place issues such as single hauler or solid waste on a ballot to gage how the community feels about these issues. The argument against taken by some Council Members is that's what we are elected for. To make those decisions on behalf of the residents. I don't necessarily agree. I think it is always good to gauge where the community stand on important issues. I don't like the "Hollier than thou" attitude of some Council Members who do not want to let the community have thier input into important issues.   Sign Ordinance  As you may know, last week Council approved modification to the sign ordinance basically grandfathering businesses that existed prior to December 31, 2003 from the requiements of changing to a monument sign unless they change, sell or modify thier business. After our initial discussions on this matter I was not in favor of grandfathering the businesses in. They have had plenty of time to make the changes we required. But as we continued to investigate I found other issues that just were not resolved. I drove through the tire city looking at signs. I met with business owners and discussed the impact the ordinance would have on them. I finally came to the conclusion that the sign ordinance sounded like a good idea at the time, after all, the Council wanted to keep up with the "Jones" and that's what other cities were doing at the time. But when it comes right down to it, it's just a sign. As long as its not falling apart and has some good taste, does it really matter if its a monument sign?  Stay tuned for more info as the budget discussions heat up.  Peace.  G
