NEVER given out to any companies/agencies  and the caller claims to be representing Maxim Magazine. When I asked where she got my number, she answered "Maxim Magazine". Knowing that Maxim does not have my phone number, I again inquired where they got my numbed and her reply was again "Maxim Magazine"...  After telling her that I did NOT receive maxim AT THAT NUMBER she hung up.  Now, I dialed star[*] 69 and got the number  800-362-0796 ... I've been trying to research that number but with no luck. So far, it will cost me between $60 and $250 just to find out who owns the number.  $250  to find out who called  MY  phone.  I call out to the masses. If anybody has access to this information would you please email me any information you have. I dunno, maybe someone in your family is in law enforcement or is a private investigator? I could use a hand...
