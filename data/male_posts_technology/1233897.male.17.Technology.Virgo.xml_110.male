Without going into a large amount of detail (which, I would estimate, would take several hundred pages to write, or several days to dictate orally), I will try to explain as best I can some more recent events.  I’ve always viewed my dad as an angry person, from as far back as some of my earliest memories, but these last nine months or so have revealed just how deep that anger problem went.  There was a time, at the end of last summer, when my mom was in tears at LEAST two times a day, for almost a month on end (this was all from verbal abuse from my dad).  To cut a very long monolog short, the pinnacle of evidence of my dad’s anger came about a week or two before Christmas last year.  (My family situation was so bad throughout December, that I skipped celebrating my birthday, the 18th, until late January.)  It was at that time that his problem finally came out into the open, and they started going to marriage counseling.  It has had a drastic difference, I can tell, and I’m quite proud of him because of it, but it hasn’t come without its own share of problems.  For instance, one thing that we have started to do is have formal family meetings to try to create a stable forum for communication (something that we have never had before).  The first several had their share of hitches, but were predominantly effective.  …Not so with this last one.  We had a meeting today starting about 9:25, and expected to last one hour.  Within the first five minutes, however we launched into a trivial argument that I exited 25 minutes later by excusing myself from the table, and amid my dad yelling how terrible a child I was being, and demanding that I come back down and sit at “my place” at the table before he “counted to three”.  (It’s almost comical, actually, if you don’t take into account my two crying sisters, my sullen mom, and the fact that now he won’t let me go to a play tomorrow night because of my being “stubborn” and “rebellious”.)  Make no mistake, it wasn’t just my dad’s fault, my mom was the one who started the argument in the first place, and the one that was being the most controlling.    Other than this wonderful development, my day has been relatively uneventful.  My Spring Break was quite fun. On Monday, Steven came over around noon, and went to Butter’s house with me from 4:00 to around 11:30.  The Neff troop, Gwen, Adrie, and a couple other people were there.  It was kinda interesting the first hour or so – we were all tired, and for some reason we decided to go up t the Gadeholts house, and bother Kat and Timy several times.  ‘Twas funny.  We watched LotR, cracking Gandalf the Gay jokes all night long, even while were watching the Patriot later.  We went to a park around 10:30, and had fun running around in the dark… (at least I think we had fun…) lol.  Steven and I stayed up till around 4:00am that night (morning?) and woke up around 9 the next day. :)  We went to a really cool piano shop, and saw / played some really really “top-of-the-line” pianos, and learned interesting, but relatively useless info about them (like, did you know that all the string combined exert more than 20 tons of force on the inside of a piano?)  Later that night we went to youth group, and Steven went back to his house afterward.   Wednesday, at 5:00, I hosted a large xbox lan party.  In attendance were Pat, Steven, Andy, Andrew, Brady, Goody, David, Mark (I hope that’s his name… lol), and Cameran. We debated going out and throwing rocks at windows of friends residing nearby at pre-dawn hours, but nothing came of it.  Everyone was gone by 4:00 Thursday, and I decided I needed sleep, but didn’t get much.  On Friday, Brady, Cori, and Mrs. Lee picked me up at around 2:00, and then we went and acquired Cameran from his abode.  I don’t remember much about Friday afternoon (but that’s okay ‘cause I videotaped a large amount of it), on account of sleep deprivation.  I do recall playing HALO for quite a while though, and eating some really rich chocolate cake that Cori brought back from her growth group.  Cori finally went to bed past 1:30 (she had work at 8:00 the next morning), and Cam, Brady and I ran around for a while, outside.  We kept going outside, and making random videos involving little dancing chipmunks, and alternately going back inside and watching random movies (including the Princess Diaries, and some Ernest movies, before we got scared by what we thought was a cougar.  At around 5:00, we went back outside and repaired a tree house.  I think we sat around bored for an hour after that, then woke Cori up at 6:30 and showed her some of the footage of us being weird that we took over the night.  (lol)  She left at 7:30, and we started riding a go-cart around. Including a break for lunch (really good homemade pizza), we ended up riding that go-cart for more than 6 hours, and we had to refill it twice.  I was so stinking tired on the way home, I couldn’t think, like at all.  Cori, Mrs. Lee, and I were discussing conspiracy theories, and I had to really concentrate to even comprehend what they were saying.  Quite funny.  I got back to my house around 6:30, walked around in a daze for ten minutes, went up to my room, closed the door, turned on the tv (the stereo, computer, and lights were already on), laid down the wrong direction on my bed, woke up 12 hours later, changed, brushed my teeth, took off my glasses (lol), and finally got in bed.  Sunday, I went to my parent’s church, and hung out with my Grandma and sisters all afternoon.    Monday – nothing substantial  Tuesday, we had guests over, and I got to youth group almost half an hour late. So late, in fact, that I just stayed in the Sanctuary, and watched Stages' final dress rehearsal before the debut of Song on the Mountain tomorrow.  Today, I went to the dentist after school, and Ben came over late. Later, I missed midweek, so I could be part of the wonderful family meeting, and that’s about where I am now.   This was finished at 10:13, but I have been hindered from posting it until now.
