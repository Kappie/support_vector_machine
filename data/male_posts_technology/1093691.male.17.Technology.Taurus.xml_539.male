That's really horrible, when you wake up in a sweat and crying cos it's so scary and it seems real. I hate those type of dreams. Anyway! Science this morning was okish, harder than the other exam but Mr Stickland succeeded in messing up my questions 4- the minute I had done it anbd turned the page he said "I#m sorry to say that we've just noticed a mistake in question 4" and i thought 'oh bloody hell, here we go' and then I had to re-write the whole of the quesiton and made a mess of it. 5 minutes later, "I'm sorry but we made a mistake, there  wasn't  a mistake in question 4. So I had to re-write the whole bloody thing again, except I was out of space cos I had already written it twice. Honestly. Flamin' teachers. Right now I need some food. Marmite on toast followed by chocolate fingers sounds like a good idea.  Oh guys you will laugh so much when you see my birthyda cake, it's going to be so funny and soooo sickly!! he he he he!  Good luck in english everyone, although I'm sure no-one will need it cos you just make english up as y ou go along, being creative and arty-farty etc etc. Toooodles!
