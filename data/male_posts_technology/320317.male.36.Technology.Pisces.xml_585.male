 Don't get me started on these idiots who are out of touch with the real world. Not to mention uniformed, and let's face it we are all uniformed on what our government really knows about Iraq, so don't make idiot claims like you know Iraq doesn't have WOMD. I hate to say it, but in this case I tend to lean towards trusting the government on what they really know about Iraq, especially after fears of terrorism. I am just looking forward to Saturday Night Live making fun of them this weekend. Although Al Gore is hosting so who knows what they will do. By the way, take a look at the list of these losers. I haven't heard of  a lot of them.
