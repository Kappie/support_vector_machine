He's in the area working for a law firm up in the city but will be going back to NYC to finish in a couple weeks. Solid guy - haven't seenhim in a while so we grab dinner in San Jose at a local taqueria and afterwards head over to Gordon Bierch to grab a couple beers. We talk about random shit - school, life, work...then he tells me about the new car he's driving -his dad'syear old Ferrari 360 Spyder. I know his dad's pretty well off being the CFO of Flextronics and all but you would have never guess that bylooking at Tony- he was always part of that free love/narcotics experimenting/granola-y society so common to the CO-OP type. I guess people change...So we start talking about his car and after sitting around for a couple hours, he offers to give me a ride around town. Of course i say hell yeah and in a couple minutes, i find myself in the passenger seat of midnight blue 360 with the top down. So we start driving, and mind you, I've never taken the overpassfrom 280N to880S more than 60mph in my station wagon. So when we hit this thing at 120, i swear i almost shat my pants. With the top down and a screaming V8 behind my head, it was a moment i will never forget. And Tony -who the fuck knew he was such a good driver? Turns out the kid used to race in the Formula Dodge series back in high school and you could tell- hewas heel-toeing like the best of them. Anyways, just got back home a minute or two ago and my hands are still shaking. Goddamm that car is fast....   Music playing - Talib Kweli - Get By
