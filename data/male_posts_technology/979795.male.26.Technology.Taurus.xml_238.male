I think it's either the ice cream Venetta I've been eating these past few days taking effect on my fitness, or the weather is just getting cold, because I seriously had a slight problem running these past 2 sessions. After the run, I even felt a bit of cough coming up. Just took my grandma's remedy, 2 raw eggs. Justin and David were disgusted by it. Haha. Must admit lah, the initial taste is kinda hard to take down, but it gets better after that. Anyway, so long as it's effective, I don't mind the awful taste for a few seconds. Let's hope my stomache can take it tonight because I haven't taken this remedy for some years and I'm not sure of my stomache is used to it now. Well, maybe some water to help it go down later.  I emailed a complaint to the bus service and I'm hoping to get some kinda reply soon. But even so, I think I've cooled down enough to be able to forget it lah. Afterall, the thing is over already. Sigh ...  OK I gotta go work on my report liao. Final year project write up, ARGH!
