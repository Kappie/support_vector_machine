This is what I get for not checking the blog since Thanksgiving: BACH's smash-up, Dave's enlistment, John's brood, Chris' arrival.... Thank goodness the ladies are okay. Stay safe, all y'all.  Have been working days making costumes for a dance group at a community center in the South Bronx; Hans Chrstian Andersen's "Snow Queen" with elementary  middle school kids  some young guest artists from Dance Theatre of Harlem. Also still wardrobe supervisor at "Salome" down in Brooklyn. Aidan Quinn has joined the cast as our third  newest John the Baptist. (My co-workers are the people I see in onscreen in cinemas! Weird.) Four more performances, then home to RVa on x-mas eve for the holly-day. Who's around? Should we have a coffee klatch next week? I just found a recipe for macadamia-cranberry cookies.  Allen - I'll be in VA until the 27th or 28th, then back up to QNS. Call me when you're up: 917-514-7237. Do you have plans yet for new year's eve? I have an option available. And for the record, last weekend I was in Brooklyn, working.
