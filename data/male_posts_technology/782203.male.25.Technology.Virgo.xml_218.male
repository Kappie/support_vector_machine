I have to admit that I probably wouldn't have the balls to do it, so gotta give those gals due respect. But a guy won the 100k though but it wasn't really fair cos the final challenge was a rather physical one.  Walked home from Bedok Interchange to Chai Chee instead of taking the bus today. It wasn't that long a walk around 15 minutes but it was pretty good workout (hey im not in the fittest state right now) and I think I can almost feel my biceps growing so it's all good. Gonna do it again tommorow.  I'm ahead, I'm a man I'm the first mammal to wear pants, yeah I'm at peace with my lust I can kill 'cause in God I trust, yeah It's evolution, baby  Do The Evolution by Pearl Jam
