The bikers on the other hand ... you need to watch behind you often. If you are carving back and forth across the entire trail, the biker will not know how to pass you safely (righ or left?). You can cruise enjoyably down the entire trail using just half (right side) of the trail. OK, here are some details:  The Capital Crescent Trail is an 11-mile converted railway that runs from Washington, DC to Silver Spring. From Bethesda on south, the trail is paved. From Bethesda to DC, the trail heads downhill and once over the DC line at about mile marker 6.7 the trail really drops down to the C Canal. None of the hills are steep however. The final few miles from past the Arizona Avenue trestle at mile marker 7.7 to the end are generally flat and parallel the C Canal Towpath. Here is a link to a site that displays a map of the trail:  urlLink Capital Crescent Trail Maps .  Enjoy and I hope to see ya!
