It's a Christian-run non-prof here in town that handles real estate and housing via communities of faith. She was Deputy Director, and did a lot of grant writing and PR stuff, as well as meetings with donors and local politicans (::rolls eyes::). I don't know much about the sector or their mission, but I understand they're a little overwhelmed since she left. She is a consultant and still does some work for them, but according to her, it's not enough, and they haven't hired anybody to fill her shoes.   Then again, they might have told her they were going to try and not hire someone else to save bling, bling...
