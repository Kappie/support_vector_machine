The problem with the spam is that they don't cause problem direclty, But the spam filters filter out some of the legitimate mails too...  I also started beleiving that people below 18 years shouldn't access the internet or mails.. Because the spams are mostly adult contents and all the people who access mails will hencforth have access to these stuff..   Damn the SPAM...
