By “We”, I mean we Indians, we Indians having a rich history of about 7000 years or so, we Indians who have given the world the Buddha, the Vedas, the Geeta; We Indians who taught the world how to count and how to think. Do we need to focus so much on “Independence day”?  Of course, we were conquered by the British and we fought long and hard to achieve independence from them. We should be aware of the sacrifices of our freedom fighters and also respect them immensely. But we should also remember that this is just 100-150 years of our history. Why is it that we do not focus so much on our history before the British?  It seems more like our collective identity is based more on the fact that we were ruled by the British and we fought together for our freedom. Of course, one may argue that India emerged as a single state only after this. Yes. But that’s only politically. But we Indians have had a common history and culture from time immemorial.  So what is it that is wrong with the “Independence day”? Well, its just that our sense of history and identity has been completely captured by it. We all know that when a child goes to school, he/she is taught that the most important national day is the independence day. He/She hears passionate speeches on British atrocities and how we fought them. He/She is taught Indian history which again focuses mainly on the freedom struggle.  We are creating generation after generation of Indians whose imagination and identity is completely captured by the last 200 years of our history. We Indians don’t seem to identify ourselves with the Buddha, Chanakya, Chandragupta, Shankara, Ramanuja or any other historic personality. Our identity with Indian mathematics starts and ends with zero. We never recognize the fact that the Vedas, the epics and the Geeta were written by our own ancestors. Our own!!  Before I conclude, let me make it clear that I am  NOT AGAINST  Independence day. But its just that Independence day and the associated history with it should not be the most significant factors in deciding who we were. Let us also look at not so recent, but a glorious history to draw our identity and trace our roots. What we require today is a broader, deeper and a more comprehensive outlook at our history and identity.   JAI HIND.
