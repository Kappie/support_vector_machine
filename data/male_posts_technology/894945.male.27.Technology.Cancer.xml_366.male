On the other hand, I don’t have any friends or life and any girl that drinks pints and isn’t a psycho butch lesbian has to be cool.  Secondly, Someone post details on how the hell our resident Alex got some girl to snog him last Friday?  Thirdly, Why is it I get pins and needles in my feet after 20 minutes on the cross trainer down the gym? Apart from the running machine, it’s the only thing I don’t need to strap my size 14s into (or try – the bikes just cant handle my trainers)  Fourthly, What is a turkey nibbler?  Fifthly, why do car mechanics try to rip you off when you know that they are lying through their teeth?  Sixthly, Monkey Magic was on TV last night. Why was it not advertised. It was on so late that I fell asleep during.  Seventhly, Why wont any women help we with my experiments into tantric sex.  Eighthly Why is the duckbilled platypus such a screwed up animal?  Ninthly, Why am I considered just a number?  I am a Free Man!!!
