I could have rented one for 222 bucks for a week!  hummm what to do what to do!  wife figured out the best way to mix the concrete, as in what order to put the ingredients in!  If it comes to it, for the concrete for the pool and decking, she could mix while I pore it in.    we make a good team!  should get the fenc up today and start on the sides.  Bro in law is coming over after lunch and I am working half days this week, we should get alot done!
