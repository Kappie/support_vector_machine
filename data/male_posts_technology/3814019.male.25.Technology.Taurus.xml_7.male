Here, surrounded by cardboard trees and animals of all shapes and sizes we see the indigenouspigmies of the pickerpacker  tribe. Somehow managing to live in perfect unison with their surroundings, the pickerpacker people have learnt to survive on the most basic of diets. They have many customs and dressed in baggy clothing and woolly headpieces most civilised members of the western world would find them bizarre to say the least. As we approach we can clearly see the two main tribesmen  suffuros gladly  and  torturous loudly  begining the daily dance around the hi-fi. Strange noises can be heard eminating from the device, to which the tribesmen seem entranced by.These noises are the tribesmens way of keeping the many beasts away from their emcampment as most animals find the noises horrible to the ears. A quick journey away from the pygmy home and we get to see a rare sight indeed! Here, hiding behind a plethora of boxes, we see the lesser spotted  wherus davus.  Seldom seen in these parts, the wherus davus is a timid and shy beast, preferring solitude and quiet to the normal social noisy lifestyle of your average jungle dweller.
