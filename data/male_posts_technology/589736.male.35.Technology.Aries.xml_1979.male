I think venturing from this planet is the only thing of value that our species can do.  I remain conflicted about the invasion and occupation of Iraq.  I miss Buffy, though I realize the show had nowhere else to go.  "Lost in Translation" remains my favorite film of last year.  I am excited about the semester beginning today, though I wish I had more time for gaming.  "Comfort" on the 200(?) block of Broad is a fantastic restaurant.  And I love Angie!
