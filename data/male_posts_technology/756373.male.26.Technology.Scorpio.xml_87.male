This speaks volumes about the guy. This is an example of  exactly  what he's guilty of perpetrating in his 'documentaries' - taking a truth, and twisting it to support his 'cause'. Sure. He doesn't always  lie  directly to our faces. He just tells us half the story. Excuse me, but doesn't this make him  no better  than the politicians he crusades tirelessly against?  The man's hypocrisy is just so laughable, it's hard to understand why so many take what he has to say seriously. He's a con artist, and he's coining it off of the fear and insecuirity and anger and delusion of the common schmo who knows no better than to just go with his gut. Because - hey, the world owes Joe Average after all.  I guess at the very least he admitted to this scam, this time.
