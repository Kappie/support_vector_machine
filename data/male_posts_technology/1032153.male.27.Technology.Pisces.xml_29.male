What makes me slightly peeved, is that I have been for this problem about six times (or was it nine times) and spent hundreds of dollars on it. I have a bacterial infection, which keeps reoccuring, and is resistant to some certain antibiotics we have tried to use to get rid of it. Not good.   Comments Amok  What is wrong with the comments? I mean Fridays post was registering '0 comments' but had two, and Tuesdays registered '5 comments' and had 3.  Now I'm really cheesed off.    Congrats  Congratulations are in order for Anita! I was reading the intranet news today, and it looks like she's got some kind of promotion. Well done!   Book  I feel like writing a book. At the moment, if I did, it would be entitled:- "In defence of good old fashioned blokes." Or perhaps I could call it "Real Men - A dying Breed". Or even "MOAs - Men of Action - a dying breed - just like the bird, but back from extinction. Or maybe just "Why We Need Strong Godly Men". Part of this is as a result of my frustration with the increasing number of bolshy (read - obstreperous) young women there are around. But the thing is many of us guys don't like confrontation, and just capitulate at the first sign of it. To all those lovely women who read my blog, my apologies. I am not tarring you with this brush, but merely commenting on a trend I have noticed. Weak guys, Strong women. Or should I say strong women, weak men?   Mind Siege  Buy it! Here is an excerpt from a chapter called "The Wisdom of Man".  "Today's philosophy of education is obsessed with self-actualization, self-image, self-love, self-sufficiency, self-esteem, self-satisfaction - self, self, self. .......Traditional Christianity, Mr Rieff observed, made great moral demands on believers. Its goal was salvation; consequently, it exhorted believers to 'die to self'; repent of sin, and cultivate virtue, self-discipline, and humility. Today however, wrote Mr Rieff, 'psychological man' is rapidly shouldering Christian man aside as the dominant character type in our society. For psychological man - the offspring of Freud and his ilk - life centers not on the soul, but on the self.  Psychological man rejects both the idea of sin and the need for salvation. He aspires to nothing higher than 'feeling good about himself.' Mr. Rieff summarizes it this way: 'Christian man was born to be saved; psychological man is born to be pleased.'    Musical Composition  I fancy myself as a bit of a composer. Purely instrumental at this stage, but we'll see. I haven't written much lately, which is something I would like to remedy. Nothing like working out a funky rhythm. I would love to record some stuff one time, and Jono's offered the hook ups with soud gear so that's the ticket. I'll let ya'll know if I ever get it done.
