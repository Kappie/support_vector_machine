The Aloha spirit is showing some love for your neighbor.  For example.  When the girls were here recently and we went kayaking, you have to cross a road that has a fair amount of traffic coming by, I told one of the girls, Jamie, wait - someone will show us the Aloha spirit.  Seconds later someone stopped and waived us by.  When the girls came out here and I had nothing in my new apartment, they all pitched in and let me borrow so much stuff.  The aloha spirit.  Live and well.  Also, there is a rumor on Hawaii that if you remove lava rock, or as I heard it, also black sand, from the island, that bad luck will come your way.  Well when I went kayaking recnetly to a smaller island I took a small rock from there, not lava rock, but as soon as we got back from the trip I lost my wallet.  A few other bad things happened since then so I made a return kayak trip to the island this past weekend to return the rock.  Just a few hours after returning the rock, I went to the post office and checked my mail, and low and behold, someone had returned my wallet, everything except the cash.  Bottom line, all is sacred, do not take anything from the islands.  I learned the hard way.  Yikes!  Live and learn.
