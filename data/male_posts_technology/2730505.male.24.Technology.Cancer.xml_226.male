His grandparents took him to see his great grand parents all the way out in Colorado.  My fault there.  I should have called.  I did call but no one was answering the phone at their house so I had to break down and call Jenny to see if he was around.  So it turns out that he wasn't, I still tried to make the most of the weekend.  I borrowed this little thing from work called a projector.  It was awesome.  HALO was just unbelievable.  Resolution was maxed out at 1024x768 for the computer but XBOX looked damn good!  Lets see, I brought with me the following games:  Rainbow Six 3 HALO ESPN NFL 2K5 Need For Speed: Underground Soul Caliber 2  They all looked awesome.  It's like having a 8 foot TV screen.  Sharp as a TV and the only thing lacking was surround sound.  I saw everything I needed to see in Rainbow Six.  I was able to get through the first two missions but got stuck in the third.  Halo was amazing multiplayer.  You could really see where people would be.  Football was also awesome.  I could see wide open receivers.  I also tested out the 1st person perspective and damn, it's hard being a quarterback.  Especially if you're short.  Soul caliber was just an amazing experieince.  Need for speed on bumper view was awesome!!!  So I think, instead of a big TV I will just hook myself up with a damn projector.  Portable and just as clear as a regular TV.  I can go get some HD lens for it to really make it sharp as can be but that can wait.  Besides being able to play XBOX on it, I can also hook it up tomy computer and play Counter Strike, Half Life 2 and Doom 3 when I finally get a decent box that'll run that shit.  For now I will be on XBOX Live playing Black Arrow, Football, Basketball, HALO 2 etc.  So In Iowa, we had a little fun with the projector.
