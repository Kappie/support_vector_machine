I here you cry,  "Work" I proclaim,  "But no one likes work, apart from those weirdo's, you know the ones, Americans", I agree with your witty but true remark but counter with  "Not just work, my Boss", I sigh with resignation,   "The only way you can like your boss is if she is a part time lap dancer and wants to practice her Pole technique on you during your lunch breaks" you say, knowing that I will fantasise just such a scenario. "But mine can't even file things properly" I retort. Now I don't mean file in an obscure manner, such as by the national debt of the country the last person to deal with it last visited, or by the volume of water displaced if you feed the work to large shaven horses. But something EVEN SIMPLER THAN FILING IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER!!!! Yes, even simpler. Date order. That's right, something dated the 03-Oct-2002 is filed after, yes after 02-Oct-2002, not before, not in-between, before. I know what you’re thinking; it's a simple mistake to file it after, but NAY!! NAY!! And thrice, for continuity sake NAY!!! In any normal circumstance I might agree, but in my work we have a separate file for each day.  That file is clearly labelled that a midget nymphomaniac with an oversized forearm can read at three nautical miles away! Putting work labelled the twenty-sixth of august in the forth of September is plane STUPID.  No wonder 70% of my day is spent correcting my boss’s mistakes. No wonder I am busy, no wonder I don't have time to waste three hours a day (no exaggeration, this time) eating breakfast/lunch/afternoon snacks/chatting on the phone to mum/brothers/husband/friends on the phone/ reading books/magazines.  Roll on next month.  Did I say she has been made redundant?  Do I blame myself for bringing the above facts and more to my superiors? Did it improve for about seventy-six minutes after she had been told?  Only you can tell!  Now I have to re-order three years of filing before 5:30 tonight…..
