The awareness of space arises from the relative awareness of differences – from duality to diversity, or separateness – the distance between two or more things. On the level of sensory experience the feeling of space requires an affirmation of separateness through sensory perception. In this process a dynamic change of the spatial world must take place in time; indeed, our relative awareness of space actually originates and grows only with a change of the mental space of our imagination.   Under the outer hull of the sound-space the musical parameters move as if in different layers.   The material of the musical sound-space can be compared to our material body, while the motif-space can be compared to our subtle body. The motif-space enlivens the musical sound-space from within, it structures it and holds it together.   In this terms, the sequence may be understood as our mind which, from within, from a state of even greater subtlety, enlivens, structures, and integrates our subtle body, which corresponds to the motif-spaces.   The infinite harmony-space may be compared to that basis of our mind which, from within, from the state of greatest subtlety, enlivens, structures and integrates the mind, which in turn corresponds to the sequence-spaces.
