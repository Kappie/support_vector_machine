Not that I expect anything much, I just wish it wasn't always my turn:) It's especially funny cause the guy who's turn it was to do dishes this week, waited until last night to start them up. (*The thing you have to realize for our house is like 2 people eat 3 meals there a day. Thus causing about 10 dirty dishes a day, minimum.which makes doind dishes a daily need.*) I just laugh cause of how no one talked to him about it:) Also, I don't eat food prepared at home, so I never have any dishes so it wasn't a big deal for me, besides it looking like shit.  anyway, hope everyone is well, and I'll check you later...
