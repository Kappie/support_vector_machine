The families in the movies try to keep this illusion of being a really happy family to outsiders, when in reality they are anything but.  And I think it's really true in real life as well, Most people usually seem to have this really happy family life, at least to their friends and frelatives. But I wonder how many of them are actually just faking it. My guess is that it's the majority. My family ? Nah I think I wun answer that.
