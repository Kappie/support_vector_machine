I think that three should do it:  1) Stop biting nails- they hurts your teeth! 2) Save money!! 3) Find a good girlfriend!!!  Yup I really would like to save a bit of cash this year, so that I can go away and enjoy experiences across the world, and I reckon it's about time I found a girlfriend, as I've been single for like over a year and I'm tired of one nighters!  So, what's been going on since the new year? Well I have started to paint again, which is cool because I needed to chill and painting is a good way to do it. I am thinking of perhaps starting what is called 'Hand Of The Wind' Kung Fu, as I really need to be more active this year, it's been a few years since Custard and I went to the gym three times a week!!!  Asides from that, not much has changed, although Toaster has started doing games nights at his pad, which are usually good fun, in fact we are having another one tonight.  Proposed holidays for me this year....  Crusade roleplaying event in May, Mopar drag racing in June, Renewal roleplaying event in August, and perhaps another somewhere else that I haven't decided yet.  All in all I hope this year will be more exciting than last year, which it looks like being if everything goes well. So for now I'll leave you all to contemplate your own thoughts or whatever you were doing before you got bored and decided to read what I had to say, until next time.....tata.  Baity signing off......  'Into Glory Ride'
