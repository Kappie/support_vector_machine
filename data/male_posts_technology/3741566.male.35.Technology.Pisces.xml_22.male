I got Wendy a job offer with the company by early February.   How did she respond to the job offer? Funny you should ask. She looked for every reason in the book not to accept the offer. Maybe that should have been my biggest hint that her heart wasn't in it. After numerous talks with Scottee and I about the move, with us pleading that she come out and give it a chance, she finally made the decision to give it a try. I should mention now, her situation in California.  1. She left the position of PR Manager at the company I worked for when she found out I was moving 2. She took a job at a medical company that offered her one type of position and then when she got there she found out it was something else altogether. She wasn't happy at all. 3. She lived in a house her parents owned with her ex-husband and had never been really out on her own 4. Her parents had long since moved to Florida, leaving her in California with her ex and a hand full of other friends that hadn't moved out of California yet.  The idea of leaving the security she had become accustomed to was terrifying to her. She was born and raised in the bay area and couldn't actually visualize a new life living somewhere else even though she had talked of nothing else but getting out of California every since we met. More talk than action, which I think I can understand even if I can't relate.  By early March she had made the leap and came out and that's when things got really bad. From the moment she got here she was looking for reasons that it wouldn't work. She was on a mission to fulfill her own prophesies in her mind. We had found a nice townhome for her a couple of miles away from our home that we thought would be perfect for her and I even ponied money out of my own pocket to pay off the leasing agent who found the place for us (which wasn't easy because money has been very tight - moving costs a ton). From the moment she arrived she found every reason to hate the home, hate the area and just be angry in general. I still don't remember a time when she just said to me "thank you". Thank you for getting me a great job. Thank you for taking time to find a good place to live in a nice neighborhood. Thank you for helping me move in. Thank you for going out of your way to make everything easier on me every chance you got. It's depressing to think back on.   Her furniture didn't arrive until 2 1/2 weeks later which seems to be typical of these moving companies. We expected her to stay with us since we have a large house and plenty of room for her and her two cats and one dog. We also had the eating utensils, stove, washer and dryer, and most important...us! She couldn't do it. She couldn't be in that family environment for more than a few days. Within a week, she had asked for an air mattress and was sleeping in an empty townhome. Scottee and I knew then that we were in trouble. From there, the same pattern that happened in California arose. The pattern is so typical that you can actually map it out now.  PHASE ONE: "HAPPY" 1.Everything is fine, sex regularly, lots of talk of a future together from her, plans to go on trips together, and lots and lots of I love yous. 2. This phase never lasts more than one week. Ever. It has been 9 months and this phase has never lasted more than a week.  PHASE TWO: "THE EVENT" 1. Something happens to "annoy" her. Since she is looking for something to go wrong from the beginning to fulfill her prophecy that the relationship is doomed and that no one really understands her and no one really loves her etc, it doesn't take long before she finds some action or words, that in her mind, justify anger. 2. The event is usually followed by immediate body language that betrays her anger. She all of a sudden has to go home, or has a headache, or has something she has to do anywhere but with us. This is followed by her immediately breaking any plans that might have been made for the following night and next day or several days depending on how angry she is.  PHASE THREE: "EGO" 1. Since she has broken plans and made it clear that she is annoyed either verbally, through her actions of breaking plans, or by her body language, it is inevitable that we ask "what's up" and/or "why do you not want to be around us?" We might simply ask why she is angry. This might be in email or in person, either way it elicits the same response. 2. That response it always the same. RAGE. Unreasonable and unexpected RAGE. She lashes out verbally and uses anything at her disposal that she feels will hurt one of us. There have been so many hurtful and mean things said during these times I couldn't possibly write them all down. It usually revolves around exposing any character flaw that she feels we have and throwing it at us. I can't tell you how bad this time is and how bad it hurts to have someone you love rip you apart time and again. Usually the rage is directed at one or the other of us very rarely both. This pits Scottee and I somewhat against each other. Most times the rage is towards me, but a few times against Scottee.   PHASE FOUR: "THE MOOD" 1. Shortly after the initial rage follows the after math. Rage usually lasts only a few hours and "The Mood" phase usually lasts anywhere from one week to three weeks (god I wish I were kidding here". The mood phase is actually the worst).   It starts after the rage.   1. Whomever she had the rage against, she won't talk to period. Simply ignores their existence.  2. The other party she starts talking to right away. At first this is to vent what an ass the other one was and how DARE we do whatever it was that put her into the rage to begin with. It doesn't end there. The real fun begins.  3. She starts in on what a screwed up relationship this is. How Scottee or me just can't seem to be happy. How that she can't deal with all the drama, that she is worn down by it all, she is tired, she doesn't want this anymore, she is moving away as soon as her lease is up, she is leaving the job as soon as the lease is up, the I or Scottee are seriously screwed up mentally, that she needs to find a "real" relationship, etc etc etc. It goes on and on. The most hurtful crap that anyone can say. She knows that we tell each other this and feeds off the hurt she causes. She has to make sure she punishes us for whatever harm we supposedly did this time.   The worst part of this phase is the harm to the relationship she causes to the one she DIDN'T rage against. How would you like your lover telling you that your relationship isn't real, that she is moving away the first chance she gets, that she needs to date to find a "real" relationship etc, when it wasn't you that she was mad at to begin with? The hurt is causes goes beyond words. We end up thinking that she is only in the relationship because of the other person. That our (either her and Scottee's relationship or mine and her relationship)exists just so she can be with the other one. Why else would someone say these things?  This phase lasts anywhere from a week to three weeks. During this time it isn't unusual for her to go out with other friends or out to events and genuinely act as if she couldn't care less that the relationship is over.  PHASE FIVE: "OOPS SORRY". 1. This phase can only begin once we stop talking to her completely. She has to be alone by herself without us being antagonistic in any way (which means not talking at all since anything we say during phase four will be construed as us telling her she is wrong). After she has sat on it and thought and gone all through her self hating self-talk she gradually comes out of it. This phase is started when she finally calls us. She then says something to the effect of "I don't know why I was so angry or I don't know why I do that". It is then followed by "I really do want to be in this relationship" and "I want to make it work". We then have actual meaningful conversations. This phase usually lasts for about three days to a week. The relationship gradually gets better until finally we are back to phase one. Then it starts back again.  The end result is that phase two is always just around the corner. I'd like to believe that one day she could find peace and be happy, but the outlook is getting dimmer and dimmer. Let me explain.  In 9 months time here is what has transpired.  At least 30 dates cancelled (if I were to count I'm sure it would actually be more like 50). This can be as simple as not coming over for dinner, canceling shopping trips with Scottee and canceling sleep overs to large events like canceling plans for thanksgiving, Christmas, her birthday, and canceling weekend vacations that are already paid for. Oh I wish I was kidding here. It has gotten to the point where we just expect her to cancel. Usually the bigger the plans the more likely she'll cancel. The canceling always occurs in phase three and four.   In 9 months time, I personally have had sex with her less than any woman I have been with for a month. Because the only time sex happens is in phase one, that means that sex usually only takes place in one week a month. Add in Aunt Flow and similar things and it has averaged that we've had sex less than twice a month. Not bad for a new relationship eh? Her and my wife's track record there is even worse.   Well that is where we are at today. Currently we are in a phase four. Two weeks ago we came out of a monster phase four and into a good phase five. In this time she was great, coming over all the time and being awesome. My wife left for Florida for two weeks on Sunday and she slipped into a phase one with me. We spent almost all of Sunday together. Everything was great. Better than it had ever been actually. Monday she feel asleep upon coming home from work and our plans got cancelled. Tuesday everything is going fine until, oops, phase two and three hit hard. How did is start? Why does it matter? I asked a question that in hindsight I should have known better to ask. She took the question as me being an ass and "babysitting" her and within 60 seconds we had entered phase three.It wasn't as bad as other phase three's have been, she only said mildly hurtful things and cancelled plans for a four day stay in Maine next month that had been made for the three of us. The funny part is that less than an hour before she was telling me how much she wanted to go. It wasn't surprising since she has cancelled those plans three times now. When I made them I knew that the odds were against it ever happening. Scottee and I will go, and it won't be the same because we'll both have Wendy on our mind. This time she made sure that the she can't change her mind again and go with us by making plans to go to Florida and see her family. She will have bought a ticket by now and that will be her excuse later of why she didn't go.   So here I am in phase four. She entered it yesterday 3 hours after entering phase two by saying she was done talking about it and that she was going to cancel plans we had for last night. I didn't hear from her last night and although I don't think she'll stay in four for very long at all this time, the damage to me has been done. I am making plans with my best friend Darrell for the weekend to make sure that I am occupied. Last night Darrell and I went out to a bar and played pool for a few hours with a friend from my work. It was a good time and it got my mind off things. I'll just find things to do for the next two weeks till Scottee and the kids come home.   Well that is where we are at currently. I stayed away from going deep into feeling and thoughts about all this. I just needed to explain this situation in generic terms. The the next posts will be about the feelings and thoughts I have about the current situation and then I'll move on to broader topics, past experiences. My life has been full and wonderful so far. I have a lot to share.
