Seriously, when you are feeling overwhelmed by the waves of white trash scumbags entering your store, simply slip in a copy of  Chitty  and let the soothing melodies like  Truly Scrumptious  serenade you into a state of apathy, where you don't really care whether or not the half-drunk, wife beating, cracker is slapping around his ten mangy little kids.  So in other news, I got paid today, which always makes me smile, unless of course you just recently got back from vacation and have very few hours so that your check is miniscule...but on the bright side, that one paycheck probably adds up to more than most families in Somalia make in a year, plus I have daily meals and a home to live in so I should probably be a bit more thankful.
