As a send off, Phil and I went out to the bars on Thursday with our friend Christine. It was a pretty good time. I was wise enough to limit my alcohol intake, so I felt perfectly fine the next day. I think that is the first time that I didn't feel like shit after going out on Thursday... Damn you Bullseye and your 3$ all you can drink Thirsty Thursdays.   I ran into another friend of mine, Jen (of French Is fame), at the bars and we decided we should go do some karaoke sometime. For some reason, I have this urge to do karaoke, but that will probably go away after I get booed off the stage. I also found out that Jen works in the new science building and has a master key, so I will be paying her a visit at work soon so we can explore the new building.   The good news about Phil leaving the office, is that his position is now open. If everything goes to plan, I will get his position. This is good news for me because it means I will get benefits and an increase in pay. I have to hand in my resume next week, so I'll keep you posted.
