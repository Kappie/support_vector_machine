We went to the nude beach again today, but first we were on the other side, it’s a two sided beach.  We played a little volleyball, and swam in the ocean for a while because there were some monstrous waves, got those on video too.  Went to the nude beach for a little bit and then drove home.  We caught a ride home with this guy from the hostel and right before we got to the hostel which is in the ghetto, we passed the government housing and there was a huge fight going on outside.  There were probably about 10 or so individual fights going on and everyone was slowing down.  The driver decided to turn around and when he did the fight started spilling into the street and a guy got pushed into the side of the car, or he may have been trying to jump on the car so we could get him out of there because he was getting beat pretty bad.  We weren’t about to stop and the cops weren’t there so we kept going, the guy was still getting beat up behind us.  Once we heard the cops coming we went back, and the cops had to get a statement from us and everything, it was a huge mess.  After that we went back to the hostel and had a few beers and then some people at the hostel almost got into a fight, but one of them left in the morning.  Lots of drama, and all I want to do is sit on the beach.  Too top things off, there is a community kitchen, and the food we keep buying keeps magically disappearing, staffs probably taking it.  But we’re outta here soon enough, onto Kauai, and onto the Na Pali coast, in the mean time, I’m gonna sit on the hammock and read some books, maybe watch a little tv, and play a little scrabble.
