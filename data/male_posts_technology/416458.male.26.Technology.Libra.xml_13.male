We've been trying to find out what the minimum and maximum values for the Java Date class are.  Turns out they are 2^63 milliseconds either side of 1st Jan 1970, obviously we wanted to know what this would be in years. Mike broke out the Windows Calculator and started to work it out, but on a whim I wondered if the Google caluculator would manage this. So I tried it, see below.   urlLink 2^63 milliseconds in year   God they rock.
