I can console you on the loss of the cellphone connection but don't expect my sympathy for your Ranjitha. If you want, you can spend the wholee day calling her or waiting in froint of the Reliance office (as you are free now),  Vijay Babu wants to join us, I'm told by Rajesh. Seems like we are getting a lot of new faces to join us. Kicha and Ram take note. So i'll be sending him an invite now.  Bye, Jax.
