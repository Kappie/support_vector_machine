Well first let me say that she is the only friend of Jaimes that I have problems with.  Probably why shes become Jaime's best friend.  second, I'm not the only one who feels this way.  Sharon (Jaimes's Mom), Marty Jr (My dad), John (A friend) have all said that we need to get rid of Jill.  Its not just the fact that I'm jealous, which I will admit I am, but shes just a bad influence on Jaime.  Plus I probably wouldn't hate her if she didn't do half the stuff she does.  Like when Jaime is upset and I try to comfort her Jill, even though she sees what I'm trying to do, takes Jaime and comforts her while I'm standing there looking like a Jackass.  Thats probably why Jaime thinks I don't care for like I used to and why she tells Jill stuff that she doesn't tell me.  Well anyways I just wanted to point out that I'm not the only one who feels this way about Jill.  I'll quit the bitching and let you all go.
