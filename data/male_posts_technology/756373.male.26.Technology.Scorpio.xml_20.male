Vul_kahn's arguments are that both feature you bashing things to level up so you can bash more things. This is a simplified version of his argument, but essentially he IS correct. The single-player campaign of 'Nights IS pretty much just a hack and slash with some decent dialogue and plot intrigue thrown in. However, to define a true RPG, you have to go deeper, you have to look at the roots of Pen and Paper Roleplaying. A P RPG game consists not merely of a bunch of players hacking things. It includes two very vital elements. The tools to CREATE an adventure, and someone (The Dungeon Master) to actually run the game. When you play Diablo2 or 'Nights single, one key element, the human DM, is removed. No longer do players have the freedom of choice in a P RPG, because strict rules prevent you from doing so. The reason? Simple - PC's aren't human. They have no intelligence. They cannot predict or react to human 'wackiness'. If you kill a critical NPC, the game either 'breaks', or the town guard kills you, or even worse, the NPC is 'invulnerable' (pfft). And THAT isn't roleplaying. Roleplaying means being able to do exactly what you want, and bugger the consequences. Not even 'Nights' single player is, in that regard, a true RPG. Neither is Baldurs Gate, or even Planescape Torment. However, Nights has one thing up it's sleeve that Diablo doesn't. In multiplayer, you CAN have a Dungeon Master! And INSTANTLY, 'Nights becomes a lot more than merely a hack and slash. It becomes a true CRPG, the first of it's kind, ever. FM's can possess creatures and NPC's and 'speak through them' or even guide their actions. DM's can create NPC's and monsters out of the air... almost anything that you can do in a P RPG, can be done in 'Nights. Factor in 'Nights' content creation, a toolset the likes of which have not been seen before, and I can comfortably say tha tNeverwinter Nights IS the first , true translation of Pen and Paper Roleplaying, to PC. Now if only more people would actually LEARN to play as the DM...
