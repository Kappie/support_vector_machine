Saturday, I painted the inside halls of my school, spent a couple hours at Tualatin Valley Television while some friends of mine were editing footage from a tight retreat that I had to miss cause I had way to much home work.  Then, I went to Melissa's house for her b-day party.  For the first hour or so, until Butters decided to show up, I was the only guy among, like 20 girls at the party. It was cool; we watched a couple movies and played random games for several hours.    Sunday, I went to my parent's church. It was ok.  Monday, I didn't do much out of the ordinary.  Tuesday, I went to youth group. *duh*  Man, Stages wastes no time - they had their last performance of the Cross and the Switchblade on Sat., and by Tuesday, all but a couple tiny parts of the massive set was torn down.  We had worship in the Fellowship Hall cause the on-stage end of the PA system wasn't up yet.  This was the second to the last week that we're going through the evangelism course.  Next week we'll wrap it all up, and the week after, we'll go back to normal yg teaching. After we got out, I spent more than 45 minutes trying to pipe the music from the cd changer through our new digital mixer, into the mains. I finally figured out what setting was wrong and corrected it, right as my dad walked in. lol  Wednesday, Ben came over, just for the sake of coming over (he just started a new trimester, and didn’t need help with math).  My mom took us over to midweek, and Uncle Greg gave me a ride back home.  I love midweek – it has an amazing atmosphere to it.  Josh lent his red leather jacket from the play. I wanted to wear it to school on Friday for school spirit day, but it was raining and I opted for a jacket with a hood instead. (Actually, this week was spirit week – Monday was twin day, Tues. was super hero day, Wed. was nerd day, Thurs. was blast from the past day and today was school spirit day.)  After the service, Trevor and I went out back and checked out this tight tiny VW bus.  The thing is like, 8 feet long, 4 feet wide and 4 feet high. The engine block is in the back, so Trevor and I could easily lift the front half up off the ground.  The entire weight of the thing, including engine block, can’t be more than 800 pounds. :)  Thursday, I wanted to help out with a show Pastor Steve was doing at the studio, but I had too much homework. I was talking to Jamie on im, and was planning on dropping in on her and Brittany quickly, but my mom wouldn’t let me until after we ate dinner (which turned out to take an hour to make, not 10 minutes).  Then, I called them and said I’d try to drop by today, but that didn’t work since I was only home long enough to take a shower and head off to my small group tonight.    Today was pi day (3-14), and we had a party in pre Calc.  *yay*  We also had a "pep rally" (if you can call it that...) after last period.  Since our high school student body is only 130-some-odd people, it wasn’t that big of a deal.  It mostly consisted of our three basketball teams (girl’s, guy’s JV, and guy’s V) facing each other off in an amazing set of playoffs (well… two), using a beach ball-sized ball, with circus music playing in the background.  After school, I got a haircut, ran into Mr. Rivas at Costco, talked to him for around half an hour while waiting for the employees to get me some more contacts, then ran over to Best Buy to get some badly needed RAM.  While there, I spotted a tight AFI cd (Sing the Sorrow) for $6.99, and bought it.  I got home, took a shower, jumped in the car, and promptly tool 45 minutes to get to a destination (my small group) less then 20 miles away…  First, my dad misread the directions (I was driving), and we overshot the turn by 2.6 miles… Then, he again misread the directions, and we overshot the next turn by 4 miles… Then, he misread the directions again, and in the process of turning around, he directed me into a ditch.  All in all, it was quite funny.    Tomorrow, I'm going to help out with a program that Andrew’s dad is recording, from 2 to 6 pm.  Then, on Sunday, I'm attending a surprise party for one of my upper classmen, at Melissa’s house again, from 4:30 to 9 pm.  I’m prolly going to catch a ride back with Gwen and Adrie, since my parents are going to be at a bible study.
