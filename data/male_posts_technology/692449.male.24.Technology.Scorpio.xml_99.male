I understand that my application is less then impressive and that my handwritting makes it look like the application was filled out by a four year old on acid, but you'd think I'd be able to find something somewhere. Oh well I must continue to soldier on. In other news the  urlLink Czar  and his men are invading Baghdad. I hope that his Proconsul will actually give these people something better then what they had, but after our past  urlLink attempts  I have little hope. Here is one last  urlLink  link  that I think will be educational.
