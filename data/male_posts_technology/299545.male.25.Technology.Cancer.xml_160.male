Throughout his course of treatment, Ben played computer games and began to think about the need to have something positive to help others kids battle their illnesses. Ben’s wish was to design a video game that would be helpful for kids like him who have cancer, a way to fight back and relieve some of the pain and stress involved with treatment.   So the Greater Bay Area Make-A-Wish Foundation® sought out game companies to find a champion to make Ben's wish come true. “The initial response was overwhelmingly pessimistic” said Patricia Wilson, Executive Director.  “People told us this venture was nearly impossible without taking several years and literally millions of dollars.” A hero stepped forward: Eric Johnston, and his employer LucasArts fully supported his efforts.  Not only did Eric want to make Ben's wish a reality, he planned to involve Ben in every step of the process.  For months, Ben and Eric have been meeting on a regular basis to make the game just as Ben envisioned it.    You can download Ben's Game  urlLink here
