Sure I can handle it, but someone will suffer, I can attest to that.   Apparently there are two GBA games that have gone under my radar (which I prefer because I love to be plesantly surprised).    urlLink Mario VS Donkey Kong    urlLink River City Ransom EX   Granted these games are remakes, but they bring back a time when things were simple and I didn't have to think so much (or think at all). The gut basic instinct of gameplay is presented on both these games. You should take notice (if you do play these games) that this is gaming at it's best (as far as gameplay is concerned). Best Buy has Mario VS DK for $24.99, which is a good price (better than gamestop's $34.99). Ten bucks cheaper is a good thing. River City Ransom is going to be a different story.   I think I've pretty much accepted my position (or lack thereof) at work. There's really nothing I can do aside from bitch and moan about it and I'm not really known for that. I still hate it (that much is true), but I resign myself to hoping that this is a temporary situation.  I must finish the Star Destroyer. I must finish reimaging my computer. I must finish La Pucelle and get back to Disgaea. I must read some more.   Lots of thing to do.
