I am so tired from Thorpe Park though. I really am. But I really enjoyed it. Simon is a wimp. Haha. I am tired. At least I won't be bored over the next 2 weeks as Jackie is very kindly giving me her dance mat while she is away. O how I love Jackie. I am tired. The park tomorrow better be fun or I just won't bother so someone better come and mess about and not just sit there for the whoooooole four hours. I am tired. O look, I just looked at my msn list and 6 people are online but I didn't even notice because my brain won't function properly today. I am tired. My cats are so funny. One is asleep in the chair and one is in a box. How cute. I am tired.
