Kids have exams today (don't ask!) - so now I am wondering what to do this weekend - I got these new swim pant/shorts so I want to try them out - I HAVE to go swimming this weekend!    OK, maybe plan a trip to the Lake on Sunday.  Today seems like a cleaning day.  Boy, could it get any more exciting?
