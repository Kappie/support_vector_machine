So i proceed to cook the hotdog omelette with FAN CHOY! yum yum!  Morning was a rush throughout work. Afternoon will be a well dugged graveyard for me to fall in as one company's entire network having problem due to unknown virus attack. Guess tonight will be another night of OT. Let's get myself prepared....a lawyer firm and american club to go for my field detail but I feel like eating more snake at home and just went I am typing my hp ringing for me to reach american club by 2pm.  I want to watch HARRY POTTER and the prisoner of Azkabanz!!! I have no time for it at the moment two proposals coming up....time's up! time to work!
