I have, for some time, been quite despondant about the future of the internet, especially with regards to the lack of forward motion from W3C and IETF about sorting things out. Now this may have stemmed from my dislike for RDF and the lack of a decent roadmap for the acceptance of IPv6, but there you go.  Anyway, I now know better and that the future is all about XHTML. This standard rocks my world. I've been annoying my workmates since I downloaded it, always saying things like "This will be so much easier when we get XHTML". This annoys them becuase they are, on the whole, far more sensible than me and know that it'll be a good 5 years before we can actually build sites using this stuff. But I am still a happy bunny, because I can now relax in the knowledge that the right people are working towards the right goals. If you have any interest in websites then you should check this out right now, while there is still a call for public comment.   p.s. I have to admit that a small part of me, honestly a very small part, likes this because I know how much it's going to freak out web designers! :)
