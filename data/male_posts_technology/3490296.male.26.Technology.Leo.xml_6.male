Old flame and a new love.. only thing in common is, both are attached and both love their bfs.. Ya, i really feel like taking a 100 tonne hammar and smash my head... Shouldn't me at least wake up my idea after all these while?  When Mandy see this blog, she probably will feel ease that she didn't fall for me... Hap.. i feel down.. If Aileen gets married, this will truely be the ultimate regret i will ever have.. There is nothing i can do, except to wish them happiness.. I'm envious.. but thats the much i can do.   This morning, i went jogging.. ya, to vent my anger and regrets.. Yup, pretty dangerous coz my body almost couldn't take it and i almost fainted. I'm too disappointing! I was the one who initiated the broke up with Aileen, yet until day, i still carry the torch for her! Damn... I tried.. i tried... i told myself, she is not a babe and i must be shallow.. But, the truth is, i didn't fall for her looks, i really fell for her.. the person she is. That's why, until today, i still feel... in fact, very much for her. It was hidden, didn't surface until i called her last night. I didn't know abt it prior.. I don't know how much she had changed, i just hope, she is still the person i love.. At least, i can continue to keep this feeling deep, hidden where its supposed to be hidden..  Hap: You sucker! What about Mandy? Thought you felt for her?! DJ : It wasn't fake.. i really do... i really don't know anything now.. i'm too disappointed in myself, too disappointed to face myself.. i will pray that they are happy with the ones they love.. i will..  Hap: What about your's?  DJ : I ruined it 4 years ago.   DJ
