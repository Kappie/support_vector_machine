There was a question about the mean number and all I could think of was the advert where that man goes 'can you spot the mean number' and one number takes an ice cream from the other then hits him. Dammit. I would've been so depressed last night if it weren't for lovely Jackie. 2nd July.....hehe. Then I was thinking about Jo's party. 21st June.....hehe. Then I was thinking about Party In The Park. Whenever that is......hehe. Then I was reading the email Si sent me aasking fi I did actually want to go to the cinema or was it just Jackie messing about. Hehe.
