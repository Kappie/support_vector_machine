It was as though I'd been spit here,  settled in,  into the pocket,  of a lighthouse on some rocky socket,  off the coast of France,  dear.  One afternoon,  four thousand men,  died in the water,  here..   and five hundred more were thrashing madly,  as parasites might,  in your blood.   Now I was in a lifeboat,  designed for ten,  and ten only, settled in.  anything that systematic  would get you hated.  It's not a deal nor a test nor a love of something fated...   The selection was quick,  the crew picked and those left in the water, got kicked off our pantleg...  and we headed for home.  Then the dream ends,  when the phone rings, you doing alright?  he said it's out there,  most days and nights,  but only a fool would complain.  Anyway,  Susan,  if you like,  our conversation, is as faint as a sound in my  memory,  as those fingernails scratching on my hull. ------------------------------------------------------------------
