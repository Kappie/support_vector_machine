The author studied in India for a while, so the book is about 75% Eastern philosophy and concepts that are probably valid ideas, but my narrow Western brain has a hard time wading through. Anyway, the primary thing I have gotten from the book is the concept of the inner child (which he says is often misused in western psychotherapy). I basically agree with his description of "trances" that reflect the age when something traumatic happened, related to my own experiences. The trances are similar to the concept of coping mechanisms, which may have worked for a traumatized child at that age, but as adults, those mechanisms are no longer appropriate responses to non-existent but perceived traumas (ties in to the cognitive distortions: paranoia, awfulizing, negative self-talk,etc.)     This concept fits rather well with my current "working model" for my depression. I think that I developed coping mechanisms (trances) at various ages which worked for various occasions. I kept operating under those false mechanisms when the threat had ended, but I perceived it to still exist. Eventually the distorted behaviors became habitual and ingrained into my personality, my "character" I play every day (usually far from the "real" me). Now that things are different and I no longer need to operate under those conditions, I will need to make an effort to reverse the habitual behaviors I have developed over 25 years or so.     God, that sounds easy. Time's up, that will be another $90. If it were so easy to make those changes, don't you think I would have done so already?? I think that 15 years ago, maybe soon after Lilas (the Old Bitch) left, I would have benefited from dealing with these issues in a therapy setting. Instead, I just kept things inside, talking only to a very few close people (Anne and Alyssa both helped get me though) over time but never really dealing with the problem. I just kept those few boxes sealed up, stuffed in the mental attic for more and more time, knowing they were there but never having the courage to open those boxes and finally throw the shit away. I finally realized about 6 months ago that NOT opening those boxes would be potentially more painful in the long run, and that in order to *survive (not exaggerating) I would have to deal with those issues, no matter how painful.     Now that I am starting to accept new possibilities, I need to start believing I can get better. There is a big difference between accepting that UFOs are possible, or believing that they exist, or seeing one land in the front yard. For a long time, I have felt that the "happy people" live in an ignorant, brainless dream world. Now I can accept the possibility that some of those people have had problems, but they figured out how to put their past behind them and chose to lead a sincere, well-adjusted life. It will take some time before I become one of those people, not necessarily happy but at least at peace with their life, but maybe I am starting to believe it can happen.     Finally, I am starting to believe the concept that the thoughts cause the illness, not necessarily the other way around. Up until this second, I have been saying "the beast" is in control. Can it be that The Beast is really more of a Sasquatch, alive in the imagination but with no tangible proof of it's existence? Can it be possible that The Beast is nothing more than the sum of all my illogical fears and manufactured coping mechanisms? If this is so, then if I can de-bunk the myth of the beast, piece by piece, stripping away each individual distortion and fear and negative thought, maybe it will just be a little man behind a curtain, pulling my levers but with diminishing effectiveness until ... I free myself, and get on with my life I left behind at age 15 or so.     So here I am. This is me, right now, today, older, flabby, sitting in my Hanes and writing my life story. If I have a choice, there will be many more chapters to write. I am a product of my experiences, good and bad; the people I have interacted with, good and bad; and the choices I have made, again good and bad. But I am more than that, or else I would be no better than a troupe of monkeys. I have the ability to move on; to break old, bad habits; to take better care of myself mentally and physically; to accept the past as the past and not let it rule my life anymore.     I remember being mean to someone 15 years ago, does that mean I am a bad person today? I made a dumb mistake 1, 2, 5, 10 years ago, last week, or maybe 5 minutes ago, does that make me an idiot? I didn't make an effort to keep up a friendship, does that mean I should never make any more friends? Only if I choose to see it that way. I think I finally can start believing that I do have choices to make, not necessarily the choices I thought I was missing, but other, more fundamental choices that determine the rules I will choose to live by: those of the Old Bitch, my self-imposed martial law, or a new set of rules that I have not written yet.
