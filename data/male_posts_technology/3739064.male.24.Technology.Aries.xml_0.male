So, yesterday I spent the whole day programming and thouroughly enjoyed my day at work. This has confirmed what I need to b e doing the rest of my life.  Today though, I am confronted with a dishwasher. You see, we have 2 dish washers. Ive only been using one. Stuff was piled in front of th other. So I move the pile and open it. I am greeted with with 3 inches of water falling out of the dishwasher about 6 months old. Imagine a Brown, white, green film of mold over the top falling out onto the floor for me to clean up. The smell was even better! SO, I eventually soak up all the water and remove the filter in the dishwasher to find paper and whatnot blocking the drain. Turns out some assclown saw that the dishwasher had flooded, shut the door, and left it for 6 months.  Now that that's off my chest, heres another little fact about me.  Yes, it's true I have a hard time saying no. Everyones told me. But is it really so bad to do something  for somebody. My thought process always comes up with an excuse to make me feel good about my decision. I mean I do make decisions to help within reason, i wont just give somebody my left thyroid if they asked me for it. And I am getting better at saying no in the right situations. For example I used to do computer work to help people for free. Now, unless you are family or close friends, I charge 50$/hour for computer repair, 75$/hour for Infrastructure setup, and 90$/hr for programming. Isn't funny how nobody wants my help anymore :)
