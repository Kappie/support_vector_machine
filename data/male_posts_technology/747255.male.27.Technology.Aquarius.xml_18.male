I could have written a dozen or so pages of encyclopedia derived facts and figures but that's not what the professor was looking for. She wanted analysis and thought... So I analyzed and thought my way through 6 pages, including title... and the last page was half bibliography. Oh well... I think I could still pull an A in the class. Final is coming next week... can'tcomplain much about open book open notes... it's just that there are 3 books and no notes... why didn't anybody send me notes? hmmm....
