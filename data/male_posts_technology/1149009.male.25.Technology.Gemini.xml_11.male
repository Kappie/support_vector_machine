I recall these events with great anxiety and fear, as well as great joy and relief. This day was among the best, and the worst. The day started out like most others. Then an unexpected chain of events lead to an unexpected conclusion. 	As a child in the second grade, life is typically care-free. Eight year old boys usually worry about the new G.I. Joe or Transformer action figure and play set. Getting on and off the school bus was my biggest responsibility. The school I attended would pick up the elementary students at the end of the day and bus them to the high school to wait for those students to board. This lead to about a ten minute wait for the elementary students, who were allowed to get off the bus and play in the courtyard until the high school dismissed. So with that ten minutes of freedom, my friend and I departed the bus and began to do what little boys do best, run and play. However, the daily routine would soon be broken. 	The routine went something like this. The high school students would dismiss and board the buses, followed by the roar of the buses diesel engines cranking up. This was our signal to find our way back to the appropriate bus and get on for the ride home. On this day, however, my friend and I took our time making the short trip back to our big, yellow mode of transportation. We bounced along kicking rocks, jumping from anything we could climb on, and playing in the dirt. For an eight year old boy, the shortest distance between two points is a skewed line. Our pace quickened, however, when we noticed the lead buses pulling away. Running up to our bus we found nothing but a folding, glass and metal door that was shut tight. I can remember the expression on the drivers face. Without a word she said it all, she was making a point, and no matter how much we beat on the door, she wasn’t going to open it. She just shook her head and said, “No”.  My friend and I watched that bus, and many more pull out of the lot. I had never seen that lot empty, until now. It was an unfamiliar territory. 	We started to make our journey on foot, walking up a busy street that lead to the overpass and our neighborhood on the other side of the interstate. I remember being so scared of being run over or picked up by some evil person. The worst thought though, was what my mother was going to say or do. The awful and swift punishment I would receive couldn’t match being run over by a truck. Just before we made it to the overpass, my friends’ mother pulled up beside us. This was all made possible by my brother, who had made it onto the bus in the first place, and was already home. On the ride home, I tried to be as invisible as possible. My friends’ mother let us know how she felt about our adventure. She was not pleased. I knew that I would get the same treatment when I arrived home, and I was petrified. In my minds eye, I could see my mothers’ belt, affectionately known as “White Lightning”, just lying there, waiting to dispense punishment. My friends’ mother dropped me off at my house and I prepared for the worse. However, my wild imagination was wrong. There were no belts cracking, no beatings, no yelling or reprimanding. Only the smell of home-made pizza and the loving embrace of my concerned mother. She wasn’t mad, and she had made pizza for supper! That was too much, I didn’t believe it. 	That day in my childhood is, without a doubt, the worst and greatest. It was an emotional roller coaster that stands out among my thousands of experiences and will remain with me forever.
