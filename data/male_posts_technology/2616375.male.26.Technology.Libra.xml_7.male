When i was planning to do my MBA, i read the book "Snapshots from hell" authored by Robinson that gave a insight into Stanford Business School..  Now, we have our own IIT version of the pains and gains one goes through that makes them go from good to great.. The book captures the 5 point GPA (out of 10) travails that a few IITians went through..  the interesting stuff (like the omnipresent playboy) in the IIT hostels are making the book an interesting read :) so things are not that "academic" behind the closed doors ;-) i am still reading the book, it was soo interesting that i couldn't resist writing about it.. and chetan is going to be in bangalore on May 22nd (more details at the URL mentioned above) to sign a few copies.. i am going to be there.. we need more literature like this to document the great institutions that we have in india. as an afterthought, would it be a good idea to publish the book in hindi?? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.
