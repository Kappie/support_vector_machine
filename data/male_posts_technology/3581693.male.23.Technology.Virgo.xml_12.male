That is I don't like too many different types of music.   I find most music is tollerable to a certain extent.  One point of interest about my musical interests is the fact that I enjoy Elton John. For the longest time I was ashamed to admit it. Because he's gay. But then again so was Freddy Murcury - Queen - and millions of men sing along to his songs at sporting events each and every day.   So - anyways now that I'm nearly 24 - I think it's time I stopped being ashamed to admit that he is one of my favorite artists. He's very talented.  I went to one of his shows once. It was just him and a Piano at GM Place. It had to have been one of the best shows I've ever seen. 3 hours of just him and the piano - mind blowing.  So there you have it... I am self-confident... proud of my interests.   Hey after all it's me!
