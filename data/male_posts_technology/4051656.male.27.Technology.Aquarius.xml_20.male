Even back in my days of 6th grade Civics class, things like  urlLink "police state"  sent shivers down my spine. Back then, the very idea that the USA could become one of these places was the furthest thing from reality.  These days however, people argue about whether or not  urlLink free speech zones  are constitutional. Constitutional?!? Are they serious? Wasn't one of the primary functions of the constitution to preserve the freedom of speech in ALL OF AMERICA?  People argue  not  about whether or not candidate X will win or lose the election; we argue about whether or not candidate X will  steal  the election. And the really offensive part about it is; it's really not whether or not candidate X  will  steal the election, it's about how hard we make it for them. All this nonsense about electronic voting machines doesn't even matter. It's who's counting the ballots, or who's announcing the winner that matters. The UN has been invited to monitor our elections, which makes me somewhat more comfortable, but what exactly does that mean? Do they count the ballots? Double check the results? Or are they just monitoring the actions to make sure there are no sheninagins? It's a sad day when the bringer of freedom and democracy needs an election monitor.  About this "police state" business: does anyone really doubt that the USA is anything but a police state right now? With the  urlLink FBI   urlLink terrorizing protesters , and our would-be head of the  urlLink CIA proposing legislation  that would allow the CIA to conduct operations within the US; something which has been banned for over 57 years. With all this, can we really wonder about our situation? It seems to me we are already in a police state. What's it going to take for Americans to realize?
