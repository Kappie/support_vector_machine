Not too shabby.   *Note: This was a Christmas gift, so I didn't even have to pay for it although I got to pick it out. Sweet deal.  ** Also note: Those are not my hands in the picture. Those are nice hands though. I bet this guy is a professional hand model. Look at that manicure. Those nails are the perfect length. And the nail itself is shiny. Geez, those hands don't look anywhere close to what my hands look like. In fact, my hands are developing a bit of a inferiority complex just looking at them.
