This is an ambitious project (with mixed results) to archive the whole freaking web at various points in time...it's like mega terrabytes of data and it's all well protected and regularly migrated as well as copied and kept in different countries around the world.  So in a thousand years or so, when researchers are looking at how people used to practice the Cincinnati Steamer at the dawn of the 21st century, Belle will get proper credit for practically inventing it.  And Boz will be rightfully worshipped as a God. And I will go down in history as the first Amish blogger.
