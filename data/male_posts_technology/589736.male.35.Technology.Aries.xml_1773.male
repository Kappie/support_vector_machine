Mir - I wouldn't necessarily classify you as a flaming liberal, but there is definitely some smoke rising around you.  Ben - Do you want pictures of the statue or of the nudists?  Speaking of the statue, do the protestors see how silly it is?  Bush is not being toppled, Sadaam was.   If  Bush loses the election next November, he will still be President for another 14 months.  And, he won't be a hunted man in his own country.  Hey, maybe we should hold a protest over here and topple statues of Chirac and Schroeder!  Yeah, that will show the French and Germans!
