I took the thermometer and measured my temperature..38.7 degrees. Oh my, i thought. So when my hands and feet are freezing, it means it's above 38 degrees. So what did i do? Nothing much..just lied down there hoping the cold would go away by snuggling in my blanket. My parents had to towel my forehead to keep the temp down and i felt i got warmer. Then, i took the panadol..i thought i was supposed to take it after dinner since it said twice a day but then it's been so long since i last took it (after bfast) so i did. After awhile, i started to feel warm...nice....then i could go and have a bath.    In the toilet, i noticed a lizard..not fully grown yet. It was on the wall going up....i saw it go up and suddenly it fell and gave me a shock. It managed to stick itself to the wall so it didn't hit the floor. I was thinking how come lizards have such special feet..almost like they have some suction power on their feet. Anyway, from out of nowhere, i saw a big black spider(i think) come down from the top of the wall right into the lizard's path. Then the lizard walked towards it and shot forth its head to bite the spider. After that, it shook its head violently. I think this is to make the spider blur. After that, i couldn't see what was happening already because the lizard went behind a piece of towel. (I witnessed all this while on top of the ivory tower so i couldn't move)..after a while, i heard 2 crunches..i guess that's it, that must be the spider's body being crushed..the lizard did have a good meal..such a big spider..of course it was happy.
