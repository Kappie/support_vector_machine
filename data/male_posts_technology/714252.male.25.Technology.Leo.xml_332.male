You know it still affects you in some ways but you also think it's not a big deal, then you realise that actually a lot of the things that you feel and the ways you react are changed forever because of something stupid.  I hate what I've become sometimes. I have no tolerance for certain things and has really screwed me up when it comes to relationships.  Last night I went to a Table Quiz with Orla and some friends of hers. One of them was an Ex of hers and I just found it so hard to handle it. After we picked him and his friend up I just felt really uncomfortable. I must have come across like such a prick but I just couldn't handle making small talk. I eased up a bit as the night went on but when it comes down to it all I could think about was what happened before.. What a pile of crap.  The thing is I have no problem with the Ex, he's a nice guy and I  know  I can trust Orla..  The problem is with me and I can't seem to get the damn monkey off my back..
