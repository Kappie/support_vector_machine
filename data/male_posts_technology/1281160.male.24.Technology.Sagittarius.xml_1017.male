Years hence, it would look as funny for ourselves as it was for the others in those days...   How often have u tried re-enacting some acts... that blows an inexplicable air of nostalgia taking us back to our "good old days" for a few moments... and at times becomes a revelation to us about ourselves as to how we have changed over the years... and may be teach us a lesson or two...   Sometimes.. it pays to ponder the past...
