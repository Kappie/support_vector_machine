Before the United States went to war [with Iraq], the IAEA had effectively demolished the most serious case for doing so -- Iraq's ongoing effort to build nuclear arms. Postwar American efforts to find nuclear materials have proven the IAEA right and the United States wrong.  So now comes the IAEA saying it has no evidence that Iran has a nuclear weapons program, while the United States asserts that one exists. Who's the world, and the American people for that matter, more likely to believe?   Basically, the U.S. used up their credibility on their prewar claims on Iraq. So even in Iran is a legitimate threat, the burden of proof is on the United States to prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt.
