In a way, he was living the life, but he also didn't get to have all this great STUFF that we wage slaves get.  Isn't being a consumer great?  I'm glad I have kids, because they can be trained to be little consumers now (especially by my shop-aholic ex-wife).  Or they can be crazy granola anti-tv, anti-consumerism, vegetarian cast-outs raised by their dad who's full of wacky ideas.  It's hard not to feel powerless.  Sometimes I feel that I just want to get by and eke out my existence.  I feel financially burdened, but hopefully it will just be a temporary feeling that will subside with time.  Hopefully my advisors are right when they say that my best investment will be my house.    The best thing I can do to not think about all this crap is to do what I enjoy.  Is that hedonistic?  Yesterday after work I took a swimming lesson, mowed the lawn, visited friends, and watched "Monsoon Wedding".  I had borrowed Monsoon Wedding from NetFlix, but halfway through, at chapter 11, the thing went haywire and didn't play on 3 different dvd players.  I never had these kinds of problems with VCR tapes and I still wonder how much better DVD's really are.  Maybe I just have to get a home theater system to experience the true power of DVDs.  But there I was, halfway through the movie, and what was I going to do?  Return the movie to NetFlix and wait a week to get a new copy?  No, I went to the library and borrowed it for FREE.    Yeah, so I love movies.  It's a good way to pass the time.  And I feel that that's all I'm doing lately - passing the time.  It's depressing, I guess.  Tonight I'll go hiking, and tomorrow night is yoga.  But I'm really just passing the time.  I guess it boils down to being pleasurable, possibly a chance to make new friends, and good for my health.  We do everything for a reason, right?  So what other meaning is there in my life?  Raising my children.  Becoming healthier by eating right, exercising and losing weight, so that I can be healthy and enjoy life more.    Maybe what I'm really doing is trying to cope with getting divorced and all the personal and financial hell I'm facing.
