Don't go there if u planning to watch the movie cos its a huge spoiler !  Lol just saw the new M1 ad....its making fun of Starhub's free incoming calls policy by having this couple trying to get each other to call the other party. But it is quite annoying when people keep messaging you to call them so that they save money, my sis always does that to me !
