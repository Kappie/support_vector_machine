Raven has started to become a familiar face in the north of Faerun. The adventurers have come to find him an allie, even before they found any real reason.  Raven first appeared when the party found themselves trapped in Luskan when the Brother Hood of the Arcane had put the town in lockdown and was searching for some unknown person or object. The party wanting to find a way out of Luskan where fortunate to find raven. He simply asked them to deal with a group of men that would appear at a specified address. Raven would then provide their escape.  The next time they met raven was in Miribar. This time was specifically strange in that he had no aparent motivation to help them other than some unspecified common enemy. As such, he gave his information and left them to their own.  The third time they met his was after the battle of Silvervein. There he congragulated the party on their success and proposed another deal. If the party would re-establish trade with mitheral hall for raven he would provide them with a way to repair the town and to alow them to finally stop galimar. It was at this time that they confirmed that Galimar was their shared enemy.  But what does Raven do? He quietly slips in and disappears with almost no one noticing. He always has what's needed and seams to be imune to the authorities. There has been much speculation, but only one member of the party can say for sure. The little halfling rouge, in a bold move that impressed raven asked outright to join his guild. Raven agreed, and upon the completion of the guild test the little halfling found out that Raven was the leader the strongest thieves guild in the northern sword coast, the Night raptures.
