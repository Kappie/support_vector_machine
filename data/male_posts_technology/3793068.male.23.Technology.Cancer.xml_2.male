Usually not the biggies like Christmas or Thanksgiving, but the smaller, more personal dates like birthdays and anniversaries. Since, I am also interested in PHP, I had the idea to create a web based calendar that can help me remember events. Right now, the calendar is just a bar bones object. I set it up in such a way that to use it all one needs to do is include the .php file on the web's and link to the stylesheet that goes with it (otherwise you would get a boring calendar with no colors :-( and we like colors).   urlLink Here  is what I currently have. You can change dates by click on the date you want. It doesn't rollover the year (ie Dec. 04 -> Jan. 04, not Jan. 05) and it uses 'get' variables to move from day to day which is something I would like to change, I'm just not sure how to do it. Anyway, if anyone else in the world that knows PHP happens to see this feel free to give me any ideas or criticisms.  The code itself is pretty self explanatory. Most of the work is done in the calendar class. So in order to use it all one would have to do is create the object and call the 'draw()' method. Of course this requires putting the HTML and CSS references in the class making it necessary to have the stylesheet to use the calendar. It still works without the stylesheet but it doesn't look very interesting.  If I were to put a version number on this, I would give it about a 0.05 because I still haven't implemented all of the features I want yet. The next big thing I would like to get is rollover year where going to Dec to Jan and Jan to Dec automatically changes the year. I also want to move away from 'get' variables as well.
