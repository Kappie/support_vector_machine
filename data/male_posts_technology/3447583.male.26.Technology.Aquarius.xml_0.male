Refer URL : http://www.hindu.com/2004/05/22/stories/2004052201691000.htm Please find that article pasted as the first comment below.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  In the Article “Calling India’s freethinkers” dated May 22, Meera Nanda’s point of “commitment to much thrashed scientific temper” is well received. There is indeed a need for the government to just govern instead of being a thought police. But I strongly disagree with the approach she proposes for attaining this objective and differ with her views on Indian spirituality and Hinduism.   To ensure that people are receptive to any idea one should understand their psyche. People should not ignore the entire argument by considering it as a mere intellectual gymnastic.   She proposes “In the case of Hinduism, secularization must involve a critical engagement with those aspects of Hindu sacred teachings that make empirical claims regarding the presence of a disembodied spiritual element in nature “seen” in the minds eye for the mystics and the yogi’s”.     The pre-requisite for a scientific attitude is an open mind which means a mind free of presumptions and the curiosity to explore the unexplored.The lack of emperical evidence does not mean the evidence of the lack.           Such a solution would never work.Such engagement with people’s beliefs will evoke fury and make the targeted audience defensive and thus apprehensive about your intentions, however noble they may be and in fact will lead to disastrous repercussions on two grounds.   First, It will increase the divide between those who believe in a faith and those don’t. Meera Nanda apparently doesn’t believe in the “minds eye” or in kundalini yoga. How then does she to hope to establish a channel of communication with those thousands or lakhs of Indians who meditate ceaselessly on the “minds eye” and practice yoga everyday? The message of secularism must percolate to the masses. How does she assume that they wont discard her arguments and understanding of Indian scriptures and Hindu philosophy as unacceptable and baseless?     According to her “Hindu gurus and god men stake claim to extra ordinary and extra constitutional powers by invoking gods commandments or by reading sacred books.” And she appeals the secularists to offer an honest way to reconcile Hinduism with modern science.  The intellectual Hindus will argue that this apparent mis-understanding and the misrepresentation thereof of the message propagated by the realized masters itself is an explanation of why it doesn’t appeal to the intellectuals who haven’t made enough attempts to understand the significance of India’s spiritual heritage. The hindus will argue that science should be looked upon as work in process and not as absolute truth. That there are subtler laws that rule the hidden spiritual planes and the inner realm of consciousness. That these principles are knowable though the science of yoga. And they will provide proofs of mystical phenomenon demonstrated by the realized masters time and again amidst the various scientist and doctors.   Such discussion will not help us bridge the gap. The need is to bring about a consensus on this concept of secularism in governance and in administration. Let people believe and follow their faiths. Let us not make the mistake what the politicians are already doing. Being a thought police.        Secondly, such attempt will give rise to creation of yet another political party, a group of fundamentalist, intolerant brutes who will shout loud and provoke the common man to support them in saving their religion from intruders. Lets us learn from the history. The strength of such political parties is the approval from the common man. The only way to enfeeble them is to withdraw this support. For it we have to attack the root cause of this problem. How?      Meera Nanda's calls upon the scientists, writers, intellectuals, and the liberal, forward-looking clergy of all faiths to join the battle for a deeper secularization of the Indian society. And I doubt if this call would have had any appeal amongst the intellectuals of this country. The reasons are understandable.   The greatest of the scientists, sports men, philosophers, mathematicians, doctors and academicians that our country has produced have been deeply religious or spiritual. Wasn’t Ramanujan deeply religious? Weren’t Aryabhaat and Chanakya rational and scientific enough?  Wasn’t S. Radhakrishnan religious and scientific? Were the academicians of the ancient nalanda university not religious? Scientific temperament Religion and spirituality can and has coexisted seamlessly in India. We must realize that religion, spirituality and scientific temperament are not mutually exclusive components in the fabric of Indian society. They are tightly intermingled threads that define and unify this diverse nation.  The problem is neither with religion nor with Indian spirituality. Indian spirituality has percolated the western world deeply. So deeply that that have begin to teach the same philosophy to us now. Its presence doesn’t bother them not does it create any problem in their politic. In fact they are reserching the effects of faith in god on medical healing. Indian scriptures are all about universal love, goodness, being kind and using your power of discrimination at all times. The problem is the anarchy and confusion caused by the dogmatic opinions supplanted in the philosophy by the intolerant selfish pedants few hundred years ago and which are still being preserved rigidly by these myopic obscurants, the VHP and Bajarang dals for their own vested interests. Its impact on the Indian society has been so grave that its virtually impossible to cast off that veil of misunderstanding unless these fundamentalists are prevented from propagating and carefully nourishing their nefarious intentions. This has happened in all the religions. Reacting to the chaos and maligning the religions is no solution. We need to seperate the wheat from the chaf.          Why is that the uneducated poor is the victim in the riots and not the educated class. The educated intellectuals of this great nation realize that there is an essential unity in all the religions; that there is no difference in the faiths expounded by the various faiths and that there is but one goal admitted by all the scripture. Of love, tolerance, selfless work, devotion and universal brotherhood  self realization.   This is the only message we need to explain to the masses again and again through various channels and in detail by systematically comparing the scriptures of various faiths. It has already been done, but not advertized properly.  Unless the masses decide not to get aggravated by the provocative rhetoric of these mean politicians  deceitful sadhus there is no way to counteract their attempt at leveraging political advantage and safforonising the politic.   Convey they the message :    "Love does not delight in evil,but rejoices with truth. It always protects,always trusts,always hopes and always preserves"        Corinthians XIII 6-7     and tell them what krishna said :    ahankaram balam darpam kamam krodham ca samsritah mamatmaparadehesu pradivisanto' bhayasuyakah     (Gita : XVI:18)      "Given over to egotism, brute force,arrogance,lust and anger,those malicious people hate Me,while dwelling in their own bodies as well as in the bodies of others"    If this is the only topic that appeals to the masses then why not take help of it.This is the only message on religion to which one hundred crore people of this country will be respond to.You need snakes venom to cure snakebite. We require the help of the unfathomable goodness of the scriptures of all religions to clean this induced dirt. We need the help of spirituality and religion to make India peaceful and secular.
