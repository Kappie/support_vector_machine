Its our crimbo tradition anyway. We came back with nothing so we had lunch and with the firm instructions from mother of 'go and get some christmas lights' we headed out again. Went way out, right off to the M25 to a garden centre there. We brought a set of new crimbo lights, a new candle light set and this sicky stuff to hang your crimbo cards up on. So all in all, a sucess. Yesterday evening Jackie and I went to see  Elf ! I loved it. I love kiddies films. Soooo funny. SAAAAAAAANTA! I know him! I know him!
