     
       Strong feelings for the wrong reason, 
Wrong reactions to silly decisions, 
Silly musings on obvious subjects, 
Punish me, please, don't let it get worse, 
 I could come Sundays, but i come everyday 
I'm sad to admit i don't know the better way, 
Everyone does it, i'm not better of course, 
Punish me, please, don't let it get worse...
