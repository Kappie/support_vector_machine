Once in office, Bush put aside the Florida controversy and pushed for the passage of his tax cut bill and education plan. He signed into law modified versions of both. With those two great victories on the domestic side the President didn't look to revolutionize American foreign policy, but that's exactly what he did.    When President Bush entered office he pursued a very different approach from his predecessor, staying out of the Middle East and taking the United States out of a series of international agreements. These international agreements included the Kyoto global-warming treaty, a biological weapons agreement, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the International Criminal Court, and he withdrew the United States from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty much to the dismay of the world community.   Then the September 11 attacks happened and changed the Bush presidency forever. The world praised Bush for his handling of the events and he made a well-received speech to Congress, notable for this blunt line: "Whether we bring our enemies to justice or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done." This was the first glimpse of the new direction Bush was taking, two months later America invades Afghanistan and overthrows the Taliban regime for their support of terrorism.   President Bush was now ready to introduced America and the world to the concept of pre-emption. He lay to rest the Cold War doctrine of containment, replacing it with a new national security strategy which holds that the United States must not let its enemies strike first. "After September 11, the doctrine of containment just doesn't hold any water." he said. "We must deal with threats before they hurt the American people again." Bush seemed ready to put his plan to action.  On March 20, 2003 President Bush order the invasion of Iraq, despite the lack of international and U.N. support (but with the backing of Congress and a high majority of the U.S. public). The US lead "Coalition of the Willing" seized control of Baghdad in April 2003 and Bush declared an end to major combat in early May. Although spermatic fighting still exists in Iraq that War has been an unbelievable success, freeing the Iraqi people and giving them hope for a prosperous future and pre-emption worked.   The concept of pre-emption is the right Foreign policy for America. No longer are we constrained by world opinion and their views toward us, although we must not abuse this. We can not be held down by another country or the world community. If America sees a danger brewing we have every right to take steps to protect ourselves. No longer is our security in the hands of other countries.   President Bush went to the UN and international community trying to find a solution for the Iraq "problem" before the war, but nothing was done. The UN had a loud bark but no bite. Saddam Hussein knowing that disobeyed all of the UN resolutions passed by the security council. The threat just grew and grew until something had to be done. Bush quickly solved that problem.   Critics will argue that once America has done something other countries will follow. Many say now that America has used pre-emption what stops countries like China or India from using it? I believe there shouldn't be anything from stopping them. If the threat is real and viable then they should be able to protect themselves by any means available...if the threat is real, but not for any aspirations of conquer or empire.   President Bush went from being a governor untested in national politics to changing the way America handles it's Foreign policy. In 3 shorts years America has adopted and embraced Bush's pre-emptive policy and it has caught the attention of any nation or group of individuals that's wish harm on our great nation. The attacks of 9-11 awoke America to the dangers of the world and America will never be the same again.
