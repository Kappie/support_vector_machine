       Graham Crackers 

    

    

       Gurgling in lower abdomen 

       Flatulence 

    

    Seemed fine but small 

 

 

 I don't drink coffee, but I must have my morning intestinal problems. I was fine until I rolled over in bed, then the gurgling started low in my abdomen. It isn't painful, just disturbing and annoying. 

 Today is the day I pay very close attention to my meds and food intake.  I'm going to start a lot of things soon, but hopefully not all at once so that I can try to figure out what is working and what isn't.  Vitamins, Calcium,  urlLink Citrucel ,  urlLink Primal Defense ,  urlLink Perfect Food  and  urlLink Zantac  will be my regimen, along with eating a little food frequently.  I've tried all these things before, just not all at once and not consistently. With starting a new job soon, I need to get a handle on the regimen now.
