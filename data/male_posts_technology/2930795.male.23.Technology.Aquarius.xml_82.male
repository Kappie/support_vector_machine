It was  cold and raining at the Melbourne Cricket Grounds, and the game started close and low scoring.  The match was almost tied at the half, but starting in the third quarter Brisbane Lions had their way with the Collingwood Magpies.  Aussie rules football is a great brutal sport and a hell of a lot of fun to watch.  It's got all the elements that make a sport exciting to watch, fast paced action, high scoring potential, feats of skill and luck, and a healthy dose of violence.  It may be my new favorite spectator sport.
