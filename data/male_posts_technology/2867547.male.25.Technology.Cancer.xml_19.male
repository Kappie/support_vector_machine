Ooh, man, the links are precious. I read recently  urlLink Exception Management Architecture Guide  which has some good insights, but it left me somewhat unsatisfied. I have already read some good Code Project articles, listed in Mike TreadWel's post  urlLink Managing Unhandled Exceptions in .NET  and  urlLink  A Treatise on Using Debug and Trace classes, including Exception Handling .   But I had never heard of  urlLink Chris Brumme  and when I read yesterday his 20 page blog post  urlLink The Exception Model . It was too much detailed for me, and there were plenty of things I had never heard of. I was forced to skip huge sections, but still I found many practical advice and explanations of the some exception peculiarities. If you want to dig deep, read that one.   If you want to design your own Exception form (to deal with unhandled exceptions by the applictaion) go look at those very good articles (code supplied). Jason Bock,  urlLink Creating a Reusable Error Dialog for .NET Applications  and  urlLink Display Dissected Exceptions . In my last project I used a simple message box to include exception type, message and stack trace but I admit it was ugly.   Now I plan to get to know  urlLink Exception Management Application Block for .NET  which I may use in my current project. My first impressions are quite good.
