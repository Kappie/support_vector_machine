The next step in human civilization will be the universal language. English is this language, and internet the process accelerator.  My grandfather is 101 year old and he often talk me about all technical evolution happened in 100 year (car, fridge, TV, nuclear energy, etc.) It was so interesting to watch and live all this evolution, and to try to imagine what our future will be in 50 year. I 'm happy to live this and afraid to learn how we destroy a part of this planet to progress again. It's so interesting to talk with you at the other side of the planet, and in same time, I don't know who is the guy who lived on the other side of my street.  So I need to learn english, be cause it will be the inInternationnal langage, and if one day the guy who lived on the other side of my street has a blog, I could take a rendez-vous with him to take a beer at home... Isn't it ???  Don't forget to leave me messages and blogg adress because I like to know what people do on the other side of my dear planet. Mother Earth, I love you...
