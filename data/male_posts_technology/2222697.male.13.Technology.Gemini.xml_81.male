I was assigned a project to make an animal out of geometric shapes and it turned out like shit. Yes they do give us work and teach us stuff but still half the time they are correcting the students that are off task and sometimes all we do in a period is grade papers...WE ARE ALL GOING TO HELL!!      They need to fix the skool system and actually teach us things, get rid of all the kids that are disrupting so we can learn something. Damn public school...I am an A student and I can figure out why everyone is an ass all the time, My friends are AP students and they aren't immature.       A reason why i decided to move is because of this, everyone is trying to make me multi task and I can't. If i watch tv kids are always at school, and barely have a life. All of it is, "are you gonna go out with her", or stupid things like that.      A middle school relationship doesn't even matter, It is stupid, seriously is anything going to happen!? No its not. I don't even know why I try anymore...Oh yeah, it is to get money for A-kon.      If I was like most of the kids in the school I would get 200$ for every Time i got straight A's, I would be rich if I we're them, Their parents wan't more, I guess.  I'm glad for what I get, I got a computer for christmas and It still isn't old!  (thanks dad)  Straighten Up Your LIVES!
