This is a monumental leap forward for my department.  We have been working on the Smartphone platform for years and we are now in the US market!  The AT site is selling the phone for $299, but until 10/28/2003,  urlLink Amazon  has the  urlLink phone for $149.99  (after $150 mail-in rebate).  

It is difficult to explain just how powerful these phones are in words.  First off, it's a great phone.  Reception is rarely an issue, audio quality is fantastic and all the features of a regular phone are there.  Combine that with a full-fledged PIM (calendar, contacts, tasks, email), MP3 and video player, Internet Explorer, MSN Messenger, and more!  An additional feature that not many people know about is you can use most of these phones as a wireless modem as well!  Anywhere you go with your laptop, just connect your phone with the provided USB cable and now you are on the internet!  

The longer I am in this department, the more I love the products.
