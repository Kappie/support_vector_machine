As the time draws closer I am getting more and more excited, and can concentrate less and less.  However I am also sad, sad to leave my two partners in crime behind.  Both Carrie and James have been a strength (and supply of cask wine) over the last few weeks.  How I would have coped without these amazing people around me I will never know.  So to my two bestest friends in the world - I will miss you heaps, you will always be in the back of my mind - well at the front when I am writing one the 25,000 emails letters and postcards that I will be sending home, and Gede and I will have a few drinks for you.  Take Care, look after our lovely home, and I will be home before you know it.  Much love, always Kai xoxoxoxoxoxoxo
