I've grown so used to tech stuff that I wonder if it were all taken away from me, if I could have a happy life. I'm serious, I don't know what I would do without my cell phone, my laptop, my video games, my television, my Internet, and just about everything else.  If I'm bored, what do I do? Go play Gamecube or some Gameboy Advance. If I need social interaction, where do I go to? Go online and chat with friends of use my cell phone to call someone up. If I'm hungry and want something quick, where do I direct my attention? The microwave, of course. Without these things, I would feel so lost.  Can anyone get so dependent on technology, that they actually think the things they use daily have existed for all their lives? I think I'm guilty as anyone who works in this line of work. Lately the use of technology has been more frequent. I'm spending way too many minutes of my cell phone ( Thank God for unlimited plans! ) and the countless hours spent playing Metroid Prime have been growing with each passing week. Plus, I've realized I left my Gameboy Advance behind, so lately I've been playing Superstar Saga and leveling up, to try to kill the last boss. He doesn't let me have a chance against him! By the way, if you own a GBA and haven't played this awesome game, you should go and buy it NOW!  Today is the end of my working week, so I'm psyched up about that! So let me go finish some work and actually earn my pay today! Have a great day, and don't do anything I would!
