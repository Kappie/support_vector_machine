I'd like to ask you make an appt."   My heart just skipped a beat, then practically exploded, before dropping into the deepest bowels of hell.  "Ooops she said, I mean we got your blood test, and you are negative."  THANK GOD!  I almost pooped myself.  "But we didn't get the urine test done successfully, could you come back in and give another sample?"   Well sure I answered.  Ended up going after work today.  Whoa, gotta end this entry quick.  CW's Uncle is returning, early, and I need to get the hell out of here.  Oh this feels SO much like highschool :)..
