Although I did not put any efforts into becoming one, but whenever I came across my friend's uncle (who was a well-known Telugu Actor) or another of my close friend(whose distant relative was a Telugu superstar), I couldn't stop thinking about those precious minutes of fame.The film industry seemed to me as a get-quick-rich industry where I could make a lot of money with only my talent (which I thought I had enough, although nobody in my family had ever been in movies). As days progressed, I moved my focus more onto my first love - My desire to be a Software Engineer - and there ended my dream of becoming an actor. But that did not stop me from reading about films, the actors, the trends in the film industry, and the happenings. Maybe that is why it hurts me while I write this article.I used to hear about struggling actors being exploited for roles in movies - which some of them never even got - both the sexes alike. But as we all would agree, being a woman in a Man's World is the worst thing to be. I then read an article about 4 years ago in one of the leading newspapers about how a struggling actress was interviewed by a very well known director to cast her in her movie, and then how he had proposed her to sleep with him in order to do the favour. That really shocked me !! But then, my more knowledgeable friends told me that this was common in an industry where the few minutes of fame can make one do anything. Do you mean ANYTHING? Yes ANYTHING. As the Pandora's box opened, more and more things came to my knowledge and I realised that the industry that I once considered as 'ROSY' and 'NEWCOMER-FRIENDLY' and 'TALENT-BASED' was not exactly what I thought it to be and there was more to it than what appeared to the eye.So what is that drives the film industry? Is it Sex? Is it the Underworld? Or is it both? What I realised is that it is both. There were stars who were related to the Underworld in influencing the outcome of the movies or the casting of the movies or the distribution of the movies. Then there were stars who eloped with the men from the dark. Then there were stars who flew all the way to the abode of the Underworld to favour them. Then there were stars who acted as a double for the more popular stars to replace them in compromising scenes in a movie. And then, many stories, many articles.All that glittered was not really Gold !!! Then I happened to come across this story of a struggling actress who was raped 16 times in a period of 5 years by a well-known director on the pretext of being offered a role in one of his movies, which finally did not happen. And she broke the news out. Shocking? True. Read the story at  urlLink http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/789587.cms   urlLink http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/789610.cms   urlLink http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/788327.cms   urlLink http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/789054.cms   urlLink http://www.indiafm.com/feature/04/jul/2607couch/index.shtml   urlLink http://www.indiafm.com/scoop/04/jul/2607preeti/index.shtml  This lead to a lot of other shocking revelations and questions too. The first revelation was that this sort of a you-favour-me-I-favour-you system had existed from a long time in this industry. In one of the articles above, one model says "Even before producers and directors ask them to sit down in their office, these girls are lying on the couch. It's basically an established barter system. 'You give me what I want, I'll see what I can do.' No guarantees." Now that is something that is astounding to read. One of my friends has a relative working with a very reputed Entertainment and Media Firm in this country that has interests in Aviation, Real Estate, Politics, Cricket, Advertising, etc. This guy told my friend about what he saw at almost all the lavish parties of this Firm, which were a platform for bringing together the filmstars and the politicians. He said that almost in all the parties, most of the top stars would end up drinking heavily and lying unconscious on the couches here and there, while the half drunk politicians would end up putting their hands in the wrong places for some fun. I also came to know from my friends that there were some people who could deliver you any woman - right from a Medical Student in a top college in Bangalore to the most popular actress you can name - all for a price ranging from Rs. 1000 to Rs. 2 Crore !! Some of the top film stars have come out themselves in the past about their relationships with their co-stars. A famous heroine of the yester-years got pregnant from a well-known director and married him after making him divorce his first wife.In yet another article above, a struggling model says "I'm an NSD passout and looking for work in Mumbai. It's accepted that you get a role only if you sleep around. Just last week, I was propositioned by the assistant of a famous director. I was offered a role subject to my fulfiling three sexual acts described to me in graphic detail. When I refused, the role that was 'just right for me' became 'come later'. There's hardly a break with no strings attached." Also, A British wannabe Bollywood actress narrates an interesting incident, which confirms the existence of the casting couch to the core. Anna Edwards felt it unbelievable when she was informed that she had landed herself a role in this mega budget bollywood movie. But what followed almost threw this 23-year old into a tizzy. On the next meeting in the producer's office, he darted the question, “I have given you a role in my movie, what will you give me?” The girl at once realized the situation at hand and fled in good life. She is now a popular television star in UK and opines that Bollywood isn't the dreamland that it is made out to be. Looking at the other end of the story, this kind of a rape can only happen when there is a consensus. But again as it is said in the article, there is a very thin line between rape and consensus rape and maybe this is why it is difficult coming to a conclusion on such cases without taking the underlying situation into account. The point to be noted here is that if the director, after sleeping with the actress for 16 times, gives her a break, then would this news have come out? And, is it justified for an industry to have such a system in place? Isn't there a law that can protect the exploitation of these newcomers and allow them to raise their voice against these producers or directors the moment they are asked for sexual favours? Or Is there already a law in place which is not being properly utilised for the benefit of the common man? Whatever be the case, it might be the case that many a talented actors/actress might be out of the place they actually deserved because of some money-hungry, sex-hungry producers and directors who would not give talent a high priority against their hunger.Let me see if I can write more about this in my next article.
