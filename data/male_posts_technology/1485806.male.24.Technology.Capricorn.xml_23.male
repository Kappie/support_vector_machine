Other things that counts especially to pursue a technical career, and...well what a long story but then it is Joshua 's time to make the long story shorter....  One of those days while i parousing for jobs in the jobstreet.com.my and the advert caught my eye literally and I applied for it... As had happened to my past job searching applications, it got rejected because they have unclear details on certifying the documents...i have sent it twice before it have been approved.  I am studying again thanks to this and i am starting this Monday...similar to Wai Nyan, starting a new chapter of life in another college except this college have not a CF. Hey now i see an opportunity...hmmm....president of Info-Trek Christian Fellowship....ITCF ...that is nice....  But then i am not the president material, i tink i shall stick to serving in college ministry....  For now i am still stuck in Ipoh preparing my car...yes i am getting my car in the next few weeks....preparing my false teeth following a few hours stuck in the torture chamber (dental Clinic) that strikes fear each time i brushed my teeth and the sound of the drill still haunts me at night. Can you believe it ? I asked my mom certain questions pertaining to what if i get a girl and there starts the occassional never ending bombardment of questions about the girl instead of the usual questions of career.  I can't wait to get back to KL and have my cell meeting and meeting all the strange people again.  Come to think of it, cell ,haahh...now that is home but all good things must come to an end...with so many members going off next year and even my cell intern and cell leader.....What is left is just Wai Nyan and me....ahh But then this is not concrete whether Daniel will leave us....  5 of us will still lead Simply Utd, with me , Wai Nyan, The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit. Imagine a cell of 5 , we can do so much. I mean we can do it any time....hehehe......If not enough we can ask the angels to join in too....  Think that i am crazy....no just having fun time ,,,,]  Hey God always in control...and God will provide the cell for us and a plan ....probably a bigger plan for us But we have not seen it yet. Ohhh welll....   Just want to praise God for all the God things He have brought to us...an approval for me to study and hey even a bigger news.  Siok chye my project partner and best friend have accepted Christ or so I think ...because he have invited me to his Baptism. Heheh God is good alrite
