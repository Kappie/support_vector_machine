Having this hit me all during graduation really sucks.  I know that I won't ever see a lot of my friends every again.  Not seeing my wife again, that's hard to deal with too but she's created a lot of false animosity between us to make it ok.  I just wish she didn't go for the jugular of our relationship.  I could have justified her unhappiness, but she willingly ran into the arms of another man.  She thought that she would fall in love with one of the four guys she was hanging out with, Donnie just happened to be the one most readily available.  She's kind of a slut that way.  We even had precautionary sex before she went to see him.  I know it's a sick thing to tell your husband after the fact.  She's a sick person and I know that now.  I see clearly and I am more hurt but better because of it.
