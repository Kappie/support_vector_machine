Regarding Vijay Babu's question...as most of you said...i am not sure either....cos i want to change my job now..but dont know what field to choose....im in real limbo....in UK mgt job means sales and marketing.....the title may differ from company to company but the role is the same.....telemarketing!!!.....i dont want that sort of job....i want a mgt job in an IT company....this is what im doing right now! my current job profile is ok but not the company.....when i try to look out for a job there is not much scope for me.... all I can tell our juniors is.......be focussed in what you want.....develop your core competencies in the chosen field!  All the plans for TN govt sounds promising....just waiting for the day we see the result! bcos all I do is compare the atmosphere in here with what we got in India......v really wonder many times...' when these dumb heads can have such sophisticated living, why not we, who are much more superior and advanced in technology? ' as far as im concerned....the core reason for what India is today is ' CORRUPTION '.....i dont say corruption doesnt exist here....it does....but not for petty things and more importantly when it comes to the question of people's welfare!   bye
