The only difference is that some people's lives are more messed up, because they can't seem to control it. I suppose, from that point of view, I'm lucky, because my life is fine - but it wasn't always that way. One thing I've got going for me is discipline - I can make myself do things I don't want to do. The down side of that is that I'm to disciplined at times and I've made choices based on what I think I "should" do, rather than what I wanted to do. Its always a balance that you never can acheive. I suppose some of it is if you listen with your heart or with your head (and which one!). That's largely a personality thing and its beyond an individual's control. That's what makes life interesting - everyone is different. You wouldn't really want to live on a planet with everyone the same as you, would you - I sure wouldn't! Since everyone has to create their own lives, there are a few bumps along the way, as you discover what works and what doesn't and try to implement what you've learned. The challenge is that everything changes constantly, so just when you think you've got it figured out, the rules change....interesting. My objective is to try to stay loose and not get to stressed about what's happenning. Remember no one gets out alive so have some fun in the meantime!
