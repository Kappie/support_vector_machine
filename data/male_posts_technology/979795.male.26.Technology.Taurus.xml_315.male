Now I'm really tempted to read the book and getting the extended / Director's cut on DVD and watching all 3 shows again.  Was feeling lazy on Mon and didn't go for Aikido thinking I could go on Tues instead. But lastnight I was out with my cousin (after the movie) and so I missed practice again. Haiz ... must be getting a bit lazy these days.  Found out today that my dad's Pacnet is on a 1 yr contract and we have to pay about $300+ if we wanted to cancel it. WTF! And to think I had asked him whether we were on a contract or not. He nonchalently replied no, making everything sound as though we had the better end of the deal. Oh goodness, I can't even upgrade the plan to broadband according to Pacnet. Argh ... feel like puking blood. Now the 2nd alternative would to maintain the co. a/c, and cancel the pte a/c instead and replacing that with SCV's connection. But why on earth would we need 2 unlimited a/c?   ... looks like no broadband/cable for the next 10 mths at least. Might have to discuss with my sis to see if she's willing to pay the extra. But then again, we'll still need to setup our own wireless network and the equipment seems like it's gonna cost us a onetime amunt of $500 or so, excluding subscription plans. ARGH!!! This is so irritating.
