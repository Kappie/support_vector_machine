More and more, customers ask me early in the call if I can see their screen, and even when I say that I definitely cannot, it seems they assume for the rest of the call that I can.  Here's an example from today:  Me - Tap the F8 key after you start the computer, let me know when it's on an 'Advanced Options' screen.  - (sound of F8 key being tapped) Customer - Ok. It's on a blank screen right now  - (sound of F8 key being tapped)  - (sound of F8 key being tapped)   - (sound of F8 key being tapped)  - (sound of F8 key being tapped) Me - Is it still on the blank screen? Customer - No, it's on the 'Advanced Options' screen  - (sound of my head exploding)  If you don't tell us what's going on, we can't give you continued instructions. We have no crystal ball to divine what is occuring with your computer.  When you're dealing with tech support over the phone, the method of communication is VERBAL, which means you must speak or nothing will get done.
