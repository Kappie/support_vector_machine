Awesome unit and I couldn't be happier about it.  urlLink (this is it actually)  I didn't pay $549.99 (before 15% tax btw) for it. I paid $321 and change total because I know someone who works there :)  So what the hell is my problem?  I spoke to a guy I know at work here who has his own PC-shop-side-business-type-thingy. Anyways, he's willing to cut me a good deal on a Radeon 9600 Pro! I don't have enough money now to get this, and its a $60 savings.  Sucks eh?
