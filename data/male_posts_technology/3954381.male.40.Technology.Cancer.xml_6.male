I knew he was going tostep it up, he said he was and he certainly did. Jose amuses me, I don't mean that in a condescending way; he left me a message one day last week, about what I'm not even sure I remember but his message started out with "Hello, this is Jose Fuentes, your personal trainer...". I can't help but crack a smile even as I wrote that; I mean yes it's possible I know another Jose, I don't but of course it's possible. But to clarify that he is Jose Fuentes and to follow it up, as if there would be some sort of confusion on my part because I didn't recognize his voice, he reminds me that he is my personal trainer...you gotta love someone like that. It's all I think about night and day, not him per se; but that I am going through this metamorphosis and it consumes my every thought.   Can I do it? Will I succeed? Will I be the better person for it? What will I look like when I am done? I can't even imagine. I would like to think I will be a million times moreattractive physically, I mean I have certainly seen my share of the male phsyique both in person and in pictures (thank god for the internet) and I think that even an average or below average face on a sculpted body equals above average looks. Let's hope so. I am certain I have the determination to go for quite some time.  Jose weighed me in before we started, we were both pretty happy when I weighed in at 322, that's an 8 pound drop in two weeks.During the workoutsession I noticed he was much more into it then has been in the previous two weeks, cheering me on, motivating me, trying to get my flabby unused muscles to perform in ways that have, until now, been unaccustomed to.   Once again I was spewing perspiration, I must look like a lawn sprinkler when I get like that and it embarasses the hell outof me. But I suppose it's my overly largebody just trying to keep itself from overheating.   After the workout we were chatting, I had some serious (and seriously embarassing) questions for him. Such as, once I have lost the weight, will I have disguting saggy skin all over my body. I mean I have such a gut (still, even after losing 68 pounds in approximately three months), I know the weight will continue to drop off and the abdominals will contine to tighten and develop, but I'm not convinced that the skin will bounce back. He assured me it will. Also I was asking about stretch marks, woudl they go away. He said they would. I hope he's right. Of course I believe everything he tells me, I have no reason not to; he's been doing this for some time. I just have this horrible feeling that despite my acquiring a muscular body after logging in many many hours working out that I will still have these gross stretch marks and sagging skin. That would really suck. Not to mention completely unfair, but so far as I know, there is no complaint department in lifethat will handle that problem. "Excuse me, God? Yes, I would like to exchange this skin......you can see it's damaged?" Fat (no pun inteended) chance.  So during our chat he informed me of the following:  1) By October I should see musuclar development 2) By December I should be down to 250 3) By April 2005 (sounds like a long time, but its really only nine months) I should be "cut"(?). He didn't use that word but that was the impression I had. But really, basedon where I am now, anything will be an improvement.   Right now my stomach is killing me (damn crunches)and I can barely sit up straight; I am sure tomorrow I will feel better. And each day thereafter....a little better...I just have to take it One Day at a Time.
