In the midst of our pain, we are encouraged to remember Him. When we are bruised and broken, we are called to remember His sufferings. Jesus carried His cross on a bruised and bloody back and walked directly into crucifixion for something He did not do. He was killed by people He loved and cared for, abandoned by all. But He walked that valley. He carried that cross. He completed His assignment. He purchased our salvation.   When you think you can't make it through the valley, when the pain gets too great to bear, when you can't take another step--remember the cross. Draw strength from the cross, fall on your face at the foot of the cross and let the One who bore it all help you bear it now.   -- Reflection on  urlLink The Valley Song    Source :  urlLink SolidSounds.org , featuring insights from God’s Word on the lyrics of today’s Christian music  ********************************************  Gems, does that describe  our  situation or what? Or mine lang? Hmmm ... hehehe :D
