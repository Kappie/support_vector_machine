You arrive at the station sunday evening and find your train on track 4.  There's a few people milling around, climbing aboard.  You get on.  The seats are arranged in 4's, two forward and two backward, with a little table in between.  You find your seat, in the second car, seat 16, which is on the aisle.  You can see a head in 15 (beside yours) as you approach.  You get closer and see a long, shapely female leg sticking out from under a Saint Ivan's skirt hung over the armrest.  As you get to the seat your worst fears are confirmed.  It's Missy Thorson in seat 15.  She's staring out the window chewing on gum and hasn't seen you yet.
