Or more specifically, IBM's WebSphere Studio Application Developer (WSAD). It was good to see them again. My ex-colleagues, I mean. I invited them over to do the demo so that we can decide on what development tools to use. So far, our boss has decided to use Java. So now it's up to us to know as many developments tools there are in the market as possible, then to choose the best. In other words, the easiest to use. After the demo, (which took about 2 hours to finish, this plus the question and answer session and the eating and drinking session... hehehe), I went out for lunch with my ex-colleagues. Just the six of us. Just like the old times. Sometimes, I still miss them, the old office, the environment, the friendships.   Alas, now I am in a whole new environment, getting to know new people, getting to know the workings of a hospital, and getting to be called 'doctor' once in a while! Heheheh... I think I should start wearing a stethoscope and a white doctor's coat and walk around wards and clinics just for kicks. Then, when somebody ask me a medical question, I'll quickly put my hand to my chin and say "hmmm... interesting question... I think you should refer your [insert ailment here] to [insert a doctor's name here], because I feel he/she is more experienced with that kind of thing".  So, what do you think? Can I pull it off? Hehehehe...  Yesterday had a chat with a friend of mine, and I commented on her blog. Well, actually, it was more a comment on the things she didn't say. And I said, if it was true, then I'm happy for her. At first she denied everything, saying it's not true. Then after a while she became defensive. And started being angry, although she did it in a joking way. After that, I logged off because I had to go home then. Then in the evening, before Maghrib, I think, she called me up and asked whether I was hurt by what she said. Of course not, said I. And we started talking on the phone. She was, at that time, driving home from work. Hands-free, of course.   Anyway, the reason I brought that up is, I don't know what's going on. With her, I mean. She's a really good friend, but I don't know why I made her angry. No, let me rephrase that. I don't know why she was angry with me. And this morning she was angry with me still. She said it was because England lost. If you are reading this, dear angry friend, I apologise. Hope we can still remain friends.  On a more cheerful note, a friend of mine just called me up. A few minutes ago. She just arrived in Malaysia from Australia. And she sounded so happy. She said she's been calling everyone and telling them that she's back in Malaysia, and she was suprised that everyone was excited that she was back. She said it made her feel like the Prime Minister. Hehehe... I was excited as well. I was darn happy to hear from her. We used to be colleagues. And her other half is my junior from school.  On a more wonderfully cheerful note, my beloved just called. She's still in bed though. It's so good to hear her voice. Although we call each other up every single day. Hehehe. Am missing her so much. She's at home at the moment, her classes starts on Sunday, since she's studying in Terengganu at the moment. How I wish she is here with me now. Don't want anyone else. She is all I'll ever need. I pray our 'jodoh' is strong since ours is a long distance relationship.  InsyaAllah . Miss you, my love.
