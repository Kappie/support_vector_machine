I've been thinking about taxes and the government and decided to approach the problem from a different perspective.  Is taxing a RIGHT or a PRIVILIGE?  Really, does "the government" have a right to tax us whenever they please, or is it something that we should have a say in? Can someone come back and tell the government: "I evaluated the deal that you have offered me and I don't like it. I wish to withdraw from your protection for my company in this aspect and not pay this particular tax".  Why are we so used to just accepting whatever the government decides to do?
