I still need to rake everything up, but that really won't take me all that long.  There are some bare patches in the back yard that need to be fixed, but that's something I'll have to take care of over time.    The front yard is my first project for tomorrow.  It'll probably only take an hour or so, so I'm not very concerned about it.  Nevertheless, I'd like to get it out of the way.  The remainder of the back yard can be done either tomorrow afternoon or on Thursday.    I've noticed that my temper is very short lately.  Perhaps it has always been that way and I'm only just noticing, I don't know.  In any case, I've been getting very angry very easily of late, and I'm not sure it's a bad thing.  I'm much more inclined to voice my opinion when I'm angry, and I don't become a frothing beast like some people do when angered - I remain articulate, but I gain in volume and diminish in tact.  I become very direct.  It's a good thing.
