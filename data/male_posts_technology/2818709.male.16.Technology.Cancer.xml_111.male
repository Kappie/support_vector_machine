Don't care for me, don't cry let's say goodbye, Adieu. It's time to say goodbye, I know that in time it will just fade away, it's time to say goodbye.  I stand alone and watch you fade away like clouds high up and in the sky I'm strong and so cold as I stand alone Goodbye, so long, Adieu.  * Oh how I love you so, lost in those memories And now you've gone I feel the pain, feeling like a fool, Adieu  ** My love for you burns deep inside me, so strong Embers of times we had And now here I stand lost in a memory I see your face and smile  Diese Liebe von meinen fur mein Blutenherz....
