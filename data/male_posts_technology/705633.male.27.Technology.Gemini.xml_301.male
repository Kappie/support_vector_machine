For those of you that don't know "The Toaster Crew" and some friends are all going over to Guernsey for a 60's Disco to celebrate Toasters Birthday we have The Afro's, The Flare's, The John Lennon style glasses and the bright colour shirts.  At this very moment Toaster is blasting 60's funk music throughout the office practising he's dance move's. I have charged the batteries on my "get your mind out the gutter" camera and will have the pictures posted as soon as we get back.  As long as we are not all locked up, in case you fail to hear from us by Monday we are relying on you or dedicated readers to come and break us out in true Steve McQueen style!
