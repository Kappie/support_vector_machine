With fans gripped by the fifth book in J.K. Rowling's series, the owner of No 4 Privet Drive -- in reality No 12 Picket Post Close -- is putting the house up for auction with a price guide of 250,000 pounds.   Go on! Bid on it!! If you are able to buy it, then you'll have to excuse the occasional appearance of Dobby, the house elf or the swarm of owls that descend on the house every once in a while!! ;-) :-P
