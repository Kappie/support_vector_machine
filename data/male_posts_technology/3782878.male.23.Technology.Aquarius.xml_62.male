When I first got out of the camp, I found out my ally Kretais was busy in Skyfire battling some rather large hoards, I also found that Ellektra, our Enchanter was otherwise occupied as well. So my trusty Cleric companion Akcron and I made our way to Emerald Jungle, because we heard the hunt would be good there. Sometimes it's nice to just go somewhere on safari and hunt. when we arrived to the cliffs of Emerald Jungle, we found our way down the staircase into the jungle. The jungle was lush, and the animals were no where to be found. After some hunting I came across a large mosquito, called a Soulsipper by most. I ran forward and shot arrows at it, it chased me and I began to hit it with my hammer to fair effect.   It was then that I realized the shouts of pain from Akcron, who was being pummeled by a gorilla. I attempted to taunt off the gorilla while providing my lay on hands to Akcron, but I wasn't fast enough, she fell dead before me, and I knew I was in trouble, running with all my might through the trees I was trying to find my way out of the jungle, but apparently I took a misstep, and was quickly killed by a reflective spirit. I found my body rematerialized at the soulbinder in Gunthak, and made my way back to Emerald Jungle to recovery our equipment.  While this happened Akcron had met up with Ellektra and began mustering forces to assist, I made the decision that since Ellektra was now with us, we should head to Lower Guk once I rescued out items from the jungle. We agreed and I made my way deeper into the forest. I eventually found my body, removing most of my equipment from it so that I could use it against anything that got in the way of my recovering the body of Akcron.  I found Akcron in the same place she had fallen, and I drug her body back while being assualted by 3 large mosquitos I eventually outran them, and found a quiet spot to cast my resurrection spell. Brell brought Akcron back to her corpse to recover her strength and equipment. I left her there in that safe place and returned into the jungle.  I made it to my body fairly safely, after having gone too far on the cliffs and almost being eaten by leeches. Down stairs I managed to grab my body and return it to the safe spot I left akcron at, and she blessed my corpse with brell and I recovered my strength. after recovering our equipment Kretais had completed his Raid on Skyfire, and made way to meet us at the Grobb stone in the Plane of Knowledge.  We returned slowly but surely to the Plane of Knowledge, and made our way to Innothule Swamp, home of the Frogloks. We had a new member of our group, another dwarf paladin named Katheena, she was upset for a man had mistreated her, but she turned that pain into strength as we went forth into battle.   When we made it into Upper Guk we did not realize the Frogloks of Guk did not take kindly to our Enchanter, but then again, many people distrust Dark Elves, even I distrust them, though Ellektra has proven in battle her worth. the Frogloks of Guk began assualting our enchanter so I fought a few of them off, and we fought our way into the passageway into lower guk, where forbidden things have occured for quite some time.   I found out that many of the lower guk denizens were undead, the foulest creatures on the entirety of Norrath. so I called upon the power of Rodcet Nife, and he imbued my hammer with the power of Life to slay these undead creations. and we continued on into Lower Guk. We almost got lost a few times, as Kretais said that we needed to go North, but his map was not very clear of this place. So I eventually found the lower level that did go north. came across a blood pool, I had a strange feeling in my beard that this was going to be trouble.  Cautiously I attempted to walk around the pool of blood, as I had a feeling it may be a trap, well it turned out that the space around the pool was the trap, and I landed in a pit, assualted by a mean nasty gnome and his pet skeleton. A necromancer! worse than the undead themselves! by brell's beard I must destroy him. so I fought him, while my friends were all looking for me. Eventually Kretais found me then the rest, and we set out to dispatch this corrupted gnome. This gnome was no child of Brell for sure, and it seemed as if the battle would last forever as my hammer kept missing it's mark. Knowing how poor I am with blunt weapons, I always carry my two handed darkforge sword, so I switched to that, and began causing havoc, as blow after blow began to land on him, eventually he fell, and we rested for a bit. after a little rest Akcron and I went spelunking further into the area, following someone I had seen earlier moving north.  When I got to the spot I had seen the man walk to, he had become a skeleton, I realized this is often what necromancers do, but I figured this Necromancer was fighting other undead, and it is better to realize an enemy to be your ally, until he stops fighting your enemies, so I decided not to challenge this individual for his beliefs, and instead asked him if this was where the Arch Ghoul Magi was to be found. The Necromancer seemed to know who I was referring to, so he led me and Akcron back into another area, with a library and a cot, and said that this was where the foul Magi lived. he then took out one of the guards that was in the room, and took off. Meanwhile I was fighting off another of the guards and sent Akcron out to lead the group back to our location. they made it to my location, and after dispatching the guards, we setup camp inside the room.  It took a long time for the magi to return, so I sat in the cauldron, ducking down so only my eyes made it over the lip of the cauldron, and teased the others that I was invulnerable inside the potted steel. they then further teased me by dropping various ingredients in with me, and talking about how tasty Dwarf Stew was. I played along and pulled out my garnish and spices, and poured a jug of sauces over my head. Then I began to pull out my wine from my pack, and began to drink. Claiming the whole time of course to be "marinating" myself. everyone got a good chuckle, and began to laugh even harder when they started saying they couldn't understand me.   I must say I have a weakness for the bottle, but I recover quickly and I have yet to meet a dwarf who couldn't drink and still fight. Akcron began telling me how she would help me get off this addiction. I told her it was no addiction, I just enjoyed the feeling. We hung out in the Magi's room for a great long while, and killed a few guards who returned to the room. but eventually our Vah Shir friend Kretais had stated that he grew weary of the battle, and that we should return home.  I led the way out, only to find out I led too well, half of the group was not behind me, and as I turned around more undead frogloks attacked me, so I was fending them off while hunting for the others of our group. Well it turned out I began to hear Katheena grunt from the blows of battle, and I cried out asking where she was, she was in the trap that we fell in earlier. Now equiped with the power of levitation I floated down right as Katheena grew weak and was about to fall, and laid my hands upon her, rejuvenating her back to decent health. I told her to climb the ladder as I began to taunt the attackers away from her. Apparently brell blessed her, for she disappeared out of view of all for a time, such that the undead forgot she existed when she returned to view.   After taunting the evil Gnome off of Katheena Akcron had been rooted by the vile corruption of Brell's creation. I couldn't get the Gnome off of Akcron sadly and she died. so I ran up the ladder and noticed the pained sounds of Ellektra running through the hall, I ran around trying to find her, only right as I found her and was about to cast my strongest healing spell, she collapsed dead. I could not find out ally Kretais anywhere either, we just all got lost and seperated, and that made us all dead. I tried to escape to the upper guk area, but I made a wrong turn, and my heart fell into my stomach when I wound up standing face to face with the Arch Ghoul Lord.the undead closed in behind me, and I fell dead. I learned later that Kretais was lucky and managed to gate out before being killed.  Anyone who knows me, and knows paladins, we are knightly people, and I uphold the art of Chivalry, so when I heard that Katheena was all alone trapped inside Guk with no safe way out, I scrambled to assist, unfortunately being without my equipment I attempted to rely on my spells. I had made it down into lower guk, but I did not make it much farther than the entrance before I was slain yet again. By this time Kretais had assembled a fine group of rescuer's, they were a Warrior, a Wizard, and a Cleric. they ran in, made a path and began to resurrect us. They found one of my bodies without error, and once Akcron and Ellektra got resurrected they took their stuff, meditated and gated out. I however stayed behind for I was the last one resurrected and Kretais was lost as to where my corpse may have been. I guided the troops to the appropriate spot, using nothing but my summoned hammer of wrath and my halo of light to guide my way. Brell must've given me strength, not to mention the cleric's temperance because I marched ahead and managed to help the Warrior clear the path for our group. Eventually I met back up with Katheena, informing her that we were coming to pick up my body and that we were going to then teleport away together. she was happy that we had finally made it down to salvage her.   The Warrior pulled my body out, they resurrected it, and we all ported away. Needless to say, it was a messy evening, and I have learned a very important lesson. when the group splinters and get's lost, there is no hope to survive, only through preserverence and close unity can a group survive against powerful enemies. I will always look behind me when leading the way, to ensure no one gets left behind. Tonight perhaps we shall return to that rotten place, and finally meet that arch magi. but now it's time for me to rest.  If we meet may it be as brothers, and not as enemies, Ziggur Rathebringer
