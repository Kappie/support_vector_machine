Its the second time I've played since I've moved back home, and the second time I've done any physical activity since...  Anyone?  Anyone?  Starts with ``can't,'' ends with ``remember.''  Anyone?    I think the only thing keeping me strong enough to lift ice cream to my mouth was my occasional use of my force feedback steering wheel.  So after we played soccer, and got cleaned up we went to Hooters (for the wings).  Then we cruised down 1960 (cuz thats what ballers do).  We ended up at Hurricane Hut because there was no cover (cuz thats what broke college guys look for).  Our waitress was an undergrad from Texas State studying Marketing---  Allow myself to interrupt myself...  If you have seen me interact w/ people as I meet them, then you probably know that I have an undeniable urge to find out what they do, are interested in, etc.  (I don't always ask, but often do.)  To me it is an opportunity not to be missed.  You never know who you are going to meet, what they know, and what you can learn from them.  It's really something to take advantage of.  (e.g. I once learned a lot of interesting stuff about lawsuits, including the famous McDonald's hot coffee case because I sat next to a lawyer on a plane.)  So, where was I?  Ah yes, justifying my flirting with the waitress...  Ok, so this waitress was studying Marketing.  So I asked if she had heard of  The Secrets of Word of Mouth Marketing  or  Purple Cow .  She had not, so I started to talk a little bit about accelerating buyer decision and some of the principles of WOM.    Curiously, she seemed completely uninterested.  It's not like she had a lot of other tables.  There was basically a client to server ratio of about 3:1.  So what is up with that?  At least for the sake of tips you should feign interest in what your customers are saying.  I mean, flirting is good for business.  I know if I was a server I would flirt my pants off.  ---Well... not literally.
