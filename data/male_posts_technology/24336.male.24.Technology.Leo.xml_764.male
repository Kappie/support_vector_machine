Ok, in all actuality, having your strongest competitor get slapped with a  urlLink 5 minute penalty  wins the race.  If you don't want to read the link, basically Petter Solberg had some electrical issues before the start of a stage.  He and his codriver tried to push the car uphill to make it to the starting line in time.  There were already 4 minutes late, giving them a 40 second penalty when the officials realized they received help from the spectators to reach the starting line.  That tacked on an additional 5 minute penalty eventhough neither the driver nor codriver asked for the help.  With a final time difference of 3 minutes and 14.7 seconds from Markko Martin, Solberg would have won.  As Russ said, he probably wouldn't have pushed so hard if it wasn't for that 5 minute and 40 second penalty.
