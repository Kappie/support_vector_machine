So over the weekend I just watched The Cider House Rules, which I'd seen before, remembered it was good, and decided to watch again.  It was still good the second time.  I think it got some oscars.  For some reason, those tend to be good movies.  I also watched The Closet, a hilarious french movie with english subtitles about a bore of a man about to get fired because he's so boring.  Gee, I can relate to that -- it's not because he's boring, but that he doesn't really talk to people at work.  I thought it was neat to see the office hell lifesteyle in French.  I also have Monsoon Wedding but didn't quite get around to watching that.  So I just returned the first two and should be getting two more later this week.  I'm thinking of mixing up my queue so that I get Mostly Martha and Better Luck Tomorrow next.  Oh yeah, this is my first post.  I wonder if anyone will stumble on me like I stumbled on Merthin.  I was thinking about how much I loathe my wife (soon to be ex-wife, I guess).  I don't want to get into it now, but I googled "loathe", and bumped into his blog.  I should thank him.  Maybe I'll start expressing myself every day.  I thought about writing a journal every day, but usually I do that for a day or two and then skip a few months and admonish myself for having such a weak will.
