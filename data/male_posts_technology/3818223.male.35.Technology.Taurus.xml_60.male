One of two situations must apply - either the church ordered its parishioners to steal the books, in which case I can savor the irony, or they used their tithings to buy the freaking things, thus supporting the industry they attack.  Book burning is a good metaphor for religion - flame and noise and hatred and finger-pointing with no real impact on their appointed enemies.  Besides, they need their enemies.  Without them they'll have to point those fingers at themselves.  I think I'll dedicate my first novel to Satan in the hopes that many religions will want to burn it.  If any religious representatives want to place an early order,  urlLink e-mail  me and let me know.  I'll see that your church gets a good discount based on volume.
