It seems to me that there is more "hidden" things that you can pick up on when watching it over and over again.  So now i'm watching  urlLink MXC . i have to say that i'm impressed by the makes of the show with their translations as it is almost what they are actiually saying... it matches with what they are doing but then i  hope  that it's not actually what they are sayingin the  urlLink japanese version . It's amazing what they'll go though without being completely plastered :-)
