SO, herez my list:  Bill-do, my failure of a father want me to drop a G ($1000) to come to his mother's ash spreading.  He give me no details as to where I'm going (south Haven MI), no details on airports, doesn't know when the service is, and wont return my calls.....beatdown for him.    Some Neanderthal dick head at work pisses on the fucken toilet seat and doesn't mandle his mess.  Either: 1.  Piss in the fucken urinal 2.  Sit down and piss like a girl 3.  Clean up your fucken mess!    A bunch of work for a roll out I have this afternoon got deleted and I'm in scramble mode trying to get it back.  Feels like Monday on crack!     urlLink Super Greg  is a total tool.  So much so that it angers me!   More rants to come.  Have a happy Wednesday for me!
