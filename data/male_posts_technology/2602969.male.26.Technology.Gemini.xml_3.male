Why dont they send this information to the mobile phone and probally provide acess to this data using some API.  For j2me the answere is Location API ( I think )   I wonder if I could integrate MobiMap with the location based information if that is possible the user can use MobiMap and ask questions like 'Where am I right now?' and it can use location based API and MobiMap services to show the exact location of the mobile user.  I guess I will have to look at the JSP for Location API for j2me devices and if they (sun) have a reference implementation out use it to write the program. I know I will not be able to use the program using Location based API on my phone, but then too I would be something interesting to try.
