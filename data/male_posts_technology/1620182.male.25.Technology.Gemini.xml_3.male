 It's official.  The laptop is in the infirmery.  Let's all have a moment of silence for it.......Thank you for your attention.  You know, I was actually hoping that I'd somehow be able to weasle myself into a new laptop, but that's not looking so likely now.  The repair guy at work said he thought it was the mother board.  Honestly, people.   If you need to replace the mother board, shouldn't you just get a whole laptop along with it?  Especially when this one is about 1/1000 the power of the latest and greatest?  Whatever.   As long as it works.
 
 I finished Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets on the plane back from Vegas yesterday.  What a fantastic read.  I'm now 2/3 of the way through the next book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  I've quickly come to realize something about these books.  The whole reason I'm reading the first two (despite seeing the movies already) is because I was told by a friend that they wouldn't make sense out of order.  What a load of horse dung.  These books are totally written as episodes.  There were parts in the Prisoner of Azkaban where Rowling rehashes what happened in the first book (the scar, the Dursleys, Hogwarts, etc).  I somehow suspect that the same thing will happen in the fourth episode, the Goblet of Fire.
 
 For some, this type of repetition will get old very quickly.  I, on the other hand, don't really mind it at all.  Life is repetitious, and Rowlings does a good job of bringing points from the past up when the reader needs reminding.  
 
 What I find most shocking about the tale is how Harry Potter has not been herolded as the magical savior he is.  I mean, he's faced off and defeated Voldemort (the Wizard so terrible that nobody will say his name) three times before the age of thirteen.  He single handedly (well, mostly) protected the sorceror's stone, found the chamber of secrets, killed a giant snake, and lead his team to victories in Quidditch nearly every time he's on the field.  This kid is 13.  How is he not on the cover of every magazine?  The subject of every television special?  It's amazing.  The teachers at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry treat him as if he's another boy....simply amazing.
