           
      Welcome to a very late edition of Sailor Ecchi's RAW review (yeah, I guess I could call it that since I'm tiered now and have no creativity). Haven't been able to write this column till now cause I have been working on an article for a friend of mine that works as an editor for a local magazine. She asks me if I could write something up for her related to the topic of J-Horror. I've just finished and it reads very well. I'm actually excited about it, even thought I am not sure if it will be published in the magazine or in the magazine's website. Either way, it's still very cool. The article is in Spanish. I am planning on writhing an English version and publishing it in my blog in the following weeks. I will also keep you posted on the progress of that.   Okay, we had a PPV on Sunday. From what I hear, the Vengeance PPV was pretty cool. In fact, many people are raving about it. Let's take a quick look at it before we move onto RAW.  We start off the show with an unannounced match made on RAW's Heat. Rhyno and Tajiri defeated Coach and Garrison Cade... Okay, look, I know they were working Rhyno up to create a storyline for this PPV, but his program was with La Resistance. That all went to hell when it was announced that the team of Eugene and Ric Flair would be taking on La Resistance at Vengeance. So, the Rhyno looking for a partner to beat La Resistance went to shit. Which, btw, I never really understood why Rhyno would want Vengeance against La Resistance anyway. Still, it's very unfair of the WWE to build a feud and then replace it with another feud, and then return to it (sort of) at last minute. Heck, the Eugene and Ric Flair feud against La Resistance is really throwaway since the real purpose is to advance the Evolution - Eugene storyline. Also, to give the PPV a comedy act.  It's good to see Rhyno on a PPV. So is seeing Tajiri, who I thought was killed by Batista. Tajiri has history with the Coach and Cade. Heck, the WWE never finished their feud. I'm pretty sure they won't finnish it know, taking into account that they will probably move on to feud again with La Resistance, probably for SummerSlam. Could be interesting.  Anyway, Rhyno and Tajiri's appearance as a team and win here more or less seals the deal on the fact that La Resistance is winning to night.   This, I hear, was a good start the PPV. Short match, but good. Tajiri was the real highlight here. Then again, that shouldn't surprise you.   Next we have Batista defeating Chris Jericho via pin fall. What?!?!?! Nice way to build up Jericho, especially considering that it looks like he won't be moving on to a further feud with Batista. Yep, according to Monday's RAW, this feud is over and Batista won. Jericho lost to Batista. In fact, from what I hear, it was pretty clean. Yes, his foot was on the ropes and the referee didn't see it, but I also heard that Batista dominated the match. Sure, the WWE wants to build up Batista and, good for them, the dude is looking pretty good. But the WWE has to learn not to put over talent at the expense of good, hard working talent. I imagine Jericho wasn't to happy with this and, when Jericho isn't happy, he usually puts on a lack luster match. Proof of this? His match against Kain on Monday...  La RÃ©sistance defeated Eugene and Ric Flair via disqualification. I hear this match was funny and entertaining.  Nick Dinsmore has done wonders with this gimmick. He really plays the part well. Plus, he's actually been giving some good material. During the match, Eugene apes Ric Flair's move set (to Ric's displeasure), hits a Stone Cold Stunner, a Rock Bottom and a People's Elbow into a Ric Flair Strut... And the crowd goes wild !!! And why shouldn't they? Sounds pretty funny. Must have been cool live. Also, Ric's the man.  Anyway, referee disqualifies Eugene's team because Eugene got involved in a way he shouldn't have. And, La Resistance moves on the feud with the newly made team of Rhyno and Tajiri. Weeeeeeee !!!!!  Matt Hardy defeated Kane via pin fall. Matt Hardy wins? In a PPV? Against Kain? Holy shit !!! Everyone thought this was going to be the death of Hardy, especially since he had to leave for knee surgery. So, people where expecting not only that Kain win, but that the WWE would arrange the match in such a way to leave Matt looking like a bloody pulp so he would have an excuse to leave for the surgery. No such thing.   I hear the match was good, but people in the audience who knew about Matt injuries where confused and stunned. Still, this is good for Matt Hardy. This gives him a chance to leave a winner and return with a nice push waiting for him. I hope so. Matt deserves better.   I'm happy for this win, even thought he had assistance from Lita. After the match, Matt asks Lita to stay away from him. On Monday night RAW, Matt was absent, so I guess the story here is that Matt, feeling betrayed by Lita and having just gotten revenge on Kain (yes, pinning him is good Vengeance against the guy who fucked and impregnated your girlfriend), decides to travel the world and become a monk and never return to wrestling again, or something like that. The point is, Matt's not here anymore and that will give him time to fix his knees.  Edge defeated Randy Orton to win the Intercontinental Championship in what I hear was match of the night. Randy Orton is really doing his best to prove that he has what it takes to be in the top card in the WWE. I think he does too. This match with Edge proves it. Looks like the old Edge is back. Weeeeeeee !!!!!!  Edge wins, assuring a SummerSlam rematch for the title. If there is any indication, I hope they continue to improve themselves.  Next we have what I hear was a good women's match. A good women's match on PPV? No way !!! Victoria defeated Molly Holly via pin fall. This was another thrown together match. Still, it was a good thrown together match. Even Mr. Tito liked it, so it must be good! Good to see Victoria kicking ass and taking names.   Gee, shaving Molly's head really didn't amount to much, did it? Anyway, sounds like it was a better match that their PPV match.   Finally, Chris Benoit defeated Triple H to retain the Heavyweight Championship. Sounds like a wonderful match. People were a little sore that Eugene got involved and accidentally cost HHH the match. On the other hand, others comment that it help add more drama. Still, sounds like a good match.  All in all, this PPV sounded really solid, like last month's Bad Blood. This is very good for the WWE. This is the streak of quality PPV they need. I am most definitely buying this when it gets to DVD. Now, about the Smackdown PPV... sorry guys, it ain't happening. Maybe after Angle returns to wrestle... I will think about it.  This leads me to talk a little about SummerSlam. I'm pretty sure that Angle and Eddie Guerrero will have a match together, making this a hot WWXX rematch (which I believe will be a whole lot better). JBL (A.K.A. Brashaw) will probably take on Undertaker... *sigh*  On the RAW side, I'm looking forward to a Chris Benoit and HHH rematch, even thought I have a feeling that the match that will take place will be a three way match between HHH, Eugene and Benoit. Anyway, Edge VS Orton is pretty much locked in.   I would also love to see Ric Flair VS William Regal. Yeah, I know. I'm weird. I really think these old guys will click in the ring. We might be also seeing a Kain VS Jericho match and a Trish VS Victoria match. Oh, and La Resistance VS. Rhyno and Tajiri. Not bad actually. Sounds like the RAW side has more structure and interesting matches possibility than the Smackdown side. All I know is that no matter what happens on the Smackdown side, they better have RVD and Rey Mysterio on the card.   Anyway, on to RAW...   The show starts up with a slight teaser that there will be a confrontation between Eugene and Evolution. HHH says he will get Eugene and that the rest of Evolution should follow his lead, but when a frighten Eugene appears to apologies to HHH, The Game responds in a sweet manner. HHH says it's okay and that he doesn't bare a grudge and that Eugene made an honest mistake. This obviously shocks the rest of Evolution who wonder if their leader has gone bonkers. Of course, HHH has something planed for the boy, soooooooooooooooooo... on with the show.  Show starts with one hell of a match between Edge, the newly crowd Intercontinental Champion, and Batista. Edge wins what can only be described as a battle. Both looked really good. Batista has been impressing me for a while now. Tonight was proof that this guy is ready for the big leagues. Randy Orton, look out !!! You could find yourself being demoted soon.   Speaking of Randy, Orton gets involved only to be thrown out by the Referee, a move that got a very positive reaction from the crowd. The match moves on, back and forth with some near pins. Finally, Edge wins, but he has to cheat to win. Interesting. Edge had to grab on to Batista's tights to win. Good stuff. Actually made Batista look like a monster. This is a good think. I really liked this match. Excellent way to start the show.    Next, Rhyno (with Tajiri) def. Robert Conway (with Sylvain Grenier). Not a bad match. Just too short. The crowd seems to like the pairing of Rhyno and Tajiri. I'm liking this very much.  I think around this time, maybe before this match, Eugene comes to see Uncle Eric and a match is booked for the main event tonight... Eugene VS. Benoit for the gold !!! Damn, this could be a good thing or a bad thing. It has Evolution intervention written all over it.   Many people wonder if it's a good idea to overexpose the Eugene character like the WWE is doing. I'm not sure if it's bringing any new fans. Since its a comedy item in the show, it's probably bringing in a lot of children and families to the show. How ironic, no? Still, that good fortune is about to end tonight. More on that later...  Tyson Tomko (with Trish Stratus) def. Maven (with Nidia) in a crappy match. Two too green wrestlers fighting it out. To RAW's Heat with both of you!  Jericho has a Highlight reel segment with Lita and Kain as guests. Boy, was this smart. Kain is burned by Lita's comments. He proceeds to tear apart Jericho's set. Funny how Jericho places himself in harms way to protect his expensive television monitor. Jericho would later challenge Kain to a match. The match is pretty lame. It's like Jericho isn't in it. Kain hits Jericho in the nuts and we have a DQ. Yes, Kain is such a monster...  Only good part of the match is when he choke slams both Jericho and the referee. This woke up the audience. I think they actually cheered !!! Hahaha Nothing like having a referee get it to receive a cool pop from the audience.   We also have Ric Flair defeat The Hurricane in an ok match that was made because Hurricane reminded Ric that his book wasn't selling as hot as Rock's or Foley's books. Funny stuff. Ric is still THE MAN! On the other hand, Hurricane needs to start finding a new agent.  Finally, the main event and out plops happy Eugene, waving at the crowd who seem to enjoy him being there. Benoit comes out and it's back to busyness.  The match was interesting. Actually, pretty exiting given that both these guys know how to excite. Heck, there was a moment where I actually saw people standing up to watch the match. I am shocked at how people are reacting to Eugene's character. Eugene uses one of Benoit's moves, the cross face, and the crowd goes wild. Heck, when Eugene gives Benoit a Rock Bottom, the crowd gasps and cheers. It was a near three count, but Eugene thinks he's one and starts celebrating, when Evolution comes down to wreck the party. Yep, you guessed it...  EVOLUTION Beat down!!!!!  Yes, and everything officially goes back to shit. The spell is broken. The old HHH is back. A beatdown can only signal one thing... the end of Eugene's push and a one way ticket to the mid card. Don't believe me? Who has had the honor or receiving a full blast Evolution beat down? RVD... Booker T ... Scott Steiner... Yep, done wonders for everyone there.   The problem is a little more serious... Eugene was actually a character that people were clicking with. Heck, after this bloody beat down, that clearly left the audience numb, you will probably be seeing a drop in the ratings due to parents pulling their crying kids away from TV. Yes, Eugene is a character children relate too. Now, Eugene is a bloody mess. Goodnight, children.  And the WWE wonders why parents no longer buy the WWE toys for their children.  A good program ends in a sour note. Still, I will give it a B- because Edge VS Batista was really special. Other matches where okay and the segments where good, but the ending isn't new. In fact, it's the same ending they used to use a year ago to finish every RAW: Evolution Beat Down.  Of course, we all remember how well RAW was doing last year...  Well, hope next Monday's show is better. Well, back to work. Again, sorry for the delay in the review. See ya all next Tuesday.    urlLink Sailor Ecchi
