So I picked up Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (KoToR) and Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance for the Xbox the other day. Both games are excellent. I especially like KoToR because its a Star Wars RPG based on the Dungeons and Dragons 3rd edition ruleset. Pretty cool if you ask me.  I haven't found a beef with Baldur's Gate yet, but I do have a few minor ones for KoToR..  1) Alien's talk far longer than needed. You have the english subtitle at the bottom and I guarantee you'll be done reading it far far far before the alien stops yammering on his in language.  Luckily you can hit the A button to go to the next thing he says before he's finished. 2) Jaggies. They can be quite bad in some places, but they're forgiveable because of the next point coming up and because the game is just too good to let jaggies be the end all and be all. 3) Framerate drops. Every so often, the framerate drops and things get a little jerky. Its not really bad where its unplayable, but it drops just enough to be noticeable. Likely they didnt implement FSAA to kill the jaggies because the framerate drop would be horrendous then.  Like I said, these are minor gripes. The game far makes up for it in almost every other aspect so far.
