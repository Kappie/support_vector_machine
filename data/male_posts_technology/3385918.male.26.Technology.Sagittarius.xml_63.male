Dear Employees:   It has been brought to management's attention that some individuals throughout the company have been using foul language during the course of normal conversation with their co-workers. Due to complaints received from some employees who may be easily offended, this type of language will be no longer be tolerated. We do however, realize the critical importance of being able to accurately express your feelings when communicating with co-workers. Therefore, a list of "TRY SAYING" new phrases has been provided so that proper exchange of ideas and information can continue in an effective manner.  1) TRY SAYING: I think you could use more training. INSTEAD OF: You don't know what the fuck you're doing.  2) TRY SAYING: She's an aggressive go-getter.  INSTEAD OF: She's a ball-busting bitch.   3) TRY SAYING: Perhaps I can work late.  INSTEAD OF: And when the fuck do you expect me to do this?   4) TRY SAYING: I'm certain that isn't feasible. INSTEAD OF: No fucking way.   5) TRY SAYING: Really?
