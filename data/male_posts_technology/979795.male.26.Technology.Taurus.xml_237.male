Think that's a good thing, coz it could mean that she's not unhappy about the last incident anymore. That's good. And I do have a slight ease of mind now. But like Eileen mentioned, I don't dwell on it too much. Afterall I've already gotten over the occasion by opening my house's door to her anytime she may want to makan here. We (I was with Justin and Daniel) were doing our warmup jog up a slope from our place to the park nearby when we met the both of them coming down to our place. Couldn't chat much then. But everything seemed ok. Even after dinner things seemed pretty alright. Just that they left kinda early after dinner instead of hanging around.  Went running today again. It's turning out to be a guys thing in my house. All 4 of us went for a run at the park. David, being his 1st run, had a bit of a hard time. But I can tell that he has quite a bit of power still in his legs. I think if he ran a few more times, I'll easily be the slowest runner in the house. I guess that's the difference between Officers in the SAF and normal foot soldiers like me. OCS training is something to be reckon with. Which kind of makes me wonder. At 25 years old when I graduate, will I be able to take the training in the Police Force. Hmmm ... well, guess there's no point pondering over it too much. Just keep training and bring my fitness level up first.  After the run, I was feeling fine but Justin and Daniel had a slight headache. After dinner, I feel a slight groggy feeling. Could be a fever or something going around the house now. Think I'll pop either 2 panadol or 2 raw eggs in again. Need to keep my health up the next few days. I need the extra energy to complete my final report before Mon.  Now that David's decided to join us for a bit of running. I think after Annie (housemate) gets back from Spain with Juliana (housemate), and we're back into playing frisbee again, I'll see if David wants to do a few forward rolls while we're at the park. I can do it in my backyard lah of course, but I think the daily bokken exercises I've been doing has worn away the ground quite a fair bit and it looks a bit too dirty now. Whereas at the park, all we need to do is pick a small corner and we can roll around on the grass. Err ... only thing I think we need to look out for will be dog shit. It's a park afterall :P I'm kinda keen on training my forward rolls with some obstacle in front. Might need the other guys' help to curl up in front and let me jump over. And I'd love to try jumping over the 2 taller guys and train my rolls into getting some distance and height in as well. Well, the girls are due back tommorrow anyway so I guess I can look forward to my rolling exercises soon.  O yea, talking about this, just few days ago Justin and I were running and we saw this guy standing in the park practicing some kind of self defence moves or something. Err ... OK lah, not trying to like put down the guy's efforts or anything but to do some things too openly in public is kind of weird. And I think he does look like those half half pattern who hasn't exactly been learning much for a long time. I mean, whether I'm in Singapore or UK, I only practice my Aikido in a private compound. Sure lah, the neighbours may see me, but I usually pick the weirdest hours so as to minimise the no. of people who might see me. I mean, I'm not that good anyway so I would really hate to expose myself more than I really needed to. Only my housemates and family are like the only ones who see me practice regularly, but they know me enought to be able to tell that I'm being serious and just wanted to be alone when I'm concentrating during those times.
