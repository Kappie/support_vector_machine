When I'm at work I can feel my brain being destroyed by the mindlessness of it all. I can't wait till school starts again I'm looking forward to this next semester. In other news everything is going pretty good I haven't been maimed in a horrible farm combine accident, which is a good thing. I'm currently trying to plan something cool to do for me and susan's 1st cycle. Any ideas would be much appreciated.
