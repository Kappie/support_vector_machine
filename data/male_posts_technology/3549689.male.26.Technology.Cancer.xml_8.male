It's at GoStats.com. It provides statistics, and is free. (What else do I need?)  I've set it up on my  urlLink other blog , since there doesn't seem to be any support for using the same counter at two blogs, and keeping the counts separate. And I really don't want to sign up for two accounts with GoStats and then try to remember two usernames and passwords.  I got a counter face that fit in quite comfortably in my site, though, so that's a good thing. I wish Blogger gave stats.   Question of the week: So what's so techy about this post?
