The first table I was at I took $20 and made it $50. I did the same on the second table. Or something like that. So now I am up to $582. Going to cash out $50 as a gift once I get to $600. I hear there is a cash out curse, but people have to do it sometime! The second table I was on I did nothing that required skill. I just got AEWSOME cards. Here is a sample:  ***** Hand History for Game 750198883 ***** 1/2 TexasHTGameTable (Limit)  - Tue Jul 13 22:09:33 EDT 2004 Table Table  10839 (6 max) (Real Money) -- Seat 3 is the button Total number of players : 6 Seat 1: Flag2 ( $24.50) Seat 2: SirFWALGMan ( $16) Seat 3: Tghtgrl ( $49.50) Seat 4: hoefertg ( $28.75) Seat 5: Sodomizer ( $48.25) Seat 6: thaiwin ( $28.50) hoefertg  posts small blind (0.50) Sodomizer  posts big blind (1) ** Dealing down cards ** Dealt to SirFWALGMan [ Jc, Tc ]  thaiwin calls (1) Flag2 calls (1) SirFWALGMan calls (1) Tghtgrl folds. hoefertg calls (0.50) Sodomizer checks. ** Dealing Flop ** :  [ Td, 4s, 5h ]  hoefertg checks.

Flag2 calls (2) ** Summary ** Main Pot: $15.25 | Rake: $0.75 Board: [ Td 4s 5h Kc Jh  ] Flag2 balance $18.50, lost $6 [ Ac Ks ] [ a pair of kings -- Ac,Ks,Kc,Jh,Td ] SirFWALGMan balance $25.25, bet $6, collected $15.25, net +$9.25 [ Jc Tc ] [ two pairs, jacks and tens -- Kc,Jc,Jh,Tc,Td ] Tghtgrl balance $49.50, didn't bet (folded) hoefertg balance $27.75, lost $1 (folded)  Sodomizer balance $46.25, lost $2 (folded)  thaiwin balance $27.50, lost $1 (folded)   ============================================= Not sure if I could have done some check/raise  stuff at the end to get a bigger pot. I think  I played this with the correct aggression level  in betting once I got the 2 pairs. =============================================  ***** Hand History for Game 750201656 ***** 1/2 TexasHTGameTable (Limit)  - Tue Jul 13 22:10:27 EDT 2004 Table Table  10839 (6 max) (Real Money) -- Seat 4 is the button Total number of players : 6 Seat 1: Flag2 ( $18.50) Seat 2: SirFWALGMan ( $25.25) Seat 3: Tghtgrl ( $49.50) Seat 4: hoefertg ( $27.75) Seat 5: Sodomizer ( $46.25) Seat 6: thaiwin ( $27.50) Sodomizer  posts small blind (0.50) thaiwin  posts big blind (1) ** Dealing down cards ** Dealt to SirFWALGMan [ As, 2s ]  Flag2 folds.

One thing I did not like -- I checked  at the end. I probably should have raised. I could have been  up against the high side of the straight. This kind of hand  scares me a little, so I just bet 1 unit, and call and bets.  Probably need to play these stronger. ===========================================================  ***** Hand History for Game 750208160 ***** 1/2 TexasHTGameTable (Limit)  - Tue Jul 13 22:12:34 EDT 2004 Table Table  10839 (6 max) (Real Money) -- Seat 1 is the button Total number of players : 6 Seat 1: Flag2 ( $20.50) Seat 2: SirFWALGMan ( $33) Seat 3: Tghtgrl ( $55) Seat 4: hoefertg ( $18.75) Seat 5: Sodomizer ( $44.75) Seat 6: thaiwin ( $21.50) SirFWALGMan  posts small blind (0.50) Tghtgrl  posts big blind (1) ** Dealing down cards ** Dealt to SirFWALGMan [ 3d, 6h ]  hoefertg calls (1) Sodomizer folds. thaiwin calls (1) Flag2 calls (1) SirFWALGMan calls (0.50) Tghtgrl checks. ** Dealing Flop ** :  [ 4h, 6s, 3h ]  SirFWALGMan bets (1) Tghtgrl calls (1) hoefertg folds. thaiwin folds.
