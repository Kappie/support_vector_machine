I mean, if you only count the weekend days, (sat.  sun) you get 48 hours, of which I spent more than half in a building at MS.  Anyway, it was nice to have Jebe and Kelley in the house again. Also got to see Dejah and Amorah this week. So that was nice.  what else...  Saw Time machine on friday night. Not a bad movie, could have had more of a more completeness. It left you wanting at least another 30 minutes or something.   Worked till midnight last night, worked till 9 tonight. Last day off was February 24th. Hmm.. how time flies...  Thanks for being in my life- T
