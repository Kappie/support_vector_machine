Where I step in halfway of the lesson as in really break time then step in. My trying to be funny class mate tell me that lesson already ended which i find it hard to believe. And of course not so stupid to believe. It kinda getting on my nerves, working had really put me off from my studies and I think i am lacking back. By hook or by crook I gotta get my proposal done this week.   Life has been so good so far, I have just burn two track into my mp3 collection CD in my car. One is from Amelia's website that Hikaru Utada Track is so nice and solid, not forgetting I am a fan of her. Another is what you are hearing now, "Just the way you are" by Diana Krall.   But suddenly feel so alone while hearing that Hikki's song, very terribly lonely feeling. Listen while driving my car to lessons. have not been touching my car for almost three days. After driving my comany vehicle I learn how to appreciate my car more than ever before.   Okay lecturer is in for lessons, my idiotic classmate trying to be idiotic telling me idiotic lies has not succeed.
