He decided that "stoplights are stupid and pointless." It's common sense, he said, that someone should stop their car if they saw another car coming towards them. So, we made up the "Stupidity System". All other laws would be abolished but that one. There are 3 levels of this law.  I. Stupidity - I.E. Driving down the road, and cutting someone off. This would get a fine. Not punishable by death, but they could get a good spanking. II. Dumbassidity - I.E. Talking on a cell phone while driving. This would be a felony, and depending on the call, you could be sent to jail or a huge fine.  (Or, if they're being a JACKASS, then you can shoot them.) III. Idiocy - For those idiots out there, that brush their hair, eat breakfast, and talk on their cellphone, we dont do anything to them. We figure that they'll just kill themselves because they're that fucking dumb.  Only people that my dad and i have decided that are not stupid and at least semi-intelligent will be allowed to become stupidity officers. They would get free food wherever they went. And people would be required to throw money at them. Also, they all had the right to carry as much arms and munition as they wanted. And they had a "license to kill". They could kill anyone that they wanted as long as they were being a jackass. In any manner that the officer sees fit. Except for higher officers. That would be punishable by being abandoned on a tropical island in the carribbean. With no water/food.  [Work calls]
