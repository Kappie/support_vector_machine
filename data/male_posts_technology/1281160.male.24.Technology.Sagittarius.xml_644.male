I came to chennai sunday afternoon itself..'coz I forgot to book the return ticket and in last moment I didn't get any tickets in bus or train.So I preferred Day journey. It was too boring on sunday evening..I was alone in home. Then just started with all the housekeeping work pending. My roomi came in the evening..Then we went out for shopping..had dinner outside.          Valli..How is your job going? I didn't see any blogs about your experience..I might have missed that also..I am not sure.           Expecting all your blogs soon...
