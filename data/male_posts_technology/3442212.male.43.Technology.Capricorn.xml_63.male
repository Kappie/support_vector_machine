It's tech and dress rehearsal week at  urlLink Footloose , which means long nights, incoherent days, not enough sleep (though I reset the alarm to 7:00 from its usual 5:30[1]), and bad food. Thus very little web updating, no music editing or practice other than for the show, and I have exactly 1.5 brain cells left.   Ahh, show biz.  But the show is going well and once we open, my schedule will go from insane to merely overloaded.  I can hardly wait.    [1]: Not that I get up at 5:30 - the clock radio turns on and  Bob Edwards  Renee and Steve fill me with the day's news for an hour while I try to sleep. Then the radio shuts off, I realize I'm late and leap out of bed.
