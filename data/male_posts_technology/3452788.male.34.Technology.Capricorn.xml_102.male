The weird part is that his head is severed and replaced with the severed head of a donkey. Meanwhile, the donkey with Elway's head is recovered from the bathroom near the sports book at the New Frontier. The donkey is just fine, and was chacking out the horse racing on the TV wall. Of course, police recognised Elway's body in the hotel room immediately, because of the facial resemblance to a donkey, and it took several hours before anyone realized the head in the hotel room actually belonged to the donkey downstairs, who by now is in a room with a couple of prostitutes, saying "I'm a Stallion!" over and over. Anyway, it turns out the crime was committed by a crazed Raiders fan, who is sitting in Gilley's watching midnight bikini bull riding.    BTW, I'm hope Elway's arena football team gets their ASSES beat by Bon Jovi's AFL team.  Bon Jovi is cool.
