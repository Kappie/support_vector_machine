English people in general. English rain. English chips! English shower. English home. English road. English left side driving on the English road. etc.....  I've decided from my Barcelona trip that I dislike the French, and France. Quite a lot. So its not good really when I am going on next years art trip (most likely, ie: Phillips said: of course you can come, you can do what you like) (woo!!!!) to the South Of France. Gah.   What is everyone up to this weekend? I'm working 9.30 - 6.00 today and 10.00 - 2.00 tomorrow even though we are shut. Lol.   Have a good day.
