Bus starts 1 hour late (every time it used to be 30 mins) and Bus gets some unique problem where it rocks all the passenger back and forth around ten times when you change gears before acclerating.. and atlast to make the matters worse Drum Brake fails and we had to risk our life for 2 hours travelling in a bus without brakes and consequences : Night out, 3 hours late  KSRTC is improving day by day it's new rajahamsa buses are pretty cool..
