We were talking on the way to work today (my room wasn't clean last night, so he won't let me drive myself anywhere) about his relationship with mom and whether or not he's being loving.  It's so frustrating trying to reason with him. As most of you know, He's from a Moslem background (having been born in Iran and all...) and the way his culture has taught him to think from birth is much different than most of us. We all use "linear reasoning" meaning that when we see a problem, we actively work our way logically to a solution. Example: If we are being kept awake at night by a faucet dripping, we all eventually have to come to the conclusion that the faucet is at fault. Once we have done this, we actively work toward a solution: getting up and turning the faucet all the way off. The way my dad thinks though, is something called “circular reasoning” where you see a problem and instead of working toward a solution you keep turning around and focusing on the problem. Example: Again we have ourselves almost asleep, but being kept awake by a dripping faucet. Instead of thinking about why the faucet’s dripping though, we start obsessing about the problem (the faucet’s dripping, the faucet’s dripping, the faucet’s dripping, THE FAUCET’S DRIPPING!!!). As you can see the former way of thinking is more logical, but once someone’s been ingrained with the latter, it’s very hard to convince them that they are going about it wrong, Imagine if you will that there is not one person, but two people within hearing of the faucet, one equipped with linear reasoning and one with circular, and that the one with linear (whom we will call person A) cannot reach the faucet.   Person B: The faucet’s dripping. Person A: I can hear the faucet’s dripping. Person B: The faucet’s dripping.  Person A: Yes, we’ve established that the faucet’s dripping, why don’t you just go take care of it? Person B: Because the faucet’s dripping. Person A: What? How does the faucet’s dripping keep you from fixing the faucet’s dripping? Person B: Because the faucet’s dripping. Person A: WHAT?? What’s wrong with you? Person B: Nothing. Person A: THEN GO FIX THE FAUCET!! Person B: But, the faucet’s dripping.  This is pretty much how I feel when talking to my dad. He listens to what you say, but he doesn’t  listen  to what you say. Actually, it’s more like he can’t comprehend what you’re saying.   Anyway, specifically we were talking about what he would do if she got kicked out of (or rather stopped attending because there’s no way she feels comfortable there, and what good is a church if it’s not a place of refuge?) the church that they are both going to. He said that there’s no way he would leave I really honed in on that the entire drive to work. He seems convinced that the husband is called to be a hedge of protection around the family only when everyone’s obeying him to the letter. (By hedge of protection, which is a biblical term, I mean guarding us all from people or things that might oppress us or bring us down – like the stupid people in my mom’s (now former) church. A small portion of our conversation went something like this:  Me: So you’re saying you would stay at Southwest Hills if mom left or was kicked out? Him: Yes Me: Why? Him: Why not? Me: Well, think about it this way: you’re always talking about unity and wanting to be one with you wife… well what do you think it’ll do to her, knowing that you still continue going to a church where everyone looks down on her? Him: That is my church. Me: Yes, but your church as a whole seems to be at odds with mom.  …silence… Me: What are husbands supposed to do for their wives? Him: Love them and provide for them and… Me: Whoa, wait a second; the first thing you said is love right? Him: yes Me: how are you displaying you love for her right now? Him: I love her. Me: That’s not what I asked, I asked how you’re displaying it. Him: What do you mean? Me: Well, you’re supposed to be a protection against things like this that are going on, but instead do you realize what you’ve become? - The very thing that God designed a husband to protect his wife against! Him: Well, she’s the one that’s leaving Me: What? And that somehow negates the husband’s responsibility to be a shield? You’re to love and protect you family, especially your wife, unconditionally: not just when you think she’s deserving of it. Him: But she has left me shield when she disobeyed me. Me: You just don’t get it do you? She can’t “leave”; it’s ALWAYS supposed to be there. Him: Not if she leaves it...  (This went on like this pretty much all the way to work.)  Maybe now you can kinda see the relation to the faucet example in his way of thinking.
