I already know most of what's going on in there, but there are some commands I don't really understand. So, it's off to  urlLink w3schools.com  and  urlLink htmlgoodies.com  for now. If anyone knows any good sites, I'd love to check them out.  Update:  I'm enjoying learning about CSS. It's a handy time saver for people with extensive web pages. I'm running into some discrepencies between the syntax I'm learning and the syntax used in this template. For example, where w3schools tells me to use this syntax:  p.post { , the template uses this:  .post p { . Other than that, everything's been coming along pretty smoothly. I'm going to continue to use this template and it's associated artwork for now, and just change minor things to taste until I can put together a nice looking original.
