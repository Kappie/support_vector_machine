 This is good news. I was a subscriber to  urlLink PressPlay , but it seemed they never had the artist I was looking for at the time. This will hopefully solve some of my issues I had with the service. "Stealing" music was becoming too much of a hassle for me. I just want to get to the music I like, and I am willing to pay for it at a resonable cost for a reliable service that is  easy to use . I'm just not sure if I like the " urlLink portable downloads " idea. They only allow you to burn them twice, and the files you download are tied to your hard drive not to you, so if you get a new machine you better keep the hard drive.
