Then along some Friday and I can't do anything at school because I'm so busy trying not to be sick. So I get sent up but my form tytor. I come back at lunch thinking well I've had 3 hours kip so I shuld be okish now. I didn't make it to English. I sat in the common room trying not to be sick. I forced myself to textiles as I have a deadline next Friday and cannot afford to miss the lesson. Saturday. Didn't make it to work. Didn't do any work. Stayed in bed. Along comes Sunday. Made it to work for 2 hours then get sent home. Can't go to the cinema either, too ill.  Today I wake up thinking yea I feel better. Eat my breakfast. Bad move. I nearly throw up this time. Don't make it to school. I'm about to go to texiles in a moment simply because I have to do this work. I can't afford not to do it so matter how bad I feel. What really annoys me is the fact that I still haven't been sick! I wish I would be sick because then I'd feel soooo much better. Apparently there is a bug going around work anyway so hey, I'm definatly not making this up. The other annoying thing is on Sunday I could've Paul twice. But I didn't because I'm ill. Could've seen Paul for most of today. Can't. I'm ill. I hate being ill. Although it is rather nice when mum makes me soup and buys me jelly and things that are easy on the stomach. She even cut the crusts of my sandwiches. Marvellous.
