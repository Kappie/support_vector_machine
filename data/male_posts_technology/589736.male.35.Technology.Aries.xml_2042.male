As to the press conference, it is the press asking the questions, not either of the two leading candidates.  It is one of the roles of the press to reveal that those in power have feet of clay.  That said, it is also one of the roles of a police force to protect its citizens.  Some police officers reach beyond the originally-intended boundaries, pursuing that end proactively rather than reactively, through violence, profiling, or similiar strategies.  Such acts do not represent a flaw in the role; only in its interpretation and execution.  Likewise, the press occasionally (some would argue frequently) reaches beyond the originally-intended boundaries, in the interpretation and execution of its role.  In both cases, the flaw lies in an unrelated entity that has grafted itself onto, or even assimilated itself into, the original whole:  for the former, that foreign presence might be racism or ideology; for the latter, I would argue that the unwelcome intruder is advertising revenue, of which there is a finite amount, and which is determined by a publisher's ability to make the audience feel equally happy, sad, and superior.  This is not to say that the press is absolved of responsibility; I only add it as a probable explanation.  I don't think that in this situation the press is revealing a flaw in its calling, which I fully support.  Nor do I think that the press is revealing any particular ideological preference.  I think it smells a potentional story, and in its eagerness to get that story placed between lucrative advertising spots that require the largest possible audience, it displays not so much a mindless hunger, but rather an embarassing clumsiness in how it goes about its business.  Case in point:  It displays neither skill nor intelligence to grill someone at a press conference.  This isn't sharp and cunning journalism; it's grandstanding at best, simple rudeness at worst.  Take the potential lead and go snooping around the back doors.  Set out the honey and wait for the flies.  Watching the press conference live on cable yesterday, I was struck only by the mutual train wreck:  journalists behaving like a pack of dogs, and a poor government functionary who made a wrong choice a long time ago and now believes in the empty role he performs.  I still long for clever heroes and cunning villains who deserve respectful cheers and boos.  I am no longer interested in thugs and bullies, no matter what color hat they may wear.
