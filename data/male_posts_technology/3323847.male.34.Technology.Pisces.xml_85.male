It comes as no surprise to me that the "paid" access at Starbucks and McDonalds (among others) isn't really working.  I wouldn't want to pay for internet access at a place I don't plan on staying around for much time...  I think Panera bread has it right.  WiFi can act as a pretty good lure, especially if you're a business that caters to business-level people.
