Very strong, with high carrying capacity. S ilitary surplus too, so looks kind of funky. Comes with big wheel option. 6 wheel drive for extraZombie crushing power.   I looked at construction trucks, but they will all be too wide and thus might impede escape. even this truck will be pushing it, but since keeping off the pavements won't be an issue should be fine.   Initial modifications:   Habitation and defence module constructed on the back. Make the floor fairly high (about the level of the bottom of the cab's windows) to keep people out of the way. The space below can be used in many ways (storage, weapons etc.). 20ft by 9.5ft space. Build it 8ft high as it ain't going into any multistoreies anyway and 2 ft above everyones head will give a feeling of space. Could make the cab part of it, but would this be dangerous in an attack? If it becomes a factor, have we already lost? An integrated solution would give better morale.    -------------------- --- LBBBBBBGGGGGGSTTTTT B = Beds, 6ftx2.5 , 2 stacks of 3  S DD WWWWW DDSSSSS T = Table 5ftx2.5  S DD WWWWW DD  C = Cooking facilities, 1.5ftx4ft   --- LBBBBBBGGGGGGGGCCCC S = Seats, 6 + 2 in cab   --------------------W = Skylight, armoured glass 5ftx4ft (sliding steel shutter too)  G=Storage cupboards, 3ft high (most storage below the floor)  L=Ladders for beds  D=Trapdoors to underfloor storage.        Fully armour the cab and habitation. Lots of armour can be used, since the total weight carried will never exceed the rating of the truck. Suggest 10mm steel plating. Could use up to 100 metre square sheets of this easily! Can be doubled up in importance places. Attachments to the chassis and wheel hubs (partially protecting the tyres) should be considered, though ground clearance and maneuverability are a priority. The armour will also need holes for various shafted weapons. These can be used to attack the zombies, but also to fend and push them off. they should have detachable shafts, so the business ends of the weapons remain on the outside of the truck at all times.
