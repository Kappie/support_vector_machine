It was completely programmable for all the devices on my home theatre:   - My Sony Surround Sound Reciever  - My Sony TiVo  - My Phillips DVD-Recorder  - My Sony iO Cable Box  plus it has the capability of reassigning keys between different devices, so while set for TiVo, I can control the power to the surround sound reciever as well as the volume controls (Even better than I could on the real TiVo remote)  I also have the capability to add any 2 additional devices (TV and VCR). The buttons can be cross programmed as well, so the TV button can actually work any type of device (PVR, DVD, VCR, AUD, CBL, etc..)  Not bad for $20!
