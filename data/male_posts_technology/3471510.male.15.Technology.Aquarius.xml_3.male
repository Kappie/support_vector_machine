I ran out side. As I got closer the heat increased, I was sweating loads. I as I pulled the man out from under the car he made some sort of groaning noise. I told said in a clam voice “ It will be all right mate” and he groaned again. I dragged him away from the heat and laid in front of my door. I stood up and looked at him closely. I noticed many bleeding bite marks. I decided to go inside and get him some bandages. As I was returning I herd more groaning so I rushed to the door. As I open the door he was standing there looking at me, with his mouth open. I said while thinking “When did you get a burst of strength”.  He didn’t reply he just looked at me. Then all of a sudden he launched at me, not with his fist with his whole body. He went for neck trying to bite me. I pushed him off. He we went back but started to walk towards. I started to walk backwards. As walked I looked at him, he looked almost dead. He was pale and he walk with a strange limp. I was thinking that he was a zombie but I didn’t want to expect it. I had now came a good distance away from him but I was backed up against a wall. He looked at me and from nowhere he started to run. I was quick to react to not quick enough. He was on my tail. I ran into the garden, as I ran I saw my shed. I ran in a locked the door after me. I sat at the back of the shed scared out of my skin. I through the only way to get out is to retaliate. With this through in mind to look for a weapon. Then as searched I saw it laying on a self. A weapon that was my best hope. It was my petrol chainsaw. I looked at the fuel gage I was fuel. He or it was still banging on the door. With this my rage grew. I start the chainsaw and gave it a couple of revs. This my rage I opened the door. He burst in. He lifted his arms to gain a bite but stuck the chainsaw straight into his stomach. Blood spurted everywhere, but this didn’t stop him so I gave him a body slice from shoulder to leg. This sliced threw him like a knife to hot butter. Blood was now everywhere including on me. I walked out with a smile on my face, but that b****** wasn’t dead, he grabbed my leg and tried to take a chunk out. Before he could do this though I sliced with a clean cut. I said knowing he was dead “my first blood”.
