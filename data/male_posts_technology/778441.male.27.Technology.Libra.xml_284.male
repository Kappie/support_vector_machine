But when the engineer in the Hydraulic Department of BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Anand Deodhar, was asked " urlLink Why are there dead fish in Powai lake? ", the answer he gave was imaginative to say the least!  If you thought the fish in Powai lake were choking to death because of pollutants, think again. Apparently, they’re all committing a unique kind of suicide: by diving out of the water like dolphins and dashing their heads on rocks.  Sounds far-fetched? Not to the hydraulic department of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) that cited this reason, along with others, for the dying fish.  Trust the brains in BMC to come up with such "ground-breaking research"!!
