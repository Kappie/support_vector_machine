I don't know when the first time I saw it was 6 or 7, but back then the idea of costumed gangs threatening to take over New York City was mind blowing.  After watching it again after all these years the costumed gangs are really silly but fun especially the  urlLink Baseball Furies , who all wear full baseball uniforms and carry baseball bats.  But underneath all the silliness are some cool action scenes and  a great Odyssesy-like story of the Warriors journey from the Bronx back home to Coney Island.  "Can you dig it?"  Hell yeah, I can dig it!  I also watched   urlLink Bus 174  .  What a harrowing and powerful film!  If you liked  urlLink  City of God  , I highly recommend this documentary.  America has plenty of problems but at least we aren't Brazil, which is simultaneously a first and third world country all rolled into one.
