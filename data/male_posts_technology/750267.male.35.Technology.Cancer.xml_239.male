The [U.N.] General Assembly passed a resolution in October calling on Israel to halt construction of the barrier and dismantle the completed section.   Israel has ignored the resolution.   When Iraq was in violation of several United Nations resoltions, the United States acted swiftly to force Iraq, one way or another, into compliance. Ultimately, the U.S. claims it invaded Iraq due to this non-compliance. So the question is this: where is the United States now? Israel is in violation of many U.N. resolutions (just like Iraq), and the resolution calling for the dismantling of the wall is just the latest example. Why isn't the U.S. using its influence on Israel now? Surely it should have more success getting Israel to comply than it did with Iraq, right?
