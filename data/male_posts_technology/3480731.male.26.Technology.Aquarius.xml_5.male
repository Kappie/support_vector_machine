Some of you might have heard I was in a car accident on Wednesday. It wasn't too serious, but it's the first one I've been in since I started driving a little over two years ago. I was a bit shaken up, but the damage is minimal. It shook my confidence in my driving ability for a few days, but I'm pretty much better now (taking the Edens Expressway from Glenview into downtown then the Stevenson out to Midway will help the confidence level).   The hoot of the whole thing was that where the accident happened wasn't even a place I would normally be. I was coming back from jury duty in Rolling Meadows (I live in Forest Park, about 35 minutes away in good traffic), which I discover most people seem to get out of somehow. So, thanks to the Circuit Court of Cook County for this. Maybe I should send them a bill? ;)  Like I said, I'll get a Bad Blood review up tomorrow along with  urlLink WWE Raw  if I can. I'll also work on a SmackDown taping review since I'll be going to it at the  urlLink Allstate Arena  here in Chicago on Tuesday. I'll mark it accordingly so you can avoid it if you don't care for WWE or spoilers.  Need...Sleep. Night.
