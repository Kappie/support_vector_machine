For example if a person is an extrovert he may be suitable for marketing etc. so for identifying that the workshop would be helpful and most important is with a professor like Mr Raja Govindaswamy.  I will suggest the following tips for persons who wish to get into marketing.   First choose a city where u think  there r more oppurtunities for marketing . for eg chennai, bangalore etc.  U should know the local language of that particular city like tamil or kannada.this is a must because without local language u cannot go  speak to a local customer.  Have a definition of marketing and the difference between marketing  sales always in ur purse.becoz as a fresher these r the two definite questions they will ask in an interview if u go as a fresher.(Questions out pannitenna hehehe) I always keep one  still i have it with me.(i know u r all laughing because i used to bit adichify in exams  it continues even in interviews)   Second delete all the IT projects  packages u know from ur resume. u can include at the most Ms office.( padichethalleam waste aaa )  Third after joining in a job the same evening post ur resume in all the job websites  keep applying for all the jobs u see.  If u r in a company which is big (say for eg Reliance ) u will definitely get atleat 5 calls for interview in a week.  If u get a good offer with a hike in salary go for that job. this process can go on till u settle down into a good company where u think there will be growth and where there is good salary.  These r the tips i can give with my expereince so far in marketing and sales.  Bye
