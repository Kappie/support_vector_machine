       
      Fun and exhausting weekend.  We left for Wisconsin after I got off work on Friday.  Took a while to pack up the car and made it there around midnight-ish.  The next morning we got up really early and moved Mary (Ann's sister) into her new apartment.  I also got to meet Ann's brother, sister-in-law and niece.  I also got to meet Ann's friend Andie just back from Nepal.  She had internesting stories and gave Annna game called Tigers and Goats. It is a very fun game.   Sunday we went to the Brewers game.  It was a slugfest as even the pitcher hit one out.  Padres won.  The new stadium is very nice. Monday, we drove back to Cincy.  That is a long drive.    Tom and I will sign our lease today.  Our apartment is in Hyde Park Plaza, across fromt he Hyde Park Kroger.
