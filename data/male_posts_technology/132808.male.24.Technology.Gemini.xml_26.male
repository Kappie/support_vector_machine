Actually, now that I look at it carefully, they may win the division, because they're in with such fucking winners like the Minnesota Vikings, Chicago Bears and Detroit Lions.  If they don't go AT LEAST 5-1 in their division, do they even deserve a playoff spot?  How you can say Favre is the best QB of all time and not expect me to respond is ridiculous.  But you probably expected me to respond, so it's not that ridiculous.  All we have to do is look at their records.  Ace Ventura vs. Something About Mary.  Isotoner gloves vs whatever the Hell it is Favre sells.  I think we can all agree that "The Man" is still the man.  Dan Marino is where it's at, Nex.  Jump on the bus.   Oh, I love the fact that they wear teal and orange.  Because any time you see someone in Dolphins clothes, you KNOW they're a big-time Dolphins fan.  No one in their right mind would wear teal and orange for fashion reasons.  Oh, and to kick off the opening of this little site, I will, in about a week, reveal the 10 greatest Jean-Claude Van Damme villains of all time.  Now, to most of you who know me, this may not seem like that daunting of a task.  But I will judge this fairly by watching every Van Damme movie I either don't remember or haven't seen.  Now, if this still doesn't seem all that bad, take this into consideration: I've seen or can remember seeing Kickboxer, Street Fighter, Lionheart, Bloodsport and Universal Soldier.  I do NOT, however, remember seeing or have seen Universal Soldier: The Return, The Order, Double Team, Maximum Risk, Timecop, Desert Heat, Replicant, Knock Off, Legionnaire... oh Good God, this is gonna be tougher than I thought.  The things I'm willing do to for Blog My Salad.  I guess it really is true what they say: "Try everything once, except for incest and heroin".
