Talk about dedication to his art!  The movie is really amazing and for those who haven't seen it please do.  Did nothing much today. Played more TNET, chatted with some net friends online, efiled my parents' tax returns and took a nap. And just like that my weekend is over. Back to work tommorow.   Mom bought a tub of ice cream today. Sigh here I am trying to cut down on junk food and she's tempting me with stuff like this. And now shes asking me to eat it arrrghh.
