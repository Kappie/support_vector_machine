Think it's almost breathing it's last coz no matter what kinda options I restarted it in, it just came out the MS blue screen. Can't even enter safe mode anymore. Suspect the harddisk finally gave in. Anyway, lagi best. Means I can concentrate properly on my project meeting tonight, my Jap test tomorrow and my project demo this Fri. DAMMIT!!!! Kuusooooo!!! (Note the effect of knowing  urlLink someone  who throws in Jap verses every now and then.)  Oh yar, last weekend Annie (housemate, in 2nd year medical school) had a group presentation to prepare. She invited 2 of her friends over and one of them (another Annie) brought 2 Chihuahuas!! Cute leh. I always knew how one looked like, but to have 2 of them running around and licking your finger was like ... wooohooo. Did I mention they were cute little bugger? Fed them a bit of ham and they started to hang around my feet when I wanted levae the kitchen with my ham sandwich. Heard they'll be dropping in sometime this Easter again and they'll be going to the nearby park for a walk. Woohoo ... Chihuahuas.  I'm probably not gonna start server revival operations till this weekend. But only after a well deserved break and maybe a lunch in town or something. FRI!!!! FRI!!!!! C'mon!!! Anyway, won't be online till my server comes back on. Cheers.
