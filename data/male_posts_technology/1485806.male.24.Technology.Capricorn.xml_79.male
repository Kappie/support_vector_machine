Prayers, tears and even the courage to stand each year and everytime an altar call is made to stand in the gap for my parents have been heard and even planned for this day , this moment. Truly His loves continues to amazed me even more and more. The night before in previous posting,my car have runned its last miles on the same battery for the past 2 years...and God have blessed me in the middle of my working hour with mechanic which take care of the job in less than 15 minutes.  The next morning, I went to UH to pick up my mom for church and i still dazed over the fact that my mom wanted to go to church like it is the most natural thing for her to do. My mom came to KL because my bro needed an operation on the leg to repair back the muscle tear . And really i just can't believe it and continues to even praise God for his amazing love when she came to church without any objections.  She came to church and really she just stood there hearing a message in worship and the sermon which is properly planned by the Holy Spirit about the reverance we have for the cross..John 3:16 was preached time and time again during that time. My mom was really touched when i introduced to Ps Lee Choo whom she prayed for my mom and my bro.  Another good thing is that she is staying for another week for my bro's physio and really it is by God's grace and mercy that she is staying. Easter Healing Service is just around the corner, and yeah Wow..she is coming. I just want to request from you guys to pray for her salvation ...cause I have been praying for hers for so many years.   Another miracle just happened today.My tyre got punctured today in the middle of Damansara Perdana in the hot sun where no cars stopped by to help. I called everyone as usual but to no avail. I was in the middle of changing the tyre with me muttering a prayer that someone would be sent by God to help me.  The moment i stopped a moment to rest, there stood a girl coming down from a car ....which happens to be Lin, a girl who used to be studying in the School of Photography and now working  and attends my cell Simply United and church SIBKL), she recognized me and her friend directed me to a nearby tyre repair shop and got someone to help me change the tyre.  Really God 's love amazes me...with miracles happening after even such a small simple prayer that i have grown to just have God-Dependency ....,
