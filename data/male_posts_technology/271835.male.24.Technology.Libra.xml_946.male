This is 20,000 more than link to Opera, 5,000 more than link to Netscape, 15,000 more than link to Microsoft's IE page and 12,000 more than link to Apple. This is phenomenal!  All these figures are easily verifiable  by clicking on the links in the  urlLink article .  The article goes on to explain that a  urlLink database of posts  about Firefox has been created which is how I found out about it as we've had a few referrals from an  urlLink entry of ours . They are trying to get 2000 contactable sites by August 10th. As the sites are indexed people are asked to put on the contact details for the site. I've just put ours in which takes them to  urlLink 353  at the time of writing. This database is going to be used to contact people to get them to put the get Firefox button on their site. Well I think it's that button anyway as I couldn't find a link to buttons in the article.  Well there's ours in this post. I'll stick it in the sidebar at the weekend.    urlLink
