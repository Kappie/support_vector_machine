Anyway, I went out there this weekend to see the progress of the house they're building out there. When I got there, there were about 20 or 30 cows mooing their way up to the house. They were still in the field for the most part, but some of them had made it up to the yard and out-buildings. Now, my parents don't have any livestock, so these cows have broken through a fence somewhere and made it on to our property without any guidance. No one was around, so I took it upon myself to herd the cows out of and away from the yard. So, I'm out there whooping and hee-yah'ing like I imagine a real cowboy would. I'm sure I looked ridiculous in my Hawaiian shirt and no horse, but I sure felt like a real cowboy, if only for a few minutes.
