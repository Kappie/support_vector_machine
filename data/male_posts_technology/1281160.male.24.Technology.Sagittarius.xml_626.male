And i welcome one more poet! ya Jax i read ur poem at ur jaxsays blog and found it good! By the way dint u write any stories in recent days and one more thing, the story which u had sent us some time back, i could not read fully. The story which starts at Indian PM's residence. can u resend me again? Is it a thriller? and by the way these days thrillers are not very thrilling with much twists and turns.   Recently i read one sujatha's story. Hope all of us know Ganesh  Vasanth. His prime detective characters. It was a detective story and the story was so dull that in the end there was a billow of disappointment of having read a kothu kathai. Yes, the end of the story was so plain and i wonder how sujatha could write like this and it has got a place in Vikadan's Deepavali malar. That time i felt, even jax would have written better than him! So send me some interesting story which i havent read till date or the story which i have missed.   Though got lots of work, my mood is kharaab and so dont feel like working only.
