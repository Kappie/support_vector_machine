My wife, Penni, and I are about to take the biggest risk, leap of faith etc...We have sold are successful business, cheaply I might add, in Tulsa and are moving to Kansas City. We plan on spending a couple of years in KC at The International House of Prayer. For me, this is a huge step (a bit scary)in my life. I have always been the one to worry about working and providing for my family. To walk away from the business I have built over the last eight years was not easy, but I felt it was what we should do. We leased a house in Grandview, MO (with a acre of open space in the backyard, WOW). I felt very clearly last year The Lord speak to me that he was bringing me into a new beginning, and he has. Anyway don't want to ramble to long especially on my first entry. Oh, BTW Oikos means household in greek.
