The Big Three are doing so bad to begin with, undertaking an endeavor to sell cars at a loss in this economy seems like it might endanger Ford's future ability to introduce more promising green technologies.  That being said, I think the more car companies (American in particular) do to reduce this country's obscene use of gasoline and big cars, the better. So, I am conflicted on how I feel about this. Good for Ford, but are they sure hybrid SUVs are what anyone but the typical early adopters want?   UPDATE: After looking into this more,  urlLink Toyota  is also introducing a  urlLink RAV4 hybrid .
