My linux-server at home is now awaiting my upgradeing to Slackware 10.0, but that might be a while. I find less and less time to "fiddle" with my server. I did manage to get some time to take photos the night before last. Nothing spectacular, but I hope I managed to cature the lightning-flash I encountered. If I did, I'll post it in my gallery when I get that up and running. I also post to  urlLink www.foto.no  and  urlLink www.photo.net  when I have pictures I'd like to have others view.
