Training starts the week of July 4 and goes to race date, November 7, 2004.  Stay tuned for future running updates as I get back onto a normal running schedule and train through the summer. Woooohooooo!  NYC here I come!  I posted a copy of the text sent to me from the marathon people indicating my acceptance.
