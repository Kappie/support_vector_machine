Today, I reformatted(after spending 7 hours at work) and then realized I failed to back up my messages:( I have it backed up from 2 weeks ago, but I archived almost all the messages from the past 2 weeks and then forgot to save the archive:(  So, now I have no written record of my emails....  Hold on, Thank God for "Deleted items" folder on hotmail. All of my stuff I "moved" to archives is still waiting to be deleted. I copied it back to my archives folder:)  It's 1:15 I need to go to bed:)
