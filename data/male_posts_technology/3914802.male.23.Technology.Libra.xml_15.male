If there was sex to be had, I am pretty sure we had it. We did it like bunnies. We broke up while I was in college and she was getting into college, which also happened to be the same one I went to. It was a horrible break up, which I would never want to relive. But afterwards we did hook up a couple of times... because we are needy people (as in, need the sex). We are still friends now and talk sometimes, but that really isn't the point of this post...             So, I called up my ex-girlfriend who used to dye her hair a lot, so she could help me dye my hair.... blond. Which is a big change if you have never dyed your hair before and your hair is a dark brown, which also happens to be my situation. And apparently my hair DOESN'T ABSORB BLEACH! An hour! an hour is what I let it sit in my hair for and, what do I get? A STRAWBERRY blond! an hour should have been enough to turn it a platinum-y color but I have armor hair. It really doesn't look all that bad. Although it is frizzy from the bleach so I woke up with some kind of afro-puff thing for hair. After a liberal dose of brushing and combing, coupled with a hat on my walk to work it settled down. Now I have all the reactions of my fellow co-workers to deal with. One of them shrieked with surprise at the sight. I am not that bad am I? hehe, another said he thought I was lying when I said I was going blond. Another, said she would never get used to it. But then some others said it was pretty slick, so hey mixed reviews but it is okay with me. I will just need to lighten it up a little next week.
