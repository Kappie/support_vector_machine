So I thought to post in my blog.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Gay And Lesbian Medical Association Lists Homosexual Ailments Date: Thursday, August 08 @ 20:42:30 CDT Topic: Diseases  The Gay And Lesbian Medical Association (GLMA) has just published a list of diseases and social pathologies that afflict those who engage in homosexual conduct.  According to the Gay And Lesbian Medical Association, men and women who engage in homosexual behaviors are at greater risk of a series of diseases and mental problems than are heterosexuals. These risks include: HIV/AIDS; substance abuse; depression/anxiety; STDs; prostate/testicular/colon cancer; alcohol and tobacco abuse; gynecological cancer; domestic violence; heart problems; osteoporosis; breast cancer and more.  Instead of discouraging these behaviors, however, the GLMA simply encourages health care providers to be aware of these diseases, addictions, and mental health problems.  If your school is pushing the homosexual agenda, school officials may wish to read about the dangerous health consequences of promoting sodomy among teenagers. GLMA has published reports on homosexual males and females. To access this information, go to:  urlLink http://www.glma.org .
