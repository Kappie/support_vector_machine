We'll see...  Yesterday started normally.  Got up, took shower, dressed and off to work at 7:00 a.m.  I'm getting much more comfortable at work these days.  I was able to perform 99% of all requested tasks without asking anyone for help.  This is good since my co-worker was on vacation and I was running solo.  I did have to call her regarding a printer lookup issue, but that was easily resolved.  The printer definition was stored in an unfamiliar location.  The user was happy I got him the information he needed.  I left work early at 1:30 to pick Nick up from the airport.  It took a lot longer to get there from Griffin, GA than it does from home, but the trip was uneventful.  As I pulled into the airport parking lot C called and let me know his flight was delayed and has not taken off yet.  Bummer, what was I going to do for four hours?  I parked the car and went to the Delta information desk to get a security pass so I could meet Nick at the gate.  It was surprisingly easy to get the pass.  I managed to pass through airport security without incident.  I bought a couple magazines and got a beer in the Budweiser lounge.  After about an hour C called and let me know the flight has left the ground.  I proceeded to the gate and waited for the plane to land.  I got an iPod mini and sat and read and listened to my eclectic musical choices:  James Brown, Counting Crows, Trisha Yearwood, etc.  The plane landed around 5:00 p.m.  We walked to the baggage carousel where, thankfully, our luggage was waiting for us.  We picked up Nick's bags and went to the car.  I drove home, but decided to stop and get supper.  We had dinner at Chin Chin's, a Chinese place.  I had Szcheuan Beer and Nick had Terraki Chicken.  Good stuff.  Went to Great Clips to get Nick's hair cut.  Then off to Show Carnival to get Nick some comfortable walking shoes for the band practices all July.  I bought him two pair.  I also make a quick stop into the Matress Factory to get a replacement for the master bedroom.  Our matress is almost 18 years old.  It was time to change it.  Especially given the sinking middle of the matress.  We went home, dropped off the luggage, then off to Publix.  We got Nick some food, cause I don't have anything he'd want to eat.  Since I started this diet, I've been eating salad, cheese, veggies and meat.  This isn't on a teen diet.    Nick played AIM on the computer while I watched a little TV.  Off to bed at 11:00 pm.  This morning I got up, showered, dressed, woke up Nick, and off to work.  Pat is coming to the house today to do some work around the house.  I'm having the front porch refinished, wainscoting in the family room, finish basement ceiling and correct peg board install C and I did.  Also he's going to put in a work bench with MDF top for me.  That'll help with the hobby stuff, I'd like to do.  Make furniture...I'd like to continue a hobby my grandfather W was so much into.  Anyway, as I got about 80% to work, I remembered I forgot my computer.  So back to the house.  Pat was there and had dropped off his stuff and was headed to Lowes to buy the stuff to finish the house.  Good stuff.  I picked up my computer and went to work.  Nick has band practice tonight.  I hope everything goes well for him.  I bought him some compression shorts to help alleviate chaffing during marching practice.  It's a good life so far.  Kevin
