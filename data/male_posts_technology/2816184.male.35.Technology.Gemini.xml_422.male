I went from "well, sure it's okay, but do I really love it?" to "what is love of life anyway?".  I eventually worked out a scale.  0 - I wish I'd never been born. 1 - Put a pillow over my face and get it over with ... 3 - It's okay, but I've *got* to make some changes ... 6 - It's generally better than worse. ... 8 - I think there are some general changes I'd like to make but other than that, smooth sailing! 9 - I'm happier that a clam at high tide. 10 - I'd carve out an eye just to keep breathing.  So I figured out I was at about a 6 myself yesterday, mabye even a 7.  Then I got home and got ambushed by the wife.  I dropped to a 0 so fast it would make your head spin!  Even today I'm still only at a 2 or a 3.  Add to this the fact that I've got another migraine....I have a feeling this sliding scale will come in very handy!  On other news, I had a realization on the bus yesterday.  She is the only person I've ever met who I can fall in love with (and I mean mad passionate obsessive love) over and over again on a regular basis.  I'm on my second wife here and a few girlfriends, and never before have I expeienced this.  I've heard it's not even possible.  But it is....
