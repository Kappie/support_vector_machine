Max - Glad to hear you can come, i am trying to get Lora to come, but she has the same problems as Nicki Tom - If you can please let me know if you can come, cheers  Ok, Yesterday i went out for this meal, started with the theory that i had a physics exam in the morning (eg. this morning) so i wouldnt drink anything alcholic. It didnt last long,First of all i was joking around with the waitress and she guessed that i was 18/19 so i said yea i am, she then insisted on buying me a drink, and once you start you cant stop. I drunk far too much, i remember getting into the car with a beer and telling my dad that i hadnt been drinking at all. I wasnt the most drunk out of us 4 though so it could have been worse. I came in for the exam this morning, on time, but with sun glasses and a sore head!!! Still the exam went better than i expected, so that is good. I will not be in school tommrow. But i wilil be on friday. Please encourage others to come on sunday. I dont really care who comes, (you all know who i like and who i dont!) Look foward to seeing you all soon, Text me if you wanna know anything, Dave
