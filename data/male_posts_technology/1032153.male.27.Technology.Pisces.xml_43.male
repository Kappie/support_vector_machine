Well as most of you will know, the word is not one which is found directly in the Bible. Anyway, there seems to be confusion over what this word means. This, I believe, is mainly due to misuse of the word, when another word or phrase could be used instead. The word has been hijacked!  To me, and until recently this word meant:-  a reliance on ones works (obeying the law) for salvation. Today some people have hijacked this word, and used it to oppose those people who would confront sin. Those who confront sin are labelled as legalists (which obviously has negative connotations).  The greek word for faith is pistos. Pistos comes from the greek word peitho, which means to obey (among related meanings). Interesting. Faith and obedience seem inextricably linked. Remember also how James argues that faith without works is dead. It is by grace we are saved through faith, which is the gift of God. And with faith that is alive, comes obedience. This is not legalism. It is biblical.  To expect it is also biblical. When 'faith' is not acompanied by obedience, we need to question whether it's saving faith.  1Th 5:14  My friends, we beg you to warn anyone who isn't living right. Encourage anyone who feels left out, help all who are weak, and be patient with everyone.   1Th 5:21  Put everything to the test. Accept what is good  1Th 5:22  and don't have anything to do with evil.    Jud 1:22  Be helpful to all who may have doubts.  Jud 1:23  Rescue any who need to be saved, as you would rescue someone from a fire. Then with fear in your own hearts, have mercy on everyone who needs it. But hate even the clothes of those who have been made dirty by their filthy deeds.    These verses show us that we must warn people who are in sin, that we must have nothing to do with evil, and hate evil. Neverthless, we must show grace in our approach to these tasks. A difficult thing to do, but that doesn't mean it can't be done.   So in summing up:- I'm definately not a works for salvation man, but I do believe works are the fruit of true faith. But nevertheless it is not works that save one. Legalism is not saying something is wrong!    Respect for Church Leaders  1Th 5:12  My friends, we ask you to be thoughtful of your leaders who work hard and tell you how to live for the Lord.  1Th 5:13  Show them great respect and love because of their work. Try to get along with each other.   Interesting, and challenging. I'll remember this next time I'm about to complain and whinge saying I wouldn't do things  that  way.
