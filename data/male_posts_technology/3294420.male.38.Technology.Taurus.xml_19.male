They said that she will likely be home in about a week.    They will keep bottle-feeding her two out of three feedings until she consistently finishes them all.  Next they will increase her to all bottle feedings using the feeding tube only when she isn't able to finish the bottle.  Then they will move her to "ad lib" feedings where they don't automatically feed her every three hours, but instead wait until she "demands" a feeding.  If she doesn't do so in four hours then she will be fed.  With these feedings, they feed her until she is full.  Once she is doing the ad lib feedings she will be about two days from coming home.      Dale and I had a great visit with her tonight.  Dad fed her.  She ate the whole bottle in about five minutes.  She was definitely wanting more.  She kept sticking her tongue out.  She was very playful.  Love,  Gina.
