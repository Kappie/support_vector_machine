Among those some are fun, some are sad, some are enjoyable.. and it goes on.  When I am doing my postgraduation, we(my friends and myelf) went for a trip to Bangalore and Kodai. We all had nice time enjoying there. Few snaps  for you here.    Elavarasu, Selvin and myself(from right to left) .....a kind of relaxing.   A part of our group..   Nice huh?!   Later after my PG, I joined for CGI Software Solutions @ chennai. And he is my second employer. There I joined on Feb 2003. Andrew(the tall, honest, spritual man), my ex-boss there. There my team is Nanda, Ravi, Rajen and myself(may be small, but perfect team) done great job. we usually have a fellowship lunch every week.   Andrew comes once ina while from US and will be with us for the 15 to 20 days. Snapshot of one such lunch is here(quite favourite dish....yesssss... its Pizza).     After 6 months Nanda left for another concern, and in the next 6th month I left CGI, and joined in NatureSoft (where I am working now)
