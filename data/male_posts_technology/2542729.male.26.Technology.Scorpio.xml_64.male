A marvelous, bluesy, old time church style of song, reminiscent of an era long forgotten thanks to today's contemporary whitewash. Inspirational thought perhaps?  This weekend was one to be remembered, as I took a trip to the haunted city of Columbia, SC to hopefully catch up with some college friends. When I left there in the summer of 2002 after graduating from  urlLink BC , I finally said goodbye to a host of unworldly entities. None so prominent as the deva Cackelo aka Mike Cade. Of all my greatest adversaries, he ranks at the top of a surprisingly long list. However in my list of greatest acquaintances, his name is also close to the top of the list. He is to most people what satan is to hell...the embodiment of the ultimate soothsaying antichrist. To others, he is a godsend. A deliverer. To me he was pure, yet filtered, evil. But I took time to consider what my life would have been like without him in it and I see two different Ron's. One of them is a clueless loser who would have lived in a bubble his entire life. The other is a prince. Among the other ghosts in the city are the banshee Ruthie, my first official "stalker", the demon Dr. Swinton and his unholy band of crackheads, and a sea of supporting cast members that include numerous roommates sent straight from hell.  People tend to ask me all the time why I hate that city...and why I hate my alma mater so much. The answer is simple, I wasn't meant to love it. I was not meant to stay in Columbia and make my mark on the world from its bronzed bosom. I was meant to move on, to retain the fond memories but keep in mind the essence of the struggle. To understand life  the people who struggle. To understand that the worlds were framed by a mind more powerful and more complete than any that there has ever been upon the earth. In this haunted city, I wasn't meant to begin my spiritual evegnys, I was meant to learn and to leave.  ...obviously not leave...FOREVER, but definitely not to stay.  I still have some good friends in the city, some of which are mentioned a few entries back. After this weekend was through tho, I think I may be on the road to making a new friend. Only time will tell.  One thing I tried to do was get back in enough time Sunday afternoon to be able to make night service at my home church. Earlier in the day I visited one of the churches Dr. High plays for, a CME church off Assembly and had a great time. During the night service, one of the young brothers in the church DJ wanted to dedicate a song of his to a revered aunt of his that was in town. I was re-writing / mixing and had the only copy, so it was imperative that I got back in time. And I did...time enough to walk into the church  hear him already performing lol. Everything worked out in the end. Looking back, I wish I had put my name on program also. Seems I missed the first half of a very special night and it would have been great to have been part of that.  I also discovered that the Serles brothers have a  sister> ...who looks like a cross between an old school friend and my sister. I'd have to devote another entry to tell all about them. Just know that they are two brothers whose mother married a guy in our church. She did a number on program, and I wasn't blown away so much by her singing...tho it was exceptional...but she was really attractive. Not to mention she was singing one of the last songs I played on program at that! Very cute but very married, which works out just fine I guess. Once again, i'd have to devote another entry to explain why (and its not the reason most devoted readers would think).  This post is actually a rewrite. I had a whole set of similar info to post but the site was trippin.
