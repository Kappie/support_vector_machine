And, the main(and the only one so far) Prime Minister candidate is none other than Italian-born  urlLink Sonia Maino Gandhi , the wife of Late PM Rajiv Gandhi. I've nothing against Sonia. Rajiv was my hero when I was a child. My parents and all my relatives are Congress supporters and they have never voted for any party.(I've never voted at all - I'm not in the voter's list, Applied, Denied, Rejected)  But the very thought of having a "non-Indian" as a PM makes me shudder with disgust. It's not me alone, the same is the case with most of my friends and colleagues. Most of the middle class thinks the same way. But, they don't decide the mandate. The people like me never goes out to vote.  And the congress also doesn't seem to have a choice. The next choice would be the novice Rahul Gandhi, son of Rajiv and Sonia. After all , it's a family business.  I'm happy that both the children of veteran Kerala "Leader" Karunakaran lost the election.
