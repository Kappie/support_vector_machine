It just popped into my head during a discussion on the PH board about absinthe, and it's recent legalisation (or so I hear) in SA.  I used to be involved in the mild stuff. The herbals. Weed. Looking back, I realise ever getting involved with that stuff was a mistake. When I was on the leaf, I was a washout. Like, a complete llama. It very nearly cost me my scholarship. The will to better yourself evaporates after a few tokes. And while the desire to enjoy life is admirable, I feel to do so under the influence of a drug, is pointless. Because that's not  me . It's the same with alcohol. After enough beers, I'm a friendly guy... but it isn't  me  I'd rather someone like me when I'm me. Because that's the person they'd have to live with most of the time. It reminds me of that movie with Sandra Bullock - 28 Days. I was her - sans boobies of course. Today, I'm clean. I hardly even touch booze - usually a single beer is enough. The bad experiences I've had with booze, I could write a novel about. Suffice to say waking up in your own puke (or worse) loses it's appeal after the sixth or seventh time. That I'm still alive today is a wonder - how I had repeatedly managed to drive home barely able to see the road, is beyond me. The only plausible explanation is that  someone  up there wanted me alive - at least for now. You can only tempt fate for so long though.  I'm not condemning drug or alcohol use. Some people are willing to take the risks. I just realised that I wasn't. I'm clean and sober today - and actually  happier  than I was back then. Maybe being clean and sober is just who I was meant to be.
