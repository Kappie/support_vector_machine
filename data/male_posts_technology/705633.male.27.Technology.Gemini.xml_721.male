Here's news on the  urlLink Red Dwarf Movie (yay!)  It's James Joyce day today! Perhaps I really should make the effort and read Ulysses after all. But why bother, when  urlLink the BBC have condensed it all for you  and it's far more interesting:   CHAPTER 6 Bloom attends a funeral at Glasnevin Cemetery, his symbolic encounter with death mirroring Odysseus's descent into Hades. It's a real barrel of laughs.    On another note, I've decided to create a Toaster's 'eating-out' guide for Jersey, as recently I've had a couple of great meals out and a few really bad ones. Restaurants will be rated up to five slices of toast, for quality of food, service, atmosphere and waitress attractiveness. (OK, maybe not the last one). Stay tuned.
