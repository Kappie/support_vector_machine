Also, I find it funny that not caring is a crime, but caring is as well. Can't try to help, but if you shy away and give someone space, then you never cared at all.  Funny how these things work...  Can you say 'Lose-Lose situation'?   Otherwise, things are going amazingly, amazingly good. I'm going to be driving a lot, Mom and Dad are taking me out, and then I'll have my license... and  THEN , you and I will be able to get away.
