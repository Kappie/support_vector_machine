I have a white hessian shirt and psychedelic pants, with a blonde woman's wig and John Lennon glasses. Stand well back :)  December is looking pretty booked out on the party schedule as well. I have four, yes four, seperate works bashes to go to, (benefit of getting moved around different departments so much I guess) and I think I can gatecrash at LEAST another two on top of that. Also we have go to have a TF night out, so that's in there as well.. I think you can say December is going to be one long alcoholic blur.  TF Posse: Slapper McSlapperson (aka Mad Chica Canadian Andy) is over tomorrow and i've agreed we are going to take her out and get her dancing on tables naked. Txt me for time/place. Muahahaha.  I have to go now. I am quizzing a bisexual girl in a chat room and she's telling me all the unwritten rules of girl on girl action. Thank you lord.
