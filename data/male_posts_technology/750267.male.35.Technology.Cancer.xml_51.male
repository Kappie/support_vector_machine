Back in the old days, we used to have to print out our tax returns (on special BLUE paper) and then stuff it into an envelope (which barely fit) to mail it in. It wasn't long after that Revenue Canada (now called the CCRA -- our IRS) experimented with electronic filing. I must have been one of the first to try that. There was no Internet back then -- or at least, it was still acedemic at the time. That seems like 10 years ago at least.  So here I am, at 2:00am on the day they are due, filing my taxes. And what do you know... I discovered a bug in QuickTax. Off to the Intuit website. You know, for a company named Intuit, the web site is not very intuitive. It took me 1 minute to discover that the web site didn't have a record of my bug in its knowledgebase, and 29 minutes to find the phone number for tech support. "Intentionally hiding the tech support number -- a sure sign customer service is a top priority!"  To top it off, the tech support number is LONG distance for me. Geez, louise! Can't you even afford a 1-800 number? OK, I figure it'll cost me a few bucks on my phone bill -- I need to get this fixed tonight. I call the support number, at 2am remember, and am told by a computer voice that the current wait time " exceeds 60 minutes ". What? Excuse me? 60 minutes of long distance to talk to a rep who probably can't help me anyways. Uh, no thank you.  Why do I keep purchasing this software? These bozos at Intuit have proven, time and time again, that they are the most customer unfriendly company on the planet. 30 minutes just to find the phone number? At least 60 minutes on hold for a long distance call? This wasn't free software - I paid money for it.  Oh, the company did offer to help me right away for $20 (priority support). Hey, it's your bug! I'm not paying for support. Paying for tech support is the most ludicrous invention ever. I'd pay if it turns out I did something wrong, but not if you have a faulty product in the first place.  End of rant.
