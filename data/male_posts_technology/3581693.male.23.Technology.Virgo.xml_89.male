See a friend of my pointed out to me today that maybe I should have gone skinny dipping before now - which brings me to thinkin' - if that's true then what else might I have forgotten to do in my youth? (Not that I'm old by any means)  So here's the question: Is there a (set) list of things I should have accomplished in life by now?   Just a basic set...  starting with Skinny Dipping....
