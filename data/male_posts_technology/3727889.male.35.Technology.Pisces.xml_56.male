In computer class I was the guy who was “Sorry teacher but the correct scale of a double is 1.81673+e15 not 1.81672+E15”. I have since become wise instead of smart. I do not know the precision of a double anymore but I know how to find out. I may not remember every fact, tidbit, and bit of data but I know how to negotiate for a good pay rate. I know my memory may not be as good at 35, but my use of that knowledge is much better.  Now to set the record straight I called a $3 raise with an 8-3 of diamonds. I then proceeded to make worse calls all the way down to the river. Once I hit the river I made the only good choice with my flush: Raising my remaining .40 cents.  I will tell you all right now though, I do not write down my poker hands. I tend to write this Blog freestyle, saying what is on my mind. The only accurate hands you will ever see here are my live tourney reports. If you are depending on me for great poker advice please read someone else. I bet many of the Bloggers out there can give you better advice. I have been doing this for two months.   If you want total accuracy please read the New York Times.. check that, “Free Kevin Mitnick!”.. umm.. the Boston Globe or some newspaper like that. I am sure they have many editors that check the facts out.  All I promise to provide here is entertainment and my personal view of how my Poker career is going. For the most part I write the Blog for internal reflection. I hope you find my trials and victories inspiring or amusing. I hope some of them get you to think about poker concepts. Perhaps a few might give you a nice push in the right direction. If you require 8 degree decimal precision the 18 year old version of me would be glad to help, but the current edition does not see the need. I hope you all enjoy what I write.
