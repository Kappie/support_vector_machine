I competed, or maybe I should say completed a biathlon today in Waikiki.  Been a while since I've done anything like that.  It was a 5k run (3.2 miles) and a 1k swim (about .75 miles).  The run was pretty tough for me, I've always been a crappy runner, but I did it without stopping which was my goal, but I got killed by a lot of other runners, however on the swim I kicked some but and caught up with and beat a lot of people there so that was good.  It was pretty cool doing the swim because your competing in this race but all these cool fish are swimming around you at the same time too.  Anyways, it was pretty exahusting, but well worth it, there was an 81 year old woman doing the biathlon too!  Pretty sweet.  I'm starting a paddeling club which is the Hawaiian looking canoes, basically a canoe with another attachment on the side.  5 men row in it, or at least I think it's 5, and I heard they party pretty hard too.  Starts pretty soon I think, more details to follow soon.
