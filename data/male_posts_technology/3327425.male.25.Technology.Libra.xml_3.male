A wireless directory could generate as much as $3 billion a year in fees and additional minutes by 2009, according to a study conducted by consulting firm Zelos Group Inc.  Note "fees" and "additional minutes."  Who's paying for that?  The carriers "are either going to make money by getting lots of people listed in the directory" and charging for its use, "or they they'll make money by charging people not to be in it," said Roger Entner, a wireless analyst for the Yankee Group.  Hmmm...the regular phone companies already charge you for an unlisted number.  Think they will do the opposite for wireless phones?  Critics counter that the promise of consumer choice is disingenuous because many cellphone service contracts contain clauses that give permission to publish numbers.  Did you read your cell phone contract/policy closely?   "My [phone] already has started to get deluged with spam from pornographers and get-rich-quick schemes, and this directory will only make things worse," said Bob Eagan, president of consulting firm Mobile Competency Inc.   Now Discover Card can call my cell phone AND my house AND send spam email to my phone AND spam email to my home email address multiple times a day.  Verizon and T-Mobile are "vowing" that they will keep the numbers private unless customer's opt in (althought T-Mobile will have to change their contract because it states that they will list it).  Not sure about everyone else, but I beleive them.  Sure. I. Do.  Nextel/Verizon/others subscribers, wonder how safe your direct connect/push to talk/two-way numbers are?  How nice would it be to get a nice loud over the speaker message to enlarge your penis.  In church.  At a wedding.  During a moment of silence.  Disturbing.  Very disturbing.
