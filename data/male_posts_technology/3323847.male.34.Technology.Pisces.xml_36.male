I just wanted to get my music in a format that I use all the time now - digital.  It's  very  rare for me to use CD's.  In the rare times that I actually buy one, or get one as a gift, it usually goes directly into my computer for storage (MP3 format, of course) and future playing.  Then when I want to listen to my tunes, I either do so on my PC using iTunes, or on my Sony Clie (N760C).  My interest in music has increased in the past couple weeks.  As a music player/ripper, I just  love  iTunes, using it for everything music related.  I've been wanting to use the iTunes Music Store, but purchases through that gets you a file that can only be played through iTunes and/or an iPod.  NOT my Clie.  I can't afford an iPod, but don't really need one as I  already  have a music player.  Hymn was the straw that broke the camel's back, so this weekend I subscribed to the iTunes Music Store and made some purchases.  Hymn worked like a champ, so 10 minutes after downloading my recently purchased tunes, I was outside mowing my lawn and rocking out!  I gotta tell you, if you don't mind walking on shaky legal grounds (using Hymn) or don't mind the limitations on the iTunes-downloaded music (which, when it comes to DRM, I must say is not all that limiting), I  highly  recommend giving the  urlLink iTunes Music Store  a look-see.  In this man's mind, this is the one of the few internet companies that "Got it right" (See also: Amazon.com and Dell).  Direct link to  urlLink Hymn Project .  P.S. DRM =  urlLink Digital Rights Management .  It's basically technology that limits your use of media (how you can copy it, where you can play it, what you can do with it, etc).
