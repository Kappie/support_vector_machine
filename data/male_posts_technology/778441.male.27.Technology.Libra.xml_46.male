Little Miss Tuffet   Little Miss Muffet sat on her gluteal region, Eating components of soured milk. On at least one occasion, along came an arachnid and sat down beside her, Or at least in her vicinity, And caused her to feel an overwhelming, but not paralyzing, fear, Which motivated the patient to leave the area rather quickly.     Reflections on Ice-Breaking   Candy Is dandy But liquor Is quicker.  Ogden Nash     Woe-song of a born geek   Here I sit, broken-hearted, All logged in, but work unstarted. First net.this and net.that, And a hot buttered bun for net.fat.  The boss comes by, and I play the game, Then I turn back to net.flame. Is there a cure (I need your views), For someone trapped in net.news?  I need your help, I say 'tween sobs, 'Cause I'll soon be listed in net.jobs.     Hmmm...   My darling wife was always glum. I drowned her in a cask of rum, And so made sure that she would stay In better spirits night and day.   Well, ok people... I didn't have anything to blog about today, which is why I posted these verses. So, till next time...  cheers!
