First  foremost, a birthday shoutout to my hombres', Mr Ramesh  Ms Dippy on their respective birthday celebration. May this year be kind to you guys and hope all your dreams come true.  This happened to be one of my busiest weekends ever. After work on Friday, rushed to Midvalley as there was a Spider-man exhibition being held there. After getting some keychains, a cap, 2 t-shirts and a mug, i swung my fats webs and got me-self outta there. Can u believe that a taxi guy wanted to charge RM15 for a taxi ride from Midvalley to KL Sentral ? Sheesh .... It was supposed to be RM5.20 with a meter. Thank GOD for honest cab drivers in KL.  And yest and today, i watched Spider-Man 2 for the 2nd and 3rd time respectively. Sigh .... It was a promise made to a few friends and boy, i really overdosed on Spidey this weekend. Was planning to catch the LOTR trilogy at the Starlight Cinema which was from 8pm to 8am the following day but sad to say, there was no kaki .... Apa lar ....  Next weekend is gonna be busy too with a Klang bakuteh trip planned on Sat. This had betta be good or else ....  Savvy ;)
