My first one at that.  i don't know how often i will post anything here, but i'll give it a shot anyway :)  Today i scheduled my next test for my quest in becoming an MCSE. The test i scheduled is 70-216 aka Implementing and Administering a Microsoft Windows 2000 Network Infrastructure.  It'll be a lot more difficult that the silly "managing a network environment" that I took last month and got an insano i've-been-assimilated-by-microsoft-score of 1102 with nothing to improve on.  Well, i gott a go do something now...  be back
