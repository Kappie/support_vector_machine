Irish-born actor Sir Michael Gambon is tipped to take on the role of Professor Dumbledore in the Harry Potter movies following the death of star Richard Harris.  Sir Ian McKellen  (who plays the role of Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings trilogy)  and Christopher Lee were also touted as possible contenders to play the role of Prof. Albus Dumbledore, but both of them said they were not interested.  I always felt that Richard Harris  (may he rest in peace)  was the perfect choice for the role of Prof. Dumbledore... just as Ian McKellen fits like a glove in the chracter of Gandalf in LoTR movies.
