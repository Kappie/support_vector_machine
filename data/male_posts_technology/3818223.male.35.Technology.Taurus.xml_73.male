A quick check on  urlLink Eclipse Magazine  revealed that my first published story "Locus of Control" is still listed, although no links go to the story itself. Eclipse never really took off - only one other story is listed as being published there, and both are from 2001. Good is bad, bad is good, all the stuff's the same.
