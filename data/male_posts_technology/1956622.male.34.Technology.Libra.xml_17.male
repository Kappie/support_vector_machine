I told her I did not and once again was ignored.  In fact I was so ignored that Karissa was more interested in the dog crap on the bottom of her shoes that she decided to talk to her mommy about that instead.    I just love the way mommy encourages her to talk to her daddy.  She never says you can play with that after you are done talking to your daddy.  Never encourages dialogue of any kind just stands next to her and lets her put the phone on the computer piano or something and ignore me.    I hope she gets to experience that feeling someday!!
