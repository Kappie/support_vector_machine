But in Yuishinkai, we're told that it's 'e' (as in the word h a y) and 'i' (as in the word h i t). So it sounds pretty much like 'eeeh-eeee'.  Only a matter of how long you drag each syllabus. For instance we do a shomenuchi strike, at the start of the strike (when arm is swinging forward) the 'eh' sounds off and 'eee' comes immediately after. But 'eeee' is suppose to end together with your strike (when hand reaches maximum pt/end of strike at hip level).  I guess it applies to shomenuchi undo, rowing exercise, striking exercises, tsuki, etc. Good pt.s to note. I tend to only ki-ai during warmups. But never in a technique unless I'm told to do so.
