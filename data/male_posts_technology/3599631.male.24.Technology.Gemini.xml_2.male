For example,  urlLink Froogle  allows you to search the web for low prices on pretty much anything. Of course, this whole  urlLink Blogger  thing is Google-owned now.  The real fun, however, is over at  urlLink Google Labs . That's where you can find all the cool stuff before it comes out. It's like going to an auto show and seeing the concept cars that just never get to market. Though a lot of Google's stuff comes to bear. I've been using Froogle for a while, it just recently got onto the Google homepage.  A pretty neat tool over in the Labs is the  urlLink Web Alert  tool. I don't know about you, but I've been known to do some  urlLink egosurfing  every once in a while. With Google's Web Alerts, i don't have to do it by hand anymore. Instead, the  urlLink results  are emailed to me. A new item comes up, I get an email about it.  So now I'll know when someone is talking smack about me, without ever having to look for myself.
