Today I want to talk about boobs. I used to hate the male (and female) obsession of boobs. So much so that I wore baggy clothes and was called a variety of names from a dude, to a dike to a guy continuously. Well meaning strangers would kindly tell me that I was entering the wrong restroom for my own safety. I simply did not want to be a piece of meat. I wanted to be known for my charming personality and quick wit. Yes, you know it, I rarely got a date. (Love ya Pheonix)   Then a dress code change came into work. No baggy clothes, I was upset and mortified. I felt like my old ratty boss wanted to see my boobs. I contemplate going for sexual harassment, Pheonix talked me down and told me that boobs, yes wonderful are actually sources of infinite power if used correctly. I decided to hone this power and use it for good and not evil.   It’s been working pretty well too. I get days off of work and if I wear just the right shirt, nobody really cares if I’m late. (Only girl in the workplace.) The best thing that I have done with my boobs was sell my car. It was a ratty 150,000 mile totaled Ford Taurus. It wasn’t always like that though. I loved that car. It went through my rebellion years with me. But hasn’t been driven since. Two years ago at about 5am I was blazed and driving home to crash. I was also stopped at a red blinking stoplight. I waited. I rocked to a number of songs headbanging in my car and bellowing along. I waited some more. Finally a little voice in my head whispered, ‘it’s a red BLINKING stoplight.’ I turned down the music and the little voice told me, ‘at a red BLINKING stoplight you must Stop Look Both Ways and Proceed.’ I felt like I was in the Field of Dreams. I looked around the car, no one there. ‘DO IT!’ yelled the voice. Then it finally dawned on me. It’s a RED BLINKING STOPLIGHT. I hit myself in the head and ran into the intersection. Then  I saw it. A bright orange Scooby Doo van, it hit me, I turned three full circles and stopped on the other side of the intersection exactly as if I had stopped, looked both ways, proceeded and stopped on the other side of the intersection. I was wondering why  I would do that. Why would I stop on the OTHER side of the intersection?   As I was scrambling in my head for some weird law concerning this Boone, my best invisible friend from when I was a kid, popped up on my steering wheel and said ‘DUUUDE! You totaled your car MAN!’ I told him I didn’t and asked him where he had went I missed him. As we were catching up on old times there was a knock on my window. I thought that was just kinda rude to interrupt a conversation but I decided to be polite. I rolled down my window. The guys asked me if I was ok, I told him I was just talking with Boone. He looked around the car, obviously only seeing me since Boone is my invisible best friend, and said ‘Don’t move. The ambulance is on its way.’ Then it dawned on me, I’m 23 and talking to an invisible friend, I’m insane.  So that’s how I wrecked my car with no registration, no insurance, expired plates. I didn’t even get a ticket, I got a court date. The Judge I got was really, well weird. His grandson had just won a spelling bee and he told everyone awaiting punishment that if they congratulated him he’d go easy on them. I watched as people went up most of them getting thousand dollar fines or jail. It rang in my head ‘jail’, ‘prison’, ‘jail’, prison’. I hated high school I sure as hell was NOT going to prison. I was too young and too cute. It was my turn. I had to pee. I walked up there and stood in front of the judge hanging my head and doing the pee dance. Then I looked up to him and thought I was looking at God, you feel really lame and little when you look at God. But I did stuttered a congratulations to his grandson.  God smiled at me and said ‘What did you do.’ I told him. He asked me why. I said I didn’t know but was really, really sorry. I think a tear fell then. He smiled again and gave me a warning and not to drive for a while as a punishment. He didn’t suspend my license or anything just kind of like a warning for a toddler. I was ecstatic. I couldn’t believe it. I left while another person was being put in jail. I was invincible.   Well back on the main story I just paid off my piece of shit car and found out that since it wasn’t ‘under cover’ ie under anything including a towel, I owe registration and back taxes. So I marched down to the court house in my boob shirt, waved them in front of a really lonely ugly guy and got them waved. He just told me to sell the car or give it away, also not to tell anyone who he was. So I did and the over a grand of fines and fees are waved and I got a profit of 200.00 from flashing my boobs to my Mom’s old boyfriend.   I like boobs.  Akcron – Ziggur! Wait for Backup!
