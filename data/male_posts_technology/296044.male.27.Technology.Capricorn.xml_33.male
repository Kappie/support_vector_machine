Well, technically, I have a truck scheduled for the 20 th , but I get the keys on the 15 th . I cant wait! And, whats more, I bought a brand new 27 (Shut up, 27 is just fine for me) Panasonic flat tube television. Its slick. And, its silver.                Lets see I also bought a new couch and loveseat! They are a sort of moss green nice color. I still need to get a coffee table, and two end tables, but I think Im gonna go to Target for hat. And, thanks to my pal Susan, Im going to get a bakers rack, and use that as my entertainment center. I think it will go quite well. Then in the future I will get my perfect television stand which I dont think exists.                Other than that, not much else going on in JJ land. Oh, I was in an accident. Im fine! My car is fine also, thanks to Josh. I rear-ended someone. Ive told this story twenty times, so Ill make this short. I was looking out my window, to the left to check for traffic in the next lane, so I could make a lane change, and was not paying attention to traffic in front of me. Bang, I hit a guy. My fault. I was bad. Not much damage to the other car, as far as I could tell, and the dude driving seemed to be fine. I have to pay a fine of $150.                My idiot roommate has pretty much moved out and is now living with his nineteen year old friend pretty dumb if you ask me. He took most of his furniture except for his bed and computer desk. Oh thats right, HE LEFT HIS DOG TOO. Yeah, the dog spends all day locked up in my roommates old bedroom doing nothing. I think my roommate comes home maybe once a day and lets him out. I dont know if he just expects me to take care of the dog or what, but I think its cruel and irresponsible. And yes, I do take care of the dog, and play with him, and all that jazz, but its still morally wrong, and pathetic. His reason for all this? He and his 19 year old moron in training do not yet have room for the dog at their place.         Gee, if I had a dog, room for the dog would be at the top of my list of need in an apartment, but no, not when youre my incredibly stupid roommate!                Aight. Ive written mucho stuffo, so Im gonna go-o. Yall come back now, ya hear?
