As for what is wrong with telling people not to kill, to respect their parents, etc.: nothing.  But what is curious is the need to enhance the already strong argument with the physical presence of the Ten Commandments, which, if one is to take them as merely wise suggestions rather than the direct prescriptives of Yahweh, have no more weight than what anyone else recommends anyway.  The only way that words gain weight, or importance, beyond their inherent meaning, is in either how they are used, or who uses them.  The Ten Commandments, traditionally, come directly from Yahweh through Moses.  Take away that connection, and they have no more weight than any other wisdom.  Are our society's laws so dodgy that we need to back them up with a direct line to the Creator of the universe?  My goodness, but that's an alarming prospect.
