While the MRI did not show anything about my memory loss, it does show that I have 2 funny looking small holes in my frontal lobe.  They think it is one of two things.  Either brain bleeds, or early signs of multiple sclerosis.  I personally don't think it is the latter.  I was in a bad 4 wheeler accident when I was in the 8th grade.  I actually cracked the helmet in two.  So it is probably just some old scar tissue from that.  Any way the doc is setting up an appointment for a neurologist just to make sure.  I am not really worried... prob not a big deal.  I am hoping more so that the doctor can help with my memory.
