I had them look at the two spots on my left shoulder, and they decided those are ok right now, but he then went on to look at 3-4 different spots on my back, and decided 1 had to come off today.  So I have 2 stiches in the middle right side of my back, 3-4 inches over from my spinal column.  The other is from the lower part of my left calf.  That one took 3 stiches.  I get to go back a week from tomorrow to have them taken out.     You would think, since novocaine would hurt so much going in.  The stick of the needle sucked, but to have that liquid fire going into your leg...OUCH!!!  I got to look at the spots the doc took out, and was surprised at how big they seemed.  The one on the leg was 8mm and they used a "punch" to take it out.  I should know by next week when I have the stiches taken out if they are actually skin cancer or not. Based on how they looked (EW!!) I'd say the qualify.  Hopefully they don't though.   I took 1500mg of Tylenol (generic) to make sure I was ready for when the pain starts to kick-in.  Hopefully it wont be too bad, but judging by how deep he went, I'm "definetly going to feel that in the morning"
