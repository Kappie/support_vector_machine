If a player had 15 homeruns in the AL and then is traded to the NL he has 0 homeruns in the NL homerun standings.  What if 1 of the 15 homeruns before being traded came against a NL team in an interleague game.  Shouldn't he then have 1 homerun when he starts obtainig NL stats?  Wouldn't he then only have 14 AL homeruns?  Would he have always only had 14 AL homeruns if he hadn't been traded?  Not even Tom could give me a good answer on that one?  Does any one have an answer?
