I did not make your pretty picture yet because I could not find the right color crayons"  That really made me smile.  We started a conversation the other day about her favorite colors and stuff and I asked her to make me a picture with her favorite colors and have mommy send it to me.  Then yesterday I asked her about the picture so it was funny when she said that first thing.  I told her it was OK I was not in a hurry and she could send it when she was done making it.  I also found out the circus was coming to Houston during the time she is supposed to be here (if   SFW   agrees to the terms) I know she wants to go so it would be really cool.  She was watching 50 first dates with everyone she said she liked it and it was funny.  She also talked to my room mate Rick and told him about the movie.  Then she put the phone down and came back and said "Thank you daddy!"  I said what for?  Lisa got on the phone and said we had a book sent to her and we told her it was from you.  Not the type of behavior I expect from someone who knows about upcoming events so I can only assume she does not know yet.
