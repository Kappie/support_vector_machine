(1 Cor 3:18)  Paul is addressing those "wise" and smug Corinthians who like to rock back in their chairs and compliment themselves on how much wiser they are than all these other Christians.  Why do they think like this?  Their reasoning is because "I am of Paul" or "I am of Apollos" (v. 4).  They are giving their allegiance to men and boasting about how this makes them better than someone whose allegiance is with someone else.  How does Paul reply to this?  "Let no one boast in men" (v. 21) and then "therefore I urge you, imitate me." (4:16).  What does it mean to imitate Paul... read 4:12-13:   "We labor, working with our own hands.  Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure; being defamed, we entreat."  The Message translates that passage:   "We pick up odd jobs anywhere we can to eke out a living.  When they call us names, we say, 'God bless you.'  When they spread rumors about us, we put in a  good word for them."  "Imitate me."
