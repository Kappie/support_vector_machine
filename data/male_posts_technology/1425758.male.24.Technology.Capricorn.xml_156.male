 I went to my usual physician a few days ago and told her how bad i feel at the workplace. Physically ill. She asked me if there's someone in particular in my workplace that makes me so ill, i said yes. She asked me if everything becomes normal when i come home, i sayd yes. She said that it's a known condition, medically called "anxiety"; She couldn't formulate it better: "It sometimes happens that some loser is over-promoted and then he ruins the lives of his empleyees ... usually out of envy." She gave me one sick day, with the diagnosis "Headache". 
 There it is, Mr. G.: to you i'm just a little soldier, but to me you're just a little man. I have just six months until the end of that damned contract. You won't break me.
