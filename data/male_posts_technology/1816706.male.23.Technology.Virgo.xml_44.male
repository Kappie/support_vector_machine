We require different O.S. and application combinations and each time there is a new class our instructor has to reload the operating system, requiring lots of man hours (or women hours in this case).  So to simplify this process I decided to make each of these combinations on the computer and created what is called an image so that you can basically push a few buttons and let it go and VOILA!  you have everything done in a matter of minutes.  So after doing this for about a week, I have just a few hours left before I am completely done and the hard drive dies, completely crashes, completely kills an entire weeks worth of work.  Just spectacular.  I work with this guy Curtis who has the absolute worst luck I have ever seen, I do believe it's starting to run off on me.  DANG IT!  Best day ever.  Ahhh, well tomorrow is Friday, tonight is Thirsty Thursday, and I have nothing to do all weekend 'cept sit on the beach and veg out.  Shoots.
