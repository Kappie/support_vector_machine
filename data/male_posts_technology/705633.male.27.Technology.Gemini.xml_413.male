Anyway, i've been busy being ill over the weekend, a nasty dose of the flu has rendered me incapable of fun/booze/strippers. I am proud to be a typical male, which means whenever I am even remotely ill I get the right to spend all my time under a duvet, drinking lemsip, watching  24  and moaning for attention. Anyway, I feel much better now, thank you.  Holly is now complete, bathing my desktop in her lava lamp blue hue and making me feel all warm inside. I do have a pic but it's really crap, so as soon as i steal a diggy camera i'll post a better one.     This is why we haven't invaded Iraq yet.
