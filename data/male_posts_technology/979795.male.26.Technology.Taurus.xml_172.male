We're just waiting for the sky to get a little better before we go out. Later we'll be shifting to a more centrally located accommodation. However, it looks like it’s may be in a red light district of sorts. It also seems like there is a huge population of Asians in the area. We do have some events lined up for the day but everyone seem to be in a world of our own since Justin’s bag was stolen. I have no idea how long this mood will last but it’s getting boring. I hope we can find something to lighten the tension soon.  Visited Amelieborg Palace (Royal Palace) for the changing of the guards. I finished up my current roll of film here. It was interesting but not too fantastic. Justin noted that one of the guards dropped his magazine on the ground during one of the drills. Cham liao, the chap sure kanna extra guard duty. After this, we went for a guided canal tour. It was really good, but Justin and I fell asleep. For me it was because of the rocking motion on the waters, the nice sun and the soothing breeze that made me fall asleep. The tour isn’t boring and I did find it quite informative. Next, we visited the National Museum. It was pretty interesting. But the problem was that we were all too tired to enjoy it much.  In the evening, while deciding on what we are having for dinner, the atmosphere turned a little nasty. We met a group of Singaporeans and Daniel took a bit of time to talk to them – he’s a friendly and sincere guy who takes time to talk to people, even those we don’t know very well. On the other hand, Justin is rarely that patient with strangers over such niceties. He’s not an unfriendly person, it’s just that he places purpose, speed and efficiency over such protocols. I feel pretty uneasy when I noted the change of tones. But everyone knows that tempers were just running a bit high at that moment. The mood was defused as quickly as it started. Whew.  We all had an enjoyable pizza buffet (but the drinks we had actually cost us more than the meal). After dinner, we went back to our accommodation and rested. I called Marcus about the details of visit and found out that we had a cheaper alternative. What we needed to do is to try to change our tickets first thing next morning. We had an enjoyable discussion about things in general and as it sometimes happens, a (friendly and interesting) debate ensued. I think we only went to bed sometime before 0100 hrs.
