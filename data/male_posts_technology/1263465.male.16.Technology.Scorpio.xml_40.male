I didn't know that there were two releases of them, a release A and release B.  The main differences between the two is that the low-end model was only a single processor, and the middle model was the dual 1.8 (which I want).  This is important because with the middle model you get more fun stuff, like an 8gb ram capacity, a 160gb hdd, and 3 pci-x slots.   A quick google on the matter produced  urlLink this :   Revision 1.0 of the PCI-X specification defined PCI-X 66 and PCI-X 133 devices that transferred data up to 133 MTS, or over 1Gbyte per second for a 64-bit device. The present revision adds two new speed grades: PCI-X 266 and PCI-X 533, offering up to 4.3 gigabytes per second of bandwidth, 32 times faster than the first generation of PCI. Another major feature of the PCI-X 2.0 specification is enhanced system reliability.  Sounds pretty cool, and I think I should investigate this more.  The only downside to the release A powermac is $200 more (for the store prices).  I think that that is a better thing to get however, because of the added features.    *Hopefully* I'm making a good decision on Apple.  It's an awful lot of money, and I could build a windows system for half as much.    One more thing:  I'm in a  urlLink battle  at BB.  It's fun ^__^  peace out :)
