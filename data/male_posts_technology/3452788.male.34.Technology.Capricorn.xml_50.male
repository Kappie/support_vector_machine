Who among us has not thought about blowing up at least one or two stores, if not the whole mall?  I know I have wanted to blow up Sears, Kmart, or Radio Shack several times in my life.  When you get screwed by a store, it is fun to contemplate, "What Would Arnold Do?"  He would blow their shit into next week, dammit.  When I worked at Longs, I imagined several times sitting on the hill above the store and sending a handheld missile into the front of the store.  Never to hurt anyone, just to see the place blow up.  If we can't dream about mayhem and destruction everyday without getting put in jail, the terrorists have won.
