What every man wants to know, (except possibly gay men, but then again, all men are curious at heart) For you women out there that actually read this site (God bless you all) I could simply answer you with the phrase "It's a man thing". If you still don't understand, follow my simple steps. 1) get a man, any man, if you have a boyfriend, it will make them worship you, If you have a male friend, they will do anything for you. If not, well, why are you asking? 2) get a close female friend. Closer the better, Make sure that they are in on this too, otherwise it could be messy. 3) arrange to go out together for a meal/clubbing/general piss up. 4) find a place when you are next to your female friend and also opposite your male partner/friend. 5) when the male in question is looking, lean over to your female friend and start kissing her, Tongues, hands everywhere… 6) continue for a minimum of 10 seconds to let the situation settle into the oft thick and unaware male mind 7) stop, lean back and look at your male friends expression. Also look at every other male person in the room. 8) as a friend, Pick up your male friends jaw and return it to the anatomically correct position.  Simply being every mans fantasy (if they admit it or not) is an understatement. It is genetically encoded into every mans loins. Besides, anything that a woman can do to another woman that we can't, intrigues us, for some its an inferiority complex, for others its an opportunity to learn. What more can I say, HAIL TO THE KING!!!  Anyone know where I can get my head wax stripped? Oh and I know the people that own La Friggate… Oh and one of my ex's worked there for a bit. Until she got fat eating their cakes, no kidding, she put on over 8 stone since I left Uni. Ok, admittedly I'm not the slimmest of people, but I have only put on 1 1./2 stone since I last had sex. With a person. With a live person. I'm a born again virgin. Virgin on the ridiculous! Oh I rant. Boss leaves tomorrow. Cut hair on Saturday. What else could I ask for in life? One thing. Liane? When are you gonna visit our lovely Island?
