Three shindigs of varying importance, and several events set to transpire in the coming months, all happening within a 72-hour time frame.  Below is a listing of what happened and what's to come.  You'll get a pretty CLEAR depiction of just how busy things have gotten.  Parties  Friday - My bride-to-be and myself attended my grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary.  It was held in a quaint little room in a good-sized banquet facility.  The price of the food during normal dining is listed in the local paper as moderate, so you can imagine the type of fare we were expecting to have.  But never in my wildest dreams did I expect to be exposed to food of this caliber.  Lets put it this way, for those who aren't too keen on massive details...it sucked.  It was basically a buffet dinner, which I am not opposed to in the slightest.  The salad was the traditional roughage, with broccoli and cauliflower thrown in for good measure.  The choice of dressings was either fat-free Ranch (barf), a paltry excuse for French, or a dismal and bland oily Italian (the little lady hated it).  The dinner was worse.  Rock hard rolls with no butter, grease-infused chicken, very wet cole slaw, bland scalloped potatoes, and the worst cafeteria-style mashed potatoes I have ever tasted.  It was horrible.  But, it was quickly forgotten as we celebrated this huge milestone in the sacred bond of love.  Aside from the food, it was a fabulous occasion.  Saturday - My lady's older daughter celebrated her 4th b-day today at a bash we had thrown for us at The Children's Museum of Indy.  An expensive effort, but rewarding nonetheless when we saw her face light up in joy.  It was marred by an accounting error and a lack of cohesive organization on the part of the organizers.  Basically they wanted $50 more than they were owed and because they took too long to play dress up with the children, we had our party go over and the present-opening was cut from the itinery.  Pissed us off, but it was still fun.  Sunday - Went to the woman's friend's shipping-off party.  Her friend is heading to the Navy on Tuesday, so this is their send off to her.  Had some good food, mingled, watched some insightful TV, and learned that if you pet a male Pug dog on the back of the neck just right, his little pink rocket will pop out for the whole world to see.  A learning experience for everyone to indulge in.  Plans  Listed here are things we are supposed to do for the next 2 months.  This is in no particular order, but is on the agenda: Weekend camping trip Weekend trip to Kings Island with another couple Family Reunion in Southern Indiana Surprise 50th b-day party for my woman's aunt in New York My niece's 5th b-day party Fourth of July cook-out with my family Company picnic at the zoo Company outing to Kentucky Kingdom  This is all things I have learned of planned in the past week, and summer hasn't even officially begun yet.  Oh what fun lies in the near future.  Also, stick in a potential trip to Cedar Point with the lady's boss, and yet more hilarity ensues.  Ah, summer...just a couple days ago I was yearning for the old days...now I feel like my wish is granted...more things to do than I have time/money for.
