(I know that alot is not a word, but I still use it, in fact I use a lot very often) :)  Does it make me a hypocrite? I mean, should I have to live in a world where my boss cannot spell routine, and then he misspells it like 420 times? yet, since I can't spell "a lot",  I am a hypocrite? (PS- I can't spell hypocrite either)   Well, I'm done on my little spelling defense, peace out- T
