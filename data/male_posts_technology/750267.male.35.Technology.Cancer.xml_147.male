You say you got a man, and you're in love, But what's love got to do with a little   manag  ? ... We'd be freakin' all night like we was on   E      I heard a heavily censored song on the radio this morning. But knowing what the lyrics are supposed to be, I couldn't believe the words they were blanking out. The song was "What's Luv?" By Fat Joe, Ashanti and Ja Rule.  I've highlighted just a few of the censored lyrics above.  Who gets to decide what words get blanked out? OK, from the above it appears that any words that have a direct or indirect reference to drugs get blanked (high, E). And any oblique reference to sex as well (menage)? I mean, are these the words we are trying to protect our kids from hearing? I understand the purpose, but in reality it will have no effect. It just ruins a song for no good reason.
