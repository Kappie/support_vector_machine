Have I done something bad and ended up in purgatory?   pur·ga·to·ry  (pûrg-tôr, -tr) n. pl.  pur·ga·to·ries   A state in which the souls of those who have died in grace must expiate their sins.   My company used to have about 300 - 400 people now there are less than 5 (in the US that is). I now sit in the office with nobody around but myself (and my servers). Occasionally I talk to some people from our Mexico plant to fix their problems, but they should probably hire somebody down there to manage the server farm and cut me loose because they get paid in peso's not dollars.  I wish I had a project to do but nothing...  Maybee I should just start sleeping under my desk like George Costanza.  Oh well, at least it's Friday and I'm not going back to work till Monday.  until later... -Casey
