The Pixies, after not playing for over ten years, are making Regina and Saskatoon their 2nd and 3rd stops on their reunion tour. I'm almost disappointed in a way because now I have hardly any reasons to go to Coachella (The Flaming Lips, Wilco). If I stayed here I would go to the Regina show as well. That would be wonderful to follow them all the way from Winnipeg down to Coachella.  Wed 04/14/04 Winnipeg, MB Burton Cummings Th. For Perf. Arts  Thu 04/15/04 Regina, SK Doris Knight Hall  Sat 04/17/04 Saskatoon, SK Prairieland Exhibition Park  Sun 04/18/04 Edmonton, AB Red's  Mon 04/19/04 Calgary, AB MacEwan Hall  Wed 04/21/04 Victoria, BC Curling Club  Thu 04/22/04 Vancouver, BC Commodore Ballroom  Fri 04/23/04 Vancouver, BC Commodore Ballroom  Sat 04/24/04 Spokane, WA Big Easy  Sun 04/25/04 Boise, ID Big Easy  Tue 04/27/04 Eugene, OR McDonald Theatre  Thu 04/29/04 Davis, CA Freeborn Hall   So yeah, should I spend over a thousand dollars to go to Coachella? I dunno. I already had my heart set so I want to. If The Flaming Lips and Wilco play Bumbershoot this year then I would really feel bad because I was planning to meet an internet friend in Seattle in September. Woe is me. haha yeah right. This should be great news, how come I feel weird.   Seeing Frank Black last year was great. I'm skeptical to think that the rest of The Pixies will make it that much more special.  I wonder is Coachella will just end up being me and Curtis. I think we should take Greyhounds if it is but I would love to go to Vegas and travel back up the coast and through Seattle.
