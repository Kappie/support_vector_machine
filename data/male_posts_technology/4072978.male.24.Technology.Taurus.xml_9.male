For me what is important is that I keep changing for the better. Better is defined as what makes me feel more fullfilled in my own life. So when I feel like I am stagnet I feel depressed and have love self worth. When I am accomplishing personal goals I feel good and my selfworth raises.    I also think that a large part of my selfworth comes from the knowledge that I am important to others. I don't think my life truely has meaning if it doesn't have an impact on other's lives. I am not sure if this is a fault or not, at times it serves and at times it destroys my own self moral. Go figure.   I think the worst thing that could happen to me is that I find myself letting everyone I know down and have no direction in life. That has not happened yet..... Will it? Not while I still care about living.
