For all the cuteness a baby shows you, there is the flip side of caring for an infant. Well aside from the constant drooling, the endless diaper changes, the crying, the fussing, the frequent feedings...where was I. Oh yeah, so babies pretty much just eat, poop and sleep. The sleep part is the tricky thing because unlike adults and older children for that matter, babies wake up in the middle of the night. Right now, my girl Sabrina is waking once during the night, usually around 2 am. Then again at 6 am. I am not a morning person at all so these interruptions are tough. You're sleeping when all of a sudden you hear the baby crying over the monitor. It's a sensation not unlike getting a bucket of cold water thrown on you. So you jump out of bed and stumble your way to the baby's room. Change the diaper full of pee, or toxic poo if you're really lucky. Go downstairs to make some formula. Return to the baby's room and settle in for the feeding. Half an hour later, you're pretty much awake. You put the baby back in the crib and shuffle your way back into bed.   My problem is that I either just stay up all the way to 2 am and the kid's feeding session. Or, I go to sleep early, wake up at 2, do the routine, and then can't fall back asleep. It's maddening. When the baby is newborn, it's even worse. The first month of the baby's life, it wakes up every 2 or 3 hours. Now, that was a tough road. I know this happens to a lot of parents, but there was a time after a couple of weeks where I literally had a breakdown. You are sleep deprived for so long that it starts to really affect your mental state. When you're expecting a child, all your friends who already have kids pretty much tell you the same thing. Get all the sleep you can before the baby arrives because once it's here, you'll never be able to sleep well until the kid is 18 and off to college. Joy.  Of course, poetic justice being what it is, the evening/morning I write this, the baby has, so far, slept through the night. And here I am unable to sleep.  As long as I'm talking about what parents should expect, parents-to-be, like my brother in law Kenji and his wife Bonnie, should know about some things:  1. If you want to travel, do it before the baby is born, because once the little squirt is home, the only travelling you do is to the store to buy diapers and formula. If you do travel as a couple, flying is cool now because you can use the pregnant wife as an excuse to preboard before the rest of the travelling masses.   2. For some unknown reason, everyone tells you to make sure you take a Lamaze class. Yet, during the actual birth, no one ever uses the Lamaze technique. Save yourself the money and bail on Lamaze. Take a childbirth preparation class instead.   3. Don't spend too much money on baby clothes. Why? Because everybody and their mother will be giving you baby clothes as a present. Also, infants grow out of their clothes incredibly fast. If you have too much, the baby may wear a given outfit literally once before he/she can't fit in it any longer. That being said, buying baby clothes is a blast. There are so many cute outfits to dress the baby in, especially for little girls.  4. After the baby is born, don't wait until the day you leave the hospital to learn how to install the baby car seat. Seems like a no-brainer, but it happens a lot. Those seats are not easy to figure out in a couple of minutes.  5. Here's a mystifying phenomenon. After the baby is born, it seems to get harder to communicate with your wife/husband. Everything concerning the baby becomes a big production that requires in-depth discussion. Guy will be guys and just kind of assume things, while the women have to practically chair a Congressional hearing on stuff.  6. If you are lucky enough to have family and relatives who offer to take care of the baby, NEVER turn down that offer. That allows mom and dad to go do other stuff without worrying about bringing the baby. Believe me. New parents NEED to occasionally take a short break for themselves. See a movie. Go shopping. Go to the beach. Anything to get your mind focused on something other than the baby.  I'm sure there's more, but incredibly enough, I'm getting sleepy. Time to climb into bed...
