 I ate half a Subway Wrap for dinner, and half again now at 1:30 in the morning.  I just got home from training and hanging out at my best friends apartment.  Luckily the dvd we wanted to watch was scratched, so we spent a few hours just talking about anything, and it was a good time. 

 Some days this illness has me stuck indoors, bearly moving, not speaking, trying desperately not to feel sick.  Some days its just a general malaise that makes me not want to step outdoors, or invite anyone over.  In either case I find that eventualy movies, games, books, and even the internet lose their appeal and what I miss most is time spent with my friends and family.
