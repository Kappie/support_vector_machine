Mind you, I really have looked at the shark attack  urlLink stats  and I realize I'm more likely to get in a car accident on the way to the beach, but I'm still a Nervous Nelly. I'm mostly worried about  urlLink white sharks  ( Carcharodon carcharias) as they frequent the Monterey Bay in a haunt known as the  urlLink Red Triangle .
