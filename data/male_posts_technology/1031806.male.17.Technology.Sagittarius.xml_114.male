If they return, they were always yours. If they don't, they never were." -Unknown "Love has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get, it's what you are expected to give -- which is everything." -Unknown "We perceive when love begins and when it declines by our embarrassment when alone together." -La Bruyere "Perfect love is rare indeed - for to be a lover will require that you continually have the subtlety of the very wise, the flexibility of the child, the sensitivity of the artist, the understanding of the philosopher, the acceptance of the saint, the tolerance of the scholar and the fortitude of the certain." -Leo Buscaglia "Sympathy constitutes friendship; but in love there is a sort of antipathy, or opposing passion. Each strives to be the other, and both together make up one whole." -Samuel Taylor Coleridge "All thoughts, all passions, all delights Whatever stirs this mortal frame All are but ministers of Love And feed His sacred flame." -Samuel Taylor Coleridge "Friendship often ends in love; but love in friendship - never." -Charles Caleb Colton "Immature love says: 'I love you because I need you.' Mature love says 'I need you because I love you.'" -Erich Fromm "Looking back, I have this to regret, that too often when I loved, I did not say so." -David Grayson "At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet." -Plato  These two are powerful: "Absence is to love what wind is to fire; it extinguishes the small, it enkindles the great." -Comte DeBussy-Rabutin "If you judge people, you have no time to love them." -Mother Theresa
