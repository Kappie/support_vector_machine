India won its first match on the New Zealand tour, propelled by the all round performance of  Zaheer Khan . Following up his fantastic first spell of bowling, in which he removed 3 top order New Zealand batsmen, Zaheer scored an unbeaten 34  (in 42 balls with 2 fours and a six)  to guide India to a win which looked elusive when he came in to bat at the fall of the seventh wicket with 53 runs still to be scored for victory.  Without doubt, Zaheer is my Man of the Match!!
