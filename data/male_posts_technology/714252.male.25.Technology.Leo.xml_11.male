Was out on Sunday night (and how ;]) and only get 2 hours sleep so spent yesterday in a zombie like state.. Then got home and had a few drinks at The .Bar (No, I don't have a problem.. If there was no drink in the fridge\bar THEN I'd have a problem)  I have to say it is great having a fully stocked bar.. Makes me feel all warm (and ever so slightly tipsy)  Anywho going back to Salsa classes again to-night.. Haven't gone in well over a year so it might be a bit strange (My Ex-Fiancee's Cousin goes to them a lot) Bubbles has decided he wants to start doing the classes so we are gonna go get our salsa thing ON (And give ole' Dr. Rumba a hard time ;])  Anywho, will probably update my blog more than Karl will update his (The Pansy) so check mine first.. He'll understand..
