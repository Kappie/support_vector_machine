She loves me and I love her...and i'm not sure what else a man could ever ask for. She's perfect in every way...beautiful, smart, intelligent, funny, thoughtful, honest...also she can cook and believe me when I say...that is VERY important lol! Perhaps even a prince with a vagrant heart can set his feet upon solid ground after all. Still with no home, save the one that resides in her heart. I have a girlfriend.........  I'm in love, and i'm headed to a land of controversy  despair.....so many emotions, so many thoughts, so many possibilities, but I cannot move. My fate is sealed and my hands are tied behind my back. All I can do is watch the world go by  pray that I do not add to its downfall. I certainly don't want to add to her downfall... I don't want her to suffer emotional grief because of me. I have no desire to be her best friend  her worst enemy at the same time.  A prison, then. Such as iron bars could create, but this metal does not the prison make. Trapped in insurrection, yet furthered by the sands of time. She is my future...everything that is good...everything that has promise. Everything that shines...everything that is precious to life. I can consider no soul more worthy to create a new life...  I LOVE YOU NICOLE...BABY, I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART  SOUL!!!  And so it begins...
