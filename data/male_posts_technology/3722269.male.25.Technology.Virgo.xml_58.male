Loved it tho. Weird.Had a migrain that I should've gotten yesterday because of the nuts amount of coffee's I had.. I guess it was lag or something - ahh well, mondays traditionally suck for most people anyway - right? So nothing wasted.Sadly a mate of mine has written off his car, his work car at that, but there is a slight irony that I feel obliged to point out. His personalised plate reads 'WARDRV' - meaning 'war drive'...Makes you wonder if the insurance company will be lenient with him. Fingers crossed dude.I overclocked my computer today, with standard cooling, and non-exceptional results, but oh well, at least I didnt melt anything including my self esteem.Then I had to talk to Scabaret, who informs me his substantially cheaper CPU is overclocked further.. which irks me. On the upside, his new haircut sucks. BAHAHAHARight, that's all folks.
