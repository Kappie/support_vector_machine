The only thing that was strange is that if you play with Kilik and you win he sometimes says at the end of the match, "This rod will be your doom!"  ewww. Thats pretty gross. If you look at ALL fighting games there is always some old demented guy. Like in tekken 3 there is this scientist that won't stop laying on the floor kicking you...v_v...It gets annoying! The Anime Unleashed Game will be released "SOON" and i will have it availible for download from this site.   Well I have nothing else to say... (read my previous posts if you want to do something...)
