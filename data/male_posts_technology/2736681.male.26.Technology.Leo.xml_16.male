Its very declarative, based on patterns and rules, with no explicit execution order. At the moment, it doesn't do reversible transformations, but its structured to support it at some point in the future. Online demo. *  urlLink MTL  ( urlLink Triskell Project , Inria/IRISA): This is my current stomping ground, and I'm kind of peripherally involved in MTL, in a vague kind of way. The language is very declarative, a little bit like Java but with its own concrete syntax. It has abstraction libraries for different repositories (most notably MDR and EMF), which is nice. No support for reversibility, nor will there be. *  urlLink mdaTransf  ( urlLink Cédric Dumoulin , LIFL): Hybrid language with declarative match based on XML rules and imperative actions with some declarative flavour. Some support for reversibility, very XML-based. *  urlLink ATL  (Atlas project, Inria): Hybrid, declarative match and imperative rule, developed by a team based in Nantes. *  urlLink Kafka  ( urlLink Torben Weis , TU Berlin): Am reading about this one at the moment. Seems to be based on graph transformation, a popular approach. Will update when I know more. *  urlLink arcStyler  ( urlLink Interactive Objects ): Commercial MDA tool that includes model transformation as a feature. If their revised submission to the OMG RFP is a reasonable approximation for their tool, they've got a nice little declarative language that uses structural refinement pretty heavily. It should support reversibility OK, too. * XMOF ( urlLink Compuware ): Compuware are a pretty heavy hitter in MDA, and their OptimalJ is a pretty nifty tool, from what I saw at a demo last year. Based on their RFP submission, they have a declarative, pattern-based language. Its reversible, uses OCL pretty heavily, but its semantics are really hard to understand from their submission document. * GReAT (ISIS, Vanderbilt): The ISIS guys have a whole bunch of interesting MDA-type research prototypes and stuff, grouped as GME or Model-Integrated Computing but, as I understand it, its all non-standard and built on COM, which is a real drag. I don't know much about GReAT specifically beyond what I've read in some very short papers, but it seems to be based on graph rewriting. I'd be a lot more interested in these guys if they used MOF! * TRL (France Telecom) * UMLX (Ed Willink, Thales) * Fondue (EPFL): This comes from Shane Sendall, Frédéric Fondemont and company at EPFL in Lausanne, and I believe it is based on graph transformation. Interestingly, I think Shane tutored me in second-year university, and Frédéric used to work in the team where I am now, so its certainly a small world.  I'm collecting them, so  urlLink email me  with what you've got.
