My brother moved out in November and soon after his now empty room filled up with tons and tons of my crap: boxes of comics, books,  and records as well as empty boxes and other stuff.  After Christmas, I realized it had gotten out of hand and resolved to clean it up.  But I never did and it just got messier and messier.    So now its the middle of July and after I mopped my floors tonight I figured why the hell not lets do it.   And after all that procrastinating and pissing and moaning, how long did it take?  An hour!  One fucking hour! I now have nice clean storage room but I feel like an idiot because I could have had it 7 months ago!
