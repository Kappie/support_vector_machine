This is probably the first time in my life I've had this much cold cash to burn. So, I find myself with a load of dough, and I can't decide what to do with it. Thoughts of doing the responsible thing, investing it and so on cross my mind. Or how about paying debts? That would be smart? Right? Right. So, let's see, I need a new set of headphones, and the Warcraft3 Collectors Edition, some new tunes, maybe a nice new jacket, an amp and sub for my car, a big-screen TV, a hard disk and CD/RW/DVD drive for my 'puter... So much for saving.
