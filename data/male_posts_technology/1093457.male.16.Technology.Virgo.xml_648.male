Shrina and Shay are Alpa's kids, Kinnou and Kishan are Tina's kids, Kommel is Tina's niece and Bimmel is Tina's husband. I'm going to see Hollywood homicide t his avo with Paul! Yay! WE're going to the 5.40 viewing, just in case other people are thinking of coming today (probably not) but in case you do, I'll be there with Paul!
