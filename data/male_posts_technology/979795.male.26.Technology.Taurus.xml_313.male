She distinctly told me that's hers. After awhile, my dad came down and asked if the plate was his. I have no idea why but I somehow felt that my mom had finished her share and the portion on the table was his, so I said she'd eaten and he went on to finish the food. His share was actually still in the pot. Halfway thru the 2nd serving (the one from the pot) my mom came down and made a helluva ruckus about the whole thing (her share being eaten). My dad gave her what was left. She just kept on yelling (high pitched and irritating volume) about the whole thing and kept poking (not physically) my dad. He of course yelled back. I also joined in the yelling and I actually got so heated up I called her a b***h. Fact was, more than 1 profanity was flying around the house not just from me (though I don't think my mom said any).  Went upstairs to prepare for my Japanese class later. And my dad came up to scold me that no matter what she was still my mom and that I shouldn't have behaved that way. Bottomline: I call 'em as I see 'em. Not denying my fault in the matter, made the mistake of telling my dad my mom had eaten and being rude to both of them. But to me, that was the only way I managed to get my mom's attention and to stop. My dad, being a sensitive man will probably keep harping on the issue even after me and my mom had forgotten about it.  Conclusion: Think we were all in the wrong somway or the other. I can't say who made a more serious mistake than who, but I can only say I felt like shit after my behaviour (though I didn't show it to them). But guilty or not, I can't say there's a solution to how they should be spoken to. Mom is in her own world and points take 3x the effort to get to her (if it even goes in at all). Father is in a world of his own too and talks in circles (he may have his reasons for doing things but the way he does things hardly works out. He is so keen on pointing out things to others he overlooks his own problems).  Course of Action and the rationale behind it: Made a point very clear to me in my head, I'm not going to let them affect me anymore in this way. From today onwards, I'm going to switch off my frequency to them. There's no point in communicating when noone knows how to. Plus I'm no longer bothered about whether we do or not. My friend, Neo, said what will my kids pick up from the way I treat them. I only told him I'm not condoning what I'm doing. But with my kids, I'm going to teach 'em another way. If what and how I teach to the next generation don't work, I'll accept my failure in this area and I will live with whatever the consequence maybe then. It's a set of double standards I guess, I won't stop trying with my kids, but I've absolutely given up on my parents. They may have brought me up, but I'm still going to take care of them in future as best I can, just don't expect too many words to be coming out from me anymore.  There you have it folks. The true scenario at home. It's been like this for the past few years. If anyone has anything enlightening to share, please do. But I doubt there's anything that can be said to change my course of action anymore.  Going off for class now.
