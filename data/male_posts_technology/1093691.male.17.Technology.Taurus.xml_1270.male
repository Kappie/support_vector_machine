She can't get that angry at me because I know some people arn't handing it in until tomorrow anyway.  I have got to babysit tonight which means an extra £5 to spend, Although I just remebered I owe Nicki £2 or £3. As she brought me a train ticket and I never paid her the full ammount back.  I had a huge fright this morning because my mum phoned from work saying are you sure you haven't got school. Now I was thinking that the teacher I was seeing today had phoned up, but in fact all it was, was that when my mum drove to work she saw all of the cars in the school car park. Forrtuantly I told her all the teachers had to go in, so the scare was avoided.  To david- I wonder whether you put on any weight? And also what did you spend your winnings on? I hope it was something for me.  Wow, I can't beleive I am making such huge posts recently! Maybe it's because I am putting off doing work if I type long things?
