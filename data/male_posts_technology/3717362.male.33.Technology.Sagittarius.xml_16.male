(Bonus points if you can name the title reference -- without using Google! Certain reunion folk are not eligible.)   However, I was inspired to put up a post by an article about Clemson University installing hydrolic goal posts in an effort to improve safety in postgame celebrations. It's both funny and unfortunate. Funny, in the sense that imagining these posts slowly keeling over after a game (automatically? or in response to fan attack?) just makes me chuckle. Oh, and consider the possibility of a malfunction during a game -- or more specifically, during a kick!! Now there's some potential for real howling! Unfortunate, in the sense that bringing down the goalposts is part of college football. Yeah, I know that it is basically vandalism, and that people do occasionally get hurt. In fact, a police officer broke his collar bone and some ribs during such a free-for-all after the 2002 Clemson-USC game. But anyone who ventures out on the field -- and certainly anywhere near celebrant-covered uprights -- should be assuming any risks surrounding the inevitable fall of said goalposts. I've been part of such revelry, and it is an atmospherethat defies description. It's a shame to see it fading into extinction.   One last thing: UM coach Larry Coker is defending the pending completion to the recruitment of 19 year old, 11 time arrestee, Willie Williams -- with a straight face, no less! He says he's comfortable with what Williams can bring to the program, both on and off the field. On the field, sure, he's a heavy hitter who was the number one linebacker prospect in the country. But off the field?? Hmmmm. Maybe he can help re-open some recruiting avenues that are, shall we say, somewhat familiar to the program.... Nice work, Larry.   Can you feel it? It's in the air. Football is almost here!!
