Blogging is your hobby.....creating blogs is your pleasure......reading(I don't know, now-a-days it might help you in your profession) can also be considered...Listining to music  writing all those words in your brown diary(remember you were just behind me for two years)....you've even shown that diary to me once.....however, it was like greek  latin, to me......  Trying to be a down-to-earth person????.....  I can even say that there's no man without  hobbies......everbody should be doing something that relaxes them....that might not seem to be a hobby to them......I can never accept the statement "I don't have a hobby"....  BTW, you don't have sing that song(which i did'nt understand too), to welcome me......I'm just so much excited....can't wait to see my parents.....  expecting our first snow this week.....ooooohhh i walk out now, i'll freeze...even with my winter jackets......  yet to read Rini's new blog....
