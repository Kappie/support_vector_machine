Had a wonderful weekend hanging out at McLachlan St. I'm still in shock that we managed to have a sophisticated dinner (i.e. not sitting in front of the telly and not pissed) on Saturday night. Quite a change from the debauchery of the week before!   The Golden Globes were AWESOME. James is a super star for taping them for us and then speeding across the city so that Amy, Kaia and I could get our fix of trashy Hollywood types.  Oh, and for the record Kaia had 18 accurate Golden Globe predictions, I had 15, Amy had 13 and James had 4. Beginners luck Kai - come Oscar night, vengeance will be mine!!!
