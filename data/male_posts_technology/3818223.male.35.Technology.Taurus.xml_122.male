I mean that in a good way. Blark: The demon who lives in my sock drawer, you have driven me to my greatest heights and lowest canyons. Fortunately you only exist inside my head, so I can safely say you suck.  urlLink Connie : My muse, without whom I would have never blogged in the first place. I'll leave it up to you to decide whether or not that's a good thing. Grant:  you are my god, all-knowing without ever being exasperating or preaching about the coming of the Giant Atomic Chickens - oh, wait.  That's me.  Nevermind.  urlLink Heidi : Colorful without color, normal but never boring. Rock On!  urlLink Lor : Funny despite (or because of) your rapid mood swings, you leave me in awe of your artistic capability. May you never go offline.  If I have offended anyone, it's because  urlLink somebody  knocked me unconscious and posted in my stead.
