Why should we have to worry about the opinion of the   rest of the world when the only groups that should be   concerned with our decision making is the groups we   affect directly?    I say Screw the U.N. and all the pandering leftist   whiners in LA and New York. That being said they have   the right to free speech. (If the founders had seen   this coming...)  If we are going to have an impact on terror - how can   we play by rules that our enemy doesn't play by?    The Geneva convention doesn't even apply in this case   because A: they are NOT soldiers, and B: The Geneva   Convention only applies to those countries that have   signed it. (Al Qaida is NOT a country)  It also applies to prisoners of war - but I've known   of Fraternity hazings worse that what those people   went through.  (I know-I know, but just because they didn't want you   there and you knew you didn't belong doesn't mean you   should whine and get a legal precedent to suppress   the decades of cameraderie and tradition inherent in   the hazing-initiation process - get a clue and get   over it)  Just because you don't like something   doesn't mean its wrong.    As an aside here I can assure you that many things   you liberals like ARE wrong.  But you don't   understand morals either... tsk tsk tsk... Poor Bill   had to sleep on the couch for 2 whole months...
