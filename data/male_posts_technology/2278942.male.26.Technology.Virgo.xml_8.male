Vendors offer all sorts, shapes and sizes of fish, each one claiming their own superiority over the other, haggling fiercely to get a share of the pie. Here are my observations and titbits on fish... the irony is that I am a vegetarian. No one better than an outsider to give you a different perspective! The time has come to strictly fragment the software industry into the programming and the engineering industry. Everybody claims to be an expert in their areas. I strictly believe on concentrating on the basics. Why keep going round and round in circles? Whatever I learn today will anyway become obsolete tomorrow. Instead, some basic concepts always remain the same, those are the things to concentrate on. The rest can be interpolated on at a given time. In this blog I will mostly concentrate on the things that need to be investigated from time to time and then forget over time, since something else would have replaced it. However, I may, occasionally, touch upon topics that are invariant.
