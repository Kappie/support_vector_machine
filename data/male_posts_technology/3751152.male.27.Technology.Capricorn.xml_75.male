Anyway, I did a short list of ten questions from some sort of fun icebreaker things we do at meetings every now and then. Handy for those times when you don't really have anything to blog about :) You lot can answer them, or not, it doesn't matter. It's all in fun :)   Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).   Well I grabbed a quarter from 1998 which is easy for me :) That’s the year my daughter and I spent in Engerland. I worked for a Nazi who owned a pub/B in Little Hampden called The Rising Sun and we lived above the pub with the rest of the staff. Mondays in London were great :)   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?   I end up thinking of reality tv because I watch a couple of them. Survivor when it’s on, and right now I’m kind of hooked on Blow Out on Bravo.   What is the most honest thing you have done?    I have done the ‘return the wallet with all the money still intact’ thing.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?   Depends on where I am. If I’m at work or something, I’d probably blog somewhere. If I’m waiting for an appointment, I’ve got a book. If I’m at home, I’d probably read there as well. Or play Spider solitaire on the comp.   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?   Easy. My fecking computer.   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?   For a cause or something? I don’t know if I believe in anything that strongly. I’d be more apt to lay down my life for my family.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?   Mine would say ‘Byeee’ or maybe ‘WTF?’ or something silly.   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?   Carrottop should be shot on site and never allowed to make another ad for 1800-CALL-ATT.   What was your first job?   I was an ice cream girl at one of those old-fashioned soda fountains on Cannery Row, in Monterey :) I could make 3 or 4 shakes, whip out a Fudgebana Split and throw an orgy together at the same time. They still talk of me down there. The legend that was Stephanie.   Finish the sentence: “I have never…”  I have never, ever seen a single episode of the following: Baywatch, Melrose Place, The OC, The Apprentice, CSI-Anywhere, or Alias.
