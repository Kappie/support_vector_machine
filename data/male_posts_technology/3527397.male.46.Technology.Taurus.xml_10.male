I love the way liberals have been sitting on their hands re: Reagan. It has too be killing them to be civil, certainly not a normal state of affairs for this bunch.  The "experts" now say dogs can understand words. Gee tell us dog lovers something we didn't know. And we are supposed to believe that global warming exists? HAHAHA! Nice try, I think I will go out and murder a tree today :)
