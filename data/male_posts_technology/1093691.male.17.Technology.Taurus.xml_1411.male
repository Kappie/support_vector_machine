Just one question for you all today, how is it fair that your best friends are the people who can hurt you the most? and why is it that their mums always need you to go and fix their computers? and finally what do you say to someone who has been given a month to live?  They are three questions i asked myself yesterday, hope your all having fun, see you soon. Dave
