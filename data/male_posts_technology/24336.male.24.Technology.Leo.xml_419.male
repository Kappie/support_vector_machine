Without this box, no internet.   While we were waiting for it to reboot, I was thinking of things to do.  "Oh, go to www.somesite.com."  "Uh...".   D'oh, right, no internet access.     Just today, I had to restart my web proxy.  "What can I do while I wait for the web proxy?  Ah, go to slashdot!"  Uh... Right, again, no internet access.  Is it a bad sign when you just assume that you have a 24/7 broadband connection?
