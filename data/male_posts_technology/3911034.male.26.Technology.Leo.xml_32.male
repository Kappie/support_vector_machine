Seinfeld (Always makes me laugh no matter how many times i see it) 4. Just Shoot Me (Should just be called "Finch") 5. Rove (Peter Helliar under cover Australian Idol audition was cool) 6. Will  Grace (My kingdom for Karen Walker) 7. Star Trek: Voyager (7 of 9 can assimilate me, she is a bit man-size though) 8. Inner Space (I'm possessed!) 9. Edward Scissorhands (Tim Burton is a bit of a fiend) 10. Arsenal Stadium Mystery (Good show old chaps! Not bad for the 1930s.)
