Anyways, I wonder when they are going to announce the job. I hope I get it. Hoping, hoping, hoping. I would love to go somewhere new.  Hey... if Janet calls you maybe we can go out with her on Sunday. Or maybe Saturday night... but I'll have to freshen and change my clothes, cause I am sure I will be stinky by the end of the day. Oh, maybe we can go to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles for a late lunch after our Downtown trip.    :)   Yummmmy  I want to work in the back yard, Edgar. I loooove the backyard. I can't wait for the pool guy to come on Friday. Then on the weekend we can really get started on the area around the pool. Oh, do you know my parents will be building a sandbox. Isn't that cute. It's gonna be next to the doll house. And I can't wait to fix the doll house. It's gonna be so much fun. I also can't wait to have a BBQ. It will be so coooool. You should help us Edgar. Oh, do you know what else I did on Sunday?? It is soooo Father of the Bride moment. I carved my parents and mine and Meryl's initials in the tree in the back. It is facing the new patio. It's so cute. I have LD and MD with a heart. (that's mom and dad) Then I have LD and MD below.. that is Meryl and I. We have the same initials. I asked my mom if I could put your initials too, but she said not yet. Haha... what if I don't marry you. j/k Then I said well, we will have to chop the tree down then. Haha!! I know in my heart that we will be carving your initials next to mine. I can't wait :)
