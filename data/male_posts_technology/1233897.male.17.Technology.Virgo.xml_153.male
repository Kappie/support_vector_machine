I’m glad I did rush since, even with her dad getting lost for 15 minutes, (lol) I was still a little late getting out to the car.   Once I finally got out, my mom drove us an hour-an-a-half down to OSU (Oregon State) in Corvallis. We were they that day and today for the Mid-Summer Conference - part of our apprenticeships through ASE (Apprenticeships in Science and Engineering), and division of Saturday Academy. We got down there, signed in, ate a continental breakfast and hung out for a while, all before the orientation session at 9 o’clock. After that, all 150 of us apprentices there split up into groups of about 15 and played some really random get-to-know-you games together for a while. Then, we had the first of several lectures that day (we picked the ones we wanted to attend beforehand), ate lunch, and had a couple more lectures and a hands-on workshop. Dinner was fun - the café that we ate in was sweet.   After dinner, we split up into 20 groups at the MU Quad and set about “defying gravity” by building 2 meter tall towers out of nothing but newspaper, a tiny bit of tape and a predetermined random object. The tower had to support itself in the wind, suspending a marble from it, for a minimum of ten seconds. Awards were given to the two teams who built the most complex tower, and the cheapest tower. My group won the first title and Laurie’s won the second (lol)  Later that night, my little group of friends (Laurie, and some random people we had just met from Lakeview – Wade and Kate, and other people) went swimming. The pools at OSU are sweet. :)  They consisted of a huge diving pool, Olympic-size relay pool and a mammoth hot tub. Twas quite fun. After I got out, I spent like ten minutes in a frikin’ hot sauna drying off. As we were walking back, Wade and some random girl decided to run through some random sprinklers for a while, and while they were doing so, others informed me about some really funny senior pranks they pull at their school. (This was almost 9:45 at night, and it had finally cooled down from 85 to around 75.)   Once I got back to the dorm, I changed and walked back down to the MU (the under-story of which is a pool hall / bowling alley / mini theater place. I left shortly thereafter, because of the heat. (I met Laurie walking back from it as I walked to it and she warned me that it was hot in there, but did I listen? ... no – lol) Later, close to 10:45 or 11:00 I grabbed a couple pop tarts and watched part of Monty Python and the Holy Grail before getting back up to my room. My roommates and I didn’t get to sleep for what must have been a couple hours, partly because of the heat, and partly because of random logic and word problems we kept giving each other... like: what’s the only word in the English language who’s pronunciation and meaning are both changed by capitalizing the first letter? polish >> Polish (interesting, huh?).  ‘Ne way, I got up this morning around 7:00 instead of 6:00 and decided to forgo a shower for the day. I packed all my luggage and turned in my room key (but not my food card, which I needed for dinner the night before and breakfast later that morning). I had cereal for breakfast...yum.   Right after breakfast, we took group pictures on the steps of the MU (We were commenting that we all felt like a combination of a junior MENSA, FFA and some major communist party, 150 of us intellectual teenagers, walking down the streets of a major college, all wearing the same light blue shirt. We took several pictures, and I realized later that photographer in front of us didn’t have the only camera trained on us: There’s a live webcam on the building the Quad from us that was recording a time-lapse video that I dled, and am working on extracting an image from. Once I do so, I’ll post it.   The next lecture was the only one Laurie and I had in common. Sooo... um... *how to say?* boring. The next one for me was worse, actually, but the last hands-on one was SO fun. It was so random; was on automatic data storage and collection. At one point, one of the students needed a hand-held barcode scanner, across the room, so an instructor picked one up and threw it to him. I though that was strange and asked him, “Umm... how much are those worth?” He replied calmly “Oh, about 55 hundred a piece”. Later, when I asked him why he was just throwing 5 grand pieces of equipment around haphazardly, he responded by picking up another one, and throwing across the room. Turns out the scanners are the best on the market... insured for up to a 12 foot drop onto concrete (lol).  We had lunch on the Quad (like the yesterday) and I called Bwitty, and actually got a hold of her for the first time in months! (An accomplishment, I feel.) Laurie ended up talking to her for like, twenty times longer than I did.   Anyway, later there was a final meeting, during which my mom showed up and told me to step outside quickly and call my dad since he was putting a down payment on what was going to be my new car. *yay* Later, we drove back home, Laurie got picked up at my house, and I drove the van for the first time, by myself, to the theater to see LXG (League of Extraordinary Gentlemen).  Man, I spent so much time with Laurie over the last two days. Every break, every meal, we were together, talking or something. She’s a cool girl and I’d never really gotten to know her that well. Altogether, the Conference was an awesome time.
