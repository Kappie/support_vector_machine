I'll be racing in the Sprint Distance (1/4 mi swim, 12.4 mi bike and 2 mi run) event as this will be my first triathlon.  This race looks to be a good gentle introduction to the sport. It's a pretty short race and the  urlLink tri-california  folks are offering  urlLink clinics  to ensure that all the participants are well prepared.    To help in my preparation, I'm gonna head over to Pacific Grove this weekend a test the waters. Pun intended. Oh, and I've read an old race report from 1995 that covers the  urlLink swim , urlLink bike  and  urlLink run . Really good read. Looks like I need to learn the Kelp Krawl.
