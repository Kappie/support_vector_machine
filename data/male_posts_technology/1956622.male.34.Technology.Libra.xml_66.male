She and I went out and ran some errands which included a trip to the toy store where she picked up a couple of new toys.  We spent about 1.5 hours in the pool together and were having a great time.  When we decided to take a break Brad  Amy showed up and and Karissa was right back in the pool with Amy and their 2 boys.  So all in all Karissa spent about 3 hours in the pool.    After they left Rick started in on cookies which Karissa graciously helped with.  I cooked Karissa some dinner and afterward she sat down with me to watch American Chopper.  She liked that show she said but fell asleep from all the activity today in my arms.  I carried her to bed!  Instead of waiting for   SFW   to call I made the effort and called her!  I let Karissa talk to her about anything she wanted.  Of course Karissa got to talk to Jon and stuff to and that kind of rubbed me the wrong way but I did not let that show!    SFW   called back after Karissa hung up to have me get her W2 for her along with Karissa's birth certificate.  I told her I would look around but I was not sure if I had that stuff.  Bottom line is I will look for it when I am good and ready to do so!
