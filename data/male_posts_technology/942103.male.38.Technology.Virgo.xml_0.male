Which is why I'm going out this year as a cynical and curmudgeonly system administrator who dreams of telling his users to stick it in their PCI slot.  (If you're not a sys admin, trust me; that one's a hoot.)  Then there's my friend, Eric.  He's an interesting guy.  For very complex values of interesting.   We worked together for a while at a network operations center.  Eric was midnights, I was day side.  We didn't see much of each other when we first started working there and he got some bad advice about me implying I wasn't someone he wanted to associate with.  Ironically, the person he got the advice from was actually someone that no one wants to associate with.  Anyway, Eric and I discovered we had all sorts of interesting aspects of life and personality in common and have become pretty good friends.    Anyway, he made a comment with a vaguely boogerish tone to me today on ICQ that I wanted to share:   Eric (2:29 PM) :  It's all green and slimey and at body temperature, waiting for you.   Eric is gaining a reputation for being quoted in blogs, it would appear.
