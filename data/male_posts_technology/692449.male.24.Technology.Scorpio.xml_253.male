I am currently rereading the Tao of Pooh and the book is definitly is helping to stop the hate that builds up inside. I'd like to be more upbeat but it is really hard to when shitty things keep happening. I need a vacation I need to go somewhere where I don't know anyone and wander about for a couple weeks looking at art and doing improving myself.
