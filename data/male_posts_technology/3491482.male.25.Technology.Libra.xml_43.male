Sunnis and Shiites have a long history of brutal violence against one another,  urlLink that continues today .  One interesting consequence of Saddam's removal is that Iraq now stands poised to become a Shiite-goverened nation, right next-door to Shiite-fundamentalist-goverened Iran.  So it appears that Iran and Iraq, who recently squandered the lives of several hundred thousand of their young men in a protracted war that gained neither party anything, will soon become Shiite allies surrounded by a sea of Sunnis.  If nothing else, this will give extremists from both camps of the Sunni/Shiite divide something other than Israel and The Great Satan to focus their energies on.  I predict a long period of disquiet.  Okay, make that a long extension to the long period of disquiet already seen by in the region.
