It's great meeting all kinds of new people, but everyone goes different directions and after you meet some people out here, have some laughs with them, trade some stories, you have to say goodbye, and it always sucks, wish you could take all the good people, put em in a jar and cary them all around.  I miss traveling already, fortunately traveling to other islands out here is quite easy and I have friends on other islands now too.  But always on the move, meeting different people all the time, seeing new things, learning new things, it's really an experience all to itself.  I wish that everyone would save up for a year or two and then go traveling around for a few months where ever they want and meet people, but get outta the states, go to Europe or Australia and New Zealand, lots of that going on over here, and it's just great to hear about, I fully expect it to be just a matter of time before I head out there, even just for a vacation.
