I have included my own blog in this list, to make sure that I am successfully doing the syndication feed. One result of this is that I will occasionally stumble on one of my own posts, and begin to get a strange deja vu feeling. In the next instant, I realize I am the author of the post. What follows that moment is similar to what happens when you walk into a room and are suddenly facing yourself in the mirror. I look for a moment, consider the synchronized movement, and then look away.
