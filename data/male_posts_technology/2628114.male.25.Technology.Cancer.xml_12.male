Having to stop and walk is beginning to bug me since I feel like I should be running the whole time.  It makes me cry a little, but I usually find a little old lady to mug and/or beat up and I'm fine.  I am beginning to realize my Monday runs will probably consistently be the hardest.  My body did not want to get up today and when it finally did, I realized I am still a little sore from the Saturday 50.  Also, I really wish the wind would shift since I have been forced to run down into Eden Park every day which is nothing more than hilly treachery.  Speaking of wind, why the heck is it that I can be running northeast into the wind when the wind is coming out the southwest?!  Needless to say, I was fighting the wind for about 80% of the run today regardless of which direction I ran.  Once my legs got warmed up they felt great throughout the run.  It was the rest of my body that forced me to stop and walk up some of the more treacherous hills of Eden Park and the surrounding area.  I was able to run the extra three minutes I lost when I stopped to walk, but that poor, old lady is probably still lying on the sidewalk.  :)
