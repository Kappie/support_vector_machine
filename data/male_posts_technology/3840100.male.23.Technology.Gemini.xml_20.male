On top of that there are other little tiny things in my daily life which are really pissing me off. Other than that everything is great!!!     I've completed close to 3 of the songs now. I'm sure by tomorrow the number will be 3 total. I'm heading to bed I need to get some sleep. I'm sure I'll have another update for you tomorrow.
