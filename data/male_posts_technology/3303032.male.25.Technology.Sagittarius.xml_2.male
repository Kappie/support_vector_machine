I'll use it in a sentence.  "John Kerry cares not only for the plight of the 'haves and have-mores' like President Bush, but he also cares for the well-being of hardworking Americans."  Lemme tell you something.  "Hardworking Americans" really means "poor people."  John Kerry (rich dude, who I'm voting for BTW) cares just as much about poor folks as he does rich folks.  Wow.  Thanks for that insight.    I was in the kitchen when I heard the phrase, and immediately yelled in "That's bullshit.  Show me an American that's not hardworking!  They're fucking everywhere.  They're EVERYONE!  We're ALL hardworking Americans!  Show me someone who's not a hardworking American!"  Dave, my roommate, who was in the living room, raised his hand.  Poor Dave, you've gotta love him.  He has Raisinets for balls, but at least he knows his plight.  I damn near spilled my icewater when I came in the living room and saw him with his hand up.    "Well yeah, except you, show me an American who's not hardworking!"    That's what I love about politicians.  They can basically say "Fuck you" and say it in such a way so that almost everyone doesn't even realize what's going on.    Just remember, anytime you hear one of these political scumfucks talking about "Hardworking Americans" they're setting you up, getting ready to tell you how they're going to use the "Ron Jeremy Model" dildoe on ya.
