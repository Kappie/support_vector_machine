There now are probably 10 or more books, along with dozens of articles that provide insight into how J2EE applications should be written. In fact, there are so many resources, often with contradictory recommendations, navigating the maze has become an obstacle to adopting J2EE itself. To provide some simple guidance for customers entering this maze, IBM set out to compile the following 'top 10' list of what they feel are the most important best practices for J2EE. Unfortunately, 10 was not enough to capture everything that needed to be said, especially when you consider Web services development as a part of J2EE. Thus, in honor of the growth of J2EE, they have decided to make our 'top 10' list a 'top 12' list instead.   [Resource-Type: Tips; Category: Java/J2EE; Level: ADV; XRating: 5]
