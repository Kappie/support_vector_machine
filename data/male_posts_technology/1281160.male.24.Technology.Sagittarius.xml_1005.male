Once the page is loaded, you might find that the right side bar has a lot of padding. Just move you mouse over any link on the page. The extra padding disappears.   When I checked, this particular behaviour appears only in Internet Explorer. In Firefox, the website appears normal. Anyone else having such problem, send me a screenshot and the browser version you are using. If possible, send the screen resolution also.   Bye,  P.S. Bala, you left out Russia. There are more millionaires in Russia than Hong Kong, when compared to to ecomoic scenario prevailing in the country. (Compare thier GDPs)
