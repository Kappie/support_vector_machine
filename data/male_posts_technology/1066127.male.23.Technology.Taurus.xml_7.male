I've had all these great ideas for things that I could do to my site now, to make it more interesting, and also things that wouldn't (hopefully) need more work from me. :) It should be interesting seing in a few weeks or so, how things end up progressing, and what we end up with. I was just thinking that I'll probably end up setting up a similar site for ROTC or something along those lines.
