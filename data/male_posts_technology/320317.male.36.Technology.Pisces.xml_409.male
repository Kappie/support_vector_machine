Whether because of a declining level in customer service or the ease of publishing on the Internet, hundreds--if not thousands--of dissatisfied customers have taken their complaints public, giving birth to a new form: The Corporate Complaint Web site."

 Nothing like a grudge. These people need to let it go, and move on with their lives. I understand standing up for what you believe in, but these sites seem more like an unhealthy obsession, although I did find them entertaining for a brief moment.
