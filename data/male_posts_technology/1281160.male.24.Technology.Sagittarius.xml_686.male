There is an link called "edit" next to the post details in Blogger. You can click on it to load the post and then edit it as you like.   Your admin rights allow you to change the posts of others if you want to.    BTW the past week, I am receiving a  CD  everyday. It started with a  urlLink Windows 2003 Server  evaluation copy. A few days later, a copy of  MS   urlLink Speech Server   SDK  and a  DVD  of  urlLink Visual Studio.net 2003 . Yesterday, a copy of  urlLink Sun's latest desktop , codename "Mad Hatter", arrived. And today, a copy of  urlLink Bullfighter , a software application. The coming week is surely going to be very busy with these things.  I have also updated " urlLink Quod scripsi, scripsi " after a month's gap. If you wish, you can leave your comments on that blog.
