It gives Australia, Australian politicians and the public a good rebuke.  However, in todays paper, Michael Scammell,  a former media officer for the US consulate in Melbourne takes issue with this in The Age artcile  urlLink The real corrupters of democracy? The media , trying to point the finger at the media as the source of the corruption of democracy.  My view: It's only with a free and open media that we can have true democracy and "keep the bastards honest".   That brings up my next (soon) blog entry. Channel 9 is owned by Kerry Packer, and the respected "Sunday' show did a hatchet Job on Mark Latham on Sunday. There is a huge amount of muck raking at present. Most of it is coming from the non-indpendent media who have taken 'sides' and are out to influence our opinions.  "The Australian", "Hearld Sun", news.com.au. - News Corp (Rupert Murdoch)  Channel 9, ninemsn.com.au - Kerry Packer  Fairfax publish the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald, and seem to be free of their owner's opinions.
