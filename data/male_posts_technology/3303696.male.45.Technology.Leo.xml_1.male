That's assuming, of course, that he is aware of all that has past since he did way back in July, 1968.  I was just 9, going on 10 when he died.    Not many memories left, and those that are well, they aren't all that pleasant.  Dad's unpleasant influencial input, that was lost at his passing, is probably more of an issue concerning what I have gained rather than what was lost.  However, the whole "would he or wouldn't he" subject is all rather curious, based on the fact that any opinion generated about his fatherly support is more subjective than objective, since there is so little history to go on.  But still, I can't help wondering if he would be proud of his son today, maybe a bit supportive, possibly even somewhat excited that we finally had a chance to catch up.  He could offer his apologies for his failures and abuses, he could tell me that he loved me for the first time... we might even get a chance to toss a few baseball, you know, the Field of Dreams scenario.  I truly want to believe that version.  It's a happy ending kind of meeting, kinda adds reason and understanding to the whole missing relationship.  Fills in the gaps generated from the "God works in mysterious ways" dateline.  The Realist part of me tends to be quite a bit more pessimistic.  No gratitude, no apologies, no ball tossing... just more verbal abuse.  That would be a tough pill to swallow...  There's an old Mike saying... With life comes life's mistakes, with death comes understanding.  I think I will work on the first version... I have never been one who swallowed pills easily.
