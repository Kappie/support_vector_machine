My teacher assigned me a book called "the haymeadow" It should be called "the valley of doom." It is the worst book i have ever read. The story is about a teen guy that has to take his 6 thousand! sheep to this place of doom also called the haymeadow. The first day, all hell breaks loose and a sheep is killed, and he gets skunked and then there is a flash flood, It destroys his trailer and everything he has left.......then a bear comes....then some more sheep die.......the end.
