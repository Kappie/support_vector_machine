You can just put in the info of a Hollywood film you've always dreamt of making,  i.e. the title, the actors, the director, the budget, etc.  and the BOO (Box Office Oracle) will tell you exactly how much money your film will make or whether your film stands a chance at the Oscars. It also predicts which critics will gush over your film and which ones will skewer it!  Sounds like cool fun! :-)  I tried my hand at it and this is what I got...
