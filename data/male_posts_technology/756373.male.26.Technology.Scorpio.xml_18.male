Or something. So instead, I shall blather on about my meaningless life. It was a long weekend for me. Yesterday was supposed to have been off. It was supposed to have been spent drenching myself in cinema-marathon bliss. Instead, I was drafted into manual labour.  Manual labour , ffs! The humanity. So today I am sunburnt, grumpy, have sore back muscles and I just want to go home and watch Scrubs, instead of trying to think up creative ways to waste time until 5 o clock. And to think, this is how I spend my life, trying to KILL time. It's so precious, and yet so many of us don't realise that. So, I have made up my mind. Yes, just now as I was typing this. In about a year's time, I am going to quit my job and persue further , full-time education. I'll save up, pay off my debts (car, loan and a few others). And if it means I have to live on the good graces of others like my folks again, so be it. You only get one shot at life, and you should spend it doing something you enjoy instead of wasting it by killing time. Journalism degree, here I come...
