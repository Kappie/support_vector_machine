I shared a car with another CA employee who I didn't recognize even though he was wearing a 10 year anniversary watch.  The controller at the car company told me that he was a "big shot" at our company, but I've never heard of him.  Oh well.
 
 I got through security at the airport okay.  It's much easier when all you wear is a shirt, a pair of shorts, and flip-flops.  I chose not to go with heavy clothing despite the nip in the air.  I remember the 114 degree oven that I encountered the last time I arrived in Vegas.
 
 I picked up a cup of coffee and a muffin first thing once I got through security.  I then promptly spilled a third of the coffee on my table.  I was quick on my feet though, so I didn't scald myself.  That's me in a nut shell -- a klutz with a pension for moving quickly when necessary.  A guy saw my predicament and helped me clean it up.  Nice guy.  I read that Song airlines is giving away free tickets to people who are nice to other passengers.  Too bad he was flying the wrong airline.
 
  "How's that working out for you?" 
  "What?" 
  "Being nice."
