Drunk driving accidents are one of the most, if not  THE  most avoidable types out there. For whatever reason, that's not enough to get people to stop drinking and driving.  Of all the sheer lunacy out there these days, this is one of the biggest - in my book.  I'm just tired of reading about the dead jogger, dead teen, dead pet, dead tourist - all because someone didn't think it was a big deal to drink and drive.  p.s. Kate Nolan is the VP of the  urlLink Dane County chapter of MADD .
