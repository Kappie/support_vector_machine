Tried shaving my stomach in an upwards direction the other day and I have to say it leaves me feeling a lot smoother but really hurts more getting it done.  It's a pity waxing doesn't seem to work on me and I still can't find anywhere that will do laser "down there". I may try getting the laser on mah belly and stick to shaving the undercarriage but ideally I wanna throw the razor in the damn bin.  Immac is pretty good but I have to wait 10 damn minutes like a prat with cream coloured stuff all over "the boys" and the crab walk is a real annoyance.  Hmmmm. Maybe I am getting a bit too discriptive... Ah well :)  Again if anyone knows a place in Ireland that will do permanent hair removal in sensitive areas let me know :)
