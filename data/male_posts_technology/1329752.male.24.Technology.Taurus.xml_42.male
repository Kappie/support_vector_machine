Yet I can presume that perfection is just an excuse from a harsh kind of living that we encounter everyday in life where in reality, there isn’t really no perfection at all. A perfect day for me needs not to lie within the borders of material things. Since we are equating the term perfect with a positive value, we are also aiming to happiness that we can’t find with tangible objects. For me, it’s not what I do have and what I’ll be having.  It’s within what happened this day and made my day perfect. Thus, we value memories and not dates of when and what happened. It’s the simplicity of life that makes my day perfect. Nothing can beat up the experienced of sharing quality time with the person you value. And because that person to you is special, you tend to light up mentally and spiritually like thousand of bulbs beyond an abyss of darkness. Though the physical body is tired and restless, with this kind of emotional adrenalin almost anything is alive and kicking, leading to perfection. With this kind of experience nothing is needed except for the time and exchange of thoughts. I guess all of us humans will definitely agree to me with this kind of conclusion right?"    i wrote this last april for my friend's assignment. naalala ko lang...
