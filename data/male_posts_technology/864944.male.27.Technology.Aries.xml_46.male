Unfortunatly during the party, we lost an electric circuit and because of that we have had an electrician in to repair it, as well as identify all the other hidden evil that was lurking in our walls.  It turns out there was quite a bit.  So now we're having a bunch of repairs and upgrades done.  Welcome to Home Ownership :)   At any rate, those are going well.  In other news, I also started up a new blog with some friends of mine that is concentrating specifically on games and game news.  Stop on by  urlLink http://www.monkeygames.org .  Guess thats it for now.  Hope everyone is doing well!
