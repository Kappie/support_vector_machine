We are all traders in life,we are traders in virtue,we are traders in religion , and alas! we are also traders in Love.  ....  We get caught. How ? Not by what we give, but what we expect. We get misery in return for our love ; not from the fact that we love, but from the fact that we want love in return.  There is no mysery when there is no want.Desire , want is the father of all mysery.  Desires are bound by the laws of success and failures.Desires must bring mysery.  The great secret of true secret, of true happiness, then is this. The man who asks for no returns, the perfectly unselfish man , he is the most successful.  Ask nothing ; want nothing in return. Give what you have to give ; it will come back to you, but do not think of it now, it will come back multiplied a thousandfold.But the attention must not be on that.Yet have the power to give ; give and there it ends. Learn that the whole of life is giving, that nature will force you to give, so give willingly.Sooner or later you'll have to give up.You come into life to accumulate, with clinched hands you want to take.   You are a machine for talking and giving : you take in order to give. Ask, therefore, nothing in return ; but the more you give the more will come to you.  The quicker you can empty the air out of this room, the quicker it will be filled with  external air; and if you close all the doors and apertures, that which is within will remain but that which is outside will never come in, and which is within will stagnate , degenerate and become poison.   Be therefore not a begger; be unattached !
