Five memory card formats survived being boiled, trampled, washed and dunked in coffee or cola.  Sounds to me the way to go with storing digital media is to use large capacity flash memory.   I now have all my music on a hard drive, 100 gbs.  Do I get a tape back up? Back up to another hard drive?  If it wsa on flash memory would it last forever?   with a 4 gb gflash mem drive going for around $1500 bucks, its not affordable now.   BUt what about a couple years fom now.   A 20 gb flash drive as a backup?
