Her x-bf was going out with her best friend for like 5 or 6 month before she "accidently" rat them out. "No wonder last Valentines was 3 of us going out together instead of we going out alone!", she proclaimed in anger.  Well, I didn't know exactly how to make her fell less furious about the whole thing.  So after she went on for like 25+ Minutes (I was playing WarCraft while she's complaining), I said "at least now you have found out the truth, start to look for another guy already, he is a total jerk and you can do much better."  But then she said, "If I never find out the truth, I would be much happier and we can all still be good friends with each other. Now I have lost my bf and my best friend in return of the truth, if that's the case, I would rather live a lie."  Because I was still playing Warcraft so I wasn't thinking much about what she said.  Afterall, that was just a super lame story going on everyday around us, people who go out with their best friends and so on... :p  But now I think of it, perhaps hiding the truth away would be for the best in many occasions. What if... she never find out?  Would that lead to a happier ending?  Just something to think of... while I'm drifting mindlessly on Elevator -> Scooter -> Escalator -> Train -> Escalator -> MRT -> Escalator -> Bus -> Elevator to office everyday.  And reverse the above routine while going back home...  Oh yeah, I had her permission to post it here, since none of you who read this knows her... maybe ...  Anyways... it's no biggie... She's a happy girl and I'm sure she'll be able to walk out of it in no time.  On the other hand, in many ways, I wish I can be as tough as she is...
