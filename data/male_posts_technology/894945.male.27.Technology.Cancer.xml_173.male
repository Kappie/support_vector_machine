I was out on the town with my friend Frank, when we bumped in to an old acquaintance of mine. I was a bit drunk and tried to start a conversation with him. He started trash talking at me and telling me that me and my brother are slimy backstabbing scum. I was taken off guard by this as I thought we where friends! I asked him for an example as I could think of nothing I had wronged him by. He reminded me of a time 5 years ago when we had a small disagreement.  I was out on a work drinks night and the person in question had just started dating one of my work colleagues (but they had only been going out for like 5 days) We where sat in the cafe du Paris drinking and joking around when (I'm not sure how it occurred) I started giving the said girl a shoulder massage, nothing over the top just a joke around.. Well this guy found it very insulting and pulled me aside for a chat!!  He was all in my face asking how I would like it if the roles where reversed.  I said.. "Gee mate it was like 5 years ago and not really a big deal at the time"  Well the only reason I didn't get my head kicked in by him this Friday was due to Frank the Kick boxer being there. But thanks mate - I have had a good laugh over how pathetic it all was it really made my weekend.
