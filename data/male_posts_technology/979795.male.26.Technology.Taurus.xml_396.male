I can't remember which one it was, but the main thing I remembered was NOT the technique, instead it was when we chose to step forward and back. Realised after being shown a technique, we'd photocopy and reproduce the same thing right down to the footwork, hand movement, etc.  Syed tried to explain why we moved back and forward. Depends on Uke's timing, speed of attack, etc. He told us the words above. Something I've spent a few nights dwelling on. I have limited understanding of the words as I try and try to place them into context when it comes to my training. Change the scenario, and I feel lost. Change the technique, the same happens.  "How" can I train with understanding... when do I ask the 'right' questions... what are the 'right' questions to ask to achieve this?
