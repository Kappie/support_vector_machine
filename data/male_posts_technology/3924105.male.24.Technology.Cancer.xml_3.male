Little dancing flames swing their hips back and forth, below. Slower now, the tempo dissipates, in armlock, little cartoon flames, swinging around one another. The clarity of the moment, so soothingly grappling yet intense within the moment. Ambient reality, so dormant with startling abruption. Light flicks of tickling notes, floating one into a warm oblivion.
