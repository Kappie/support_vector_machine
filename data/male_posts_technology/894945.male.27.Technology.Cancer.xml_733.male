But really people, it isn't my fault, two years ago I was walking down a dark St.Ouen road during a full moon and this great slavernous Weremare jumped out over a fence and bit me on the arm, I haven't been the same since that day!   So remember, if your walking down a dark road during a full moon, be very cautious, because you never know if I am there....     waiting....    watching...     getting ready to pounce!!!   You have been warned.....   Baity signing off.....
