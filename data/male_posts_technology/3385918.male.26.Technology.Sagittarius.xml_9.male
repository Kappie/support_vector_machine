One was "Plan of Attack" by Bob Woodward and the other was "Against all Enemies". I had not bough mom a gift for mother's day. Now, don't call me a bad son just yet. On that day I took her to the movies and out to eat to an expensive restaurant. Still, I wanted to get her something else. So, when I saw those books I remembered my mom saying a while back that she was very interested in reading them. Couldn't decide which one to buy, so I took them both.   Yesterday, I stopped by my mom's house during my lunch break and after I took to Se√±orial Plaza Mall the two defective DVDs I bought the other week (which, btw, the replacement disks they gave me are working fine, but I haven't had the chance to completely test them out). She was thrilled at the gift. That made me very happy. =;-D  She told me that she was going to read them after the finished reading the book she is currently on. It's called "Mayada" by Jean Sasson. Mom gave me an overview of this book and I must say that it sounds very interesting. The book is about the horrors of Saddam Husein's reign of terror in Iraq as seen through the eyes of an Iraqi woman who is subject to a whole mess of tortures and humiliations.   I told my mom to lend me the book after she finishes it. I also asked her to lend me the book "Stupid White Men" by Michael Moore. Been told that it's a great. She didn't have it on hand, so she will look for it and give it to me another day.  Last two books I've read are "Black Hawk Down" (great book, better than the movie, even taught I love that movie !!!) and the fifth Harry Potter book (also a good book, but the fourth one is still the best).
