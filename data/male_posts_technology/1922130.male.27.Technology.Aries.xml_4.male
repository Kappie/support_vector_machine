For those of you who don't know, I just finished the evening MBA program at Wake Forest University.  It was at a fancy shmancy country club near the campus and was the best graduation ceremony I've ever been to for four reasons:  1.  Open Bar 2.  Free dinner 3.  No gowns or tassels 4.  Low sappy go forth and prosper content 5.  It was for me!  That was five reasons, but I'm not in school anymore so I don't care.  A bunch of my fellow graduates and I went out to the Dback grill afterwards to continue the celebration....and then to another place after that (don't know the name).   It got a little ugly, one of the drunken graduates requested "Holiday" about 50 times from the bartender/DJ and proceeded to dance on a pool table, hump a pool table, and attempt to hump other drunken graduates until he was kneed in the groin by yours truly.  I think he paid for my beer in the end so I guess he's not holding any grudges.   Overall it was a great night and I hope I am able to keep in touch with my former classmates.    Saturday:  Wake Forest vs. Purdue football game I've been helping out this dude at work (for those of you who don't know, I also work at Wake Forest University) who works in the athletics department with some network problems he's been having.  He hooked me up with some free tickets to the football game, so Ali and I went to that.  It was hot as blazes in the stands, we both got sunburned, and the Deacs played poorly.  After picking up a bowl victory last post season, beating BC at BC and then knocking off the #11 ranked Wolfpack to become the 20th ranked team in the nation, I thought Coach Grobe was money.    The play calling against Purdue changed my opinion.   The run game wasn't working at all, so to fix the problem they ran the ball some more...even though Wake has proven it can be dangerous through the air.  The most egregious error had to be a late 4th quarter 4th and 1 in the red zone.....you guessed it - a run play -  I think it was supposed to be an end around but never quite got around.  It cost them the possession and any shot at the game.    There was a graduation party at one of my classmates house in Greensboro Saturday night.  It was a nice party...chillin on the deck drinking keg beer and wine and eating all manner of good food.  It was very laid back and we had a great time.    Sunday we went to Carrboro to have dinner with Ali's folks.  It was a birthday celebration as Ali's sister Susie, a sophomore at UNC Chapel Hill, turned 19 recently.   We went to a nice Italian place on Franklin St. in Chapel Hill called 411, I highly recommend it.   Oh, and my fantasy football team won one and lost one taking my team to 1 - 3 so far this year.  Ouch.
