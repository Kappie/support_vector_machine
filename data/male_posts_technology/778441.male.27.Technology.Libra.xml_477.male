Someone or the other usually crawls out of the woodwork in Pakistan and makes these claims everytime an Indian win hurts the interests of the Pakistani team.  Perhaps the idiot did not know that the biggest reason for India's advance into the final was the terrible mis-calculation on the Pakistani team's part when India managed to scramble past 241 in their match against Pakistan. The bonus point that India received in that match was the nail in the Pakistani team's coffin... and not the Indian win against Sri Lanka ( that was just the final straw on the camel's back ).  In any case, its strange to see this player crowing about the ACC and the ICC while Javed Miandad is blaming Pakistan's mis-fortunes on their new coach Bob Woolmer!
