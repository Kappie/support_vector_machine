Let us come back to the topic in hand - my convocation. I am actually inspired by my good friend's blog   urlLink   recursivesindhanai    and decided that I too should have a blog on us obtaining our Post Graduate Diploma in IT degree.     This is more on the people with whom I have spent 2 wonderful years and how they have influenced me. This is more of a tribute to them.     In IIITB (Indian Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore) I not only learnt the academic syllabus, but also the art of learning on my own and continue learning. This is largely due my peers. They helped me gain a footing in the field of IT.     Many of them have ended up with grades which mislead their intelligence and knowledge. There way of thinking, their attitude (both towards life and academics) were simply stunning and awe filled.     My friend   urlLink   enkirukkal    has got a great thinking mind and was even feliciatated for his work on a   tamil search engine  . Another great person was a silent genius.   urlLink   Wisiwug    was a great coder and wonderful at analysing.  urlLink   Recursivesindhanai    is a great logical thinker.     Every individual who studied with me had some great aspect or the other. Each had his own strength. Some were hardworking beyond imagination, while some could think so different that they couls solve problems that I had no idea about, some were intelligent, while some inherited some of all these attributes. This is too small a place to list eveyone and enumerate his strengths.    It was a great pleasure to study with such good people.
