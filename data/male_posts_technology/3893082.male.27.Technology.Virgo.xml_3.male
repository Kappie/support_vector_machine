I am the one who controls my destiny.      I am the one who controls my fate.      I am the one who loves so many      of the people that I hate.             I am the one who cries.      I am the one who laughs.      I am the one who try's      to make sure that time doesn't last.             I am the one who lives.      I am the one who dies.      I am the one who gives      while all of the others just pry.             I am the one who breaks.      I am the one who bends.      I am the one who waits      while all the others give in.             I am the one who writes.      I am the one who reads.      I and the one who fights      and kicks and screams and bleeds.             I am the one who leaves.      I am the one who stays.      I am the one who believes      that all of the world is fading away.                                     Tom Sapp    Blog at ya'll later...
