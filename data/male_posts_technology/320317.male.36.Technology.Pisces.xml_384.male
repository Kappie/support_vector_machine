 I am not sure what to think about this. Need to see some examples. Unfortunately Macromedia isn't showing any at the moment, except for an executive presentation that really doesn't show me anything, except synchronized video that developers have been doing for over six years. However, check out Macromedia's  urlLink Flash Communication Server MX Application Development Center  to see the presentation. Pretty wordy don't you think.
