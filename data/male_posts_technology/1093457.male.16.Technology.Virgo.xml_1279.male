When the school play is on if you want, I could always come and keep you company on the balcony..each night. Then I could like watch Paul each night....and keep you tech dudes company. Sounds like a plan to me. Your choice....  Righteho. I have work 9.30 - 1.30 today. Not sure if that is good or not. I like the fact I have been given a pay rise, that actually makes me work harder amazingly. Might run into Croydon after work to purchase some things.  Have a go at this one:  Why is it illegal to park in a handicapped parking space but its ok to use a handicapped toilet?
