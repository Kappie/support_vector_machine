I feel like a kid again when I play basketball; when I run, I usually just want to get it done. Basketball is just more fun, let's face it.  I watched a few minutes of Michelle Wie, the 14 year-old golfer who is competing in the Sony Championship golf tournament with the best players in the world. It's a funny thing to consider that she was born in 1989 and is now hitting the ball 300 yards off the tee. Hmm. I think I'm going to quit golf, given that I'm not 14 and I can't hit the ball (fill in any number here) yards. I was just in awe, watching her and trying to understand how it could possibly be that she is so young.  Then she finished her round.  The commentators asked her into the booth to give an interview. One asked her if she was nervous, and she said something like, "Well, like, I think I wasn't really that worried about hitting it, and then, like, I was like, 'Don't get nervous!', but then I hit the ball straight." Ignoring the fact that she was describing her experience of playing with the best golfers the free world has produced, she was just a 14 year-old when she was talking. That was totally cool.  The only thing keeping me from dinner right now is sheer inertia.
