One word to describe the exact action of throwing someone out of a window.. Not a Door, or off a balcony, out of a window ONLY.. Not only that but you would NEVER guess what it means from the word..  If anything I think I would prbably of hazarded a guess at "to put yourself into a defensive position" or some such..  Wanna know what the word is?  "Defenestrate"  That word means "To throw out of a window"  Freaky..  Here are some examples of the usage (again taken from the e-mail)  "    Some  of  his  apparent  chums . . . would still happily      defenestrate him if they caught him near a window.      --Andrew   Marr,   "No   option   bar   the  radical  one,"      [1]Independent, July 5, 1994       I defenestrated a clock to see if time flies!      --Lane  Smith,  quoted  in  "Who's News," [2]Time for Kids,      September 25, 1998       A  woman,  driven  to fury by the manner in which her lover      prefers  to  lavish  his  attention on a match on the telly      rather than her, starts to throw his possessions out of the      window.  He's  finally  moved to stop her when she tries to      defenestrate his new Puma boots.      --Jim White, "Budgets substantial enough to buy most of the      clubs in the Endsleigh," [3]Independent, April 6, 1996      _________________________________________________________     Defenestrate  is  derived from Latin de-, "out of" + fenestra,    "window." The noun form is defenestration."  Anywho.. Today I am alive and well and having fun.. The End..
