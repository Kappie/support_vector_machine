The Mono project is an open source effort sponsored by Novell to create a free implementation of the .NET Development Framework.   Mono includes a compiler for the C# language, a Common Language Runtime (CLR) for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) and a set of class libraries. The runtime can be embedded into your application. It implements both ADO.NET and ASP.NET.   Beta 1 is released and available for download from the link to resource.
