Played  cricket after a gap of 4 years with my friends in chennai.was soaked in sweat.bcoz of smoking these days i could feel the difference while playing.was exhausted very soon.  we usually play in front of our house in adyar.neighbours said that for 4 years they were peaceful but now every sunday they have to take the pain of retrieving the ball for us if it goes inside their houses.  now all the neighbours have dogs in their houses.so u should have seen us picking the ball  running towards the gate.it was nice enjoying after 4 long years.  bye  urs  ganesh
