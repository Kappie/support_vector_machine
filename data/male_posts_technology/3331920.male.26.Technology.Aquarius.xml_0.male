In a feat of motivation unlike me, i confessed to Angel last night that i wanted to have our wedding thank you cards done and sent by the end of this week.  It's not like there's a mountain of them or anything, only 2 dozen.  Sometimes i can be pretty lazy.  And other times i can be insanely lazy.  But this week, damnit, everyone's going to know just how appreciative i can be.  I'm out.
