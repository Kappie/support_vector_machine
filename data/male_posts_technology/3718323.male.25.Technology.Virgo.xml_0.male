The smell of saltwater was in the air as the worn tires of his old bike rolled over the cracked concrete, producing a slightly noticeable whir.  Occasionally he glanced up at the swaying palm trees that stretched towards the sky, which still didn't seem real.  The streets were familiar, and the scene no different, but the experience was always new.  With a grand imagination it could easily be anyone's first time.    Later as he sat in the sand time stood still, and with the backdrop of ever present waves, memories were made.  The far away clouds hung over the mysterious blue water, grey and dreary, but the sun still shone overhead.  When he was there, it was all just a moment.  But time has no bounds, and everything etched itself into the past.  Though tomorrow was an eternity away, eventually things started to move, and with the right memories it is all recalled as he rides down a familiar street and glances up at the swaying palm trees stretching towards the sky, which still at times don't seem real.
