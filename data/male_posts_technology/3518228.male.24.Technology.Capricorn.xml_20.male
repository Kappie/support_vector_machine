More than anything I have had a lack of motivation.  But, so it goes.  It was a relaxing new year, I played pool with a small group of friends.  For the most part, we relaxed in a group,  It was nice.  My application to grad school seems to be almost done. I've been in contact with some of the people in Forestry, and apparently the only thing that we're waiting on right now is an approval form to admit me even though my GPA is a bit low.  I might even be accepted officially before classes start. I've got all the classes I want picked out.  I think I'm  going to do band again next semester, I keep talking about how I want to.  My project to build a DVR based on the  urlLink freevo project  has been a complete success.  It's impressive what you can do just by putting something on the Internet and sticking a computer in it.  It makes a stupid TV into a device that seeks out shows you want and snarfs them for you automagically.  The people at IBM who said that four computers would be sufficient to run the world must be going nuts to see what people are doing with computers today.  I was trying to figure out, for a while, what purpose the 'news' section on my website would serve now that I'm attempting to maintain a weblog ( urlLink Jerry Pournelle  says that the pseudo-word blog is ugly.  I agree with him.).  I've come to the conclusion that the 'news' section will talk about updates to the site, and my weblog will continue to be mindless chatter.
