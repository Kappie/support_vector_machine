In the morning we will check out, drive 5 minutes to our clients site and spend the whole day there.  At the end of the day we will be driving almost 3 hours across the state to  urlLink Grand Rapids  and our 2nd hotel.  The next day, we will drive 10 minutes to a client site to train all day.  At the end of the day, it's back to the hotel where we will sleep, wake up the next day and drive 10 minutes to the airport and fly home.  This all sounds exhausting but I'm actually looking forward to the trip.  A fellow trainer will be going with me which will cut down on the boredom.  I will be to a new state I have never visited which is always exciting for me.  I will also be meeting people I have only dealt with on the phone up to this point which is also kind of exciting.  It's nice to put a face to a name and voice.  I will be updating my blog while on this trip since every trip I take happens to be filled with comedic problems and circumstances.  I'll have to tell you about the raccoon sometime.
