Our fervent pursuit of war with Iraq is driving us to squander the international legitimacy that has been Americaâ€™s most potent weapon of both offense and defense since the days of Woodrow Wilson. We have begun to dismantle the largest and most effective web of international relationships the world has ever known. Our current course will bring instability and danger, not security.    urlLink U.S. Diplomat's Letter of Resignation
