I'll spare you the build up and just say there was a building in the way and so all we could see was the fireworks reflected on the water.  But who cares!!  Julian discovered he likes calamari, really he does!  He ate a whole appetizer of squid and octopus and wanted more the next day. He also spent 15 minutes making Laura and I struggle not to cry.  We sat down for dinner and the waiter brought Julian a colouring place mat and crayons.  Instead of colouring things in he writes a letter, it's all just scribbles of course but he narrates out what he's writing. He "writes" that his Mummy is very sweet and he loves her so much, that Justin is his brother and he loves him very much too and that he's also very sweet. Stimpy the cat gets the same treatment and I even get mentioned, "Daddy gets angry at me sometimes when I'm naughty but it's OK because I love him and he loves me." That few minutes redeemed several months of naughty. I love my kids.
