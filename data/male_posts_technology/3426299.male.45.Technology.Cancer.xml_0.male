I will post the pictures by next week in my WEB site at: http://www.wilmarguday.homedns.org/ for you to see.      I failed to update my homepage until now 7/17/04 due to my programming job. Currently I'm updating my payroll program. Also, the pictures taken were not in good quality since my kid (Bon) finger is covering the lens in most of the pictures taken from TMX :). Anyway I have one picture below for you to see...hehehe.
