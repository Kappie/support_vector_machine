Making money may be one of the objectives but not the primary.  Giving it more thought: I tried to gauge "what do I want from my allotted n years?" Invariably the answer was to get satisfaction in every task I undertake. Now, satisfaction is pretty vague to quantify into the map of pragmatic world, the world we live in.  Being creative and quenching my thirst of creativity being one of my important goals, I realized that success for me is not in terms of monetory means (no matter what the need is). Success (which eventually answers my first question) comes from nearing perfection!  Perfection... yes that is the ultimate aim!
