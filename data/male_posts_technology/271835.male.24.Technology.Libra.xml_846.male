According to the blurb 14 bands have signed major deals since the site started although I can't find any details other than the claim.  There is a huge amount of material here and some of it has to be good if only by the law of averages. The music is broken up by genre so there is punk, rock, r'n'b (rhythm and bass rather than  proper  r'n'b but they do have a blues section), pop, dance etc etc.   via  urlLink linkfilter
