Now your average interviewer must know most of what they are reading should be filed under "creative writing" in their cabinet and the interviewee sure as hell knows the words composed on that document  are about as factually correct as Robert Maxwells 100metre swimming certicate. Yet, bizarrely, the pretense is kept up by both parties during an actual interview. I recently had to write a CV and of course i kept the essentials in and lied about nothing (you never know, my new boss may readthis) but when i got to the section headed "personal interests" i was in two minds as to whether or not i should be brutally honest or do the usual and put more spin on it than your average US government hawk. Here were the options.         What they want to hear     I am self motivated and organised.     The Truth     Ifind it hard dragging myself to the kitchen to actually eat most days, and have no idea where my socks are kept.     What they want to hear     I consider myself pro-active.     The Truth     I went outside once...it was cold.     What they want to to hear     I am a team player and work well with people.     The Truth     Please give me a job where i get to work alone, and dont even think about taking things from my desk.     What they want to hear     I am ambitious, driven and have a will to succeed.     The Truth     Pay me each month and im happy.     What they want to hear     I am an outgoing, confident person.     The Truth     I will talk to you, but i will be thinking about whats on TV that night and nodding. oh and i really actually dispise you, but hey, no use making enemies at work.        As you can imagine i went for what they wanted to hear.
