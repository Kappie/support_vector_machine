During my many years in the army, I drove a real  urlLink HWMMV  (Humvee) on both city streets and in rough terrain. I can tell you that these things  rock  on rough terrain, but as for street driving, you might as well be driving a tank. They are wider than a normal vehicle (even a large vehicle) and their tires don't do very well on pavement. Now, these new H2s are slimmer, and sport regular truck tires, and are apparently completely useless as far as doing what they were originally designed to do. I can guarantee you that my HWMMV would never have gotten stuck on a 12" tree stump. All my years in the army, I never saw one winch.   I think the whole thing is both hilarious and depressing.
