The court decided that they were unable to hear the motion to modify temporary orders and the motion for interim attorney fees.  So the court only listened to the contempt motion.  To refresh your memories or fill you in if you are new the motion listed the following items of contempt against   SFW       Living outside of the geographic restriction of King County, Washington or Harris County, TX   Being with a person of the opposite sex, in the childs presence after 20:00 (8:00) in the evening   Responsible for timely payment and insurance coverage of the 2000 Ford Mustang     Well the court found her not guilty of contempt on the first count based on a technicality.  The technicality was the official filing of the temporary orders was filed May 10 and   SFW   moved to MI on May 7th.  However, the court did inform her that she was guilty but because of this technicality they were letting her off.  With regard to count 3 they did not even rule on it.  It was like they did not even see it or recall that it was filed.  Count 2 found   SFW   guilty of contempt!  The court said based on your own testimony you are guilty and   SFW   has 10 days to move back to WA or TX or turn over Karissa to the father otherwise she will be confined to Harris County Jail.    Of course when it was all over I got the "you are such an asshole" phone call where she threatened to make me pay and that I had won a battle but I had not won the war.  She swore to make me pay.   The only problem with all this is that   SFW   has demanded that I have Karissa ready to go tomorrow at 10 am.  She said to me she is never coming back to TX and that for me has a dual connotation.    It can mean she is never coming back to live in TX or it can mean she is not coming back!  Meaning she is going to take Karissa and bail!  She has 10 days to get back to MI which will take 2 days then 3-4 to get to WA that is essentially a week.    We have mediation scheduled for the 1st of September which she has to come back for.  The attorney's are trying to move up the final hearing to mid-september and there is still a hearing for the attorney fees so unless she is using all the support money to travel or has a new sugar daddy in WA I could see her not coming back and disappearing with Karissa.  Anyway I am spending my last day with Karissa before she leaves tomorrow at 10 AM.
