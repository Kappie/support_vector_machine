I went to a place called the Greenwood academy.  It is a training salon that seems to be highly reputable.  I was lucky and got someone whose first day of cutting a real persons hair was  today.   She did a fairly good job, even though her teacher did a lot of it and it took about an hour.  She did happen to cut herself though.  The cut was nice( the hair cut not her cut), however the style was like something from the mid-80's.  But it was only $10.00, so I guess I can't complain.  Becca went their a few weeks ago and got someone that had been doing it for a little longer and she really liked it, so for the price we will most likely be going back.
