"I was feeling for the past few days seeing your behavior..but thought so after you made a comment last night...but what happened exactly??", I asked.  "yeah , wewere not getting alongvery well, some problems between us .."  "Hmm.... so had afight ?"  "No..No.. We broke off on a mutual understanding...Actually, there were some attitude problems ..she didn't like some habits of mine and i didn't like somethings about her."  "yaar...choti choti baatein to hoti rehti hain.. but you loved her so much..how can both of you ??"  "She is a fun-loving outgoing girl..likes to go to discs and all.. and I , simply, hate it. For few days , i compromised..she doesn't like my folkscoz' we are from diffrent culture but I never told her so ...  why should I compromise every time?? "    Yes, this is the question all of us face in real life. Do you remember, when you were going around with a person , you did compromise.. but then after some time, you didn't ? why ?  When you start out in love, you ignore things , may be , which you are not able to ignore later in life.. things do hurt you but you simply don't give a damn to them.. those things later on, become a sore and hurts your ego..   Why should I compromise ? this question draws the line between self-esteem and Ego. Self-Esteem is must but why ego ? ego never makes your love and dreams come true.. have your self-esteem . Never let your partner play with your self-esteem but please don't spoil a relationship with your false ego..  Both the persons in a relation need to make adjustments, compromises...understand the need of each other .but thats what doesn't happen ... Everyone of us, riding on false ego, never thinks about other's feelings and what next , the relation for which we saw the dreams goes away..
