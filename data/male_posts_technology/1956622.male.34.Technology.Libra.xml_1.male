It is 0530 my stepdad just left for work I am going to go sleep on the couch for a few hours as I am going to pick Karissa up later.  Picked Karissa up and left about 12-1 after dropping off toys at the house Lisa is staying at.  I actually met Karissa at the Drs. Office in Kirkland because Aunt Lisa had to take one of her kids to the Dr. and she is watching Karissa because my ex had a job interview this morning.  The look on Karissa’s face was wonderful.  I had a hard time holding back my tears.  She came out of the office and Karissa did not recognize me at first.  Then Aunt Lisa said Karissa who is that?  Karissa looked at me and her eyes got as big as plates, she took a deep breath and came running into my arms yelling “daddy”   I had to peel Karissa off me so I could walk.  Man she is so beautiful.  We spent the day in kind of a lazy mode I am bushed that ride took a lot out of me.  Karissa and I went to the store and did some shopping picked up some snacks and stuff.  Today was kind of shot for things to do as picking her up really took much longer then I wanted.  I met Lisa tonight for a couple of drinks and I thought we had a somewhat normal conversation.  Seeing her was difficult for me I know the things she has done but I care for her still.  I had to tell myself there is nothing here anymore.  She told me about how she is thinking about coming back to Houston.  She told me about how she is not happy at her brothers.  She said she will talk to the kids and let me know.  She said it is not fair to keep Karissa from her daddy.  The boys are used to it but Karissa is not.  I hope that happens.  I am excited to see Karissa and it would be cool to have her back in Houston  A couple of times today I did notice that Karissa does not talk to people or ignores them when you ask her to do things.  Like her crayons she spilled them on the floor and I asked her to help me pick them up and she refused.  In addition brushing her teeth at bedtime was a Major Chore.  This did not used to be the case.
