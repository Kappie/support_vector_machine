However, there is one tiny problem.  As it is about all sorts of medical disasters, and I have an appointment with one, it tends to make one jumpy.  Speaking of which, browser hijack paranoia has me more than a little on edge now.  I don't understand why people write these things.  Someone should write some kind of recursive anti-virus virus, that invades the server of said perpetrator and erases the software.  That'd make net surfing so much easier...  Back to TV - the Andromeda re-run of Season 1 concluded yesterday.  Season 1 was better than Season 2 IMO... I hope Season 3 is better.  What makes things worse is the scourge that is Big Brother is coming back to our screens.  Why is 21st century TV so unbelievably bad?!
