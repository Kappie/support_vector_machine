Yup I have arrived in Guernsey, although I am surprised that I made it as I have escaped near death on two occasions last night!!  So yeah, just arrived and had lunch with Lyndz- played some pool, which I won after three grueling games that tested the mind, body and alcohol consumption level haha!  Mmmmmm...don't know what I am going to do this afternoon......um....nope not a clue!!! Well at least I am certain that tonight promises to be a rocking night out on the lash!!!  'LET THE PISS UP BEGINETH!'  Um that's about it for now....... Baity signing off.............
