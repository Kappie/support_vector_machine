We should be prepared to use Dubai as an entry point for steel and construction companies to supply construction material, he told reporters on the sidelines of the conference. We should chose Dubai as a warehouse and move the goods. The opportunity in the aftermath of war is fantastic," he said.  Businesses are so SICK that they relish in attacking another country and destroying it - so that they can look forward to "rebuilding it and making great profits" !!! Man thats cool - someday some country could decide to bomb India - so that the business in that country (and their allied countries) can also make "profits".... Disturbing....   Kicha
