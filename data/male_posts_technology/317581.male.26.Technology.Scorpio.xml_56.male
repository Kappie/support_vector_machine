I got this box in the mail.  It was a long box.  I thought, "Hmmm, maybe there is some Gordon Lightfoot LP's in here."  I thought that mostly because I had bought some.  I opened the box and there were some Gordon Lightfoot LP's.  I was happy.  So I played them with the syringe needle.  Hey, I'm sure it works as good as any other needle plus come one, it's a freakin dream.  Yeah and they played music.  I woke up and I was happy.  Then when I actually came to, you know it takes about 30 min before you say hey that wasn't real, then I wan't happy anymore.  I wrote an email.  I was mad.  They said they sent them though.  Then I thought, I had them when I was sleeping, and now I have to wait.  Frick.  I'm going back to bed.
