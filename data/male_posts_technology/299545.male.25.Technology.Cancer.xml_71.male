Students and parents often ask me what the technology might be used for in the future.  urlLink Here  is a great answer. It is a nano-scale combination lock developed at Sandia National Labs that is printed on a silicon wafer, and can be manipulated with electrical signals. If the user enters the wrong combination, it cannot be unlocked until someone (the administrator of the system) resets it. Pretty nifty security device.
