One of my best friends, Cho has the craziest legal DVD collections of anyone I know! He has stacks of movies he hasn;t even seen yet and I swear the only time he even considers watching them is when people are over commenting on how many un-wrapped DVDs he has sitting around, hahaha. We had some drinks and sat around for a bit. We were going to wait for some young girlfriends of mine, but then Cho reminded us that Sanctuary, where we like to go dancing doesn't charge a cover before 11 (I think is was 11... migh be 10)    urlLink    urlLink      Anyway... when we got there it was totally dead because it gets hopping pretty late there - and when it does you can;t even dance comfortably; I'd rather get there a little early most of the time.    urlLink    urlLink      Gregg wasn't feeling it and cut out pretty early. Jon Cho and I had a blast! After Sanctuary closed, we continued on and met my friends at Bella Notte (or however it is spelled) next to Rolands on Penn Ave. It was me, Scott, Chris, our friend Sean (in the baseball cap below), Alissa (in between Chris and Sean) and Jon Cho. Later,Carolina, who I met a DejaVu the previous week came out to meet us.    urlLink    urlLink      As per common weekend tradition, we went over to Chis for some after-hours fun and played Taboo for the rest of the night. Scott wasn;t into it at first. He and Caroline were on my team, vs. Chris and Sean...    urlLink      Alissa and ...uugh forget her name... fell asleep pretty early on the couch...    urlLink    urlLink       I believe we won, hehe. Good times!     urlLink    urlLink     urlLink    urlLink      -Ryan Riehle
