On the plus side the bouncers are handing out umbrellas which is nice. However, my beef is simple and is as follows:     Now, correct me if I am wrong, but that says designer denim welcome. I am wearing a pair of £90 Urban Stone jeans and I get refused entry because they are "too light" or some shit. If they are too busy they should just say that, instead of refusing people entry for lame reasons.  For the next week, all posts to TF will start with the line "Liquid is shit" until they impress us with free champange or something better.  In case you’re wondering, I didn't try the "webmaster of Jersey nightclubbing site.. I will post this shit on the net" line.. because, frankly I’d rather not go to a club that is so superficial it only lets you in if you're wearing designer clothes.
