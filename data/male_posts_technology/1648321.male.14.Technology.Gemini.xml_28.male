I will be having a ton of sugar so I might get a little hyper tonight. Plus, I am now on my PowerBook, typing this. The aluminum structure on this PB is so awesome. Last night I synced my iMac with my PowerBook and put them on the exact same settings for an aquarium screen-saver, and it was so cool! I still need to do homework (actually it is all done, but done extremely poorly). So I'll talk to you next year, 2004! 8-D
