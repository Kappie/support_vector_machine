I got willed a senior star (something put on their locker at the beginning of the year... special way to remember the person by when you get one willed to you) by Matt and Gwen, a t-shirt with paint on it from Lenny (from when we painted that church way back when...), some almost-finished bombs from our Chem. class from Gwen, and print of some of YoungHee's amazing artwork from... er... YoungHee. (lol)  I'm gonna ty to get my scanner online sometime tonight and post a scan of the print.  Later tonight I attended my sister Azita's 8th grade graduation.  Man school tomorrow's going to suck really bad and the graduation itself's not going to be much better. I shall be much crying. Hopefully the graduate's receptions later that night and the following day will cheer me up temporarily though.
