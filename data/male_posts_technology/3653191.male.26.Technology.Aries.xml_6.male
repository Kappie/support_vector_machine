I did not have  any particular topic or issue or words in my mind. Just felt like giving vent to my literary genius and write or rather type or rather bug someone!!  Since I felt that my sincere intentions and feelings would not be understood by anyone, I thought I'd rather just blog !!  As I type this @#%^*^!*$ out here, I have an eye on the clock.. second by second.. its getting closer to lunch... not that I need someone's permission to go for lunch, but I think its within decency limits to go out for lunch during lunch time.  Today morning, I went about 20 mins early to the air-ticket collection office. Lucky me, I had the radio on my mobile. So, could spend time without much difficulty. Everything was going on well, until.... yeah until... this silly looking lady walked into the office. I told myself.. "Oh my God! what a character". Well, let's stop here.. The other things I thought of are not worth posting here.  After a few minutes, I switched off my radio and looked around and saw "Token # 218" being flashed at the screen. "Good heavens !! How can they do this to me. I was the first person to walk into the office. My token # is 216. How can they ignore me like this." I walk up to the counter and horrors of horrors ... it is the same lady sitting at the counter, beaming the broadest smile she could and ask me "What is your token number, sir?" "216", I blurted out. "I have announced that number twice, sir. How come you did not hear that?". "Because, the sky is so high", I thought to myself. "I was a little preoccupied, sorry about that", I told her and handed over the papers. "Gosh!! does she know what she is supposed to do?", I tell myself.   Anyway, cutting that silly stuff short, I did manage to get my work done and came out. I think I faintly heard that silly lady telling something to her colleague and giggling. There are not many decent people out there anymore. Atleast I did not talk about this lady with anyone. (I know, there's somebody saying... Look, who's talking )   I even don't know what I am doing right now.. Do I really have to know. As long as you (yes, I mean you. The person who is reading this right now) are smiling now, who cares.  Catch u l8r  Cheers !!
