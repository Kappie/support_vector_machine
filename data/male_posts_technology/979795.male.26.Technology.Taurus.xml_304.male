Was a bit late again missing warmup and all that. Not a good idea coz it's the same both times I popped down to BVCC that this had happened. Really need to keep my timing in check.  Today was the first time I paired up with Sunny (kowtows to Nidan ... capable of some really hard throws). I can tell you every iriminage he did on me, I didn't get what he was trying to get across to me. Seriously ... I only thought I understood it the final time he did it and then it was over liao. Wasted. Didn't even manage to take a decent ukemi for him. Fell like a piece of rock each time and I know I could've hurt myself badly if he really wanted to throw me. Dun understand it, but I still totally enjoyed it. Each iriminage I did on him he could've done a reversal. OK my iriminage was craaaap. Absolute shitz ... but I still enjoyed it. Dun understand it. No frustration at not 'getting it' either.  Today's a weird mood of training for me... but a happy one.  Out've the blue my mom was in the neighbourhood to pick me up. On the way back in the car, we actually had a decent conversation. I'm still quite skeptical about how long these moments can last but it still feels nicer to be talking rather than hollering at each other.
