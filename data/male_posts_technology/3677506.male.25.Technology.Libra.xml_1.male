(i hate oklahoma)  facts about my life in the last few days: - one of my best friends, and first bf, calls to tell me he bought a house w/ his beau - my neighbor is heavily searching to buy a house and plans on taking her 10 y/o son w/ her (as opposed to leaving him w/ me) - i depressed myself this morning while taking a poop because i realized that i go through the same routine every day - i get to work today and find out that one of the first people i managed is leaving the company and moving to arizona - shortly after i find out a good friend on my team is moving back to nebraska  i'm not really depressed, but i feel like i'm watching everyone else go on w/ life around me while i stand still... and although that may be exactly what i need to do right now i'm stil anxious to grow up and become an adult... any suggestions anyone?
