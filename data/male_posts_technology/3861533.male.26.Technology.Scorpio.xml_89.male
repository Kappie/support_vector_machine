The movie is about the deaf-mute Ryu, whose sister needs a kidney transplant. He finds out that he cannot be a donor since they have different blood types. He then makes a deal with organ-dealing criminals: He'll give them both money and his kidney in return for another with the correct blood type. But the deal goes bad and he ends up loosing both the money and his kidney. But now a legitimate donor suddenly appears, but the operation still costs money and he's broke now.   In order to get the money, Ryu and his revolutionary girlfriend decides to kidnap the daughter of his boss who recently fired him for missing too much work (he was recuperating from his kidney-removal). They get the money, but the daughter accidentally drowns. His sister finds out about the kidnapping and kills herself, rather than be a part of it.  Maddened by grief the boss now decides to hunt the kidnappers down and kill them and so he does. But in the final scene he too gets killed by members of the revolutionary cell that Ryu's girlfriend belonged to. -->
