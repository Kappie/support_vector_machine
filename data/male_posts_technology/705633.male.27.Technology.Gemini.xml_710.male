It was freezing cold to start with but the wind died down eventually. Kirk's dad scored a rather small but perfectly formed bass (which went back to be caught again another day) and I landed my first ever fish! It's called a Garfish (or known locally as a Snipe), and it's a evil looking little bastard. They have green bones to help you eat them easier, which is rather thoughtful.     Happy birthday Ruth!
