It's no wonder people, especially students, will try all means to maximise and even cheat the Uni of some money.  Very sian. Just got an email from my laopeh. Kaopeh at me about the Uni thingy, coz if pay late gonna get fined for it. A lot of things tell him liao he also kaopeh. That's why really freaking hate to talk to him. Cannot have a decent conversation without disagreeing. Shits. Ah, parents lah, what to do. Sometimes I miss Singapore, but everytime I go back and I think I may want to try to be a good son, some shit will happen at home and my parents will make me wish I'm back in UK alone and away from them. Confirm plus guarantee one. These few years I really don't feel like I can hang around them for long. I don't really feel the point for joining reunion dinner and all that stuff. Don't understand lah. I think army/camp life suits me lor. When I kanna hold back by the govt/army parents usually can't do anything. Woohoo.  O yea, talk about army life. I think I will sign on with the Police Force after I graduate. I've got a module doing something called Commercial Programming and the school brings in industry people to talk to us about issues out there right now. The module is very very good. Anyway, one area was Computer Forensics. Really damn interesting. Don't think anyone really knew that our data can still be retrieved even after we do a format. The expert said that you had to format the harddisk 7 times and do physical wipe of the system to have a high chance of ensuring that data cannot be retrieved. I dunno if I can do Computer Forensics lah, but I wanna do something to serve the public. Almost definitely government work. Especially with the Sep 11 incident, think it strenghtened my convictions that we need to be alert and stron internally. It was really scary to know that JI had planned possible attacks on certain locations in Singapore. If intelligence and news didn't reach us in time, the outcome would have been catastrophobic. I can't begin to imagine the number of innocent people who might have been killed and injured. Especially after watching war movies like Band of Brothers, Black Hawk Down and Saving Pte Ryan, imagine some civilian who might have lost a limb and just be bleeding on the ground waiting for life to end and being fully conscious. Ewww ... really very cham. If I'm the one there, I might wish for someone to put a bullet through my head immediately.  Anyway, gotta go library liao. Got to return a short loan video now. Otherwise fine fine fine. Hey, who said Singapore is a 'fine' country. It's the same over here and the amount is a lot more hefty compared to Singapore.
