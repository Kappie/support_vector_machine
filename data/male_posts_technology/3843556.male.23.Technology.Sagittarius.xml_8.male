I would be more than grateful if anybody could help me find any documentation on phpMyInventory. I gave my first shot at PHP. It looks easy for now. Cooked chicken for dinner. It did not come out the way I wanted it to but nevertheless turned out to be good. The day was to end on a bad note. The same old story where the bad guy loses. I can't stop laughing at myself. I never seem to learn. It is the story of my life. You give your heart to someone but someone else steals her away. I broke down the second she told me. Well, the general thought running around everybody's mind is that I must be used to it by now. It is more of disgust to be honest. You give all you have got and get nothing in return. I am paying for something I had done years ago. Yes, something I should not have done. I wish I could turn back time. Probably the only mistake I made but it was grave mistake. I called Sandeep. The only person who would truly understand what I was going through. His words were comforting and opened my eyes. Fought hard to find sleep. Eventually I did, all ready to start a new chapter in my life without a person who meant the world to me.
