I have to wonder if there aren't going to be less huge hikes in price for the consumer if Wal Mart is the one negotiating the deal instead of the thousands of individual people.  I have an issue with Wal-Mart's employee policies, which prevent a person from getting health benefits for longer than your average company. But at the same time, I have no problem with paying less for something that is basically the same no matter where you go. Gasoline happens to be one of those things, and I'm overjoyed when this great capitalistic society of ours makes possible reduction of inefficiency for the average man. Is it good for the small gas station owner? Not at all. Is it good for everyone else, who represents a thousand times the number of gas station owners? I think so.  Wal Mart is one of the great phenomenons of the last twenty years, when you start to think of the economic impact. I'll have to find an article (one of many I've seen in the past six months) that tells the percentage of certain goods that Wal Mart sells in America, and it's staggering. That's for another time though--I've got a ten page paper to write tonight, and the thoughts are, shall we say, less than organized...
