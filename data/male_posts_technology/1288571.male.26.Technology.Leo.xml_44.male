I can see a black image, its hard to describe, in my vision and it moves around depending on where I look.  I was extremely nervous to be honest.. worried that it'd be something like the onset of blindness or some other equally bad thing (yea I tend to worry too much). The black semi-transparent blob moves around though, so it has to be something ON my eye, right?  Anyways, I find out today because I have an appointment with the eye doctor. Up until yesterday, the thing was it didn't feel like there was anything in my eye, but finally it does and its irritating the shit out of me.  So I'm praying its something he can just pluck out.  Other than that though, I'm almost 100% sure I'm going to need glasses or something.. my vision just ain't what it used to be.  Fuck.
