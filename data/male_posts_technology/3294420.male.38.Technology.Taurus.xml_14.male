Tuesday and Wednesday she was more alert, but she was only finishing about half of her bottles.  She would start out strong and then fall asleep half way through.  Thursday and Friday she did great.  Last night the doctor told us that they are working on her discharge paperwork.  I think that means that the plan is for her to go home next week.  It all, of course, is contingent upon her eating consistently well.    On Thursday she had another eye exam.  Very stressful procedure.  I was so glad that I was there to comfort her and hold her afterwards.  The  good news is that the doctor said she has turned the corner and that her eyes look great.  Just one more eye exam in three weeks and we should be able to put that behind us.  Maya has an MRI of her brain scheduled for Monday.  We will let you know the results.  The doctor said that there is no reason to think that anything is amiss.  Well...we will be going to see her in about two hours.  It is bath day.  Promise to get some pix and post them later today or tomorrow.  Yesterday she weighed in at 6lbs 14oz.  Perhaps she will hit the 7lb mark today??    Cheers,  Gina.
