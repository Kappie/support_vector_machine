Went out to dinner in Celbridge with the Little lady and the fokes ( her side, not mine ), a Birthday celebration thing. We had a party in the house and then and then my self, the little lady and the Fokes went to dinner in some town close to Celbridge (Don't know where don't care). So had some good Chinese and all was well. Walking back to the car around about 10:00pm, all was well............... NO! We hear some lively music coming from a Pub and then utter the immortal words "We will stop in for a Minute"........       Yeah so got home at about Three O'clock in the morning and was in for Work at Nine o'clock this morning. And here's the fun part I didn't wake up till 10:15, Oh the funnery!
