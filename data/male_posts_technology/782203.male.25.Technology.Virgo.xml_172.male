Mark my words, once a cyclist gets knocked down by a vehicle on the road they will reverse the ruling.   The Zoo has postponed its 500,000 dollar plan to change its name, logos and image. Which is a waste cos we all know that when people decide whether or not to go to a zoo, the logo and zoo name are the most important factors in their decision and not the quality of the facilities/service/enclosures there.  My day was frustrating, another day of research and I didnt find anything that I was looking for.   Oh ya BLUE is coming to town for a concert , think a lot of gals I know planning to go. Arrrggh wanna say something BAD about them but have to remember that everyone has their own tastes and I should respect them. *fingers itching*   Heh Asha Gil actually smiled during the weakest link next week ! That one must watch!
