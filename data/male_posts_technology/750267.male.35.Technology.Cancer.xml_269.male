Have you ever been out with another couple (married or not), who don't mind arguing in front of you? What makes it worse is when you feel like their argument is over something that is very small - like somebody being 10 minutes late for dinner. It makes it even worse when they attempt to include you, like "You would call if you were going to be late, wouldn't you Scott?". Ugh. Get me outta here.
