It seems as though my outlook was waiting for me to sign in again so it could send the application. I signed in last night, 3 days after the deadline for the job.  Anyway, I'm really frustrated by that, as I think it would at least have been a good interview opportunity. C'est la vie.  Another day, another 42.50.  Peace- T
