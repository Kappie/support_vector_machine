Plus I felt like I had a night club pouding in the front of my head.  I slept as soon as I came home from work.  That wasn;t good because I was up the rest of the night.  Tom was over so I felt bad that I was just laying motionless ont he couch.    I feel better now.  I am going to go buy the ingridients for a pot roast tonight.  I watched them make on on Good Eats (a show on FoodTV).  It looked easy.  I will give it a shot tonight so it will be ready for tomorrow.  That is all from here.  Ann will be back in 48 hours so I am gettig excited....  Until then....
