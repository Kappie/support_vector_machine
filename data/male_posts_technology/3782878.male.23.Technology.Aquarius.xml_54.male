So I decided in her absence I would seek to make new allies in the Wayfarer's Brotherhood, and I met quite a few during my weekend long siege of the foul undead castle of mistmoore and it's dungeons. I met Hits It, another Gnome, and a roguish fellow, with a penchant for using masks of illusion to disguise himself, often times as a hated iksar. And Masri, another female Cleric, who lays down the holy smiting as much as she heals. I entered a total of 7 or more Mistmoore catacombs and crypts, slaying undead and I must say these crypts never empty! I seems as though more and more undead are created each day, and there is nothing we can do about it. Seems almost hopeless. Luckily the fellow Dwarf Vaun in the Wayfarer's camp has been passing me information about a brood war between different clans of Mistmoore vampires. I might someday be able to use this against the vile beasts. Time will have to tell.  Unfortunately combat this weekend seemed to blur together, as each battle seemed much like the last, otherwise I would give you more details. The blessings of Virtue and Protection of the Nine now adhere to me, and those blessings make me more powerful than ever before. Look for many more fierce battles as I begin to hunt the Planes outside of Norrath.
