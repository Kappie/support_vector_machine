GCSE Certificates are okay now, they were posted to me yesterday and I got em when I come home.  3 things that I think are totally different from each other: I love... (example: "I think she has a really kind nature that I like") I fancy... (example: "Rah! She's well fit!") I like... (example: "Aw, ur nice") Don't quite know how to put that one.
