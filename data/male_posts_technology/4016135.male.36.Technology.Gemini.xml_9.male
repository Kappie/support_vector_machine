As a child of the 1980's, Van Halen is one of those bands I recall fondly during my high school years. Being the deprived child I was in those days, I never got to go to any concerts, let alone a Van Halen concert. So, as the years passed and the band embarked on their spectacular downwards spiral in the 90's, I resigned myself to the notion that I would probably never see them in concert. After Sammy Hagar left the band (quit or kicked out depending on who's side you believe), and one godawful release with Gary Cherone (Extreme) as lead singer, it was clear Van Halen had seen better days. Oh sure there was the fleeting failed attempt at a reunion with David Lee Roth, as announced on the MTV music awards not too long ago. However, David Lee Roth being the egomaniacal dumbass he was, and still is, had to go and screw things up by reminding Eddie Van Halen why he was kicked out of the band in the first place. So close yet so far away.   I began reading rumors about a reunion with Sammy Hagar several months ago. Rumors became fact as the band announced the upcoming release of a two disc greatest hits collection AND a summer tour. Needless to say, I would be all over tickets for the show. I didn't care that they were nearly $100 a ticket. This was Van Halen. A band I never thought I would see in person.   So fast forward to August 10. My old high school buddy and I were really looking forward to this. Sure the band is a "little" older but this was still Van Halen. And yes, I do count the Hagar era as true Van Halen, despite what some David Lee Roth fans think. The guys did not disappoint. From the opening song, Jump, to the finale, When It's Love, it was a loud and interesting show. Sammy Hagar has a little bit of a spare tire around the old waistline, but he was running around, jumping, and working the audience like he always has. Alex Van Halen (drums) appears not to have aged one bit since 1984. He must drain his blood every night. Eddie Van Halen on the other hand, has not been treated kindly by the progress of time. He looked like the walking dead. Thin as a crack addict, he barely moved around on stage. I recall he jumped a couple of time on Jump, but that was as animated as he got. Healthwise, he's been a wreck over the years, battling throat cancer and having hip replacement surgery. Now, one would think that something as serious as throat cancer would be enough incentive to quit smoking, yet there he was smoking like there wasn't a care in the world. Luckily for him, his hands have remained intact. Eddie has, and always will be a guitar god. During his 20 minute guitar solo, he reminded everyone of this fact. Sadly though, the ravages of life as a rock and roll star appear to be taking its toll. His playing was ragged and inconsistent all night. Sure it was still vintage Eddie, but there was something that was not quite right. It's hard to describe, but his guitar playing didn't sound as clean as I expected.   Yet, in spite of the raggedness Eddie displayed and the constant reminder that these guys are all pushing 50, it was a night to remember. I fulfilled a wish I never thought I would ever see happen. To be able to hear my favorite songs live: Dreams, Poundcake, Unchained, Best of Both Worlds, Right Now, Panama, was something meaningful to me. Several times during the show, I was taken back to my high school years and reminded of some great memories. I've read some reviews of the concert in some of the local newspapers. They weren't kind. I kind of expected that. The critics saw the same things I did: Sammy Hagar dominating things so much that the rest of the band seemed to get pushed into the background, Eddie's ragged play and lack of physical energy. I didn't care though. It was still Van Halen. Maybe with a few extra miles on them, but it's the band I grew up with. Who knows what the future of the band will be after the tour is over. All I know is that for one night, I was back in high school again, and it felt great.
