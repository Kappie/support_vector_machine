Please tell me that you are just writing the party line because you are in the grip of dispair and it is prevent you from thinking for yourself.   For that matter, by a voice vote -- who here believes oil the the reason we are at war? I am very curious about the legs on this line of thinking. For that matter (again):  Who here thinks that giving the inspectors more time would have brought this crisis to a peaceful conclusion? Who believes that leaving Saddam Hussein in power in Iraq is better for the Iraqi people than giving them a shot at self-governance?  All you lurkers out there -- here's your chance to chime in. I won't lecture or post about your responses -- I'm just curious about how everyone is feeling about this adventure. So, to recap, three questions, true or false answers -- and if you'd like, email me (crk@mindspring.com): 1. Oil is the reason we are at war. 2. Allowing the inspectors more time to search Iraq would have lead to a peaceful conclusion. 3. Leaving Saddam Hussein in power is better for the Iraqi people than giving them a shot at self-governance (with the very real possibility of chaos and failure to create a viable government).  P.S. 40?!?! Thanks, man. I wasn't feeling old until now!  8-p
