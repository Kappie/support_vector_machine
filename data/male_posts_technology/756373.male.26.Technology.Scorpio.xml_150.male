Case in point :  urlLink The Phillipines , where a long-dormant Islamic terrorist outfit, revitalised by the Phillipines' government's cowing to to terrorist demands and pulling troops out of Iraq to free a single hostage, has probably doomed hundreds, if not thousands, to death.  S.A. stands for everything the global fundamentalist Islamic terrorist movement despises. Freedom. Secularity. Peace. But S.A. is also weak in terms of resolve. In  urlLink this piece , Lawrence Wright outlines their motives. They want to bring about the apocalypse. They want Judgement Day. What better way to facilitate this than declaring war on those who are afraid of them. Cowards like Spain and the Phillipines are merely stepping stones to creating worldwide fear. They're afraid, and can be influenced, and by targeting nations that Islamic terrorism can 'beat' through bullying tactics, they demonstrate that they, the terrorists, are a power to be reckoned with. And it looks like they've targeted S.A as similiarly cowardly and influencable - another innocent victim to kill, to show to the mighty that they, too, are strong.  If South Africa isn't willing to take up arms against this threat, to support the war on terror, they might just be right.
