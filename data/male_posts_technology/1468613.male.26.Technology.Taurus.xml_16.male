And if you ask me, I am going to start hanging out in the garden shed to remember my place...  In one day, I have managed to put out the trash, the recycling, the paper, put the washing line away, the mini battery on the charger, load the  urlLink dishwasher , do the shopping; So we should have this serviced apartment lifestyle ready for you by time you come back....lol....If Kaia and Carrie keep digging, you will even be able to go downstairs for breakfast...  Anyway mate! Happy Birthday Again! Take Care... urlLink Drink Lots  and Smile Always...Then Fall Over...  jaMEs.
