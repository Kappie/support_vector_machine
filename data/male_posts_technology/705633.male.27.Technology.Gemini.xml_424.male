Yeee-hah.. look out for us, possible insertion points (oo-er) are Chicago and Sports, probably followed by Liquid. If a photo is taken that includes Baity's or Grist's newly shaven heads, that girl gets a free drink! Hoo-rah!  I have to say, i am feeling DAMN GOOD today. Had a great lunch with Loverat at Chicago Rock, loads of little eastern european waitresses pampering us.. nice.  Project Jackson.. (face lift for my PC, geddit) is going well.. Holly now has her stone fleck paint on, just the window to do.. the glass has been cut to the right size and a internal lamp has been chosen, it looks kind of like those plasma things you put your hands on.. it's going to RAAAWK!  By the way, I had a artist's impression done of Grist's mystery valentine card...
