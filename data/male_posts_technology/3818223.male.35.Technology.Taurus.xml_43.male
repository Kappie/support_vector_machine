I just bought some sugary, chemical laden breakfast cereals, the likes of which I haven't eaten since I was achild - Cocoa Puffs and Apple Jacks, to be exact - and found thecheesy useless prizes inside were sitting on top. What's with that? In my day the prizes were on the bottom, inside the bag with the food. I would stick my grubby arms into the box at the breakfast table, digging through mounds of sweetened crap, groping for the prize. My parents would yell at me, telling me I had to eat my way down to the prize, then would yell at me again for eating too much cereal. Note to parents - pick one already.    Ah, memories. Kids these days don't know what they're missing.
