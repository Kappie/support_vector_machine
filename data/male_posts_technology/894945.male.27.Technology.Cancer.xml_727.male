When it comes to coffee here, our choices are severely limited. Most of the populace wonder the streets in the morning, making a strange zombie-like noise, searching for precious caffeine to kick-start there cerebrum into action.  The local coffee houses keep a tight lid on the goods. They only serve us luke-warm, watered down mochas and keep the good stuff for themselves.   Only when you escape to the UK mainland can you find yourself in coffee heaven. I order a Venti Mocha and retreat to the corner of Starbucks, clutching my precious liquid and giggling deliriously. Clearly, like many others, I have a caffeine addiction and I need help.  Please come over to Jersey and set up a Starbucks here. Bring your fantastic mochas, your small but perfectly formed espresso's, and your tasty muffins and brownies.  The good people of Jersey will see the smiling, illuminated face of the Starbucks logo they will know it is good.  Regards,  Adam
