We implemented all the things mentioned in that article within hours of the redesign being launched and have been adding further hacks since. I've been meaning to write how-to posts for quite a while now and have finally got around to doing one. What with this and the long fabled Victoria Tunnel report allegedly coming on the same day you must be looking out of the window for the flying pigs now.  The first hack to be written up is the  On This Day  hack. That's because it is the simplest one to do, and by extension, the easiest for me to write up. So what does this hack do? Can you see the date at the top of the page? You'll notice it's a clickable link. The interesting bit is what it links to - the  On This Day  page at  urlLink Wikipedia  which has famous events, births, deaths and observed holidays from around the world all of which are linked to good articles on the subject. So for the effort of inserting a little bit of code in your template you automatically get a link of the day style thing for every day you publish a post. Note that you don't need to be using the new designs to use this hack - it works equally well on the old templates too.  Onto the hack itself.  The first stage is to ensure your dates are in the correct format. To do this go to the  urlLink dashboard  and then go to Settings / Formatting as shown here.   Set the date this format:   Set the date language to English. Mine is English UK but any of the English options should work.   Save your changes.  Now we are going to edit the template to put the JavaScript code in to do the date linking. Before you start you should back up your current template just in case there are any problems when you are implementing it. Done that? OK. Copy the following code and paste it just before the /HEAD tag in your template.  script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" function WikiOnThisDay(dateToMangle) {  var dateChunk_array1=dateToMangle.split(", ");  var dateChunk_array2=dateChunk_array1[1].split(" ");  if(dateChunk_array2[1].charAt(0)=="0")    dateChunk_array2[1]=dateChunk_array2[1].charAt(1);  return "a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/" +         dateChunk_array2[0] + "_" +          dateChunk_array2[1] + "\"" +          dateToMangle +          " small[Click it!]/small/a"; } /script  Now find this bit of code in your template...  BlogDateHeader h2 class="date-header"$BlogDateHeaderDate$/h2 /BlogDateHeader  ...and replace it with this code.  BlogDateHeader h2 class="date-header" script type="text/javascript" document.write(WikiOnThisDay("$BlogDateHeaderDate$")); /script /h2 /BlogDateHeader  Save your changes. You can now either republish the blog to apply the changes to the whole blog or just wait until you post next to apply the changes to any new pages created.   Feel free to use this code on your blog. If you do use it, it would be nice to get a mention and a linkback to  urlLink this particular post  would be even better so that other readers can see how to do it.
