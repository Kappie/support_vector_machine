"Well... it's a metal band... we'd better have the name 'Dead' in there somewhere." "Yeahhhh.... and, like, we've got soul, so we should put that in!!" "Duuuuuude... this is some gooood shit!!  Where did you get it??" "Cut it out.... we're naming the band!.... What else?" "Well... we're, like, primitive and shit.... Like on Survivor, where that guy ran around naked." "Yeah, they have two tribes... So we should be a tribe, cause we'd kick their ASS totally!!!" "Dude... This is some REAL good weed!!  Stop bogarting my bong!!" "Dude!!  Shut up and listen!!" "How about 'Tribe of Dead Souls'?" "Excellent!!"  ***** cut to next day *****  "Dude... I was soooooo stoned last night!!" "Yeah, we could tell... But only until we got high, too!" "Yeah... what did we decide on the name of the band??  You guys remember?" "There was 'Dead' in the title... and I think 'Soul'... and, what, 'Survivor'?" "No, man... 'Tribe'!!  That was mine!!  Rock on!!" "Yeah... "Dead Soul Tribe".... That must have been it." "Dudes!!  We rock!!" "We're gonna be bigger than Lionel Ritchie!!" "Dude... you need more weed!!"  Thus is named the Dead Soul Tribe.
