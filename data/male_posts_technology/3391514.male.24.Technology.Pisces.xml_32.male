A lot of the text needs revision though, as it is not particularly well-written.  Additionally, I got a blast from the past - well, two actually, as I spent some time playing  Disposable Hero  and  Project X .  For those who don't remember, they are venerable Amiga shooters in the vein of  R-Type .  Great fun, but the Amiga emulator has an awkward key configuration leading to hand ache.  It also seems like  Do Over  on Channel 4 has entered a second season or something, as the title sequence has changed.  Wow, that was exciting.  Can we do it again?
