Was surfing around just now and I saw Aikikai (Singapore)'s website, wah they actually went to the extent to post a certificate of Hombu's recognition certificate on their website. That's like ... wah liew ... such a cheapo thing to do. I really have no idea what they are doing lah ... but with all due respect to Hombu and the art, I think it really suxs. Brings down their image. I think the best way is to put it under the section "About Us" instead.  My goodness. ShinJu-Kai actually post a notice on their site saying that due to the pneumonia thingy, they're suspending classes for the next few practice. Looks like the case is really quite a big thing in Singapore now. And if anyone hasn't checked out ShinJu-Kai's photos page, I'd really suggest popping in for a look. They've got quite a few good shots of the whole event.  Tendoryu's website still hasn't got anything up yet. I'm eagerly anticipating what they are planning for their website.
