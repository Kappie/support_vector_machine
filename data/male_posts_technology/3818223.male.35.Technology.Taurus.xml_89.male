This concept has existed for at least a decade, and yet the world has seen no practical application.  It's time to put this theory into its obvious practical use, namely - programmable beer.  The way it would work is you would grab your beer from the fridge and say "Hey, Beer.  I said something stupid today.  Take care of it."  And the beer would target those brain cells rather than killing at random.  You could literally drink away an unhealthy relationship.  Before I apply for the patent, I'll need a name.  Nano-beer?  Botweiser?  Nanny-nanny-boo-beer?  I'm also having trouble with a slogan.  "Beer - it's not just for breakfast anymore" is the best I've come up with.  Any suggestions?
