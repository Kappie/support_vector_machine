Truth be told, I left the class hanging too, because the topic of the talk was geared more towards prayer and the sentiments in the Psalm rather than an exposition of I Sam 21.    However, since I posed the dilemma between David's apparent lack of trust in the Lord and his recorded sentiments in the Psalm, I'd like to offer up my solution.  Working from the evident first, I believe the Psalm to be inspired, useful and true.  The Scriptures command us to sing and speak the Psalms, not just the nice ones or the ones unconnected to any apparent sin.  David was not engaged in blatant hypocrisy when he wrote.  Therefore it remains to defend David's actions before Achish.    As with all Old Testament Bible Stories, this one is a type of Christ's story fulfilled in the Gospels.  David is consecrated in the tabernacle with a meal of the holy showbread, takes up the sword of the enemy (Goliath), and appears before the pagan king in the foreign land in exile.  There, he defeats the pagan king prophetically (in anticipation for the victories he will accomplish later when he has become king) through deception and self-abasement.  The antitype for this episode is Christ's humiliation and defeat, and subsequent deception of Satan through the Victory of the Cross.  This episode is played out a number of times through the Old Testament: think Abraham and Isaac with their wives before the pagan kings and Jacob with his father and Esau's blessing.  Each time deceit was used on a pagan tyrant to bring about his downfall (or prophesy it) and bless the deceiver.    And so the immediate response of nearly everyone is to cry "But lying is a sin!".  No, it's not (necessarily).  But why does it matter?  Who says the point of I Sam 21 is to give us an example of good or bad behavior?
