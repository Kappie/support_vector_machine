I won $20, my brother bought back in and lost it even faster than the first time. The only time I was below what I started with was just after the first hand I lost my $0.20 it took to call....then I won the 2nd, and 3rd hands, and didn't really lose again.  And today, I was in an online tournament, it started at 10 PM, I got knocked out around 12:30 or so. At the beginning, I lost 3 hands, and then kicked the ass of some poor schmuck when he went all in against my full house, aces over 9s. I was up to just over 2K. After that, I kept getting awesome hands and knocking people out left and right. I was doing pretty good until I got up to about 5K. Then I had pocket aces, and one person went all in in front of me, and of course, I called, I had about 2K left, the flop came A-K-10, 3 more people went all-in, of course I called, and I won $15K or so. Then 3 hands later, I got pocket kings! The flop came 2-9-K! some guy raised a couple hundred, I rereaised all-in, and 3 people called! So ummm, on that hand, I believe I was up to $30K or so. And so a little later on, I, again, had pocket aces, I raised a couple hundred on the flop. the majority of the people called. the flop, an amazing A-J-J. I flopped a full house. somebody bets a couple thousand, I call. the next card, a king. the chip leader at the time, he had like, 50K or so, went all-in, me, and 3 (!!!) other people called, guess who won over $70,000? That's right. Me. And I became the chip leader, with more than double of what the guy in 2nd had! And I remained the chip leader until the hand before I got knocked out! Here's the scenario for my last hand. I had 40K, I hold K-J off suit. the flop comes K-2-8, with 2 hearts, a guy raises 5K, I reraise all-in, he calls, and so does somebody else who had like, 5K total. So if I win this hand, I would win over $110K! the turn is a jack of hearts, which means that I have two pair, but there are three hearts on the board, and I didn't think that somebody would call 50K with a flush draw....the river is a 5 of diamonds or something. The otehr two guys lose miserably, and the guy who beat me, had q-8 of hearts...when I raised almost 40 thousand dollars, he had nothing but a queen high flush draw....and with the card that gave me two pair, he got his flush....and he won $111K. And I just stared in disbelief for about 2 minutes. And slowly walked into my room, hanging my head in shame. I won $1338, and took 36th place.  (Note: I used K's, instead of "thousand" or "...,000" because its shorter to type.)  And from what I understand, Tyler is holding a poker tournament on Monday the 5th, and I will proceed to kick some ass.
