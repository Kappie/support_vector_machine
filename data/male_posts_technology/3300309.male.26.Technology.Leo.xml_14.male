Every year, thousands of people gather around their TVs, waiting to see what bizarre creatures are brought out of the woodwork   Spain  Ricky Martin meets Shakin Stevens, a horrifying thought which shall not be dwelled on any more.  Austria  Boyband all the way from the Austrians, Attack of the Clones  Norway  The suit alone meant this guy should win.  His epic fist in the air actions during the more intense parts of his song only add weight to the argument.  Had a very Disney feel to this one, kind of expected a bunch of animals travelling along in the background.  France  My god, the Krytonians from the beginning of Superman provide backing singing while a white suited guy with cemented hair crones.  Oh and the bald lady on stilts only further emphasises how France, year after year, fail to win.  Serbia  Sam Beckett from Quantum Leap leaps into the fiddle players body.  A mystical flute fails to save this one which starts of well, because nobody was singing for the first twenty seconds or so.  Malta    Germany  A pretty good entry from the Germans, their Jamie Cullum clone did a good job with an adequate ballard, keeping up the male dominated show so far.  Not actually amusing, but then, that pretty much sums up the Germans doesnt it.  Albania  Albania make their first, and hopefully last entry in Eurovision, an English song which to me anyway, had a hint of Abba.  Alas, vocal skills appeared to be lacking and it was very, very cheesy. An epic bullshit guitar solo midway sealed its fate in my books.  Ukraine  As Terry Wogan puts it, Xena Warrior Princess.  In fact, an army of extras from Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome leap and shake their way through a very strange song indeed.  Kinda hard to pin it down. But still, a different effort from the Thunderdome extras.  Croatia  Spandau Ballet would be proud of this entry, including his appropriate attire.  80s ballards all the way.  Bosnia  Hertzgovina  The son of Billy Idol and a trio of transvestites provide the worst entry so far.  Belgium  Insane bongo busker provides backing percussion on this techno pop travesty.  The lead singers dress looks like its been through a hot wash when it should have been handwashed, got snagged on the spin cycle and frayed away.  A black guy with a Mohawk finishes off this bunch of lunatics.  Russia  Bronski Beat dancers give it all with this pop song which, I think, has a good.  Macedonia  A Derrin Brown lookalike beings with The Mighty Morphing Power Rangers, then he transforms into Elvis and Sgt Peppers Loney Heart Clubs Band style jumpsuit.  Cameo appearance by a priest and some strange ribbon bondage halfway through.  This one was awful.  Greece  Seigfried and Roy inspired the dance routine and dress of this entry, only wish the tigers would have turned up to finish them off.  Blantent attempt to show scantily clad woman to improve voting prospects, it worked for Turkey last year, why not.  The lingering memory of this one is armpit hair.  Iceland  Bland.  Ireland  Big ears, bad jacket begins this Westlife inspired piece of shit.  Four boy band clones provide backup singing.  This guy needs a stool.  Polish  Blue Café sings this song, a kind of lounge latin funk band.  Fantastic haircuts on the horn section and their guitarist and co-singer who looks like a cross between a Bee-Gee and Timothy Dalton from Flash Gordon. Spot the Terminator on drums.  Great Britain  James Fox minces through a truly bland song complete with some truly astounding nods, winks and notions towards the camera.  Suspect itll do OK.  Cyprus  A sixteen year old Cyprus girl from Gillingham in Kent sings the Cyprus entry.  A truly melodramatic love ballard, lots of arms outstretched and painful looks, you know the kind of thing.  Turkey  A latin-ska band and a true prick any singer.  I think Terry Wogan summed this one up what was that?  Romania  Well oiled male dances and scantily clad female singer with a  great 80s style mullet strut and grope their way around their song.  Lots of the songs this year had Latin beats, and this one is no exception.  Sweden  A song called It Hurts from the Swedes.  Ironically, that was exactly what I was screaming during it.  The winner was the Ukraine, the Thunderdome extras.   -------------------------------------------------------------------- mail2web - Check your email from the web at http://mail2web.com/ .
