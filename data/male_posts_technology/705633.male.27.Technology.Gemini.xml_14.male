If you too, want to take part in the sport of what I call 'Pro Street Sicking' then you must first learn how to produce the correct mix of stomach churning material. The following is a small example of the ingredients that made up this little winner:     1 deep fried chillie beef                                           1 chicken fried rice                                           1 sweet and sour sauce                                           3 vodka/orange                                           2 smirnoff ices                                           2 jugs of tequila sunrise, It is imperitive that once consumed, you mix the ingredients thoroughly by dancing and jumping around for about three hours!
