We haven't taken it in for its yearly healthcheck at PCWorld like we are supposed to. Oops.  Sorry, I thought you saw T3 on Monday when I did, just earlier. I saw it in the evening. Yes, shocking, I was in Croydon at 8pm! OMG! But Leon, Ema and James waited with me until I got on the bus which was nice. Like I said, I like having people all protective over me. Its nice.  Awww Tom. Have a virtual hug. I know, life is a bitch sometimes and its not fair when people are taken from us. I don't know to say that can help except that I have you in my thoughts.
