Me thought that I can wake up early saturday morning and compensate the time loss for the whole week..I took an oath (Think that was my 7th one this week) that I will get up early in the morning.  "Grrrriiiiinnnnggg   Grrrriiiiinnnngggggg, Oops!! what the hell is that man!! Switch that off you bloddy ..  " screamed my inner instinct.. but just managed to get up and swich off the alarm and ON the light.Once the light was on ,I cud see my provenance smiling at mee.. "come on buddy why struggle . Just come to me .. I'll make sure that you will getup with in 1/2 hr.." said my couch.So got frustrated and went to back to my day dreams ....  Time was 10:00 when I got up.. I cud see Moosa brushing his tooth.. and whose balsphemy made me realise that the same routine schedule happened and I missed my early morning studies this time tooo... got up got ready to buy my CAT application(the third time Iam gonna do this..), but ended up drooling for trisha in KTV, SUN TV , and all other channels. time was 12:00. no hope to make in time so dropped that plan... "ok .. its getting worse..." said my innervoice.Decided to give quants test and shut my room door. when I opened my book to give the test .... laaa la la la laa lala... rang our door bell(Its one of the loudest which can wake up the whole street..) went out and got my parcel from the courier wala... Opened it and found some medicine from my home... in the mean while cud see some good songs... "OOOps!! Not again.. its 1:00...." and my stomach started giving some weird noise.. felt damn hungry... but I did not give-up .. so fixed my ass on the chair and strted giving test.... after 50 min.. I felt damn hungry and was 3 questions away from finishing that test.. but gave up and verified with the results... hey!! It was a surprise .. I too fared well.... Went for lunch.. came back and slept for an hour.... Met my friends in the evening and when I was coming back... Cud hear someone screaming at me.... I turned around to see who it was.. but cud find none... again!! the same voice.. cursed me... who the hell is that !!  "Its mee " said my soul... "you screwed up this staturday also... "when will you stop doing this again and again...."... Abbe yaar Noooooo!!!! Not again !!! so waiting for the next weekend to indemnify the losses.. he! he! he!
