Cate, my Alaskan hump crumpet, and I went to see Peter Pan 's nipple , and not Seneca. No. That would be wrong, but anywhore, there was this boy there named Alex, (Methinks he may have been a mite prepubescent, but we don't have to talk about that...yet.) At the very end of the movie, he turned around, and we got to have an interesting conversation. Whee!   Alex Boy:  Hi, what're your guys' names?  Cate:  Hi, this is Fred  JaQ:  And this is Ralph.  Alex Boy:  Really....what grade are you guys in?  JaQ:  Second  Alex Boy:  Umm...cool.  JaQ:  Yeah...I'm a foreign exchange student  Alex Boy  Cool! From where.  JaQ:  ....Canada.  Cate:  *Laughs hysterically*  Alex Boy  *Gets up to leave* Call me!  JaQ:  Will do! Cate, what do you suppose is the number for the circus?  Cate:  *Laughs some more*  Exuent All   So yes, that was the highlight of my trip, that  nipple  conversation. That and, I got to redo my bedroom. It's green now. Hurrah! Also, I got to go to Cate's house. Sara and Becca were there, and we talked about lesbians somehow or another...and...something else that I can't honestly say I remember. Hmm...lessee...I feel as though I owe all of you a long post, but I really don't have much else to say, other than that *Inserts verbal plug*  Odd One Out 's next chapter is about eight pages long now, Katiefic is as good as dead, and I just killed Jessica. *Is stupid* Go me. Oh, I also have a bitchload of catching up to do. Like Mallmonkeys and such, so alas, alas, I have to depart. Goodbye Ben, and the newly joined Rosalie. I  lust after  love you both. G'bye.
