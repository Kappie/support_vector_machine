Visited a new bookshop in town today... a very depressing place.  Still, there were three of the Lensman series there - a series I recently became interested in following the acquisition of  GURPS Lensman .  And at only Â£1 a book I couldn't refuse.  Of course, the books were #3, #4 and #6.  Not much use, but a decent start anyway.  In case you hadn't guessed, I like to start at the beginning and work my way through.  that's why I'll only re-read the Lone Wolf series once I have the final two missing books.  I think its going to take me a while.  I also watched  The 13th Warrior  for the first time today.  I reckoned it was OK, and a decent example of what films can achieve without flashy CG effects.  It was interesting in that a friend once based a one-off RPG based on the movie.  In case anyone has seen the film and knows what on earth I'm talking about, my character surfed the river bit on the back of a whale.  Don't ask.  Finally, I've been having some ideas for renovation of my long-running GURPS campaign.  I tend to come up with new ideas every few months, and each revision keeps getting better and more refined.  Its been a "work-in-progress" for a decade now, so I'm very proud of what has been achieved.  Now, if only I could get the actual game to run!
