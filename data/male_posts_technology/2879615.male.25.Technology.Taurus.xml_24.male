BUt it turned out to be a nice day to drink yuengling and BBQ in the back yard.  The slip and slide is semi broken but it is still slidable.  Anywho, if you're not here drinking beer and eating food with us right now, you're beat!  Your Lord and Master, A-funk  "I love the sounds of cop sirens in my neighborhood..it's so soothing."
