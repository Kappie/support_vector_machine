I've been here before I recognize this feeling I could start crying at any moment And wouldn't be able to tell you why  It's a scary and unsetling feeling, really But also comfortable and familiar  Where's that smile You know, the one from not too long ago un-forced, un-fabricated Genuine and real  Lost. at least for the moment In this Funk
