With the much better weather we had today we made good time for the nine miles to Patterdale. We then set off to the hilliest part of our entire walk which included the highest peak. It was very hard work but we all seemed to cope quite well.   During the day we suffered a couple of injuries with Ed cutting his hands and Jim having a swollen knee which slowed him up at times. We will see how he is after a night’s sleep and the use of a knee support.   We have found a very nice place to camp wild for the night in a copse of sorts. We hope the rangers don't catch us. We will let you know. We are all very tired after a good eight hours trekking so I’ll say goodnight now.  Speak soon!  P.S. No signal in this woodland so you may get this update a little late.
