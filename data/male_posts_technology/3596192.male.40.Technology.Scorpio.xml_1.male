The Father's Day hummingbird feeder went up yesterday and within 10 minutes, the Ruby-throated hummingbirds had found it.   There is not enough time to blog everything that goes through my mind about Frog Pond. Five minutes of sitting on the porch swing provides a lifetime of material to think about and write about. Fortunately, it is a lot more fun to get out in to the land and work with it as opposed to write about it! Maybe when the land sleeps this winter I can catch up on my writing...   Every day I fall more in love with this place. The pace and the connection with the land is so much more interesting that life in the city. Maybe I will never go back...
