I have found so many pleasure on line, so many experiences with fantastic people. And what ??? This is not so magic, people are like me, I couldn't lie to myself.  I learn this, mistakes after mistakes, they are no so beautiful feelings here. This world is not so different, in fact, people doesn't lie to me, it's just me who want to see them so magic. When I meet you online on MSN my dear Juju, I really think you was an exceptionnal woman. You said no, but I doesn't hear you. After I met you in the real world in London, we've spend a great week and now I know you aren't an exceptionnal woman, you are just a woman (a pretty woman lol) with your own problems. And me I'm a just a man...  I know who is the real Juju and I can say only one thing... Juju, I love you like you are, You are my best friend, little sister. Big kiss to you, take care, and sweet dreams to you  Just a little song to you...      I'm sorry if I made you cry, if I said a lie,     I'm a just a man, please give me your hand     I have more to give, you have to believe     I'm a just a man, please give me your hand
