It is like solidfying the air. The air, we cannot touch. The air, we cannot see. Yet we know it is there.   That which is tangible, we call it reality. The abstract is like energy. The energy somehow gets transformed into an electron or a proton. A particle ! The tangible comes to life. A body losing life is similar to an electron losing its energy.   If there is one thing that is abundantly available in this universe, it is energy. Energy is beyond space. Simply because it does not occupy any.    It is difficult to comprehend the abstract , because "thinking", which is used for comprehension, itself is abstract
