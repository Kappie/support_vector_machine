Free Beer and food. fun time by all (cliff was there). Then we went to the music store to wait for traffic to die down, and Gary Payton came in and was looking through the DVDs. It was soooo cool:)   Yesterday, I played games with cliff till around 6:30 when Marc came over and we went and ate mongolian food. Then Cliff went to Hannah's and Marc and I played Galactic Battlegrounds. Then we watched Malcolm in the middle, which was funny, but I think it was a rerun. Afterwards we watched the last half of Half baked. and then marc went home and I finished up my second year of football.  Now it's new years eve and I'm at work. Check you latah- T
