Jen and I were talking to Mel via IM around 2 and she invited us to come over to Washington Square for a bit with her friend whose name suddenly escape me and the friend's boyfriend, Joe. Anyway, we went sperately, and when I got there, I found them up at the Summit foodcourt getting well, food. (lol) I asked them where they lived and they responded Beaverton and North Plains and we were talking about how they were similar to Danie and Jon cause they live about the same distance away when I look up and see... Danie. LOL It took about ten minutes for any of the to notice us, but Danie, Jaime, their mom, their cousins and Jon were all there.            When we were done eating and such, we went down to Victoria's Secret to see if Cherry was there... Alas, she wasn't so we went across to the Mac store and messed with their computers. Now, anyone that knows anything about the difference between Macs and PCs knows that Windows cannot be installed on a Mac... at least not without an emulator, but that's complicated and a lot of people have no idea how to do that. Anyway, following Steven's example from the last time, I remote logged into first my computer and then both Steven's and my computers so it looks to the untrained eye, like the Macs have windows on them. I got a lot of strange looks. ;)
