I also had a link for regular readers that was someone completing Super Mario 3 in 11 minutes, but the page is in Japanese and I can't translate the right link. If you're interested it's somewhere  urlLink here   All this morning's links have been blogged from this month's Edge magazine, which is in the shops now kids!  It makes a great Christmas gift, and is available from all good newsagents now...
