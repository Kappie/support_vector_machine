And to hear their story and testimony of how they went into the field.  To hear how God places someone in a specific circumstance for a specific time, for specific people... that's so much fun to hear.  And to hear how God transforms a heart to care for a specific country and group of people that they have never been exposed to before.  That is a God thing. Like Erwin said, "...people who can speak to what they have heard in conversation with God." Very fun.
