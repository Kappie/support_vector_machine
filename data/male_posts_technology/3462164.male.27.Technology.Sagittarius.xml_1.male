Randy lost the title to Vitor in January during the first round, after the doctor stopped the fight due to a corneal abrasion. I had the pleasure of meeting Randy in March, and his eye was totally healed. It's going to be a close fight, and even though lots of people expect Vitor to win, I wouldn't count Randy out, as he has proven time and time again that he has what it takes to beat the best. Expect to see my breakdown of UFC 48 this weekend, as I still haven't seen the matches.
