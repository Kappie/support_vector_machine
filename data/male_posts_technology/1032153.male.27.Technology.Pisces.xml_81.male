Supreme Court Bill - an abuse of power   (from Maxim's Weekly Email Real Issues)  In a rare front-page editorial, the New Zealand Herald today described the passage of the Supreme Court Bill as an 'act of breathtaking arrogance' and 'nothing short of an abuse of power'. Certainly there is no mandate for this outrageous constitutional change that could be law from next week.   A 63 to 57 vote in favour of the bill (a 52 percent parliamentary majority) is not a sufficient benchmark to pass a law of this importance. Earlier this week, United Future decided to oppose the bill claiming a lack of consultation and public support for the legislation. The Greens are supporting Labour because they share that party's desire to deconstruct the foundations of our Westminster system. In the private sector, the Companies Act requires a 75 percent majority of shareholders to change a company constitution - but no such checks exist in parliament.   Attorney-General Margaret Wilson claims New Zealand is the laughing stock of 'mature' nations, but we need a more robust basis for change than this lame and vague call to 'grow up'. We are witnessing an ideological steamroller in action to sever a 162 year-old right of appeal to an esteemed independent and international court.   There were 315 submissions to the select committee; 40 percent supported the new court and 54 percent wanted to retain the status quo. Among 38 submissions from Maori interests, only 4 supported a Supreme Court. 85 out of 86 local authorities opposed the move, as did 75% of the 103 oral submissions.   Margaret Wilson - a list MP - will control the appointment process. Direct political interference is likely, as is some compromise of the critical separation of the Executive and Judiciary. The court would also make us vulnerable to pressure from a human rights-driven agenda and international law, and will nudge us closer to becoming a republic - perhaps the real motive behind the bill.   Concerned New Zealanders should voice their opposition directly to MPs and in letters to the editor. Maxim's website www.maxim.org.nz has a letter wizard with links to the editor of every paper in the country as well as contact details for each MP. A Citizens' Initiated Referendum has been started which provides a final hope for the public to have a say - we encourage you to sign the petition which is available at: http://www.act.org.nz/action/campaigns/privycouncil/privycouncil_petition.pdf You will need the free Acrobat reader programme to view the petition: you can download it from http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html
