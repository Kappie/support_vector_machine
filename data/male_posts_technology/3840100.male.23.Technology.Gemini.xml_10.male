Things didn't really go as planned as we were hoping to actually get all of the vocal tracks finalized in one day.  That's the way it goes sometimes though.  Sometimes recording can speed right by other times it can take a real long time.  We'll see what happens this Saturday with the songs.  We should be able to get a good chunk done.  In other news regarding the studio, I'm looking to invest in some new mastering software plugins for my studio setup.  I'm not too sure if it's going to happen, but I'm leaning towards yes.  It would make everything sound a hell of a lot better when if comes time for the final mix. Of course the manufacturer has a great deal going on!!! Sure, why not splurge some more?!?!?!?!  Don't you want to live at your parents house for ever?!?! Don't you!?!?!  Anyways, besides cool stuff going on in the studio I did the typical Tuesday night deal: work out until my muscles are worthless then go sing karaoke in a smoke filled bar.  What a great surprise this time though.  NO SMOKE!!!!  I must be dreaming or something.  Actually the state of Massachusetts banned smoking in all public establishments so I can sing karaoke without getting my vocal cords wiped out and having to destroy my clothes when I return home.  The only drawback now is that the bars are more empty, but that will change as people get used to it.  Check out the local karaoke scene that I hit up if you are interested.
