But this morning I had a dream that I actually remember in some detail:  I was a member of a scientific team who were responsible for the development and launch of a probe to examine some sort of small object in space.  I don't really remember what, specifically, but it wasn't huge.  It seems like it was an asteroid or a comet.    Anyway, the probe we were designing was very cool.  It was a sphere at launch but once in space it broke into four wedges, like a quartered orange.  Each wedge was responsible for different scientific measurements and had antennae and solar panels which deployed when it split up.  It also had a very sophisticated thruster system, in that it was capable of countering external effects of Newton's  urlLink Third Law .  It was capable of precise movement in a single dimension and remain stable in the other two.  There was even computer-modelled imagery in my dream, showing NASA-like  urlLink simulations  of the probe's mission.    The funny thing was that part of the testing involved running piping and wiring through the interior of a  urlLink 1961 Lincoln Continental .  For some reason, this car had to be used for the experiment because if the  urlLink suicide doors .  Anyway, we had to move through the lab testing area by crawling through the car's interior.  Unfortunately, I woke up at this time and never got to see the undoubted success of our awesome probe, developed with the assistance of the  urlLink Lincoln-Mercury Corporation .    I blame this dream on influence from a dream from another friend of mine who shall remain nameless but not blameless, and is known for his up-fucked imagery.
