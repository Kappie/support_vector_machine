Such as life…  July 13, 2004 – the week started out pretty normal. I still had Pat coming in to perform handy man stuff to the house. The house painters had arrived and began to paint the exterior. They power washed the house and caulked. Before this occurred though I decided to remove the air conditioner unit from my bedroom window to the sills could get painted. I unplugged the unit and carefully removed the screws holding it in place. I then gently opened the window with a hand on the unit to keep it from falling. However as soon as the window was open the AC went flying out the window to crash some 40’ below. Pausing to look out the window I decided the AC was a lost cause, closed the window and went to work. Subsequently, I’ve had some friends laugh out loud over this incident. In retrospect it was funny, but still pisses me off, cause I only bought the unit to save on the electric bill. It’s all a loss due to the annihilation of the air conditioner.  July 14, 2004 – Went to work as normal. Started to work on the new system the office purchased. That’ll help understand the system better. I got home at the normal time and had an appointment to get more life insurance. The new job doesn’t have the life insurance coverage as the last one. I chose a Universal Life policy with a cash value. This should protect us for the next few years until the kids get out of college and the house is paid off.  July 15, 2004 – I went to the dentist for the first time in about two years. I’ve had difficulty finding a dentist I liked. No cavities. Nice boring teeth. LeaAnn took Nick to band practice at 9:00 a.m. The Fisher’s picked him up at noon. Thank God for them. It’d been a real pain to get Nick to practice and the dentist at exactly the same time.  The painters are working like crazy around the house. I don’t think they take any breaks. They work like dogs, to my advantage though. The rest of the day went normal.  July 17, 2004 – Saturday morning Nick and I went over to the school to help clean the concession stand. The area was in deep need of cleaning. We power washed the walls and floors. It’s amazing how much pigeons can crap. After about an hour or so into the cleaning I was getting quite frustrated at Nick for just loafing. I said some things to him but it didn’t help. I had thought perhaps it was me so I asked another volunteer to work with him. After about 20 minutes he came back to me to let me know that he understands why I was so frustrated. I then laid one on Nick letting him know is behavior was unacceptable and he better shape up. This sent him into emotional despair. I backed off and let him just hang out. When we got home I pretty much let him have it that his attitude sucked and he better shape up. He can be sure that he’ll be helping every dirty job the band has to offer until he learns.  That afternoon I worked on the garden from 3 until 8 pm. I finished weeding the garden and laid a thick layer of mulch down. It now looks great. I’m glad it’s finally done.  July 18, 2004 – Went to church. Lazy day.  July 19-23, 2004 – Not much happening. The painters finished painting the house. Pat finished the basement ceiling. Nick had a dentist appointment on Tuesday. He was informed he had four cavities. Thursday he went back to get them filled and his teeth protected. He now knows the pleasure of Novocain. Friday night I dropped the civic off to get the brakes replaced. I then went to dinner at Chin Chin’s with David and Taylor. (neighbors and good friends).  July 24, 2004 – The house is a pigsty and C is coming home Monday. Oh well! Nick spent the morning packing and getting ready for band camp. I picked my car up at 3:00 and took him to target and Linen’s and Things to get him some things for his trip. Almost $200 later he’s all ready. New portable CD player, food stuff, pillow and sheets for dorm beds. Also a new CD from itunes. We dropped off his luggage at school around 6:00 pm. Said “Hi” to a few of the fellow band parents and off we went.  Sunday morning we slept in. Dropped Nick off at 12:30 and away he went to band camp. I hope he’s having fun. Got a call around 11:00 pm that he arrived safely. It was raining on the trip to camp. This only caused minor delays.  Spent the rest of the day picking up the house and cleaning. I mopped the kitchen floor, power washed the cement walkway in front of the house. To the best of my ability the house is clean.  July 26, 2004 – Carol and the kids come home. Hurray they are home. Great celebration. I’m so glad to see them. Went to Long Horn for dinner. I didn’t feel like cooking.  The rest of the week went normal. Carly has soccer camp this week and a sleep over Friday. So it all starts just like it left off.  July 30, 2004 – Nick comes home today. Carly goes to her sleepover. Another busy day managing the kids.
