Since I am not as erudite or suave as some of my favorite bloggers, I will start out simply by posting daily events and thoughts in my life.  Here is my picture, it's almost four years old so I will post a more current one when I get around to it.    I spend a lot of time perusing the internet for news and information and can never seem to get enough.  I doubt that my simple site will satiate anyone's thirst for information but here it is.   -- Chip
