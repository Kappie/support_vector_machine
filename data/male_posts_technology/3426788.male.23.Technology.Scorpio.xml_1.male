How about spelling them correctly in Single chance … in front of a big audience in Grand Hyatt Washington. Hats off to you. If you’ve guessed it. No … I ain’t talking about GRE and TOEFL and BARRONS or CAPLAN Tests. This is National Spelling Bee 2004. The winner was David Tidmarsh, a 14 yr old Indiana boy. David, an eighth-grader at the public Edison Intermediate Center in South Bend, won the top-prize package of $12,000 and an engraved cup from the bee, plus an additional $5,000, encyclopedias, a $1,000 savings bond and a reference library from other sponsors  Whoa … Nothing get bigger than this. I was flipping channels ,trying to find out some value based entertainment. Discovery was showing the re runs. National Geographic was a passé. Suddenly I saw this competition on ESPN 2. I couldn’t resist myself. I put aside all the work I was doing (lol How bout David J. Kruglinksi’s Inside VC++). My eyes were glued to idiot box (Very often I find myself in this situation if Baywatch is not playing or Swimsuit illustrated Pageants are not showing).   I was loosing it totally … Couldn’t spell better than them. At the end when David hide his face behind his placard then I found myself standing and clapping with the same enthusiasm as David’s mother.   These contests are amazing. Intel science fair or National Spelling Bee or Any other talent exams…. It shapes up your mind, character. It strengthens you to face any challenge, overcome any adversity. Talk about prizes, name, and fame … It’s a serious Addiction …  Let me tell you Addiction of fame is the dangerous amongst all types of addiction. You start to feel more n more hungry or thirsty for that share of limelight …. The worst situation to be in than any Man Eater Leopard/Tiger.  I know it better than many of my peers. Once you reach to such plateau it is very hard to come down or thinking of descending. Once you’ve been there for years and years then it is very hard to fathom the defeats, it is callous to accept the failures.  But every trough has a crest to follow and vice versa. That’s why life is interesting and it is not monotonous.   I wouldn’t ever trade my multidimensional (add dimension of time also) life to any other dull, monotonous, droning lifestyle. I think to feel the zephyrs of success whirling around you  then face the calmness, coldness of failures and carrying the torch of hope to find that warmth shanty of success is the essence of life. Mansions of successful lives are built upon the foundation of failures and sagacity and erudition derived from them.
