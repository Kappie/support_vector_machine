After the initial embarrassment, they both manage to get to  sleep, the woman on the top bunk, the man on the lower.  In the middle of  the night, the woman leans over and says, "I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm  awfully cold and I was wondering if you could possibly pass me another  blanket." The man leans out and, with a glint in his eye, says, "I've got better idea - let's pretend we're married."  "Why not?" giggles the  woman.  "Good", he replies. "Get your own f***ing blanket."
