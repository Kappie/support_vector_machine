I was so touch not because it is a romantic film, it is because it dwells so much on how we, human beings, rely so muchon destiny and fate. As the film progress, it was visually interpreted that a person has to work on what he/she wants and destiny will just be his/her side.    There was ascene in the movie that strikes me most, where Sara's bestfriend was in a confrontation with Sara herself, she mentioned that if destiny do really exists, and that everything in this enormous world has a plan already, then why don't we just sleep all day and let destiny work its way?    This kind of belief is sometimes misinterpreted by most people, that our lives has a already been planned. It might be a force or a being, regardless of what we believed in, it is a reality. Most of us look for signs and signals from these forces, a sudden drop of rain in a hot sunny day is interpreted as a good sign, to sight an example.    I know someone who is so devoted to this belief, that his life has been planned already. He gets into a relationship because he believes there a sign has been given to him that the girl he has met is meant to be his love of his life. He does eveything to his ability to keep the relationship going, even to the extent of losing his interests in dating some other girls. He is though still young and unemployed. When the girl told him to look for a job, so he did just to please the one being destined to him. His life goes on for so many years keeping the relationship together and even planned for their marriage until one day he met another girl. It was an unexpected meeting, he meet an old friendon his way home who was with someone who attract his attention. His friend is working in the same building, just a floor aheadwhere he is working and the girlis her officemate. From that day on, the three of them go out together for lunch and get to know more about each other. He became fascinated with the girl's charm that he can't stop thinking about her but he tried not to because his inner self is keep on telling him that he has someone already. He has never felt that way before in his entire life, like he has met someone who might be his soulmate. But he is also telling himself that her girlfriend ishis soulmate. He can tell the difference of the feeling whenever he is with his grilfriend or whenever he is with the other girl. He was so consumed with his destiny that he has not been able to explore the reality that there is so much in this world that he has not discovered. The dilemma continues until today.    I will just focus this issue on relationship itself. Just an observation, most guys or girls marry because they have to, because they have set time for theirselves that at this certain age they have to be married, something of a societal issue.A fact also is that if you don't have a girlfriend or a boyfriend at a certain age, expecially older, you are either gay or just a hater of a relationship. We believe so much about what other people say or what the forces has installed for us that forget to believe in ourselves. What dowe really want? What dowe really need? Most relationship are stable not becausethey want to but because they have to. Both parties tries to build a beautiful family because it is the next phase of life after being single and because they believe they are destined to do so. We became to fixated to the destiny being laid upon us.    There are so many choices in this world that we haven'tchoosen and most of these we either painfully or have to pick. After all, it is either we say sorry for ourselves or live with it because the fact is, we chose it.
