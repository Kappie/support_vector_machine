Actually the karaoke night just started so in a couple of weeks the shit should be filled with freaks and geeks.  Hmmm, I sure hope they're tasty!  Played darts there as well and surprisingly, I still have game with darts.  I am seriously thinking about going back to the dive bar that is The Gables and participating in some of the tournaments that I haven't been involed in for the last few months.  That should be cool.  I wonder if any of the cute girl dart players that were there last time I was around are still there.  Hmmm...  After North Beach (which was shitty) we drove by  urlLink Champs  to see what was going on.  Well nothing was going on there so we went to  urlLink The Lodge in Lisle .  Again it was fucking karaoke.  This one was pretty cool though.  No matter how bad someone was, they would sound absolutely incredible with a live band playing behind them.  My favorite was this one chick, Carissa or something like that.  She had a nice body and a nicer booty!  Ooo La La.  Nice rack too if I may say so!  Well she got up there and sang her own rendition of Marvin Gaye's Let's Get it On.  And DAMN she was good.  I wanted to get it on with anyone worth looking at right then and there.  Well I still do but that's something else.  Wow she was good looking and can sing.  I tried to say Hi but she was moelsted by her boyfriend that was there.  And guess what?  I learned my lesson with girls with boyfriends.  Hmmm.  So later on I just waved Hi and got a wink back and then I left.  I suppose that is my night.  No dates or anything but then again I wasn't really planning on going out with anyone anytime "soon"  Wednesday tough is CINCO DE MAYO.  I had plans and shit for this night but as we all know those fell through.  So now, since I am going on vacation starting at 6 PM Wednesday I am on vacation.  Albeit a short one, I'm still going to release as much stress as I can and possible be a HO (as my sister aply put it) as much as I can.  I doubt that it's going to make it to the blog for "protection" reasons. but we'll see how things go!  I'm "excited"  Possible going to the Lodge again for some drinks.  Still wieghing in on staying out here compared to going to Iowa.  I miss my little boy.  I want to play with him and take him to the Zoo or read a book for him or watch a cartoon with him or just play with him and his toys.  It should be fun.  I don't quite know what I'll be doing but I think I'm leaning towards going to see him this weekend.  If I do stay out here there should be enough to do like going downtown and visiting a club/bar like I used to and just living it up.  Vicki also mention something about doing something.  We'll see I guess.   Yah, no more rambling.  Time fer bed.
