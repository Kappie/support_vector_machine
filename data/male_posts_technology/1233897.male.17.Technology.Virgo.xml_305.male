I've also completely circumvented the lock on the office door, and have gotten the serial numbers of the keys for both locks so I'll be able to make copies whenever I need to. I've left myself a route of access into my supposedly locked room though I may or may not need to use it as I've convinced my parentals to allow my computer outside of the room, though it remains un-networked, and as such, not connected to the web. I have a plan for circumventing that too, two plans actually, both of which are already starting to go into affect. All I really need right now is a bit of luck and a half hour with the house to myself. I also still have keys to every car except my mom's new one even though my mom thinks I don't have any of them.
