I have seen few people in my life more respectable or confident in what he was doing.  Made me feel older, more professional myself.  Funny the places inspiration strikes.  It's utterly surreal that my brother is getting married this summer.  He's always been somewhat distant from me, but then I feel I've always been somewhat distant from my life in general.  These brief islands of meaningful family events crop up every now and then, but it's far from the photo-album impressions of adulthood I had in my youth.  I guess this is part of my passage into manhood, letting go of the dream that I'll suddenly wake up one day and know what's going on.  I hate terms like passage into manhood and coming of age, but I can't help but chuckle at the truth of them when I come out the other side.  Whoever is writing this story of mine sure has a funny sense of irony.   The highlight of an otherwise disappointing (1:5 odds my ass) and depressing day (good-bye, Gipper) had to be the discovery that I know how to make pizza.  This noble task had always fallen to my brother when we were children, but I surpised myself and my parents for reinventing the not-quite-from-scratch art of pizza making in the Powell House.  Beats the Crispy Chicken from Burger King I had for breakfast.  For those of you who don't know me, I am one of the few people I've ever met who has a bitter dislike with breakfast foods.  Muffins, bagels, eggs of all textures and viscosities, toast, fruit, pancakes, waffles, and worst of all breakfast ceareal - long have these morning delights plagued my strange and twisted stomache.  When I get up in the morning all I want is a burger.  Is that so unusual?  If you were starving in the desert which would you rather, a bowl of cold, mushy, sugar-satured grains, or a pound of sizzling beef draped in the warm embrace of cheese?  I must admit, I was a part-time vegetarian during my college years, but the thought of breakfast foods for breakfast still ran chills through my bones and waves of nausea through my stomache.  Anyways.  I'm off for an icecream sandwich and some tums.  Maybe that'll cheer me up.
