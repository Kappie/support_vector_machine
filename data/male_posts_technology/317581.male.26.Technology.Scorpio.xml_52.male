Anyway, I highly suggest seeing it, if you haven't. It was Cahlen's first time, kinda. He'd seen the end b4.  I so want money to spend, but I don't have any cause of bills and the shitty economy:( C'est la vie...  You ever notice how we are never quiet anymore? Like, I can't remember the time I went outside and looked at the night sky. Also, I'm used to way more personal time, and I never get it (*one of the funny things living with 4 other guys*). But besides that, it's weird with the whole, personal time vs. lonely time, cause when you get personal time one can sometimes feel lonely. But other times, you're like, I just want to be alone. 1 of the things I've learned to do, is always have stuff for personal stuff time. Like I now have about 5 books that I have lined up to read. Now, I just need the vacation time to read them all.
