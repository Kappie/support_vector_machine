The system basically states a set of rules on which to buy a stock (being recently upgraded in status by a Broker is the main criterion)... and tells you to sell it automatically when it reaches a 1% gain. So, I buy a stock in the morning at $15.00 and set it to automatically sell at $15.15. Minus some commission, you make a little under 1%.  I am using  urlLink http://game.marketwatch.com  to track my results with fake money of course. Unfortunately, it has been brought to my attention that MarketWatch has some bad bugs in the software. Just as a precaution, I am also calculating my trades in an excel spreadsheet based on the buy price, sell price, commission costs, total percent gains, and current balance.  I will post my stock picks at the end of each day to let you know how they do. The "system" that I am testing states that it takes an average of 3 days for your stock pick to reach 1% gains... we'll see how it goes.
