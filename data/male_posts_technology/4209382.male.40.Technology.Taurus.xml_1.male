Al-Sadr and his militia, known as the Mahdi Army, have been fighting with U.S. coalition and Iraqi forces in the holy city of Najaf for over a week. Al-Sadr is holed up in the Imam Ali Mosque, the holiest Shiite site in Iraq. A delegation for the Iraqi National Conference yesterday visited Najaf to try and negotiate an end to the uprising with al- Sadr, AP reported. The delegates were unable to meet with him, though did meet his aides, AP said. While U.S. troops are operating with Iraqi forces in Najaf, only Iraq's security forces will be allowed to enter the Imam Ali Mosque, interior ministry spokesman Sabah Kadhim last week said in a telephone interview from Baghdad.
