I have tried many a time to come to terms with myself, but only in vain.   I know I have a future, but I dont what the hell it looks like. People say that I can shape my future, but I dont know how. Even if I know, I dont know what should be the shape. I can become an excellent software developer, a successfulentrepreneur,a provocative writer or something else. But I just dont know what I  WANT  to become.   And talking of my present, I said that I am confused. But at the same time, I am a pretty happy man. I dont have any serious problems in life, apart from the fact that I am confused. I think I can continue on in this state for quite sometime because I am happy and I can endure the confusion. Basically, there is no strong urge from within to change my life. And when I look out, I see lots and lots of people like me - confused, but not ready to change their life. Some of them are even disillusioned and depressed with life, but continue in the same state, as if obeying Newton's second law.   And above all this confusion, I now want to have a blog for myself. I dont know why and I cant imagine myself getting too much out this. I hope the readers can throw some light (or something) on how I can use this blog to fight my confusion.   Sumanth
