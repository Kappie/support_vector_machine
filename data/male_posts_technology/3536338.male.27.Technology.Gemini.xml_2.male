Well, I get into the store and I grab the apple juice boxes (way over priced) and I go to stand in line, it's pretty busy for this time of morning, about 10 or 15 people about, so there was a small line, and I'm standing there minding my own bussiness, you know, reading the headlines from star, the enquierer and so forth, oh and cheking out which magizine had more on the cover about sex then the others.. and all of a sudden there is a hand on my shoulder, so I turn and it's roger.. in case you all didn't see in my last post my wife of 6 years (11 year relationship) took off to live with another guy, but I also found out that she was sleeping with another guy at her work (witch was this same small market, and the guy's name of course was roger) so there I am, caught in a torrid of things to do, I turned and he asked me "so hows laura" (laura is my x-wife) now I'm thinking to my self I wonder how many times I can hit him before he stops moving, but instead I allowed self control to win out and simply said "get your fucking hand off of me or I'll shove it up your A$$!, which he did of course and slinked off into the back of the store, still it left me very angry and wondering how much of this shit I can take before I finially snap. Then I brought my kids to school and went and picked up my bike (84 honda shadow 500) at the shop, and headed to work. Thats all for now, tune in next post for more from my sorta life.
