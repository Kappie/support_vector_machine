 This is a huge problem.  After all the reorganization and restructuring, our intelligence agencies are still unable to clearly prove that a particular country poses a threat to our own.  Working off assumptions and making guesses, our intelligence community allowed the Bush administration to pull the wool over congress' eyes.  Senator John D. Rockefeller IV's (D-WV) quote pretty much sums it up:
 
  "...our credibility is diminished, our standing in the world has never been lower." 
 
 I think the most frustrating part is that Bush won't do anything about it.  He decided to send young men and women into a hostile environment, close to 900 of which lost their lives.  How can he not be upset that the foundation for this decision was based on evidence that simply did not exist?  He took our country to war because the intelligence community failed to do their job.  
 
 If I were him, I'd be pissed.  There's nothing worse than your subordinates maneuvering you into a bad decision with their own incompetence.  But he insists on remaining loyal to his people.  Bush might gain some credibility by actually firing the people who are ultimately responsible for all of these mistakes: George Tenent (already gone), Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz...  Instead, he refuses to admit that his administration has made a mistake.  Worse, he refuses to admit that  he  made a mistake.  This isn't leadership.  This is the story of one jerk hanging on to power by his fingernails such that he can continue to pad the wallets of his friends, family, business associates and other cohorts.  It's time for this to end.
