        urlLink MSN Messenger  is my best friend. Well, several very good friends, anyway.  I find myself chatting online with my friends in Japan several times a month.  The slick little MSN Messenger program is the face and voice of many of my friends that I don't get to see anymore.  Because of the time difference between here and Japan I am usually up long into the morning hours, but I enjoy the connection so much that loss of sleep is a small price to pay.   Tonight I was lucky enough to catch both my friend in Japan, Yu, and my friend in Wisconsin, Sarah, online. It was really good to catch up with them both.  I have actually seen Yu more recently that Sarah, and Yu is almost exactly at the farthest point on this planet from me, while Sarah is only a few hours drive away.  The world is very small.
