I would wager that over 90% of people in America over the age of ten are more than passingly familiar with that song.  Certainly they would know the first three lines at least, which set up the rhyme at the end.  The final and pertinent line of that stanza was made ever more prominent by Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s impassioned  urlLink "I Have a Dream" speech:    And so let freedom ring -- from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.  Let freedom ring -- from the mighty mountains of New York.  Let freedom ring -- from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.  Let freedom ring -- from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.  Let freedom ring -- from the curvaceous slopes of California.  But not only that.  Let freedom ring -- from Stone Mountain of Georgia.  Let freedom ring -- from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee. Let freedom ring -- from every hill and molehill of Mississippi, from every mountainside, let freedom ring!  But our illustrious president, the most successful C-student in the country, not only flubs his line but does so with indelible ink!   urlLink You've heard the story , now  urlLink see the evidence .  Okay, so misquoting/misspelling is hardly an impeachable offense but it does speak to just how disconnected and dim this man is.  And then all those high-priced flaks in the White House not only miss the error, they unwittingly flaunt it by pushing the image out into the mainstream!  Surely not all Republicans are that stupid, are they?  I mean, is this really the best they can offer?    No.  It's not.  But Rove/Bush's scorched earth campaign against McCain in the GOP primaries of '00 crushed that decent man's chances of higher office.  And now, mark my words, W will go the way of his daddy: once around the block and then home.
