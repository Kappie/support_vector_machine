Is never good for you? * I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in public * I'm really easy to get along with once you people learn to see it my way * I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter (deja vu ay Millty?) * I'm out of my mind, but feel free to leave a message ... * I don't work here. I'm a consultant. * It sounds like English, but I can't understand a word you're saying * Ahhh ... I see the screw-up fairy has visited us again ... * I like you. You remind me of when I was young and stupid. * You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers. * I have plenty of talent and vision. I just don't give a damn. * I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth. * I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you. * Thank you. We're all refreshed and challenged by your unique point of view. (sounds like a Perception Chronicle to me! ;) * The fact that no one understands you doesn't mean you're an artist. * Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental. * What am I? Flypaper for freaks!? * I'm not being rude. You're just insignificant. * It's a thankless job, but I've got a lot of Karma to burn off. * And your crybaby whiny-ass opinion would be...? * Do I look like a people person? * This isn't an office. It's Hell with fluorescent lighting. * I started out with nothing and still have most of it left. * Sarcasm is just one more service we offer. * You've always wanted to be someone? You should have been more specific. * If I throw a stick, will you leave? * Errors have been made. Others will be blamed. * Whatever kind of look you were going for, you missed. * I'm trying to imagine you with a personality. * A cubicle is just a padded cell without a door. * Can I trade this job for what's behind door #1? * Too many freaks, not enough circuses. * Nice perfume. Must you marinate in it? * Chaos, panic,  disorder ... My work here is done. * How do I set a laser printer to stun? * I thought I wanted a career, turns out I just wanted paychecks.
