I am not talking about minor ones like ‘what to eat for dinner’ or even ‘how I wipe my butt.’ I am speaking of pro and con decagons, such as ‘be late for work or play games’ or more importantly ‘Money or EQ.’ Those are the hard decisions of life. The decisions that define who you are and your lot in life. Play EQ, be late for work, lose job, no money and then, utterly no EQ. The small change to the decision such as play for ‘X’ amount of time and then go to bed is just beyond us. We get online after kid goes to bed and we just play. We get so engulfed within the game that even though we are less than a yell apart we don’t talk we /tell each other. “/tell Ziggur how are you today?” We wait to the very last minute to go to the bathroom and we do the dance to the toilet letting it flow. We wait till we are dehydrated or until we see the other already up and dehydrated to get another pop.  I personally have come to the utter in geekness. To such a degree that I can’t stand being myself. I dream of EQ, I can’t wait to go home to play EQ. Even at work I think in EQ. When I want to laugh my mind spits out ‘LOL’. There was one time yesterday that I even laughed the letters of LOL in my laugh. Humiliating. When I get mad at a computer my mind say ‘WTF yo?’ When I am speaking with coworkers my mind says ‘/g.’  There comes a time in every girl’s life that she just has to put down EQ. Will I be strong enough? Probably not. Will I even try? Probably not. However the first step is just admitting it. I have completed the first step now and am quite proud of myself and also satisfied.  Ackron – Ziggur! Wait for Backup!!
