(though fun it has been)  So what has Dougle been up to??? Well I have been busy sorting out buying my new property and it's not an easy task It should have all gone through and have been sorted by last Friday unfortunatly the Lawyers (excuse my Language) decided not to look at my case file until 4 days before court only to find out that all the boundries where not catalogued at the town hall properly as it happens the property has been owned by the same family ever since it was built in the victorian ages and 50 years ago the states of jersey compulsary purchased all its land to build some crappy states flats without sorting all the boundry rights so the sale couldent go ahead. ***Yawn*** sorry I think I'm boring myself Anyhow hopefully it will all go ahead in the next week or so and the summer chato Toaster Files will be created. The back yard on the new property is big enough to fit 2 coaches with room to spare. I have been out an bought the largest Garden table a chairs I can find plus some big out door Gas heaters so It will be a summer of BBQ's, Drinking, Bekini's and parties the summer through  Watch this space for updates.
