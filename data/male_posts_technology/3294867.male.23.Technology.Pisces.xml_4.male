On the trip I got to visit the Polynesian Culture Center, great place, but it sucks that they force the Mormon lifestyle, read in no caffeine and no alcohol, on their visitors. They could make a killing if either of those were made available. Ah well such is life though. Just in case you were wondering about the night life in Oahu, lets just say there is not a bar in Hawaii without a Karaoke machine somewhere in it, I tried to avoid the horrible singing Asian "Want to be American Idol" thing, but no matter where I went, always karaoke was there before me.   Oh and the title, the great burn, well during the trip I did not have much time to enjoy the (perfect) Hawaiian weather since I spent most days inside. On Sunday, our last day there, my girlfriend decided we should go snorkeling. NEVER GO SNORKELING WITHOUT SPF 400 ON. Trust me, my back is now lit up like a stop sign and at night it fuses to the bed... very not sexy.   All in all though, I enjoyed every last bit of Hawaii from eating Octopus and Eel at Sushi King (name harkens bad sushi, but was very good, Mike swears) to burning at Haunama Bay (which is the number 1 beach in the US by the way). I would do it all over if just for the extra time there.
