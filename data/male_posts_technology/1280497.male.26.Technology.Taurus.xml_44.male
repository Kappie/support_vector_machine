One of them was  urlLink this blog , which is about the RU-21 pill that's supposed to make your hangover go away, and I started reading it, and I thought maybe I'd learn something new.  But then I started to realize that, wait a second, this blog reads very similarly to a lot of those funny pharmacy emails I get every two minutes or so to my hotmail account.   So yeah, it turns out, the blog is bogus. But it's also totally cool, because it's a pristine example of someone deciding that this whole blogging craze could be a great tool for marketing, but also not being familiar enough with the idea to do it convincingly. I'm not even talking about the prose--sure, it's a little awkward and it jumps from one tone to another--but more interesting is the blogger Jack's process of "discovery" about the drug that he attempts to portray through the blog.  In the first entry, he puts the link to a place to buy the pill. In the second entry, he asks if anyone has tried it. The sixth entry he says it sounds interesting, but he doesn't know what it is (Jack's unrecorded thoughts: I don't know what the drug is. But I think I'll start A BLOG about it). The fifteenth entry, he says "I'm such a serious drinker that it's appalling, really, that I haven't gotten my hands on any of the stuff yet." Um, I've heard you can easily buy, let's see, six pills for 5.29, plus a free pill case. Wanna know where I got that hot info, Jack? Fourteen entries ago, in this very blog.  On the 21st entry of the blog, we're in business. Jack has tried the pill finally, and it's available at www.ru-21.cc, which happens to be the root address of the blog itself. It's always in the last place you look, you know?  24th entry: Jack says, "I just ordered some, thanks for the site info." "You're very welcome, me"  The thing I like about Jack is that he's a  really  fast worker. To recap, he was able to do the following:  1. not know anything about the RU-21,  2. research and learn a great deal about how it works,  3. learn where it's available, and 4. actually buy and try the stuff, and report on the results.  I reviewed the times at which he posted these entries, it turns out that he was able to do all this within the world-record timespan of less than  fifteen minutes!  This man is out of this world. I mean, I've been staring at the blog for, what, 20 minutes now?, and I haven't even bought one pill yet. What's wrong with me? Are there any pills to cure what I have?
