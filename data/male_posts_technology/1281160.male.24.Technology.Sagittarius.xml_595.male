I promised them I will look at a few houses, which of course I did. They saw a few houses and didn't like them.  I guess Rajesh will be posting about his house-hunt shortly.  Today, Had a surprise. Vijay Babu was in town. After lunch, I left him at a browsing center to spend his time.   More later.
