America has ventured forth into space for the same reasons."   But the president didn't mention that members of his administration view space as the next frontier for military buildup and conquest.  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld chaired the Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Organization four years ago, releasing its findings in January 2001. Rumsfeld's report found that "we know from history that every medium -- air, land and sea -- has seen conflict. Reality indicates that space will be no different."  The panel also concluded that "given this virtual certainty, the [United States] must develop the means both to deter and to defend against hostile acts in and from space."  The president's focus on space exploration because it "improves our lives, and lifts our national spirit." However, behind the scenes, USA Today reported that Bush was persuaded to move forward in part due to the military benefits, as promoted to him by Vice President Cheney.   The Center for American Progress' Progress Report yesterday noted an appearance by Republican Congressman Tom Feeney on Scarborough Country where he stated, "Somebody is going to dominate space.  When they do, just like when the British dominated the naval part of our globe, established their empire, just like the United States has dominated the air superiority, ultimately, whoever is able to dominate space will be able to control the destiny of the entire Earth."  Feeney's comments echo PNAC's September 2000 report Rebuilding America's Defenses, which said, "Much as control of the high seas - and the protection of international commerce defined global power in the past, so will control of the new "international commons" be a key to world power in the future."    urlLink -Bush Aims for Mars to Dominate Space Militarily
