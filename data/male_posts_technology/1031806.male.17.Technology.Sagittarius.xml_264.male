I went, watched Space Jam and ate food. lol  My dad just got my mom a replacement for her aging van - exact same car as mine, down to the year and the color. LOL Buuuut... she's got aluminum rims :) :) I'm stealing those... Oh, and her's might be a V6 rather than a V4, in that case we'd prolly just switch cars... teenagers like acceleration and she drives more than I do and would enjoy the fuel economy.  I'm currently obsessing with  Jimmy Eat World - the Authority Song  and    the Offspring - Amazed    Sometimes I think I'm gonna drown Cause everyone around's so hollow I'm alone Sometimes I think I'm going down But no one makes a sound They follow And I'm alone Yeah if I make it I'd be amazed Just to find tomorrow One more day and I'd be amazed Just to see it waiting And if I make it I'm still alone No more hope for better days But if I could change Then I'd really be amazed And when you know you can't relate To one more shiny face Your heart breaks No one cares And when you know you can't go on Cause everything is wrong Your heart breaks But no one's there
