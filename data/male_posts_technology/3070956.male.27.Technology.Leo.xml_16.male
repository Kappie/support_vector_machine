She's moving to Savannah, GA with her boyfriend Aaron and I'll miss knowing that she's right here near me in Pittsburgh, PA.  To say goodbye, we met in Shadyside and had drinks and dinner at a place called  Bites and Brews  on Ellsworth Avenue.  It was pretty cool - they have no menu items really - you put together your sandwich with any combination of their ingredients that you ask for.  They have a nice selections of beers and the prices were great.  -Ryan Riehle
