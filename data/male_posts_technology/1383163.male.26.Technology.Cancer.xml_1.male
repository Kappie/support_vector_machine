Admittedly,  urlLink  M  's comment on one of my earlier posts in  urlLink  a2d   really got me motivated to go ahead and do it.  So what are we gonna do here?  This blog will deal with anything and everything about powerpoint. About how to make the best use of this really imaginative tool from the Gates Factory. After all, powerpoint is a great tool - and its basic idea is not really about corporate presentations or boardroom manouevres. It's essentially a great communication medium that can be used to present just about any thought/idea that any person might have. I have seen powerpoint presentations that have used a play of simple objects (text/images/sound) to convey anything from humour to concepts to promoting social causes.  And the best part is that - it's so absurdly simple! Anyone with a lil imagination and basic familiarity with powerpoint can go ahead and make a mind blowing presentation that hits the nail on the spot.  That's what we want to do, right?
