Well today the   X   says to me "So you don't have the presidential conference calling today?"    "I said no it is just me! Why do you have a problem with me letting Karissa talk to her family?"   She then says "no I think it can overwhelm Karissa."   I replied "if you would call her family and let her talk to them I would not have to!"   She then says "if it is your family that is one thing but it is different when you get my brother and his wife involved!"   I finished that line of discussion with "well I did not hear your brother or his wife complaining considering they wanted to talk to Karissa and you don't call them either!  In addition I am an adult and no one will tell me what to do!" As you recall that last part is the   X's   new motto so I got a great big "OH I SEE HOW IT IS!! Well I will keep that in mind!"  So today when I talked to Karissa she was in the tub.  She told me about how she had found more worms.  Then she had also found a frog and some tadpoles.  I told her that the tadpoles were baby frogs and would grow legs and become frogs and that excited her a lot.  She asked me if I wanted to come see them which of course I said yes!   We exchange our hugs and kisses and loves over the phone and then I got to talk to the   X   some more!!  The second half of our discussion went well with the possibility of having Karissa come to Texas for 3 weeks being possible.  She even said to me at some point "I know you think I am a cunt!" Of course I let the silence hang for a minute and then said "well anyway"      These were mails I received from some really good friends I like a lot and these are such great e-mails I posted them.   urlLink Wise Advice many can use   urlLink Rolling 9-11    Photos on this page are large intentionally to preserve the formatting.
