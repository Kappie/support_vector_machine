The big Ontario native did in fact miss all 82 games last season due to post-traumatic migraines but here is why I truly believe he will be a perfect fit in Edmonton. First of all, everyone who follows this dynamic, exciting sport franchise knows that we are in desparate need of a number one centre. Moving Ryan Smyth out of his normal position at wing to fill the void at centre did without question hurt his numbers early on in the season. Allison would be a huge presence in front of the net and in the corners and is great at banging home rebounds and cycling the puck which will give the Oilers another capable body other than Smyth to provide offense in that manner. Secondly, we are on the verge of losing the services of the very talented Petr Nedved, along with all of the points he puts up on the board, especially on the power play. Big number 41 would replace all those points and more as he is definitely a 100 plus point power forward. JA was recently left unprotected by the Los Angeles Kings as they obviously felt a little uncertain about his medical condition and his future in the National Hockey League. You may ask why the Oilers would want to take a risk with an individual with such a dangerous and career threatening ailment but here is why. We have recently been taking risks with players such as Oates and Nedved so why stop now. Besides, Oates and Nedved do not possess the talent or offense of the younger, bigger and stronger Allison. Lowe could laden Allison's contract with incentives based on games played and/or point production which will produce a no lose situation for the hockey club. Things didn't work out as planned with Adam Oates but I believe things will pan out in this case. Jason has never been an injury prone player and if he can fully recover then he could be the key in placing the squad in a position to do some serious damage in the North West division and the Western Conference. So with all of that said let us as Oiler fans hope and pray that Kevin Lowe will give some serious thought and put some serious effort into the potential signing of big number 41, Jason Allison.
