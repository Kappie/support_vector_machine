I took a silly quiz, and got the following:              You're  The Mists of Avalon !    by Marion Zimmer Bradley      You're obsessed with Camelot in all its forms, from Arthurian legend  to the Kennedy administration. Your favorite movie from childhood was "The Sword in  the Stone". But more than tales of wizardry and Cuban missiles, you've focused on  women. You know that they truly hold all the power. You always wished you could meet  Jackie Kennedy.
