I have made many adventures already, so I'll tell you a little bit of my history here to catch you up to current days events.  I began my life on Norrath by my father Krellon Steelswinger, and my mother Adilyne Potter. They raised me in the traditions of our great people, the mighty dwarves of Faydwer. I always had great pride in my people, the efforts that we make each day so that others may use our ore from the rich butcherblock mountain range.  I didn't have much experience with outsiders in my youth, as they were often travellers who would arrive to simply buy goods, drink at the tavern, and be safe from the wandering hordes of evil outside our safe underground city. One day I happen to be wandering by the tavern, when I heard someone speaking ill of the Irontoes! these people are some of our most heralded heroes! I became so enraged with the comments by this human that I jumped at him, kicking him squarely in the nose. The constabulary eventually took us both away, and I was handed over to my parents. My parents in their wisdom decided I needed some discipline, as I was going to be grown up soon, and I would need to learn the skills to survive.   Given my strong fondness for my people my parents figured the best place for me was with the clergy. I spent the remaining years of my childhood with the clergy learning all that was the glory of Brell, our creator. I learned quite a bit about the world, including that the gnomes were related to us and lived in the mountains of Steamfont. I decided one day that I should meet these folk, for I had only seen a handful coming into our city. I also learned the ways of chivarly and the sword, once I had matured and passed the rights of initiation, I became a paladin! The road was hard and long, but I had begun the walk toward great deeds!  The first great deed I had was to acquire bone chips for one of the fellow paladins, this was to prevent the evil necromancers from using them to reawaken the dead. I spent much time hunting these skeletons. Eventually I had proven worthy enough to be taught the secret of crafting underfoot defenders platemail armor. At last I could dress in armor consecrated by my god. I worked hard towards that goal, and made quite a few pieces. It was while this was happening when I happened across a Wizard. The wizard had come to me with an offer to join together to fight against the evil. I agreed and learned the wizards name was Gerillion. He was a human, and one of the nicest ones I had met for a long time. We hunted for quite some time, and he gave me some things that his monk friend had no use for any longer. I thanked him for this gift. It was grand indeed.  During our days of combat against the evil hordes, Gerillion made mention to me that he knew of a guild of adventurers that might be interested in our service. It was at this time that I met Deltree, a ghastly Iksar, one of the most evil living things in all creation, however I came to learn that Deltree was indeed one of the few Iksar that had repented the evils of his ancestry, and has in fact proven himself throughout norrath to be kind to all goodly people. he invited us into the Call of Honour, a guild who is very selective as to who joins with them. I was honoured, and I vowed my blade to their assistance at any time.  It was after this that I began to hunt the vile Crushbone Orcs, who had been attacking our wood elf neighbors relentlessly. Deltree came to my aide with his powerful magic many times there. I had decided to also follow Gerillion to his hometown of Freeport, there I found out about the Temple of Truth, and the servants of Truth, the paladins of Freeport. As it turns out the Freeport paladins had been working hard to rout the evils from freeport, one of them being the corrupted militia. I offered my assistance, and helped them deliver a message to a spy inside the militia, only to find they deemed me unfit for further duty unless I could prove my worth.  So I spent time delivering messages for the bards of antonica, which was slowly proving my worth to the temple. However on one fateful day, I decided to step foot in Kithicor forest to deliver a message to Highkeep, when in I died deep inside the pass. Recorporated in the Plane of Knowledge, I asked for assistance to extract my body. Gerillion and I watched as my corpse was brought to me from none other than Deltree. Again he had saved me countless hours of struggle. I thanked him and went on my way.   Eventually I lost communication with Gerillion, but had joined another elite group of adventurers in the lands of Norrath, the Wayfarer's, they thought I was worthy enough to begin working for them, and it was at this point that I have met one of my best friends on norrath. A Vah Shir named Kretais. Kretais helped me in the very first Lost Dungeon I was sent to explore by the wayfarer's, and we had a blast. We had so much fun we continued to spelunk the dungeons in search for finer weapons, and to crush the evil within.  It was also around this time that I had finally visited my relatives, the Gnomes in Steamfont. I was instantly entranced by a Cleric of Brell, named Akcron Mercaii, I immediately got her into the guild, for her diving healing powers were strong, and I knew the moment I had joined up with her, that she would assist us for years to come.  Since then I've also met a Vah Shir named Konath, who has been helpful and is good with a sword. we adventure regularly together though we must strengthen our cleric against the hearty forces of the dungeons before she can step foot in them with us. For the wayfarer's are very wise, and know whether a dungeon is too dangerous for one of their members.   It would also turn out that I have become known for a interesting style of baiting the enemy into our ambush. My friends refer to this as a "Ziggur Pull" which by definition, is just the right amount of enemies to barely escape death. I rarely pull too many to be dealt with, but when I do, I am certain to try my hardest to save the rest of the group.  These have been the adventures of Ziggur Rathebringer, this is my story, now you know my past. you shall hear more as my adventure continues.  If we ever shall meet may it be as brothers, and not as enemies, Ziggur RatheBringer
