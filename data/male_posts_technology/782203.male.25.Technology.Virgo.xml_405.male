Disregarding the advice given to her by the spirits, Unicorn went inside and bled silver blood..  For her misdeed, the world knew evil."   Some examples of the Unicorn Form are Eve (Christian) and Pandora (Greek). The Unicorn is associated with the concept of innocence, the number 3, and the element of water. Her sign is the twilight sun.  As a member of Form 3, you are a curiousndividual.  You are drawn to new things and become fascinated with ideas you've never come in contact with before.
