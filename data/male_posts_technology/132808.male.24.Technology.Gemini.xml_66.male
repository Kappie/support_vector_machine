Good luck getting on to that roof, Russ.   - What the Hell happened to The Moffats? - Workouts have been going okay.  I'm crazy hurting from the leg workout, though. - Moving across the hall in three weeks... still wondering if I should even pack shit up, or just carry it over - EVERY Bomber road game is televised!!  And 7 of 9 home games!! - Where's Rusty, Mikey, Nelly, Glenny, and Yoyo Ma? - Everyone here gone to movie-vault.com already?  Have you told friends about it?  I'm hoping for a very, very, very small cult following, but I'll settle for monstrous commercial success that allows me to completely sell out. - Someone aped "Walking Tall" so I won't be reviewing that one... but watch out for reviews on Street Fighter, Fubar, and Tommy Boy. - Now that Wes is back online, and Yo knows about this place, and Shaner's thinking of shit for the Scrabble Project, and football seasons coming up for Nex, this place should get busier than a Giant Tiger with wild colored, short-sleeved, button-up comic book shirts on sale for 12.99.
