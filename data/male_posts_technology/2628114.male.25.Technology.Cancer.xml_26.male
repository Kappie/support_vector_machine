I will discuss the last two workouts in this update since they were very similar.  2/2/04 Originally I had planned on dropping in at Heather and Brad's house for the elliptical-stairclimber-rowing machine workout of which I've grown fond, but I ended up going to the rec center at UC again.  It was packed so I just went with the stairclimber for an amazingly intense 25 minute uphill climb.  The machine said I did 163 floors and about 3.3 miles and I could believe it.  I did it on setting 14 (of 20) and on the aerobic setting which gave a lot of variety up and down intensity.  My legs (especially quads) were on fire by the time I was done so after the fire department came, I stretched and went on about my business.  2/3/04 Even though it was the Crosstown Shootout tonight, it was playing at the rec center so I wasn't completely deprived of watching UC fight back and forth with XU only to lose in the end (so sad).  I actually did a more intense workout tonight with 30 minutes on the stairclimber on the speed setting and 10 minutes on the rowing machine on the highest level.  My legs (and knee which is great!) actually felt better tonight than last for some unexplained reason.    Overall, I have been off of constant ibuprofen since Sunday (which is awesome) and I feel like I could run 5+ miles after every workout.  I am a little concerned about jumping back into my relatively high-mile running schedule but I am confident I will have the stamina to do it.  I am mostly concerned that my knee(s) will be able to take it.
