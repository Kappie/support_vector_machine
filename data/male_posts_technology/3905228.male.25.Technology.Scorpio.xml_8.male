I read "11 Minutes" - Dunno any other novel said in such a plain - jane words but still creating such a huge impact, a must read for those who want to have a fair idea about what  "True Love"  is ?   2. Thanks to late outburst atleast I can recoup the spirit of our Team, I know I can't correct one individual but atleast I can mould the other !   3. After a longtime watched "Hang'em High" - Superb Clintwood Action Movie and Today will watch Spiderman and one of my alltime Favourites " Where Eagles Dare "   My Personal part - 50%-50% - mostly reminds me of my favourite song from  'Alaipayuthey'- " Kaadal sadugudu.."-"Tholaivil parthal Amam Enginray..... Nanaga Thotalo Mullagi Poginrai, Neeya thotalo Povaga..."    Somewhere in my mind lingers the song with my favorite line  " Zeena Isika Naam Hi!"
