I'm starting to hate it already. hehe *joke*  Apart from that, I'm filling in for my mom at our store, so I don't get that much computer time anymore. My cousin Marlowe (Neil's older brother is getting married on the 29th, so my mom went to Manila to attend the wedding. As for me, I take over her desk. *sigh* it's sooo boring and I don't even get paid for it.  Ok. I'll stop ranting. God bless you all and have a wonderful vacation (unlike me, who's stuck at the store. *kidding only* :D).  P.S. Ok, thanks Ren. I'll do that.
