(he said it after he saw his pic on the win2k boot logo).  =)  another thing, my officemate asked me if i were late or not.sabi ko 6 minutes lang. sabi niya wag na daw ako papalate at baka daw mahanapan ako ng butas. my boss told her daw na they won't put me down though there are some people that are planning something to expel me.  thank God there are still good people who cares.  =)  after 6 pm i asked 3 of my colleagues if they can accompany me to glorietta. i'm experiencing a blurry vision sometimes and i need to have my eyes check-up. we went to "the optical shop". this _cute_ optometrist told me to fill-up the form. eh because i did not read it first na it's written pala, LASTNAME  first. i wrote my whole name on the last name section. sabi ko "ayy sorry." (tatanga tanga na naman ako)     sabi nya: "k lang. ano papa check up mo." (syempre mata) sabi ko: "kse i'm having a blurry vision minsan eh tagal ko na di nag sasalamin pero since grade 3 nka salamin nako. eh ayun..." sabi nya: "ic. may dala kba salamin mo dati?" sabi ko: "ayy ala eh. umm.. nawala eyeglasses ko before tapos mula non d nako nagpa refract ulit."     she told me to sit down infront of a computer thing and checked my eyes. i was looking inside this tube wherein you can see a very very far windmill with fences. tapos we went to her office and checked my eyes ulit kaso manual na. yung may letters na paliit nang paliit.     sabi nya: "eh wala nman pala problema mata mo eh.. normal naman. 20/20. astigmatism lang yan. ikaw ano papatuloy mo pa ba toh? wag nalang. sayang naman." sabi ko: "eh ano... eh.. o cge normal naman pala d nalang." sabi nya: "la naman problem eh. cge na nga wag kana mag consultation fee."     (naka libre pako)     sabi ko: "by the way i'm ___"  she smiled and said: "i'm jack"  we shaked hands then sabi ko: "nice meeting you. cge thanks jack."  sabi niya: "k lang. wala naman problema eh."     cute talaga ni jack. lol.   =)  pag alis namin don punta kami kfc. since it was payday i treat my 3 other colleagues dinner. we talked about our jobs and all sort of things about it. some past issues, umm.. at kung ano ano pa.  still don't know what made me soooo happpyyy last friday. maybe   someone   from heaven   sent   me a goodluck charm that morning. umm... i don't think so.  because for me...  she's a good luck charm herself.  =)     "i can be blind and can't see you smiling once you read my words.. =D i can be deaf and can't hear you laughing once you see me funny.. =p i can pretend that i don't misses you at all =/ pero still deep inside my soul, you're the only person who can always brighten up my cloudy day. =) thank you inspiring me. you know who you are. always  tke cre .
