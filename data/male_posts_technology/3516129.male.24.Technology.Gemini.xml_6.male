But what is painstakingly frustrating is the fact that I’m traveling on award tickets. Yes, the freaking perks of the job. Seriously, it’s not what it seems.  Anyone who’s traveled on a non-revenue ticket knows how impossible it is to get confirmation on these award ticket bookings. You think that the airline would give you credit for flying enough to earn those miles. I'm talking to a Northwest Airlines agent as we speak and I still can't get the flight that I wanted. Plus I can't even get my return flight confirmed on PAL, so I'm kinda screwed if I don't get back within this month. Frequent Flyer programs are the biggest rip-offs!!!  Rants aside, I'm glad to be able to visit some really good friends and family. Plus, I haven't been there since '99. This trip will be a long-ass trip, but definitely worth all the hassle. I'm gonna eat a whole lot, soak up the energy of the city, spend quality time with people over there and just relax. At this point in my life, nothing can beat that... not unless it’s a trip around the world or winning at the lottery.  On a side note, I caught Akshay on the CBS Today News the other day. He apparently got to spell the word after coming out of his black-out. Kudos to him for that. But still, what a dork...
