I would like to take this time to reflect upon the friends i've made in times past that have in some way shaped the way my life has turned out. This I do partly to remind myself of where I come from, but also to let the world know who has helped form the man i've become. If I leave some people out, look at it this way...yal prolly don't read this journal in the first place lol so...   Kevin, my first real hs friend, thanks for being my partner in benevolence. Tho our paths have led in different directions, i'll never forget the good times. Yea U prolly don't know the first thing about computers so I know u don't read this but hey.  Panora, my first real g/f. Our relationship might have been short but i'm thankful for the good times that we did have.  Cade aka Cackelo, I hated the thought of being around you from day one and now @ day 280 something  counting of separation I still can't stand you. But somewhere between the fights, the disagreements  the standoffs I learned a lot about life and about people. May God watch over you always is my prayer.  J, my partner in crime. You always have my back no matter how retarded my stuff sounds. You're a genuine friend and I need to start mentioning more women cause this complimenting dudes stuff starting to sound gay. Which brings me to,  Tricia...can words describe what your presence meant in my life? Yea...it was a joyride thru the gates of hell. It was pleasure and it was torture. You were the most perfect symbol of what a man needs yet the quintessential demon every man loathes. Thru it all I thank you for putting up with me. Like Cackelo, your legacy is written in the stars.  Laurence, man I wish people could buy common sense. I'd buy you some every month lol until you literally started making sense. You my homie dawg, and i'm thankful to know you. Now about that Tamika thing...  Chad, you've been the missing link, the brother when I didn't have one, the shoulder that I needed to lean on when I couldn't stand on my own. May God bless you and your ever growing family!  To the rest of my college homies including Merleathia, Big Mike, Mrs. Wade, Ryan, Shizzle, Mrs. Blansing, Mrs. Bates, Quanna, Medina, Mr. D to the Izzard, Dr. High, Mrs. Knightner  soooo many others, thank you all for being part of my life and part of my education.   To my host of online cadre, a lengthy list that seems to grow daily, including the good friend Sudie G of Clemson, Jewel of Louisiana, Leafia also of LA, Melissa...also...of LA (all no relation), the chinky homie Martina of Seattle, Diamond Princess of the AUG and to whomeva else i've left out, you're all important and i'm thankful.  Finally to my military friends and my church fam, thanks go out to you also and a big "what's up"! I know that I could not be the person I am without the help of all of you...so thank you all once again  God bless!!!  P.S.
