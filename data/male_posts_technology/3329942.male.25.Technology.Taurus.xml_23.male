Here it is now....  Last day at varsity, ppl are happy around me, I am not, coz I don't have my cubicle.  Day 1 at Job, Met new ppl, I am happy, coz I have my cubicle.  Induction complete, Assigned to Product, I am happy, coz I have my cubicle.  Slogged for continuous 36 hrs, Product delivered, I am happy, coz I have my cubicle.  Late Stays, Pizza treats, icecreams is the jargon cholesterol rising, becoming diabetic, But I am happy, coz I have my cubicle.  Girlfriend got married, Life is screwed, I am happy, coz I have my cubicle.  Mom today said "Take care Son", Pop is furious, but I am happy, coz I have my cubicle.  I can't remember the day when I relished and felt content to heart, Still I am happy, coz I have my cubicle.  Forgot to take turns on the way to home, I am happy, coz I have my cubicle.  Girlfriend gave birth to a child, no hopes now, But I am still happy, coz I have my cubicle.  It's been long since I chatted with BIG BG, I hope he remembers me, Still I am happy, coz I have my cubicle.  News is spreading, Recession is on its prowl, Worried am I, Still I am happy, coz I have my cubicle.  Today it doomed here finally, friends are leaving, Some are shocked, Some are afraid, I should be happy, coz I have my cubicle.  Only lonely I felt, deep down something is broken, Someone is hurt I am trying hard to be happy, But I am not, coz I STILL have my cubicle.  O lord !! Devil is kind than you, I am now at WAR with you I want to be happy, I don't desire this cubicle
