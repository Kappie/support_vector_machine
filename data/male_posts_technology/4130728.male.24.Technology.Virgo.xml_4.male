I'm not sure if I'd have liked it if I'd seen it on CD but the theatre effect always adds to a horror movie. They must be seen on theatres.  The movies starts with the director, stating something to the effect 'This is just an attempt by me to scare you and in no way reflects my personal beliefs on the supernatural'. The movie is not all that scary (its more noisy than scary), but in my opinion is much better an attempt than its predecessors.  Unfortunately previous Tamil horror movies, didn't hold much of my interest.  I relish mostly on the element of mystery rather than the movie being actually scary and this movie did have some amount of mystery, though at later stages it degrades into the normal 'Tamil horror movie template'. Especially the combination of the small kid and the mad women goes well.  Some/most of the ghost scenes reminds me of the same makeup in 'The Ring', dead pale faces with dark deep set eyes.  Prashant plays the role of a caring husband, and for once, he looks smart. Meena is simply awesome in this movie. She looks better in the early parts of the movie and steals the show as the movie proceeds, does a great job of playing the 'possessed' and portrays very well in a scene  which gives a feel of multiple souls struggling inside a single body.  About a day later, when talking with another friend, he said 'Oh yeah! How was that movie, I heard that it had no songs!' and only then did I realize that movie didn't have songs. Not many movies in the Tamil World come without songs, but here is one in which the blend is so neat, that you won't even realize that songs are missing.
