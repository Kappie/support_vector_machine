Jason Smathers of Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, has been charged with stealing a list of 92 million AOL customer screen names and selling them to Internet marketer Sean Dunaway of Las Vegas, said David Kelley, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.  Dunaway, who has also been arrested, used the list to promote his online gambling operation and also sold the list to other spammers, Kelley said. An AOL spokesman said Smathers has been fired from the company.
