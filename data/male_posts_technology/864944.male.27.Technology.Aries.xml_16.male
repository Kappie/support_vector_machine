Lots of last minute changes to things.  *shrug* guess that just happens from time to time.  ------  Christina's Birthday is coming up!  *yay*   I am looking forward to giving her the present I got her :)  ------  Christmas is fast approaching!  I will post a list I have put together so that any family out there who are really stuck can have a place to turn to for ideas.  *coming soon!*  ------  The latest game in my world is O.R.B.  it is a beautiful 3d real tiem strategy set in space.  It is more or less a clone of Homeworld, but it is nice and has some excellent features that make it different.  And like homeworld, the visuals are nothing short of stunning.   urlLink http://www.o-r-b.com/   And as a bonus, it is from my favorite publisher ... Strategy First :)
