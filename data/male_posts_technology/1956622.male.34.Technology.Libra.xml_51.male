Karissa was out walking Sadie (the Jack Russell I bought for   SFW  ) she said Sadie was a small dog and I told her that was OK because Karissa was small.  Karissa replied with I know but I am growing bigger every day.  Karissa told me all the stuff she wanted to do when she is here.  She says she would like to walk with daddy, go to the park, go to the circus, have a BBQ, meet daddy's friends, go to "G" and Ry Ry's house.  She also said she wants a ladybug cake.    I was thinking maybe I can get Dairy Queen or someone to make one out of Ice Cream for her.  Now I just have to get the pool up before she finds out the swing set is gone!  Karissa said she was going to run with Sadie and we got disconnected.  I am not sure if Karissa hung up or if it was an accident.  I asked Karissa if she wanted to hang up and she said no but then the phone clicked so I am guessing it was accidental.
