The title of the seminar was " urlLink Presenting Data and Information ." Personally, and I think Kendrick would agree with this, I believe that this course should be requisite for all engineers, statasticians, graphic artists, software designers, accountants, and anyone else who ever needs to communicate a large amount of data to someone who might care. Tufte's critique of Power Point, especially the case study revolving around a single slide that decided the fate of NASA's Columbia space orbiter, is aloneworth the $320 admission fee. Company won't spend the money to send you? Don't work for a company?  urlLink Go  on our own. It's that good. I kid you not.
