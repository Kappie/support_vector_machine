All the normal stuff like try not to stink of fags when you walk into the class room, and show some respect for the celling, use all four legs of the chair, all the normal. My favoruite quote from the evening; "he has a wicked sense of humor", my business studies teacher. She quite liked the idea that it's cheaper to use robots because they can work in the dark. (Bit of a nerdy business joke, so don't feel gulity if you don't get it.)  I know I haven't blogged for a little while, been very busy getting my head round completcated programming problems, which still have yet to be solved. Anybody with a logical mind please enquire within.  My favourite part of music lessons has started! Sorry, did I say favourite? I meant my most hated dreaded I-really-don't-want-to-do-this part of music. Composition. Sounds easy? You just write lots of notes down, play 'em and then you're done, but there are several probelems. First of all, I can't sight read very well so when I have to play them back to myself, I can't remember what I did. Secondly, I can't read or write bass cleff, I can barely manage trebble cleff! Thirdly, I can't compose! I don't know what to do and what ever I write sounds like a monkey wrote it. This is the kind of point where I think to my self I don't want to spend 1/4th of my 6th form eduction on the flipping subject. I enjoy listening to music, and to some extent I enjoy playing it, but I hate composing and I hate learning about it. The fact the clarient wasn't around in the Baroque period isn't important information to me. I really don't need to know that serialsim sounds like me playing the piano with my arse, and I really do not need to know that a Sitar is a guitar from India without frets! I don't care! I really do not care! I don't want to know this information, please, no more! That is the end! No more ever please!   urlLink How do you mend a broken heart?   The quaility of tabloids is really getting to me - it's crap. A Solicitor jailed for life for murdering her two baby sons is freed by court of appeal, Tony Blair today pledged that after dealing with Iraq, the UN would confront North Korea about its nuclear weapons programme, and The deputy prime minister John Prescott yesterday lost patience with the striking firefighters, announcing radical new laws which would enable ministers to seize control of the industry and impose a pay and reform package. So after all this in an amazing day of news, what does The Sun have for a headline and leading story? Zoe Ball and Norman Cook - the most read "news" paper (using "news" in the broadest possible manner) in the UK and all they care about is the realtionship between two people that I really don't care about. Yes, Norman Cook has made some pretty cool music, but I really think his private and work life should be seperated and respected.  Anyway, just got to say my bit about possible war and the monkey man himself.  urlLink This sums it all up  really, nothing much else to say other than what you can see in that cartoon.
