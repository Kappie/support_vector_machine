EMI said on Wednesday it was supplying 140,000 songs for download through 20 European digital music distributors including Microsoft's MSN, music channel MTV and retailer HMV.  [link via  urlLink OnlineBlog ] Hmmm... having brought Napster down to its knees, it was inevitable that the big daddies of the music industry would themselves jump into the fray.  The big players are going to do the same thing as Napster did... although the downloads would cost around £1 per song (which is a stiff price to say the least!). Then an album (which has about 14-15 songs) would cost an exorbitant £15!!  Gee!! these people think they can get away with murder!
