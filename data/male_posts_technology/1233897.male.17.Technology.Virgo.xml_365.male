It should be out in the Fall, running for under $2K   [Edit] For some reason the pics in this post were causing the new template to screw up, so I er... removed them... problem solved ;) [/Edit]     Specifications:  1GHz Transmeta processor  20GB hard drive (shock-mounted)  256MB DDR RAM  Dimensions: 4.9" x 3.4" x .9"  Weight: 14 ozs  800 x 480 W-VGA 5" transflective display (indoor/outdoor readable)  3D accelerated graphics with 8mb video RAM  QWERTY thumb keyboard with mouse buttons and TrackStik®  802.11b wireless  Bluetooth® wireless  4-pin FireWire® (1394)  USB 1.1  3.5mm stereo headphone jack (supports stereo headphone or mono headset plus optional multimedia controller)  Microphone  Digital pen  Removable lithium polymer battery  Battery life 2-6 hours, depending on usage    OQO docking cable includes:  3D accelerated 1280 x 1024 VGA video output  Additional USB  Additional FireWire (1394)  Ethernet  DC power  Audio out    Additional features:  Active hard drive protection that safely parks hard drive heads upon detecting freefall  Screen that slides on rack and pinion mechanism to reveal thumb keyboard  Shift, control, function and alt keys that have smart-lock with LED indicators  Thumbwheel allows for traditional scrolling as well as enhanced features  Ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts backlight to appropriate level  External antenna connector for 802.11b (in addition to built-in diversity antennas)    Included accessories:  Power cord  AC adaptor  Docking cable  Desktop stand  Digital pen  Carrying sleeve   The only possible drawback I've figured on so far is the lack of "instant on" now so familiar to PDA owners... Like all other PCs, you have to boot it up.
