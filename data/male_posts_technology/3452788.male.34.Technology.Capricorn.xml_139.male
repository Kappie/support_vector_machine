Sex with your lover is great, whether it is slow and tender, or throw-me-down-and-take-me-now. Also, Anne thinks it is a good idea for us to get away for our anniversary (2+ weeks) and relax, talk about depression, talk about us, etc. Normally she is very quiet about important stuff, so this is a big deal to me. Without putting too much expectations, I hope we can do some mending and damage repair. She still has not said anything about the aborted runaway, but I believe she maybe understands a little better. She is reading a book I have, partially from my encouragement, partially on her own.  On the other hand, there is the Beast, sitting quietly in the corner, biding his time, waiting patiently for an opportunity to creep back in. All it takes is one slip, one bump in the road, a crack in the armor, for the beast (or black dog, or demon, or critic - it goes by many names) to gain a hold, and start dragging me down again. No matter how happy I am, I am always aware of its presence, in the same way a cat is alert and ready for danger, while appearing to be relaxed. This dual state of being is very tiresome. It is hard to shake it off, except in the most comforting or free moments.
