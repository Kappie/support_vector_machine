JS -- I realized tonight that I still have your video tape with Season 3 of B5 (Angie's Journey caused the lightbulb to fizzle on). Need it back? For that matter, does anyone have 4 and 5 on tape? And, yes, I still need VHS, as I have discovered myself to be a rather late-adopter when it comes to home electronics....  Did anyone here ever watch Farscape on SciFi? I noticed that it didn't make John's list - did you just miss it or didn't like it?  BTW, I really like hanging out with you guys as a group, albeit virtually, since this particular collection of minds can easily switch from discussing the inherent unfairness of international power politics vis a vis the individual all the way over to the intricacies of the universe created for "Buffy: The Vampire Slayer." It brings a tear to my eye [sniff].
