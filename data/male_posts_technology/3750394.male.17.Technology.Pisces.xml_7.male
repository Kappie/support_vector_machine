Speed and foresight are my strengths, at the cost of a little clumsiness. I'm most comfortable with a few friends, but sometimes particularly enjoy spending time in larger groups.  What Video Game Character Are You?       This is definitly me, I love my friends alot, and they mean the world to me.   I didn't get a chance to see my alternative, but it was probably something weird. And No! Corey, I didn't copy you, I actually did the quiz, LOL!  Eric
