But having said that, my question is.. are we left with an alternate option... We are talking globalization, competition... The days of a laid-back Govt job, that gives you job security for life and also takes care of ur post-retirement life has become a thing of the past... the days where one could start from home at a comfortable 9AM and be back by 6PM are only available to be seen in films...   On the other hand... the "cursed" WebCam is what enables an anxious mom to see her child's face who might be working thousands of miles away... imagine the happiness in her face... the equally "cursed" VoIP is what helps the beloved talk with her overseas counterpart without losing much weight in her purse...  Did anyone ever think that a simple coffee could ever be made into so many different varieties... Did the pre-modern man ever had the privilege of tasting food stuff from across the globe right at his door step... some may not be all that good for health... but then, given the pollution levels, even breathing is bad for health...   Washing machines and the chutney grinders may not do as neat or as delicious a work as does the dear one's (which normally refers to the female "dear") palm.. but it does give a break to her tired palm.. how many more eras will the so-called "dear one" spend in washing and cooking... that palm could also be used for some other creative work other than just washing and cooking that she's been doing for ages...  So.. the bottomline is.. its the way you "choose" to use it... prioritize ur activity... the means are available for u... its up to you to put that to proper use... once in a while, a visit to coffee day or McDonalds is going to be enriching... but not if we do it everyday.. as the cliche goes "too much of anything is good for nothing"...  Valli talks to her mom on weekends.. technology enables her... Bala himself has got a mobile for some special reasons... technology is helping him... And this very medium of discussion is because of a technology... Don't choose to use technology just because it is there... use it when there is a need to use... just as the simple difference between "want" and "need"... you drink coke... but you'll never use it as a replacement for water.. if you try to do it, that's where the dangers of technology begin.. as long as u don't do it... u have both coke's refreshing taste and also the impeccable panacea called water... if u understand what I mean...!!  To quote bala...  tell me one pleasant moment you and your loved one chewed the fat without being disturbed by a mobile call?    If "chewing the fat" with your loved one is sooooo very important.. then, why the HELL don't you switch ur mobile off...??? Choose ur priority...!!  Problem is with people.. not technology..!!  ---------------------  You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.
