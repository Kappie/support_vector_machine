Shoaib Malik coming up with a century while batting at number 3 and I am still not convinced that he should bat at this number, he is too vulnerable against swing and seam. Either Inzi or God knows who should bat at this spot. Anyhow still I feel no score is enough against this Indian batting line up, lets just hope that it continues the way its going right now. Till then  Adios
