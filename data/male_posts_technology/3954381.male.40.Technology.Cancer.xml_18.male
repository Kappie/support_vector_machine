The cause and effect of actions.  I have never,   ever   stood someone up, technically speaking. I find dating far too much fun, the whole concept of meeting someone face-to-face for the first time is an incredibly delicious feeling that I really like. I won't repeat my earlier post, just suffice to say I really really really like dating. However, on more than one occasion I have found myself chatting online with a guy, it's obvious from the get go that dating is not what they are after. Not to state the obvious, but they are looking for a hookup. Again, I don't wish to repeat earlier posts, but if you are new to the inner recesses of how I think and operate - hookups are fine. Every single person, gay, straight or bi needs a hookup now and then to remind them of what they are missing on a regular basis so that they will continue to seek out one of life's most treasured gifts. A partner. Anyway, to get back to my point, hookups are good thing.  When I find myself chatting with a guy who wants to hookup it inevitable is an inconvenient time. Perhaps it's an hour before I need to go to bed, or I am about to run out to run errands or I already have plans with a friend...it could be any number of reasons. But nevertheless the chat continues and it becomes more sexual, discussing the various possibilities of what the chattee and I could be doing. Most of the time they are happy to defer said activities to a mutually convenient time where the both of us are available. Sometimes not; sometimes it's a deal killer and we will never be able to recapture what could have been. The chattees in the former group though that agree to meet at a later time I have, in the past, perhaps mistreated. I don't feel as though I can accept total blame since I find it difficult to plan on being horny and eager at a said time in the near future.  Think about it, on Monday night at 11:30pm, say you are chatting with someone who, at that particular time, is fueling your heating core. At 11:30pm on Monday night you definitely want to be with him; but you have to get up for work the next morning so you tell him you can't do anything about it now. We may agree to meet up on Tuesday at 8pm. Tuesday night rolls around and frankly, you aren't really in the mood....maybe you had a long strenuous day and the thought of getting sexually active with someone you have never met isn't really a turn on at that point. Or perhaps on Tuesday afternoon you received a call from a friend who really wants to see the new Wil Smith movie... There could be a thousand reasons why on Tuesday you just don't want to be with someone. I don't consider this standing someone up or blowing them off. I always make a point to tell the chattee that it's best if we meet up online first. I tell them if I am online then I will definitely be looking, but they may tell me they won't have access to a PC at that time. They may ask me to call or I may have given them my number, and if they call...or rather if my phone rings, I may ignore it and not pick up. I know this behavior is wrong, and childish, but that's basically what happens sometimes. What sounded good one day isn't as appealing the next or the day after and then oddly enough a couple days later it can do a complete turnaround and become appealing again. So herein lies my problem. And make no mistake it is  my  problem.  Effective immediately I am instituting a new policy on dating and hookups. Each category will have it's own rules and procedures which I expect to be followed closely within the following guidelines. I should point out now that said procedures, which are being posted below, are subject to change at the discretion of the Management.   Hook Ups  Effective immediately any trolling for hookups will be conducted only on the weekend and when an appropriate window of time is available. It is no longer acceptable to "plan" on meeting a potential hookup at a later date since I cannot be depended upon to keep an appointment.  Hookups in general, should be reduced to a minimum.   Dating  Effective immediately, any potential dates must engage in online or phone chat at a minimum of five separate occasions before I agree to meet them in person. This procedure alone will be certain to weed out those who are insincere in establishing a relationship while at the same time allow each of us to get to know each other; making our first meeting that much more enjoyable.  ====================  So perhaps I am at fault in the recent incidents of being stood up. Perhaps karma is getting me back for my previous reprehensible behavior, or perhaps the two gentlemen were anything but...I can't say for sure. I can't answer for their bad behavior but I can answer for my own. I am cleaning up my act on a physical level, it's time for me to do the same on a mental level.  The road ahead may very well turn out to be a lonely stretch of highway filled with potholes and bad signage but if I can get there unscathed I know I will be ok.
