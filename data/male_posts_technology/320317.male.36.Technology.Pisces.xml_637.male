In some circles, HTML has acquired the reputation of being a time-consuming, difficult undertaking best left to developers. I’m here to convince you that this is very far from the truth. In fact, using HTML as the basis for your wireframing and prototyping can be a quick and rewarding experience with fabulous benefits, including easier user testing, improved client communication, and faster, more effective use of design time."

 The issue with HTML prototyping is you need to let go of "code tweaking" and use an WYSIWYG editor like Dreamweaver MX. At the same time, you have to commit to whatever HTML "code" you create in this process is to be thrown away. If you make this decision up front it is easier to let go of being a "control-freak" code monkey that a lot of good web designers can be.
