So after 8 days of no sleep, more beer than 10 doods should drink, a big tattoo in my armpit, an almost broken leg, a drained checking account, brownies, no patience, broken glass, $1000 worth of sushi, the thought of sharing a bed with a different man every night, and 10 gallons of coffee I can say I survived Haller-boy week!  Time to heal.
