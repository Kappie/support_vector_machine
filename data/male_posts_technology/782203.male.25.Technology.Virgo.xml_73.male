Yeah thanks woman for picking New Year's Eve to tell me this , now im feeling really moody about it ...anyway doesnt matter cos its not like im going to go out and celebrate new year also, probably gonna countdown at home with my 2 dogs , probably try to get them to bark once the clock hits midnight or something.
