Pity the other crowd see it as an unimportant issue.   There is a battle folks! Wake up! There are those (included in this article) who would attempt to distract us by saying these are minor issues, and others like health are far more important. They are wrong. And I say go Bush. Not guts, no glory. You take that stand, and you go hard. This Christian is with you.
