Instead, since this guy is a complete putz, asked a mutual friend for her AIM screenname!  She isn't going to date him, but they have talked a bit and she found out he has a vanity site:   urlLink Morris Singer .   

Signs you are a PUTZ:

 

 You place a picture of yourself in your title graphic.

 Your site is "Under Construction":  No one with a modicum of web design ability has used "Under Construction" on their site since 1995.  Go put your crap on GeoCities.

 You copy  urlLink all of your columns , and screw it up!  How many instances of "Restroom Revolution Gathers at Stonewall" are on that page?  Hard hitting journalism, at that!

 Your  urlLink photo galleries  are Javascript pop-up driven garbage.

 Your  urlLink bio  is written in third person perspective.

 You do not have a job or a degree yet you have a  urlLink business card .

 Your tagline is a warning:  "Thank you for visiting my site. Do not duplicate this information, content or design without written permission from me."

 

Yeah, I know, someone could rip apart my site as well, but I can take it.
