Ariane called me late last night asking me to be her date for a wedding in NYC on the 24th, so I guess I'll be going there again around then. Sounds like fun!  I love meeting new people and I was planning on going back on the 28th, anyway.  I went on my date with the real-estate girl.  She's really cool and I had fun talking to her.  She's most likely not my type, though.  But she could turn out to be a good friend.  After that, my friend Heidi invited me to go miniture golfing with her since she had some free tickets.  I had a lot of fun!  It was very cool.  And to my dismay, she won the round.   urlLink    My friend Heidi, tonight at Golf World in Fox Chapel.  Oh! We ended up seeing a fox in Fox Chapel!  How 'bout that... It was so cool! And yes... I'm sure it was a fox.  I almost ran it over - it passed right in front of my car on the road. I was going to try to get a picture of it, but then I thought of dudes on horses trying to catch a fox and decided to just let it go.
