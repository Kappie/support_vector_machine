They were great to deal with and they have really good pricing.   Toyota dealerships can be a solid pain in the ass to deal with in general. I like Autofair but I had to go there twice to find a salesperson I liked.  Anyway, so here's the rig:  Outside:          Inside:     These pictures are a little bright, but I didn't really want to screw around with them too much.     And of course, the trunk:   Yeah this thing basically has a mafia trunk. It can fit 37 Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders with the help of a chainsaw. Thanks to Boo(tm) for that joke.
