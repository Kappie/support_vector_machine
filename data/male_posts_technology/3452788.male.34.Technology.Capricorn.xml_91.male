My primary reason is to upgrade the database file for the accounting software, then transfer the database to a dedicated server (not really a "server", but the details are not really important).  However, it is a really good excuse to avoid hanging out all day with Anne's parents and brother from Goldville.  They were going to the tiny zoo here in town and the beach later.  I wanted no part of that, and since we didn't get invited to breakfast, I told Anne I was heading for work sometime, I may as well go.  That was at 11 am, and then I screwed around reading blogs for 2 hours.  I can't decide if I am getting better or worse.  I sense that since my depression cycles are getting dangerously worse lately, maybe I need a different therapist, different or more medicine, or some combination of the above.  Reality is that I like my therapist, I think she has a good sense of what I am going through, but then again sometimes I find myself censoring or either minimising or inflating whatever I tell her.  Are things as bad as I tell her?  Are they worse?    The last session I told her about several dreams about death, and eventually she asked me if I had ever had suicidal thoughts.  "Well, maybe" I answered meekly, basically only mentioning that I had thought about shitloads of pills, leaving out the ideas about steak knives, the ocean, large buses (mental picture - Bill Murray in Groundhog Day), intentional exposure and hypothermia, etc.  I said I didn't really want to admit it or think about it.  When I told her that, she said quietly "Thank you for telling me that" and continued as if it had never happened.  I'm no dummy, and I know a psych job when it is being used on me.    Thank you??  I guess she was trying to trick me into thinking I needed permission from myself to tell her that.  I mentally prickled at that, but I let it go at the time, but really that is the only thing I remember from the session.  Another $90 down the shit-hole, $20 of which I pay directly.  Anyway, she said don't play with my dosage either, as I told her occasionally I took a little extra Celexa.  Oh, database is done and waiting patiently.  Or, maybe it is silently mocking me for my shabby appearance, my big butt, or my mental problems.  Damn, anthromorphizing onto my computers again, need to stop that.  Mood: solitary but slightly better, not run-away freaked out, just waaaayyy to nervous.  Need scotch.  Music: guns, appetite for destruction.  Great 80's hard rock.  I wanna watch you bleed...
