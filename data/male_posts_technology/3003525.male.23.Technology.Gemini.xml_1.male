This is an awesome exceprt from wikipedia:    Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford  farted while swearing loyalty to  Queen Elizabeth I , and consequently went into self-imposed  exile  for  seven  years. After his return, the Queen was reported to have reassured de Vere: "My Lord, I had forgot about the fart."
