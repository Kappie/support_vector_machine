I'm going to see my family, my friends and see two very special people make public their true love for each other.  Happy Days.  I've never been to a wedding before.  My family isn't big and I don't have crazy friends that want to tie the knot at 18 so this if my first chance to go.  So what to wear?  My parents have talked me out of the poweder blue top hat and tails with matching frilly shirt and the mandatory silver tipped cane.  I think I can only go wearing that if my accompanying partner would be wearing a bowl of fruit for a hat [carmen miranda style].  As I'm going solo I better put a bit more class into it.  So the dates for my flights are, arriving on saturday 23/10/2004 and leaving again on tuesday 02/10/2004.  I come back to heathrow at 6 in the morning and will be starting work that day as I haven't got any more time off.  Oh that should be grand fun.  It's not a long stay so I'm going to try and make the most of it.  I have no plans of going home after that for .. .. .. well .. .. a while so it's going to be pretty non stop really.    Sweeeeeet.
