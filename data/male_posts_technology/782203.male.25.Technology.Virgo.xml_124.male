Didn't do much today at the lab ...well actually i spend quite a while trying to figure out how to set a Gwen Stefani jpeg as the wallpaper for my workstation and finally manage to do it with the help of my colleague. Sigh now thats one person I dun think i will ever get tired of looking at! Other than that did nothing much went for a pretty long lunch at NIE and a couple hours later a pretty long teabreak. Ya sounds very slack I know but this is the last day I'm gonna be able to do that. Cos tommorow I am signing the deed/contract and I officially start my work from thursday. Which also means i got to be there by 9:00 am instead of 11 am like i do now.    But there is a problem my bro-in-law who is one of my sureties tommorow lost his IC and Miss See See specifically said that we have to bring our IC. He has a temporary IC so i hope that will suffice but i am gonna call her tommorow to make sure.
