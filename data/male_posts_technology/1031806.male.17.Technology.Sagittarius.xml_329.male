Yeah, anyway, the last couple days have been dandy for me...   Note:  All that stuff that I said about my mom, well I'm leaving it... I kinda have a policy here on my blog that once I post something, it stays 'cause that's how I felt when I wrote it and the whole purpose of a blog is kinda destroyed once one goes back and starts editing previous posts to conform them to their current frame of mind. Anyway, with that said and with the assurance that my mom and I are back on friendly terms again (We've fully discussed the incident(s) and have come to the conclusion that if given the chance to re-live them, we'd have done stuff differently), I'll go back to the part about the last couple days being dandy...   I got to drive my car again for the first time on Sunday! *Woot again!* I kinda ...erm, left early and went to Goodwill where I was extremely happy to find a connector for this laptop, the only part infact that has been preventing me from getting it on the web. Btw, I forget the processor speed, but it has 12Mb of RAM, a 154Mb HD, and a 640x480 display running at 256 colors. LOLOL Beastie machine huh? I can't believe it actually runs Trillian... and IE at the same time! Anyway, I finally got over to Calvary, stayed a while, saw Bwitty (that's always cool - she's fun to hang around), and finally saw Cam after almost two weeks... Man I was going through Cam-withdrawal (LOL) He was doing good, but now there's some stuff going on that's really screwing with him so... yeah sux.  Anyway, on Monday, I couldn't believe it; Gwen gave the message for Opening (our Monday morning chapel). I'm proud of her... that takes guts. It was about depression and conquering it through happiness in God's love... exactly the type of struggle I'm going through right now... and have been for the last two years infact. Yeah... Monday was awesome after that.  Today I got out of an entire day of school ('cept the last ten minutes of my last class) because we had an all-day field trip to the state capital, Salem. That was cool... during our trip to the actual capital building, they had an earthquake drill. That was pretty stupid; we didn't even know what it was... I was sliding down one of the huge marble ramp things on either side of the two flights of stairs (LOL, intended as decoration, not actually to slide down, though even out elderly tour guide admitted to having done so herself at one point..... HAHAHA), and some guy walked into the rotunda and blasted a blowhorn siren. We were all like 'um... wha..?' Yeah that was fun.  I've got a huge report for Spanish due... um today (hehe) that I'm having a very hard time completing... I don't get it, I have all the info at my fingertips, I just can't seem to compile it. Ah well, there's always tomorrow.  I talked to Mandy today too, FINALLY (lol) and we're still on for prom, same with Steven and Becky. Should be fun...  Goodnight world! I love  all  most of you :)
