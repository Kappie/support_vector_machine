Lisa and I went over to the rec center with the intent to lift weights then use ellipticals, stair climbers, etc.  Instead of lifting weights, I went straight to the ellipticals to make up for not working out at all on Saturday (my intended long workout day).  I was able to do 3 sets of 5and2s before Lisa joined me.  I then did 2 more sets of 5and2s and then we moved to the stairclimbers for a 15 minute uphill.  According to that machine I went up 90 flights.  Could have fooled me, it felt like 300.  Everything felt great though, knee included.  I continue to pop the ibuprofen to keep the swelling down and the ellipticals really seem to be helping to strengthen my legs for when I go back to running.
