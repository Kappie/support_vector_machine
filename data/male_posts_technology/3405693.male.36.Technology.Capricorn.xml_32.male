Now, that's all well and good and all, but this guy sounded like a third year arts student in university.  "I was pleasantly surprised to come across a lugubrious tome by nietzsche, as well as one of my favorites, Tolstoys extemporily well written War and Peace".  Come on dude...stop with the pretentious pedanticism and just be yourself.  NOBODY reads War and Peace for entertainment; it's perhaps the second most boring peace of literature ever, right behind the Time magazine.  No, I like Time sometimes, so I am kidding there.  But seriously...Nietzsche and Tolstoy and Frost's poems...these are english class homework assignments, not something anyone really wants to buy for enjoyment.  Unless, of course, they get enjoyment out of showing everyone how intelligent they are.  But, then, the only people impressed by display books are morons who wish they had enough brains to understand those books, right?    Anyways, I wrote out a comment somewhat to that affect, only nicer, but then I thought "What am I accomplishing by sending this?"  Nothing other than showing myself to be as pretentious as this git was.  I was brilliant in my comments, going so far as to suggest he try some authors from this century such as Neal Stephenson and Michael Odjaante and Yann Martel...suggesting that a piece of literature's primary duty is to ENTERTAIN, and all the dark philosophical meanderings he mentioned aren't even entertaining to philosophy students.  But, when I looked at these comments before I sent them it struck me as very hypocritical to say such things to someone.  He was doing it his way, and who's to know...maybe this guy really did get enjoyment out of self torture.  I doubt it, but it's not my thing to judge, is it?  So...if anyone else reads this and wants to read something highly entertaining AND educational AND a bit philosophical, I suggest Neal Stephenson's "Cryptonomicon".  It's a honking big book with all kinds of mathematical equations and shit in it, but in the end it's just a great story.  If science and math makes you itch, try out something by Yann Martel (heavy on the philosophy and theology, light on the math) or anything by John Irving (just plain entertaining, but written in a classic prose style).  The second blogg I wanted to comment to was this American dude who wrote that "American media only shows us the worst of what our troops are doing over there.  Don't you think the Iraqi's are doing worse things to their prisoners of war?  And CNN is the worst."  Well, this guy I wanted to tell that, as an outsider who watches non-American news, trust me...you are not seeing only the worst.  CNN is owned by the republicans...it is the most biased, right wing, pro-Bush news broadcast there is.  They had to run the prison beatings to be competitive, but there is much worse stuff your troops have done (under orders yet!@).  I watched a documentary on the CBC some time ago about the experiences of reporters over there during the war.  One very moving scene was a reporter talking about a van that stalled on the road.  The iraqi driving it with his wife, sister, 2 daughters, a niece and a nephew begged the americans for help; they were fleeing the battle ground.  The American radio'd for advice, and the order came down...destroy it and kill them as terrorists.  They showed this on the broadcast! This is not a second hand story; I watched it unfold (well, on TV mind you, and it could have been staged I guess, but why would they?  Canada is a US ally, and has no intention of pissing them off with false propaganda...hell the US would just take us over if we did that)!   Anyways... I'm getting a little worked up cuz watching that story really really affected me.  It was a horrible thing to see.  Anyways the guy's other comment about the captured Americans...2 things here.  First: Any American who has been captured then released or escaped who I've seen a press conference from has said they were treated very well.  Obviously the head chopping guy is a different story, but that one leads me to my second point: The American's are not fighting a legitimate army who is held to the Geneva Conventions.  They are fighting a bunch of people who just had their homes and lives taken from them by an invading army...of course they're over the edge.  Don't get me wrong here...I totally do not support any terrorists or acts of such.  This whole war sickens me almost as much as the act that ultimately started it 2 and half years ago.    Well, there you go.  Two blogs that made me want to comment today.  And I didn't comment to either of them in the end.
