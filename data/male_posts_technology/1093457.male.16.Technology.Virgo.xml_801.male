But, rather than finishing at about 9pm like we thought it would, it finished at 11pm. So after getting out of the cinema, into the station, getting some food for poor Andy, finding a train, then hanging around at Clapham Junction for 20 minutes to get to East Croydon I got home pretty close to 1am. If I fall asleep in the common room, just poke me or something.
