I have a feeling it won't work either.  You get what you wish for?  Pay for...  Issues.  I need a boyfriend.  Issues.  What's this?  I have nothing planned for this weekend?  How did that happen?  No Coca-Cola.  Issues.  "Don't say you want me.  Don't say you need me.  Don't say you love me.  It's understood.  Don't say you're happy,  Out there without me,  I know you can't be."  -DM
