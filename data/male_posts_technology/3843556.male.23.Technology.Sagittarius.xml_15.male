My day at work flew past me. Spent a little time studying JAVA, though I felt I did not do justice to the time available in hand. Raghu called on my way home from work. It felt so good talking to him as I had not spoken to him in over two months. He is his usual self, the crazy old raghu we all know. But then he seems to be focussed with work which is a very good sign. Saira called and poor girl had a bad head ache. There is so much to write about her and it could run to pages. I will make it a point to do that in the days to follow. I tried my hand at racquet ball as I was not in a state to work out. My finger hurt and felt tired for some reason that i was not able to figure out.  I then played some golf at home, had dinner, spoke to Sandeep then Madhuri and it was time to wind up to go to bed as another day had come to a close.
