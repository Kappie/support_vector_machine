I had some old roommates who went to AM Church of Christ, and so I thought, "Self, why not?". I pulled out my Yellow Pages, and I had the address "1901 Harvey Mitchell South College Station". So far so good, and I went to sleep.    In the morning, I drove directly to 6 and 2818 to AM Church of Christ, only it wasn't AM Church of Christ, it was Brethern Church, so turned around and began searching 2818 for this church which I had no idea where it was, and it was 10:25, and service started at 10:30. Finally, I pull into AM Church of Christ's parking lot at 10:35, but what's this? It's abandoned!    C'mon! This is like the 4th Sunday in a row I've tried to go to any church, and it's closed or no service or whatever. I'm not having any of this, so I drive around looking for any church that isn't Peace Lutheran on 2818. That leaves Friend's Congressional Church and First Baptist Church. Well, Friend's service has obviously already started, so that was out - and First Baptist didn't start till 11:00. It's about 10:40 now. I really don't want to wait, maybe Peace will work, I think to myself.    Will that person be there? There is a small chance so, but I can sit in an unlikely place and we won't run into each other. Ok, so I pull into the parking lot just as my Low Fuel light turns on. Ok God, I'll go in. I'm sitting watching people enter and none are bringing in Bibles. Odd. Should I leave mine in the car? I'm already kind of nervous, so I take it along for peace of mind. Walking in I know that a Lutheran church does things very differently from a Baptist church, so I walk up to the greeters and introduce myself hoping that they might explain anything which I might need to know - like where the secret hymnals are or how to get the brochure. But they neglected to point those out, so I went and sat in a pew. And waited.    And the service starts, a casual glance around fails to uncover the person, and I relax a little - it'll be all right, I tell myself, even without the special hymnal or a bloody clue as to what's going on the service picks me up and I'm feeling at ease.    The second song starts, don't ask me what it was. I decide that at the end I'm going to ask the lady to my right where she got the hymnals so that I can participate. Yeah that's a good plan. The lady to my right. Yeah. That's the ticket. Yeah. WHAT THE HECK!??!?! OH MAN I AM SO SCREWED! LOOK, THIS ISN'T WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. Guess who is coming down this pew, and stands right next to me on my right.    Oh if I wasn't a bundle of nerves before I am now. The song ends, and so I gently asked, "Miss, where'd you get that hymnal?" short, terse, quick, with a hint of pissedoffedness came spoken response "In front," and the unspoken response very clearly being  what the hell are you doing here?  and I'm thinking, "Geez, I didn't come here to see you, I thought you were out of town,  why are you here ? Why did you come and sit  right next to me ? Why didn't you go sit  over there  where you sat before? This could have been easy, but now it won't be."    So I scoot over a bit and put a good two feet in between us, out of range of any covert kicks, punches, or whacks, and try to just focus on the service. And oh goody, it looks like - surprise surprise - they're going to do Communion today. If you know me, you'll know that lately, whenever I go to any church they have Communion on that day. It's ridiculous. In a Baptist church like the one I grew up in, you have Communion at most once a year. So it's a special event. Like Easter or Christmas. But the churches around here must be going through bread and wine at a phenomenal rate. Or maybe God's just letting me catch up.    Ok, so I want to take Communion, but if I do I know I can't be angry at the person next to me. In fact, I was never angry, just a little scared (and wouldn't you be? she's got nails and scary hair and gets in mosh pits and could probably kick my ass right there in church and if people got upset about the commotion in the back row she could just point at me and say "ER" and everyone would just go back to praising God, or something, did I get a little carried away there?). Oh well, nothing I can do about that now. So I pray extra hard during the prayers, and focus extra well on the baptism and sermon, and when it comes time for the food, I take it in rememberance of Him. And I like it.    Oh this is great. I actually enjoyed the service. A lot. sarcasmFantastic./sarcasm I'm so screwed. How's this going to work out? I'm not Lutheran, I didn't grew up Lutheran, I don't know a thing beyond what I picked up in the service about them, I couldn't find their secret hymnals, and someone who doesn't want me here is here and actually knows the words to the random incantations spoken from the congregation seemingly at random throughout the service.    It hurts when I think about losing you. It hurts to think of you with someone else. I try not to think about that too much.  I have to stay busy.  There are other girls.    I'm hungry. I'm jittery. I'm going to Fazoli's to see if the girl with the nice smile (Russ said she thought I was cute! I feel like I'm in High School) is working today and for some fine Italian dining, and then to the Rec to climb. Or maybe I'll go after I go to the Rec.  Better idea.
