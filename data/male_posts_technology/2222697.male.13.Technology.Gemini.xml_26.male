I am very thankful for getting a computer and other things. Today we drove to tyler made a few stops, but eventually got here. When we pulled up to the gate we saw that our door was open. Someone had got into our house and stole $1000 of power tools and all the other stuff of value around our house. It was not vandalized only our couch was messed up because they were probably looking for a remote. They stole my tv and my sega genesis which i had both worked hard for and were cherished naturally. I loved that tv and worked my ass off for it. And i mowed the yard twice for the genesis. I probably did more work than those vandals will ever do. I personally think it was the contractors that were putting a roof on our new garage. Those bastards. The county sherrif came over and uncovered nothing for 1 1/2 hours. He told us that we need a security system, supposedly we are getting one in the morning. I will become a prisoner in my own home not being able to get up at night for some water. I feel very violated and uncomforable today. I want to go home very bad and kill these child molesting teen agers who have ruined our christmas. Well at least nobody was killed or our house went up in flames. I am thankful for what i have and every single theiving teen should burn in a pit of their own blood for all the trouble and deppression they cause families. We bought a new tv for me and i guess it is more of a christmas then, its nice, 26" maybe. probably i wont get another genesis because the insurance has only paid for part of the tv. I'm fine though, I am going through minor deppression and anxiety right now because of this whole event. But at least all my family members and my dog are alive. You probably dont care because there are alot worse off then me. Aim-samuraipanda5 Yim-samuraipanda5 msn-samuraipanda5@hotmail.com
