However, the ration would have to be less than that to allow for evaporation.Water pump andfiltration system. Would work for drinking water in emergency, but mostly for pumping water from dirty sources for use in the truck and cleaning stuff. Input hose can be lowered from underneath the truck into an appropriate source.An historical thing might be to take weak beer instead of water for drinking, as it doesn't go bad?   Fuel:  300gallons of diesel - assuming the truck will get 10mpg, this is3000 miles of range (conservative estimate). Diesel would be available from lots of places for free for many years after a class 4 outbreak. Under floor fuel pumping system that will attach directly to the inlets of fuel tanks on forecourts. Extra Fuel tanks need to be military spec self sealing/armoured.   Food:  I am not sure how towork this out. Anyone got any ideas? Lots of Rice/dried vegand tins? And multivitamins? How much per person per day? hmmm. Food is bulky though, go for high calorie stuff? Special containers to keep it fresh.   Weapons:  8 12-borepump action Mossbergmarine (ie.weather resistant)shotguns with extended magazines. 500 rpg of00 buckshot. 500 rpg rifled slugs. Equipment to clean, service and repair the shotguns. Spare parts inc. 2 spare barrels per gun.   2 grenade launchers.100 frag grenadesfor anti human activity.200 phosphor grenades. Safer, non line of sight and longer range than a flame thrower!Equipment to clean, service and repair the launchers.   12Modifed swords - similar to Roman gladius, but with hand and a half (bastard sword)grip to allow a more powerful two handed swing if needed for quicker beheading of partially disabled Zombies.  12 Roman legionaire shields of the imperial rectangular design. Great for locking together and holding the Zombies while cutting them up.  12 Lightweight anti-Shark suits. These will offer bite protection better than any classical or medieval armor without being excessively heavy.   Truck modifications/weapons:  In addition to the armour etc.detailed in previous post.  Additional load carrying, "facilities"area above habitation - solar cells, wind turbine, batteries, heater and aircon(see below).  Train type cow catcher, but needs to be raiseable to give ground clearance. Sharp, extended edge shuld leave many immobilized zombies behind. Useful for pushing through a crowd.  Large sideextendable blades, around 4.5ft off the ground. Good for clearing space for any following vehicles. Experimentation required but suggest 10ft long per sidewith wide blage for strength without thickness.  Run flat tyres if they can be obtained in these sizes.  Portholes with steel covers for shotgunson sides, front and back. These should not create a weakness in the armor if added like ship portholes.  Simple props should be lowerable to prevent the truck being rolled over.   Electrical Equipment:  Solar Cells for the roof with batteries. No need to have engine running while stopped, which isgood because it is quiet.Looks like the lastest solar panels give the opportunity to generate up to 1.5kW on the roof of the truck. Cutting this down to a more realistic 1kW, there should be plently of power, even without the engine running as long as everything is not on at the same time. Batteries would be very heavy, but a good supply of sealed car batteries (ie. reliable and no electronics needed) wouldbe needed. A wind turbine would assist too, though would be a big addition - however, would be invaluable once a safe location was reached. One of these:  urlLink http://www.windenergy.com/PRODUCTS/air403.html looks good.  Lights - not neon tubes - low powerhalogen will be a lot easier on the eye.  Small aircon unit, which should work ok in the small volumewhile it lasts.  Heater - small oil filled radiator.  Radio (receiver and transmitter, as wide band as possible).  Battery chargers for torches and walkie-talkies.   Misc Equipment:  Clothing  Toiletries - esp large supply of hard soap and toothpaste/toothbrushes. Not sure about the Andrex factor light but very bulky. - Take as much as possible I guess.  200m heavy dutyclimbing rope .  Towel.  Cooking equipment.  Medical supplies for accidents.  Fire extinguishers (water, foam and powder)  Entertainment - DVD player + DVDs - cards, dice etc.
