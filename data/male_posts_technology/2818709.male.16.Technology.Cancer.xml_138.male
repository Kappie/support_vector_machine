I want a zombie outbreak. One where a few teachers become zombies, and I get to blow their heads off with a shotgun. It'd be so much fun to defend shephard mall. I would be on top of the mall, with a sniper rifle and two sawed-off shotguns. The sniper rifle for picking off any that i saw, and the two sawed-offs in case I missed one. Eat lead, zombie bitch. ka-blamo. No more zombie-head. No more zombie-head = no more zombie. It's just that easy. And dizzy's would give me free caffeine so that i could defend better. Sleeping would be done in astec, because of the fact that astec only has 2 insecure entrance points. The space place, and the front glass door. Those could be barracaded quite easily, though. and we would use many bottles of fabreeze, so that the zombies couldnt smell the people with no projectile weapons. If there WAS a "last stand" situation in the mall, i think it would be done at AOL. Seriously! Aol has very defendable positions. We could wait for a helicopter evac. And there could be a few thousand zombies assulting the place,  with about 100 people left in the building. It'd be FUN!  On another note, this morning, on the way to school, i thought of something rather odd. What if god had an orgasm? What would happen? Please, leave me a comment on what you think would happen. I think that he would accidentally negate all life in the universe.
