For those you not in the know, NCAA Football 2005 has a Mascot Game option in which all players are replaced by the bulky team mascots.  I played as the University of Florida mascot  urlLink Albert the Gator  and my brother chose Oklahoma State's  urlLink Pistol Pete .   Team Pete jumped out to an early lead but Team Albert used its superior passing game to take a 23-22 lead at half time.  With 2 minutes left in the game Team Albert had a an impressive 39-22 lead.  But Team Pete overcame the odds and scored two touch downs and a two point conversion in the next minute.  Trailing by two with 30 seconds to Team Pete proceeded to march down the field and nail a game winning 37 yard field goal as time expired.  A mass of Pistol Petes rushed the field while and the Alberts shook their heads in despair.
