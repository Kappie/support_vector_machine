Instead, I am using this as a tool to vent my frustrations. My lack of posting has to do with the fact that I have been, for the most part, not very frustrated. Sure, there's the usual crap that puts a frown on my face, but for the most part, things have been pretty close to tip-top.  So then why am I writing now? Why not shut up and go away until I have something juicy to scream about? Well, because I am bored at work and have no better way to spend my break than to jot some things down. A few "projects" in various forms of completion have crept into my social life, leaving me pretty winded. What are they?   Internet Radio Station  That's right, I am working on my very own internet radio station. Now, its not going to be anything huge like  urlLink www.knac.com  or anything of that nature, but it is a springboard that will hopefully launch a side career for me. As you may (if you know me) or may not know, I used to be involved in radio heavily. I worked at a couple stations in Cincinnati, and I even received certification from the Ohio Center for Broadcasting. So as you can see, I am qualified to make this happen. Basically what this entails is running a server from which I will broadcast various types of music through. Am I going to DJ? Well, that depends. As for right now, I am just running music through automation, and that provides for uninterrupted music for as long as I leave the station up. Sometimes its an hour, other times its for a day. It all depends on what I have going. Right now, I mainly use it to listen to something at work, and there is enough slots for 1 other person to listen to what's playing. So, once things get finalized, you'll find out here what's up.   E-zine  OK, this isn't that huge, but basically I am in the process are starting up an e-zine with a couple friends of mine. What is an e-zine exactly? Well, its really something similar to this. Basically its a web-based newspaper that is going to cover various points of interest revolving around the arts. Aside from being the webmaster, I am also going to be a bit of a contributing editor. I'll have a couple columns of differing topics, and perhaps my own review section for albums, movies, books, whatever I can bother myself with. My personal life takes a front seat to all this, and therefore I need to make sure I have my priorities going before I dedicate time and money to that venture.   Novel(s)  Yeah, you read that right. I am working on several novels of different subject matter. I am not going to drop titles or anything as of yet, seeing as I put quite a lot of thought into these and I would hate for someone to steal these titles and make them their own. Screw that, this is my work, dammit, go create your own. I have a semi-autobiographical in there, as I have lived quite an interesting life, mixed with some fiction to spice up boring parts. I am also working on a comedic space epic in the vein of Douglas Adams' fantastic "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" series and Monty Python. I am also working with a couple friends on a reference guide to all things related to rock. Its not an encyclopedia of rock music that you usually think of...no no no. Its actually a listing for up and coming bands who want to try to get into the biz. Basically I was having conversations with a couple friends of mine who are in bands and how they are sick of not being able to cut a break because of lack of connections. Well, considering I still have a few friends in radio, I tend to have some pretty good connections in this regard, so I decided to put together, with their help, a guide for young, aspiring bands to help get them in the door. I have venues, promoters, studios, rehearsal spaces, and small, independent record labels all listed with write-ups on them. This is going to be a must-have for bands that are deciding to take it serious but not knowing what to do next. This has the potential of being released first, as there are a lot of interested parties who'd love the info we've gathered. Well, there's no such thing as a free lunch, so you'll have to buy it like everyone else.  Anyway, that's what's been up. I just realized that I didn't say a word on this blog for the whole month of July, so I guess this update to what's been up was a bit rewarding. Until I get pissed again, this is your old pal Josh.
