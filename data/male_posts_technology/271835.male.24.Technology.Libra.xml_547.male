So, what could be better than   combining   a story about hard disks with another NewLinks favourite -   a nice cup of tea  .   Yep, scientists have discovered that green tea can provide a more effective and environmentally-friendly method of  urlLink preparing computer hard disks .    That also qualifies for our environmentally friendly story of the day too. ;)  w00+!
