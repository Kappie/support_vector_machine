When someone does you wrong, you are supposed to turn the other cheek, and do it repeatedly until it hurts, and then do it some more. But that doesn't include forgiveness, does it? That is to say by allowing someone to slap you silly, you aren't necessarily forgiving them. And if your Father were to rape, cheat, mutilate, and murder, are you supposed to allow it? Are you supposed to forgive him and say, "Eh, that's ok! He is only human!"  Leave forgiveness to the pros. Don't beat yourself up for holding a grudge. Its ok to get upset when people do you wrong. You don't have to be pansy. Their day will come.
