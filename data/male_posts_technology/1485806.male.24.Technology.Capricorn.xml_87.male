Melissa Wong ..my cell mate urlLink     This marks the happiest moments of SIB KL ,a milestones , a mark that is marked on everyone's staff ..to mark for many a new journey to serve and contribute to the Lord in a dynamic , culturally rich church where people's heart are encouraged to be passionate about the Lord. The growth of a church are not calculated in growth number of members but is a tangible unit to show how much the church have grown.  A fren of mine... urlLink Ireneq  blogs of how her journey of searching for a church ends back in her home church. She was of course have been absent for quite some time from her home church and was shocked to find her church's goals for 2004  urlLink   was stated in numbers.  But of course ppl like  urlLink BOB  gives her some reassurance  He thinks it is understandable for the church leadership to set quantifiable goals. "These days, people have problems interpreting the abstract. There's less independent and creative thought; most people are unable to think out of the box. Information is doled out in point form. They can't picture abstract ideas," he said, adding, "Think about it: which is easier to understand: 'Therefore go and make disciples of all nations' (from here), or 'Get 300 salvations'?" See his points.  Many people who are not in the church and does not understand the church's direction have lots to say about a church ..and was very quick to judge but caution is often given to people is that if u don't understand the church intenttion then don't be so quick to judge.   Churches like SIBKL, DUMC ..have always gives me the passions to serve in an environment where people still retains the culture of encouragement as though they are in small church. They are still faithfull to small little things which enables God to continue to pour His blessings upon them and help them expand their capacities for the new blessing God decides to pour upon them.  I am like in 3rd year of serving in SIBKL and i 'll have never got tired of it ..in fact i am much like warming up ...for what God have in store for us...and for God himself.  Any Comments from those from other churches about what they thought?
