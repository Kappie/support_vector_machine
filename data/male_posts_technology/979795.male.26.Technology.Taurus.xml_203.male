Wed, I had to skip the first hour and could only go for the second. But I don't feel very warmed up. 1 hr class always never feel alright with me. Feels a bit abrupt. Like everything ended too early. Dunno lah, just crap lah.  Sensei taught us 4 variations wourking our way up to a technique called Uderiminage. Wah, took me a while to remember the name. Think she said it's called 'arm entwining' throw or something like that. It' a very good and effective technique, but I must admit I had a lot of problems being uke. She pointed out that I wasn't giving enough for nage to do the technique. Sigh, spent the whole day working on the giving part, but I still can't quite get it. Alamak how how how. Sometimes I realise that even if I do certain things right, I lose it the next time I practice. How come I can't keep things consistent. Ok lah, this giving area is something I've never been able to do properly. Sometimes I can do it to a 'passing' degree for certain techniques but for uderiminage it was absolutely crucial, and I just couldn't. Think this weekend, I'm gonna go take a look at Donovan Waite's Advanced Ukemi footage again. Try to understand something that I might've missed out.  ARGHHH!!!!
