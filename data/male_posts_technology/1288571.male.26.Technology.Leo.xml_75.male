I mean, its just burning software for shit sakes. I think I have mental problems. Though to be fair, it looks like a sweet, sweet software package.  Been getting a lot of flak from people who are hardcore  geeks   urlLink Nero  users though. As silly as it sounds, even thinking about using anything else is blasphemy to these people. To ridicule someone over something as mundane as personal choice of burning software is pretty silly, don't you think?
