It happens all too frequently... First the thing with Brady and the Rivas' .... I DON'T CARE WHO'S ****ING FAULT IT IS... GET OVER IT. (I know almost everyone has by now, but there are the lingering few). And then the stint with Cameran right after that... so he decides to try and get from all the emotional politics for a bit... big deal.   But what really honestly ticks me off is all the little bickering and nitpicking that goes on between people WHO'VE NEVER EVEN MET FACE TO FACE.... for God's sake... I mean, get a life... there are better issues to get bent out of shape about than your suddenly loosing your 73rd online friend because your 21st IMed them behind your proverbial back and they both decided they didn't like you.   Becky, you're right about people (including me) not helping at all by posting demeaning things or leaving demeaning comments on other's blogs, but I still think you could've been a little more tactful with the posting of your little altered poem there. You're right about it being your journal, diary, whatever, but it's also been transformed into a means of communication to other people simply by virtue of its being accessible to essentially all humanity. Because of this fact, we have an obligation to censor our blogs to some extent to protect others and ourselves.
