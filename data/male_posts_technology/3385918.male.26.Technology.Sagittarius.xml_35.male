The report indicates that visitors to the stores are using their cell phones's camera capability to copy magazines and pages of books. Yoshihiro Maruoka, the operator of one bookstore in Tokyo's Kanda district, an area lined with bookstores, told the newspaper, "If this keeps up, our books won't sell." Cell phones with full video capacity are expected to be marketed within two years and are likely to be so small that anyone using them in a theater would probably go undetected.
