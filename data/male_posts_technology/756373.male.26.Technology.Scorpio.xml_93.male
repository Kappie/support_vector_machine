Which is all well and good, but does anyone else get the distinct feeling that the US is cutting it's losses and getting the hell out? America has lost the PR war, which is saddening - it's doubtful that America will ever again be able to 'do good' in the name of liberation. People will look back and view today as the day America said, "the hell with the world, they don't appreciate us - let them sort their own shit out." And it's happening. Force reduction in Germany. Handing responsibility for training and security over to Nato. Cowing to a little bad press, the Bush Administration has taken a step back and decided to focus on trying to win the next election : so politics once again gets in the way of doing the Right Thing. Iraq will probably sink back into the cesspool of violence and dictatorship it was pre-Gulf War 2. Give it a couple months, or a year and the theocrats will have iron control of Iraq, sculpting it into Iran-Lite. No doubt America's detractors, calling for the US's complete withdrawal now, will blame the US for that too, somehow. What I forsee for the next couple of decades (my lifetime) :  The US will probably want less and less to do with providing security to Europe and the middle-east, and will instead retreat behind it's ballistic-missile shields or whatever. Wars in the third world will break out, there will be more violence and genocide, and yes, probably nuclear war between squalling petulant dictators who just got their hands on nukes thanks to the IAEA's incompetence and America's choice to adopt a pre-WW2 state of non-involvement. But that seems to be what the world wants, so hey, America - give it to them. Ignore the pleas for salvation when Rwanda-esque massacres become nom-de-rigeur across the ME. I, for one, am actually  totally and unequivocally  for a complete disengagement plan. It's what the Arabs want, after all. Let them have it.
