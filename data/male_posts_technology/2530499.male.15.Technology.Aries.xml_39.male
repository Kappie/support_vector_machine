TAKE THAT YOU CLEAN FREAKS!!!! *blows everyone's noise making horns making an obnoxious....* SQUAN-KEE!!!! SQUAN-KEE!!!! Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!  I LOVE PARTYYYSSSS!!!!!  .... *cough* Writing.  Right.  Well, on the lower side of the bloggie excitement spectrum... We have a black belt promotion today. And that means that the Demo team or the "Fight" team will be performing. And that means that I will be performing. And normally this is not a problem. Except today, my entire body is sore for one reason or another, but mostly my back because Mr. Cristy-Cracker physically educated it on how to be dead for three days straight. (I'm going to continue as though you care, because it makes ME feel better. So bloooh on you.) And then I believe I pulled a leg muscle *dies* last night, along with burning the tops of my feet and both knees on the mats. After this demo, which is highly important BECAUSE it's a black belt promo...I will be resigning my highly coveted place as "Most Attendant Demo Member" for the easily acheived "I'm too flipping much in pain to come to Demo Tonight Member". And that's all I've got to say aboot that.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY JACQUEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *blows more horns* *throws more confetti t * *keels over from excitement*  ~Teh Karine~   Because every team needs a leader
