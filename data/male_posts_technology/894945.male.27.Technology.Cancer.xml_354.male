On Thursday night we were at a little swanky bar/restaurant and had been waiting AGES for our main course, like 3/4 of an hour or something. So eventually our steaks arrive and we wolf them down like crazed cannibals. Some of the other peeps still didn't have their chicken or whatever they had ordered, but Andy calls over the little Polish waitress and asks her if she has any jelly for dessert. She smiles unknowingly and says she'll ask the chef. So she scoots into the kitchen, and the next minute we hear shouting and pots and pans being banged around. I thought there was always room for jello :P
