I was a bit worried that it would rain, but no, it kept off and proved to be much better weather than what we had left at home.  Parking is really handy in the town centre and quite good access for disabled buggies etc. We even managed to combine a bus and boat tour, which I can highly recommend, and saves money to. Just get your tickets either on the tour bus or boat.  Isn’t it strange the way yanks flock to these historic places, probably because they have no heritage of their own, serves them right for their war of independence, which, if I think on was just a bunch of colonial Brits against taxes (something which I’m sure we all have sympathy for!).  Maybe in order for the present government to sit up and ‘Listen’ to the people who elected them (more fool us!) we need some sort of new revolution, down with Immigration, NO to duty of fuel, and let us import as many cigs and booze as we like.  Oi Govt situp and listen to YOUR PEOPLE.
