I saw a wonderful  urlLink site  a few days back. I'm using it as an inspiration. Let see how it comes out. Your suggestions for the layout are welcome. If you come across a nice website (in terms of design and layout), blog it. No sites using Flash. please.   Manny, send me the mail ids of Ajayan and Bala (the ids they use most frequently).   Update : Members bio.
