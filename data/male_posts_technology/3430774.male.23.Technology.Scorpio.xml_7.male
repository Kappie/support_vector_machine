The costume is selected by my own, taste not bad quar :P Initially i wish to have blazer with tie as my costume but after think twice, i believe that night sure will have a lot of people prepared themselves with the same/similar costume too. Therefore, at last i came out with a simple costume as shown in the photo :P Outer shirt from SEED, Inner shirt (white) from SEED, Long pant also from SEED, to save my time, ahahaa.. :D  Appreciate the enjoy moment with all the friends. But regretably miss out a partner to dance with :P When will be the next chance coming up? :P Luckily we able to get ourself a digital camera, took a lot of pictures that night, of course we must do it otherwise another regret for me. The members of my table :D Is it a benefit to wear in light costume? :P    urlLink        Just to blog the feeling i have that night....
