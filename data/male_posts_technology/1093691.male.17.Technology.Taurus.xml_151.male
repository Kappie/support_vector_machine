Now I basically have to attend maths and IT revsion clubs along with textiles and art clubs AND other revison clubs including science. Argh! When will these clubs end? Especially as they haven't begun!   Anywho, right now I am multi-tasking!! I am writing a blog here, writing a blog for my austrailan type o one I am on, talking to 2 people on msn, watching last nights ER for the second time, drinking a chocolate milk shake (and may I say how marvelous it is) and wiating for a text. Ooo! I texted Paul (aka the Walrus) earlier saying 'aww bless, hes cute even when he is talking to his form tutor'. But I cunningly text him when he went in for his talk thing! Mwahaha. Bet he didn't have his phone with him. Mind you, you'll only understand that last line or so if you post on the snooboo.com forum.  I am trying my hardest to be in a cheery mood and it seems to be suceeding, even though I'm ill and I wil keep reminding everyone of that until I get the sympthay I want. LOL.
