We had hospital scrubs for everyone, except for Joe and Ryan M. who were patieents.  We won the group outfit award and a gift certificate for a pizza party (just typing that made me feel like I was in third grade).  Anyway the kids from the preschool across the street came through and got candy.  It was pretty fun.  I will have pictures up soon.    We have a puzzle at work now that I am on a mission to complete.    Okay, well  urlLink Dawson's  is on tonight...so I am going to get going...until then...
