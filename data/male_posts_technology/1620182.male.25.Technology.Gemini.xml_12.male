Right now, the gods are hurling hail stones at me.  Well, I haven't really seen any hail stones, but I've been told by "trustworthy"  urlLink sources  that they're on the way.  I'm supposed to be away from windows in the lowest level of my house right now.  Instead, I've opted for a cubicle on the second floor of my office building with a great view of this storm.  Mother nature's really taking it to the parking lot.  She's giving it a right good thrashing.  But she's not going to get me.  Oh, no.  In less than 17 hours, I'll be on my way to the beach for a nice vacation.  Oh yeah.
