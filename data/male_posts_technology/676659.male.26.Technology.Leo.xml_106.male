     
      There's A Reason  For every pain that we must bear, for every burden, every care, There's a reason.  For every grief that bows the head, for every teardrop that is shed, there's a reason.  For every hurt, for every plight, for every lonely pain-racked night, there's a reason.  But if we trust God as we should, it all will work out for our good. He knows the reason.  "We know that for those who love God, all things work together unto Good." (romans 8:28)
