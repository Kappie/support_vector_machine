Tho there're still problems with the work I'm doing, I am making a significant progress today. Alas, there's still a problem tho, which is still stuck in my mind. Yeah. People to people communication. I am just not good at that. It's such a trouble to convey my message, I guess     Can you see the picture here? Is there me inside? Ahahaha. I am missing from the picture, but it's one of the scene that amused me. It really was.  Come to think of it, maybe it's better for me to be missing in everyone else's scenes as well, so that no trouble comes from me at all.   Darn. I'm losing myself here. I could be missing from my own life.    if i can get back a friend by letting go half of my life i'd do that if that's what i've to pay i'd pay just dont take a friendship away i've already lost a lot i've lost a lot  i feel so terrible it was like i am the one... "a friend that's drifting away".   don't you wanna have the continuation of the lines of words?  i do, but it hurts even just by thinking, it does hurt even by reading, i'm hurt  thanks for reminding me and i still am with thee tho i feel you're drifted apart a friendship is still in my heart   I'd value friendship to my very best. But I am still not ready for more than that. I can be anyone's best friend (No... I'm not a dog, please) yet I am always at a distance. Sorry. I don't have any intention to break anyone's feeling. I'd try, if I could, to set the part which involves  deep feeling  aside but then, I am just a cretin on the face of the earth. Limited to whatever thing I can do, not every wish comes true.  I'm quite out of time now. People comes and go in my life. The same goes for me. I might be just another temporary stop in anyone's life.  Some people may just become more significant than the others. I may too.  I don't want to remember.  I don't want to forget. I am missing... in my own thinking.
