Quick, can you name the 4 left out with a bonus to name the one he added?   "For some reason, the most vocal Christians among us never mention the beatitudes. But, often with tears in their eyes, they demand that the Ten Commandments be posted in public buildings. And of course that's Moses, not Jesus. I haven't heard one of them demand that the Sermon on the Mount, the beatitudes, be posted anywhere."   - Kurt Vonnegut   Taken From  urlLink http://www.inthesetimes.com/site/main/article/cold_turkey/
