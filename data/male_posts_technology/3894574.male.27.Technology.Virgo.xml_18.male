About 100 times I tried logging in and it was like the page just reloaded with my username and password still in place. My first thought was to clear my blogger cookie in I.E.6. I've been having problems off and on with Internet Explorer, so I decided to make sure I had all the latest updates from Microsoft. While those were downloading, I read some of the help info on the blogger website, and decided to give Mozilla a spin. Well after downloading and installing it, I fired up foxfire and proceeded to the login page. Same problem. So for good measure, I cleared everything.(cookies, cache, history, saved passwords, and auto form stuff) Tried again and here am. Go figure.
