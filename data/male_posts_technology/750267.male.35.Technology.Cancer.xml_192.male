According to the story, Janet Arvizo once sued J.C. Penny, claiming security guards beat and sexually assaulted her in 1998 when she was caught shoplifting with her kids. J.C. Penny paid $137,500 to settle the suit out of court.   Then during her divorce earlier this year, she accused her husband of spousal abuse and child cruelty. Her former husband of course denies those allegations, and also claims that his ex-wife had gotten their children to lie about that abuse on her behalf.  More recently, her son (who has leukemia) was granted a wish to meet Michael Jackson. Jackson paid the boy's medical bills, bought his mother a car and gave the family a place to live. Earlier this year, Michael informed them that he could no longer financially support the family. Suddenly he's being charged with sexual assualt.  This story will obviously be brought up in court, and could serve to harm the case of the accuser. So even if the charges are true, the fact that this woman had a history of dubious abuse accusations, and was financially reliant on Michael Jackson until just a short time ago, would damage her credibility greatly.  In other words, she has a history of claiming abuse in various situations for financial gain. She gets caught shoplifting, claims abuse, and gets a financial settlement. She gets divorced, claims abuse, and wins custody of the kids. Michael Jackson stops paying her rent? Surprise, surprise -- she claims abuse again. I hope the judge in this case allows these claims to be entered into evidence, as it really does seem relevant to this case.  I'm still not convinced anything happened here. We'll see though.
