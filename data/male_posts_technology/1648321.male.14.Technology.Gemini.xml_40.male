She won't suffer anymore, she won't feel anymore pain. Maggie contributed to the Myers family for all of my life, 13 1/2 years. Maggie is older than me, but after school today, I will come home, and she will be gone; forever on earth. Maggie is and will be an Angel Dog. She might come down and visit us. She will sleep on our beds, sit in her usual places, and still eat secretly out of her food and water bowl. My mom and dad are going to the vet sometime from noon to when my mom picks me up after school (around 3:30). For all of us, today will be one of the toughest days, ever. I have created a movie about Maggie; a slideshow of pictures of her. This movie is so sad, I cannot watch it. This post still isn't very long; not even close to as long as Maggie's wonderful life. We all love her, and we will miss her. Amen.
