"We don't anticipate farther hacking as we have put in enough security barriers," she added.  So they say!! But have you gone to the english Al-Jazeera site lately? No??! Then hop over to their  urlLink site  right now!  Whoa!! you're it!! You are the hacker!! I'm not saying that. The site says so. Dear reader, your IP address is in the list of IP addresses banned by Al-Jazeera.  Not a very bright team of web-site security they have, do they?!   [link via  urlLink WarFilter ]
