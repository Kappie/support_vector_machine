I think that a tattoo would be nice for conversation starting and allow me to have a unique way of expressing myself.   At this point, I am in decent enough shape that my tattoo shouldn't have too much misshaping over the next few years. I may go with something like a musical note or maybe a dog. I don't know, I need to think about this... :S   Peace-  T
