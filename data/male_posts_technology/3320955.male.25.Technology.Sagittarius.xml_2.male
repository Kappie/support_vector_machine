Completed the Billing project and did a Quick QA ,Looks awesome ,I figured that sitting down and thinking about the problems in coding is much more effective than grinding away @ the code ,I got done with the code which was slated for 2 days in roughly about 4-5 hrs . I am very happy I have made this switch... So long....
