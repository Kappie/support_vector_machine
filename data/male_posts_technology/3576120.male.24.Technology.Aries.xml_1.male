And if Vin Diesel ends up as lex luthor, then I will drink diesel fuel and lite myself on fire.  At this rate, I would rather troma productions take over the movie. At least I could look forward to superman fighting the toxic avenger and the Sgt. Kabukiman.  They could even change his history so that he came from nukem high and that would still be better than the crap that JJ Abrams wrote.  I'm sure JJ is a nice writer, but he sure knows how to fucker up a superman movie.  So for all the kiddies that wants to know gather around and I will give you the skinny on the script.  First off, it must be said that I don't hate or dislike JJ Abrams.  After all, he brought us felicity and the goddess known as Kerri Russell.  Anyway, here are the highlights.  1. The fighting will be done in a matrix kung fu style 2. Lex Luthor will work for the CIA UFO division and will later unveil himself as an alien as well 3. Krypton does not explode 4. A non comic book villain, who was created for the movie, by the name of tyzor, is used. 5. They kill superman and bring him back to life with a scene where Jor-el, superman fathers, convinces him in the after life to come back alive. 6. They refer to jimmy olsen as gay 7. They change how clark is found.  Instead of them finding him while they are driving, he basically nearly crash into there house with a space ship. 8. By what I could tell, lois lane has no character development. 9. And the movie ends with superman duping it out with Lex  All this added to together equals a great shittastical fun time. Why oh why do they not use a good villain from the comic book or related well-known mythos.  What about the Eradicator, Mongul, Darksied, Bloodsport, and even doomsday?   There is even a character named imperiox that could for the most part fit perfectly in this overall story.  I also hate that every adaptation of a screenplay I run across tends to try to dump lex luthor down.  The whole point of his dynamic with superman was that he could intellectual take him on.  Mind vs. Power.  Also Lex is in a business world that allows him some immunity from supes….. ahhhhhhhhhhaaaaahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!  Why is it, that every time a movie is written for a superhero, that they must revisit the origin of the character?  Everyone knows where supes came from…. I could write a script where the origin could be told in five minutes… how hard is that…. It's called a montage… where information is quickly presented to bring the viewer up to track… anyway.. I must go.. I have lunch now… I'll be back for more later.. FASHIZZLE!
