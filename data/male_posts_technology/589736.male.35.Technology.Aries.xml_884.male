"that's warped!  that's warped and evil and wrong!  when you threw me out i went to live with somebody. i...i was in love with him..i was happy.  if that's a prison then i don't care!"  "don't you?  your lover lived in that penitentiary that we are all born into, and was forced to rake the dregs of that world for his living.  he knew affection and tenderness but only briefly.  eventually one of the other inmates stabbed him with a cutlass and he drowned upon his own blood.  is that it, evey?  is that the happiness worth more than freedom? it's not an uncommon story, evey.  many convicts meet with miserable ends."  from my favorite novel - "v for vendetta"
