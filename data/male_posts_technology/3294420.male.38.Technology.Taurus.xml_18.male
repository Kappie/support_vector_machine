We were pretty bummed as we know that she has to be eating like a champ in order to come home.  Today they increased her again as she has been doing pretty well.  If all goes smoothly, she'll be home later this week.  It really all depends on the eating at this point.  Today she weighs 6 pounds 10 ounces.  Maya briefly met Darrin and Jeanette this weekend.  We were able to sneak them each in for a few minutes.  We'll try to take some new pictures tonight.  Love to you all,  Gina.
