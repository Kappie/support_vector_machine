In summary, it'sa report by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, Inc. that suggest African Americans bear much more of the burden of global warming than do whites. From the Executive Summary:     African Americans are already disproportionately burdened by the health effects of climate change, including deaths during heat waves and from worsened air pollution. Similarly, unemployment and economic hardship associated with climate change will fall most heavily on the African American community.  African Americans are less responsible for climate change than other Americans.  Both historically and at present, African Americans emit less greenhouse gas.    Policies intended to mitigate climate change can generate large health and economic benefits or costs for African Americans, depending on how they are structured.      The basic underlying principle is that because the majority of African Americans live in the inner cities and low income places, they are bearing a bigger burden than any other American. Judging by this logic, all us white people should ban together and make the government shovel our driveways, becausewhites are probably more likely todie shoveling their driveways than blacks. This is due to the concentration of different people in different regions of the country. You could make nearly any argument you wanted if you twisted the facts enough.  Maybe the Congressional White Caucus Foundation, Inc. should put out a study on the unequal burden of footing the welfare bill. Oh wait...that wouldn't be very PC of me to say...better forget I said that.  I can't tell you how much this raised my blood pressure.
