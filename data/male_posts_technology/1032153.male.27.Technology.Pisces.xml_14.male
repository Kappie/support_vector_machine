Conviently (or perhaps arranged?!?!) I don't start work at Tip Top until the following Monday. Yes exactly! So tuesday avo, me and Jono are cruising down in my new car (subject to Dan saying it's ok tomorrow) to the Kauranga Valley, and strolling up to the Pinnacles hut for the night. Awesome stuff. I love getting away from Auckland. It gives one time to think, and just take things slowly - maybe life used to be like that before computers mobile phones, and so on. Speaking of mobile phones - Who is the twerp that invented them! I mean who wants to be contacted more than they already are! The ways to beat this annoying technoilogy which means we are at everyone's beck and call all the time are as follows:-  1) Don't have a mobile. 2) Have a mobile like my last one where the microphone and hearing piece both didn't work. 3) TURN IT OFF!  Far out! I was reading my passage from Genesis the other day, and found out that Abraham married again after Mrs Abraham died! I don't remember reading that before.   Question: Why do guys find it difficult to make deep freindships.........?  Shucks my mobile is ringing better go........
