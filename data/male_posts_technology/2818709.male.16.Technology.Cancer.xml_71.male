Now it's fscking short. about 2 inches. compared to my 5 inches of before. I dont know if i'll be going to dev's party. I dont know if i'm even going to bother living. Jesus christ. Why cant I get homework done? I just cant fscking get myself to do it. I dont know why. I just cant make myself sit down and do homework. All the teachers think that the recent downfall of my grades is because of dani (they told my dad this). NO. It's not. They sucked BEFORE i started dating dani. Assholes. He was literally screaming at me in the car. As loud as he could. Well. I dont think that i'll be playing video games, talking on aim, or doing anything that i've been doing for the past month. I'll be at digitalhistory.uh.edu studying for u.s. history. And reading my chem book. And trying to convince my dad that i'm not a miserable failure. Because that's apparently what he thinks of me.
