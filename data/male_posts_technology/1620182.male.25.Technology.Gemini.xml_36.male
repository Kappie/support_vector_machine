I know that's blasphemy coming from someone living in the shadow of Yankee stadium, but it's high time I let these feelings out.  Some of my finest baseball memories of late almost all involve the Yankees losing in October.  Watching Mariano Rivera's meltdown in game 7 of the 2001 World Series against the Diamondbacks tops the list.  Last year's loss to the rally monkey was fun, too.
 
 This year the Yankees managed to beat one of my favorite teams, the Red Sox in the ALCS.  That was horrible.  I hate the Yankees.  I hate the fact that they have  all  of the good players.  I hate Derek Jeter's swagger.  I hate how Jorge Posada always gets the bloop hit to break his opponent's back.  I hate how Matsui only becomes Godzilla during the post-season.  I love how Enrique Wilson keeps making errors.
 
 Now the Yankees are facing elimination from one of my former favorite teams, the Marlins.  I say former because I, like almost all Marlins fans, felt alienated when their championship team of 1997 was immediately dismantled to become the worst team in baseball.  I lived in Miami when they received the Marlins as an expansion team.  I followed them closely for four years.  Then they sold out...took the money and ran.  
 
 But now they're back from the dead, and about to beat the greatest dynasty in the history of modern sports...probably...well, maybe.  Oh, please.
