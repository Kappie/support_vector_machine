Its the kind of thing where when I feel that there is nothing particularly interesting to report, I just wont.  There really isnt much to report right now anyway.. but here are the headlines:  ----  My sister's birthday was a week ago.  She turned 30!  YAY!  We had a nice party for her on the  urlLink Bay Queen  in Rhode Island.  It was a nice time, thouh the water was a little choppy.  Expect pictures in the next few days.  ---  Hilbilly Whack, the game my pal Jay and I have been working on is looking GREAT and deffinitely entering its final stages of development.  We have worked on it in our spare time here and there when we have it, and it is really coming together.  The plan of the game was to approach simple atari-style graphics with solid atari-styled gameplay to try out game ideas rapidly.  Artwork takes WAYY too much time than what 2 people can turn out (only 1 being a designer) and atari graphics make that process much simpler.  Plus with the nostalgia effect of Atari.. it works out nice ;)  I will post the whole thing when it is ready to be released..expect it by sometime in the next couple months, probably before the holidays.  ---  Chris and I have our costumes all set for this week.  (got a party this weekend and I am looking forward to it)  I also will be going to a non-Halloween party at my friend Paul's house and it will be great to see him as well.  Our costumes are not that "clever" per se, but they should be fun anyway.  Turns out I could not find a shark costume (or enough of one to build off) so we scrapped the chris as the diver russ the shark attacked, and instead with Chris the cult witch thing who summoned Russ the demon.   Not terribly original, but chris looks good, and I look scary.    VERY scary :)    Pictures will follow the party.. no worries.  ----  Well thats it for now!
