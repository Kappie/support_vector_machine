We beat the second highest ranked team in the league.   We started the second tournament started at three and we played well.  The game was stopped in the top of the last inning with the score 4-3 with the Prophets in the lead.  I was up with one out and men on first and second.  It rained for two hours.  I am not sure how they will settle this. The championship game is next week.  I got to talk to Ann on Friday.  She is on her way from Portland to Missoula this weekend.  She said she is more excited than scared now and that is great.
