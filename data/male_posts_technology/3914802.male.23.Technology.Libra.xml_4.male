I definitely get lots more food when I am more hungry, usually too much food for me to eat in one sitting. Although, many times this isn't too hard to accomplish since most restaurants give you those big ass portions. Unless you go to nice fancy restaurants where you pay more for less (although it usually is much more tasty). Aside from that, I went to the cafeteria here at work to get my food. I got atuna salad sub. I got that because it is pretty filling and it isonly 4 bucks which is pretty decentaround here in downtown DC. The cafeteria charges by the pound of food that you get... 4.49 a pound. It can add up when you are hungry. I had to startbalancing it out with half a lunchcontainer of salad since rice and other stuff can jack up the price. It was the difference between a 5 or 6 dollar meal and a 8 or 9 dollar meal. Yes, I am pretty surprised also that I am not fatter than I am. At least when I get the salad (even though today I opted for the sandwich) I can feel healthier.   I think that feeling healthy is important. It is up there with that whole self image thing. Sure women get pounded on by images of impossible to keep up with standards, but a lot of guys do too. Like all of those reality shows that have guyswith the really jacked washboard stomachs and man-boobies.They also have those hot sexy bikini wearing phat assed girls.... (where was I going with this....oh yeah) But real people don't look like this. You have to spend more time in the gym than sane 40 hr a week working people have.I guess I mean that people shouldn't starve themselves, they should try to just eat some things that are good for themselves. Like, lettuce isn't the only green out there, andthe others are way more healthy for you.People should eat a wide variety of things to balance the shit out, and for God's sake, eat some Carbs! They aren't gonna kill you! Just.. bread with every meal is going to make you fat, be sure to diversify. Fresher foods are much better for you since they don't get preservatives in them (this stuff  shouldn't   really be new knowledge for anyone). Oh! and something my roomie seems to not have the grasp of yet.. you don't need to eat everything in front of you either! (don't be wasteful, be sure to pack it up with you)   I, myself, got some peaches at the farmer's market outside because they looked fresh and delicious. And on my way back to my desk, I picked up some Funyuns... because they are too good (and life too short), but they have MSG in them so I don't eat them that often. GodSpeed.
