It was indeed better than the ads, but the obvious ads inside the film were a bit insulting. The filmmakers would like to thank Audi, JVC and Converse! Converse actually got a couple lines of dialogue and JVC and Audi got numerous plugs throughout the film. Other than that, the effects and overall look of the film was very clean and directed OK by Aussie Proyas represent! Being a fan of Dark City it was interesting to see his approach for I, Robot. The story wasn't overly great but the themes of prejudice and trust were pretty evident. I did enjoy it especially the robot on robot battles and the cute old school robots which are replaced. The robots did move a bit like the robots from Phantom Menace but that is to be expected. Story: 2/5   Production: 4/5    Film: 6/10
