I'd give you a direct link, but there is information in it that I'd prefer some people not see. I would have felt awful not telling you, especially Beej, because I was worried that he might be rather uptight/pissy/paranoid about something. Yes, love. I know that "we have PTH," and I couldn't be more sorryish even if I tried. So, in short, I love the world, and I also love you. Yes, even you. Forgive me for not rant/bitching about something, but I simply don't have the time. *Twisted Smile* I love playing games with Karine. She's just so much fun!    "Because I like someone and I won't tell you who he is..."
