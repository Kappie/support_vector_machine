I did get to write a paper for school and make a blueberry cheesecake but that was about it.  I guess the one good thing that happened today was that I got a copy of the court order showing that although   SFW   was given probate on being thrown in the klink they did not let her off to the tune of $300 bux payable to me.  I probably will not see it but it was nice to see it.  Other then that just another day.
