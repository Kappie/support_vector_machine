Cork taint    I talk to a number of people who seem to know a LOT about corked wines, yet they continue to force me to believe that cork taint is caused only by bad cork.  I may not have a cellar full of Bordeaux, but we have done enormous research into wine faults and cork taint, specifically.  It turns out that this is a tragic name for a number of reasons...  1.  Nobody can really prove bottle to bottle that cork is the problem.  Often wineries can trace large lots of contamination to contaminated cork (i.e. BV, etc).  But the fact that we do not have consistant failure rates with the same cork, seem to cause some scientific credibility issues.  2.  Wine enthusiasts simply have no clue what happens during fermentation.  Even smaller amounts of chlorine present in the must "could" result in the creation of low level anisoles in the wine.  Fermentation is not exact, as the enologist does not know every chemical being produced during fermentation.  While we have been told this is not possible by the wine intelligencia, it is hard for us to understand as we have found anisoles in wine barrels, tanks and even in non-wine drinks.  How is this possible if it is only "cork" related.  3.  Cork taint does not communicate the problem... which is the wine is contaminated.  Now that "corked" is in the vernacular, it will be with us FOREVER. That's okay, but is is best for all wine enthusiasts to understand that wine is a wonderful mixture of hundreds of chemicals... this symphony of chemicals normally create a wonderful experience.  The presence of TCA and other faults can and do ruin this symphony.  My two cents anyway...  Peace
