And who is responsible for this  urlLink rise to prominence for our language in Europe ? That'll be the Eastern Europeans who the  urlLink Daily Mail  wanted to keep out as they would be damaging UK culture or something. And scrounging benefits. And eating babies. Instead they are making it easier for us to go on holiday.  Their second language, if they have one, is nearly always English as they don't like Russian having spent years under Russian rule, don't like German (something to do with Hitler) and they don't like French (something to do with France). With the arrival of all these English speakers French and German are being marginalised.  The only thing to find out now is whether I can sue the school system for making me sit through all those shite French lessons - for nowt!
