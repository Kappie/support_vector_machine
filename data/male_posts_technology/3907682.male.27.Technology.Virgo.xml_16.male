Elite Tauric Drow/Scorpion   In the traditional settings of the Dungeons  Dragons game, the drow are closely associated with spiders. The Eberron campaign setting, however, associates dark elves with scorpions instead.  The tauric drow/scorpion presented below makes an excellent temple guard or elite killer, and it can easily be advanced in power by adding more class levels. If you're not using the Eberron setting, this NPC can be a rogue outcast from the drow without the religious symbolism of the drider, or perhaps even part of a growing splinter cult within the drow kingdom.  This tauric drow/scorpion was built from a Large monstrous scorpion advanced to 8 HD and a drow with two fighter levels. The tauric template appears in Savage Species and in Monster Manual II, but two modifications to the template have been applied here. First, the creature has the good and poor base saving throws of the base creature, calculated for the number of monstrous humanoid Hit Dice it possesses. Second, it keeps the racial skill bonuses for both the base creature and the base humanoid.    sh0
