She is a goddamn N-U-T; NUT!   urlLink t r u t h o u t - USA Today Drops Ann Coulter  Listen to this excerpt, Coulter was sent to cover the Democratic National Convention for the USA Today newspaper:  "Here at the Spawn of Satan convention in Boston, conservatives are deploying a series of covert signals to identify one another, much like gay men do. My allies are the ones wearing crosses or American flags. The people sporting shirts emblazoned with the 'F-word' are my opponents." Or this gem further in her story: "My pretty-girl allies stick out like a sore thumb amongst the corn-fed, no make-up, natural fiber, no-bra needing, sandal-wearing, hirsute, somewhat fragrant hippie-chick pie wagons they call 'women' at the Democratic National Convention."  Sick, sick, sick, this woman is sick and she should be thrown out like yesterday's garbage.
