Well, it was bad since she had been trying to page me since 10 o’clock and I never received a single one of her 5 pages…Turns out, her little brother was taken into custody for questioning about some vandalism that took place a few days previous. Come to find out, he and at least one other friend decided to break into an industrial area, smash a private owned car with an old fire extinguisher, run over the front of it with a dump truck, ran a tractor with the dump truck and then do a fun game of “tuck and roll” from the dump truck and watch it hit a building…seeing that they’re 16, this isn’t the end of the world for them…probably some time in a Juvi-home and maybe a little TLC with a crazy guy bunkmate name Sheila, but I seriously don’t see how this could have ever gone through their heads as a good idea. “Hey, I have a swell idea (apparently they’re kids from the 1920’s), let’s mess some expensive ass construction equipment up and then hope for the best.” It’s not like they were knocking on people’s doors and running, THEY RAN OVER A CAR WITH A DUMPTRUCK!!! I hardly think that’s something a rational person does…but what do I know, I once broke into a friend’s neighbor’s house and stole all of the mother’s underwear.   My main point is that this is a good example of stupid fucking kids doing things that they feel they’ll not get in trouble for…maybe a good punishment is to have the hillbillies, who’s gear was vandalized, come beat the shit out of their crap with some hammers and maybe piss on the interior a bit. I watched a video the same kids did to heavy metal music…if it were straight skateboarding film…or even them playing Monopoly it would have been better than seeing them do crappy backyard wrestling with poor man’s CKY impersonations. I think everyone should have their asses beat at least once in their lives…I’ve already had mine…  I might be getting a little too mad, but I don’t like the idea of cops going to my girlfriend’s house when I’m not there and not telling her what’s going on when he’s being carted off. Not to mention the cops went to his mother’s, bosses’ house at 8am to find out where she worked to go get her and then pick him up…not the smartest way to do it Chief…let’s get her fired while we’re at it…and then go smack our wives around.  Well, this is more like a rant than anything else…I guess since I didn’t want to tell anyone around here about it to start rumors, I’ll just do a little typing…
