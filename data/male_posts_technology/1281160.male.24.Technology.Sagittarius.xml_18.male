After the India-Pakistan match, this face-off was very much awaited for.   But people keep forgetting the fact that cricket is a sport, where winning and losing is all part of the game. Yes, Cricket is a religion in India. I hope no one wants to be a religious fanatic.  For the past one week, I have seen news reports which say that India is winning all its matches only after the fans at home had indulged in public humilation of the cricketers. This is ignorance and idiocy at its best. India got beaten by the best team in the world. That's it.  Anyway, I will be rooting for India today.
