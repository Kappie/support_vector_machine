One thing that really blew my mind was the new  urlLink Power Mac G5 .  Dual 2.5ghz procesors, 1.25ghz FSB (a win system can't even compete), 64-bits of processing power, and other crazy new features that I can't even begin to describe.  I'm really excited about how cool Macs are now that I've really seen some of the new features that are going to be incorporated into Tiger.  And, to back track a little, the Power Mac's are starting at $1999, and come standard as dual processors (Dual G5, 900mhz FSB, etc).  So, now I'm faced with a tricky problem: Do I buy a Mac for less than (I think) the cost of building a dual processor PC, or do I go ahead with my familiar Windows XP and wait for Longhorn?  It's a tough decision.  One thing that I'm really worried about is the software issues.  I have tons of software for Windows systems that just won't work on a Mac, some of which don't even exist for the Mac (3D Studio Max).  Also, I'm really excited about Safari RSS.  And the new video formats.  And Spotlight.  And the video conferencing capabilities.  It's so amazing what Apple is doing.  I  really  want a Mac now.  You should watch the WWDC video.  It's long, but totally worth it.  peace out
