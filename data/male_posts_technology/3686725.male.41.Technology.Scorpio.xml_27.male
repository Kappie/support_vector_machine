Because I work for a very security  conscious State office and often the web-interfaces that are used to post stuff  are not allowed through our firewall. Such was the case with my previous  blog, of which the entire site has since disappeared from the ether. So, I  and you can look forward to more active blogging experience than we previously  imagined.
