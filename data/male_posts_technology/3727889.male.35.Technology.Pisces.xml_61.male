I am already being called a liar and a windbag and the season has not even started yet:  "SirFWALGMan has decided to join the fray in the FFL. He says he's never played, but is a fan. He could be sandbagging... we'll see. Either way, I've added a link to his blog on the right, it's "Online Poker Thoughts", go check him out. He posts very frequently... and frequently posts long."  - Roberto Roundtree Rogelio    Poker Distractions  Now I might not care too much about Fantasy Leagues and all of that even if I love football. One think that is important to me though is winning! Yes! I think this has alot to do with why I like Poker. I think I have a good chance of being a consistently good and winning player. So I spent the end of today scouting out a team. From what I understand you need like 2 QB's, 3-4 Receivers, 3-4 Running Backs, a Tight End, a Kicker and two defenses. I do not know how many people you get to take overall maybe these are the limits? If Roberto is reading this maybe he can fill me in. I have chosen 9 defenses, 7 QBs, 15 RBs, 8 TEs, 14 WRs, and 6 Kickers that I like so far and ranked them in order. Hopefully this is enough of a pool to make a team from? If I need some more let me know.  The only other useful information I have figured out so far is that you should pick your running backs early in the draft. You MUST have two good RBs to succeed. I will continue my research. I probably will not do a full post again because this IS a Poker Blog, but you might get it slipped in every once in a while especially if I am crushing my opponents! Die Pagan Scum!   I like my choices so far and hope that I can get one of the choices I have made. It is the only one I really want. I am not going to say who it is, but I am going to get it as quickly as possible without jeopardizing my team. Wish the Boston Bullets luck this year! See I tied Poker into this post after all.
