From their site:  The OpenEEG project is about making plans and software for do-it-yourself EEG devices available for free (as in GPL). It is aimed toward amateurs who would like to experiment with EEG. However, if you are a pro in any of the fields of electronics, neurofeedback, software development etc., you are of course welcome to join the mailing-list and share your wisdom.  Right now, this site is mostly about the hardware; schematics, part lists, building instructions etc. However, a few members have developed some useful software which is hosted on their own websites. You can find these through the software pages.  EEG, for those that don't know, stands for electroencephalogram, which is a method for measuring the electrical activity of the brain.  They have plans that may someday make it easy to create your own device that could be used to transmit information directly from your brain to your computer.
