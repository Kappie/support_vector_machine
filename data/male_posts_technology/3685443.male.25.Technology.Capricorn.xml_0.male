Thanks to this  urlLink Wired article  that I found out about thanks to  urlLink Groklaw .  If you want to know more about the whole fight between SCO and Linux( IBM, Novell, Red Hat, Autozone and DC.  Check out  urlLink Groklaw .  Ok on a happy note I found an article on  urlLink DesktopLinux.org  about cool app that is not only cross platform, and free but also allows you to use your computer as a free point to point ip phone.  No long distance charges, just pure voice over ip, no service to sign up for or pay for, just ip phone.  I still got to play with it myself until I can officially recommend yet.  Hopefully I can convince someone from a far away place (cough Michigan) to help me test it out.  Well if anyone checks it out and gets it work (or not) I would love to hear from you either via email or the comments section.  Happy playing.  You can download it  urlLink here .
