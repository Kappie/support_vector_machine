I splashed water of my face to get rid of the blood. As I looked in the mirror I saw my wet face. I had got a black eye from somewhere. I went back down stairs and grabbed my chainsaw on the way. I went into the kitchen and got a bite to eat. After this a proceeded into the living room, I sat down and turn on the T.V. There was no signal, went up to the T.V and gave it some kicks but this didn’t change anything. After this went and tried the phone and there was no dial tone. At this point I was scared, there was no way of me know what had happened. The only way I could contact people was if I went outside. I didn’t want to but I had to. I opened my front door, the world looked no different. I walked out towards the sidewalk, I looked down and up my street. I saw nothing, I heard nothing too. I started to jog down my street, As I jogged I pear into houses and gardens just looking for anyone. Then all of a sudden I heard a scream. I ran through someone’s garden looking for this person. Then I heard it again. I looked over the back fence and saw this girl backed up against a garage door with 3 zombies walking towards her. I quickly hopped over the fence. I sprinted toward undead. As I ran I started up my chainsaw. I took the first zombie out with a clean cut from it head to it legs. Brains and guts went everywhere. With the second zombie I went straight for it neck. But this one was a harder, my chainsaw cut out while I chopping at this guys head. I ripped the chainsaw out from this neck but he was still alive, so I grabbed his head and gave this body couple of elbows. This left this head detached for his body. I still had the head in my hand so dropped it to the ground. I tried to start my chainsaw but it wouldn’t. Then all of a sudden the third zombie turned round and started on me. I walked backwards trying to start my chainsaw but it was still dead. Then from nowhere *bang*, the zombie flew sideways and again *bang* the zombie stood up with 2 holes in his torso. Then with my 5th try my chainsaw started, so I launched my self at it. I stabbed my chainsaw into its stomach and rip upwards. Blood spurted all over. The zombie dropped too the ground and I said “ This is real, Oh my god”. I turned around to see who had helped me and this guy was there welding a shotgun. As he came closer I noticed he was wearing a blue hoodey, black jeans and backwards baseball cap. He walk up to me and said “ Hey I’m Mike”. I replied by saying “Hey I’m Wez”. We both turned to the dead zombies and he said to me “Is this your first kill”. I looked at him and said “No its my second, Third and forth”. He looked at me, laughed and said “You don’t hold back do you”
