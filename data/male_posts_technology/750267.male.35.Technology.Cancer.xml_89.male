I added a couple of red asterisks to this photo to help make my point.     The building on the left is the CFMT television station headquarters. In the center, towards the back, is a school. Way to the back is Toronto City Center Airport (TCCA). The building on the right (with the red asterisks) is fake. Those buildings aren't there in real life. In real life, there is a street (Bathurst Street) and a gas station (Esso) on that spot. I guess the movie company didn't want to insert a free plug for Esso, so they added a building into the scene. By the way, I recognize that building they inserted -- 600 Queens Quay West. In real life, it is off camera to the left of the scene.  What's odd is, this scene (and the next two) never appeared in the real movie - just the trailer. Yes, Chow Yun Fat does some spectacular helicopter leaps, but you never get to see any "background" in them. (I noticed that there are a few other scenes in the trailer that never made it into the movie, probably having to do with backstory.)     Just off camera to the right of this shot, is the City Centre driving range and golf course. What you see in this photo is a pit mine, train tracks (Go and Via) and the west end of Front Street (where the cars are). The yellow building is a surplus store. To the left of that is a Harley Davidson dealership, and to the left of that is a Lambourghini dealership. The only Lambourghini dealer in Canada. He sells 12 cars a year, what a job!     Here, off to the left of this shot, we see the building that was inserted into the first shot. Either Toronto architects aren't very original, placing two identical buildings on the same street, or the movie makers thought you wouldn't notice the same building in two spots. By the way, I live just one building left off camera. Damn, almost made it into the film.     I remember the day they filmed this.     In the background, you can see Scotia Tower (red logo) and Bank of Montreal's First Canadian Place (blue logo). Two big Toronto banks.
