So, in order to get the fishes in the mood for some sweet lovin', I lit two candles in front of the fishtank and played The Temptations' "On The Nightshift" on heavy rotation. And here's the result of that effort:     Yay! Two babies (one hides behind the plant)! They are about a week old now, fishes "David" and "Bowie" are the parents. Thing is, I don't have names for the offspring yet. So I decided to name the fishes after the  first two people who comment on this post . So go ahead! This is an unique chance to become the namesake of something that looks like mutant sperm!
