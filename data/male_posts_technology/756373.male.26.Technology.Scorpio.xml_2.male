Just got back from my (soon to be ex) bank, where I had attempted to draw some cash,  MY  cash out of  MY  fucking bank account. Money  I  worked for. My money.  Mine . What does the fucking retarded teller tell me? Because I have a cheque account, I have to use a cheque to draw money. Not a withdrawal slip. What.The.Fuck? For the last year and a half that I've been with this retarded monkey-fuckpole of a bank, I've been doing my withdrawals by simply filling out slips. It's quick and convenient and costs me little. Suddenly, I have to use my chequebook.  Why ? I'll tell you why. So they can make the 20 bucks or whatever it is they charge me for a cheque transaction. Why wasn't it always this way? Why is my bank the only one that  requires  a person to use a cheque to draw money? Simple, really - they are going down the shitter, and instead of doing the respectable thing , the  smart  thing by taking care of their exhisting clients, they rather decide to  fuck  their loyal customers right in the ass. What the  fuck  kind of mentality is that? No seriously, what the  fuck ? A bank supposedly set on customer care pulls a dumbshit stunt like this? I banked with this tiny little bank because I felt I should support local business, instead of relying on a bigger foreign bank like Standard or First National, but obviously they choose not to support me as I have supported them. If I can't even draw my own money by simply walking into a branch and filling out a withdrawal slip, then they don't deserve my account. Hell, they don't deserve  anyone's  accounts. They deserve to go down the shitter, they deserve to have their Board of Directors live in cardboard boxes and beg for scraps. I am sick and fucking tired of the system pushing people around like this. I only use a bank because I have to (for payroll) - otherwise I'd keep my cash under my mattress or something. I have had it. Not only is this dumbfuck dipshit cockgurgling fuck of a bank losing a customer, but an  up and coming  customer as well. They have just lost out on a homeloan and a car loan from me. Fuck them. Fuck them and the horse they rode in on.
