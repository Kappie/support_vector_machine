I work for a small company in Virginia. I work in software.  I am a 24 years old,  politically opinionated and strong willed.   I run linux.  I try to keep fit. I was running 35 miles a week until I got injured about a month ago. Now I'm riding my bike a few times a week. It is satisfying, but as not quite the same as running was. The lack of frequency hurts too. Though I suppose that is in part my own fault.  I like film, "out there" music, the Simpsons, Family Guy, Futurama, NPR, and am a recovering Law & Order addict.  Oh yea, I'm going to Miami thursday!  Should be a blast!  TaTa!  Til later...
