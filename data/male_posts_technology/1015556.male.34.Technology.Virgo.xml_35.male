Goals: •	Provide service opportunities for students to be involved in. •	Intelligently target kids who are not already involved. •	Another tool for discipleship – growing through serving. •	Teaching on various service/mission topics. •	Bridge the gap between different age ministries (middle school/high school/gen X) - range of people serving together. •	Enabling students to see their giftedness in a serving opportunity. •	Provide support and focus for strategic, progressive, graduated student missions. (longer term goal)  Values: •	All service lies somewhere in the realm of evangelism (I Cor 3), therefore, opportunities will be pointed towards interaction with people when possible. •	There is a correlation between service and missions. •	Devotionals and debriefs for every event. •	Constant evaluation via survey forms. •	Adult leaders/chaperones are integral.
