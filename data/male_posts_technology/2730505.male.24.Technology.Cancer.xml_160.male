Apparently there are some people out there with really way too much time on their hands.  This kid especially made a little experiment to see if girls get treated differently in a predominantly male gaming environment.  It would be a little harder to pull that shit off on XBOX Live considering they use voice.  Sure you can get a voice scambler or even turn on voice mask but that might be too much effor you know?
