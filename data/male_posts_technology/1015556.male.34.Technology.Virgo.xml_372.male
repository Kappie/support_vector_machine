"When they eventually found a place to stay in Khamman, Andra Pradesh State, the house owner refused to let them in because they were Christians. The housewife bravely decided to let them in. The unfriendly owner, a rich landowner, suffered from diabetes, and had open wounds on his feet. His doctors had prescribed various medicines to prepare him for an amputation the following week. His wife asked her guests for prayer for herself and her husband; the evangelists told her that she too should pray to God. The healing was rapid; the surprised doctors cancelled the amputation, because the man was completely healthy. When his wife told of her husband's healing in the nearby store, the store owner, who suffered from cancer, also started praying to God. She was healed too. The thankful landowner donated land, on which a church building was opened in April 2004." Source: Stimme der Zigeuner
