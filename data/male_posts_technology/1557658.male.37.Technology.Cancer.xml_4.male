I'm stuck on a problem where a .jsp form is supposed to work a certain way, the same way it works in another app, and I can't make it work that way.  It's getting pretty old.  *yawn*  One problem is that this certain behavior involves changing a configuration file that requires the app to be re-started to take effect. struts-config.xml, to be specific.  stop start login test edit. stop start login test edit. stop start login test edit.   woohoo, what fun!  After work, gonna go pick up my new mustang from the local ford dealership service department.  Got LoJack installed, interior upholstery treatment, and fixed a problem with interior lights not working (map light, vanity mirror lights).  Can't wait for tomorrow.. put the top down and jam up the hill to Tahoe!!  I'm wondering if there might be a problem with the rear differential.. the car doesn't seem to be going as fast as the speedometer indicates.  It has 18" wheels, so I'm thinking that possibly the wheels were added aftermarket.  One of these days I'll have a buddy benchmark with me, make sure speedometer is correct.  Ok, break over, back to work. ugh.
