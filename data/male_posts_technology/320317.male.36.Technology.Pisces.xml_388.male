  I purchased this on  urlLink Amazon.com  and watched it this weekend. There is a lot of great content on the DVD from History Channel documentaries to commentaries from the director, producers, and all the major actors. If your a behind the scenes fan, this is a great DVD to get. However, this DVD design suffers from too much design and not enough functionality, especially the packaging. From a user interface perspective, the menu structure has the annoying long transitions which we really get old in a hurry. But the most annoying thing is you have to keep drilling down within the menu structures by selecting "More", rather than having all the selections within one screen.
