It's icy and my car starts to skid. Next thing I know the car is backwards on the road and the rear corner behind the gas tank hits one of those huge lamp posts, knocking it over. Some guy gives me a ride back home. I call the cops - they're already there getting it towed. Then I call my dad. Then I call the insurance company. The towing company says it's not drivable. I really hope that they don't write it off because the Camry is a freakin' legend. Whatever they give us for it won't be worth it, the car is invaluable to me and the family.  I got my roomate to drive me into work. I got here at 10:45
