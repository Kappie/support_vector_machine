It was  39.99, more than I normally spend on anything but I kept saying to myself ' I am on vacation, I am on vacation.' heh heh The mantra helped. I also ended up buying my daughter the 'Kim Possible, A stitch in Time' dvd. I with them love to watch Kim Possible. We hit the zoo today and was able to see a real naked mole rat. : )   Anyway, Sam Goodys in the mall wanted Quantum Leap for 59.99 so that helped me a little bit in my spending. I am on vacation, I am on vacation.....
