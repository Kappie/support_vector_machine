I have to wake up AT LEAST at 5:45 am to make it to work by 7:00 am.   I have been thinking about playing Disgaea again. I really should spend some time with those kind of games...but it seems like when I try to play them, I get tired easily of playing them. Disgaea, Silent Storm, Final Fantasy Tactics...geez, I'm even thinking of purchasing the sequel to Disgaea (La Pucelle: Tactics) which I know I won't ever finish.   But there comes a time when I think "...Someday, I'll have all the time in the world to finish all of my games...including the ones that take freakin 40 hours long!" When am I going to have this time for me to finish all of these games? When I get home, sometimes I'm so tired that I don't even want to look at the TV. Yet, there's an overwhelming urge to play through everything I have. It's quite a dilemma that I think I'll never be rid of. I'll buy new games and play, but never finish them. There are some exceptions (Rachet and Clank: Going Commando), but those games COMPLETELY enthralled me. I was so addicted to it that I couldn't stop playing for the life of me. I need games like that. The tactics genre has pulled me in a couple of times, but never like R   I'm almost done with Metroid Zero Mission. I think I'm at the last level (Tourian), but I don't think I'm suppose to be there yet. I don't have the space jump, power bomb, of most of the super missiles I need to defeat motherbrain. Plus those Metroids are SUPER HARD! I'm thinking there's another place I need to go to after Norfair. I'm going to have to ask Andrew.
