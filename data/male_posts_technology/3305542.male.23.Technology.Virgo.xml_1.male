The flight isn't until 6am Saturday, but we are flying out of Chicago so I will be leaving work early on Friday so I can drive to Sheboygan, where I will spend the very short night.  We will then drive to Chicago starting at about 2am.  I have put off all packing, so tonight will be the big pack-a-thon.  Alright, it probably won't be that big, but it sounded cool.  Anyways, I must go.  My next post should be full of fun Cancun stories, so stay tuned...
