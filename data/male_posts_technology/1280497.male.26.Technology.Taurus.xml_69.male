He just said that he is aware that terrorists are "interested in evil chemistry and evil biology."  Evil chemistry + Evil Biology = Fulfillment of your Evil Natural Sciences requirements in college. I felt the same way about biology and chemistry when I was a freshman at BYU, even though I'm not a terrorist. I'm not! I promise! Please don't take me to Guantanamo Bay.
