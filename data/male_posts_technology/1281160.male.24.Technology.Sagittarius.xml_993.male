About fonts, ofcourse its good to use normally used fonts but then i say its not fitting properly and each font look unique in its own way and not setting into the blog whole heartedly. so fit them jax.  And yes, i think everybody would have noticed the layout change, but then not much interested, since they are more contented with content i believe.   There is an article about Anna Karenina in  urlLink Elite-essays  blog. Those who are interested can have a look to know about the novel which i am reading now.  Apart from jax and kicha, y rnt u people talking about new year celebrations, resolutions, predictions? i will join the bandwagon soon, probably next week! till then little bit busy!
