It is focused, however, on the things going on with CDDG, our Content Delivery (mumble) Group.  I can never remember what the second D stands for.  Anyway, the technologies they are describing there are what are being built from a platforms perspective, and all good stuff.  The article doesn't touch on what's going on within the product divisions themselves, where we actual use the work CDDG does to try to drive greater connection with our community.  Still, good to see it talked about without any obvious element of cynicism.  [After the fact edit: CDDG stands for Content Development  Delivery Group.  No wonder I couldn't remember what came after Delivery.]
