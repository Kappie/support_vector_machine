The smoke is noticable pretty much everywhere and I think it's what is making me feel dizzy and disortiented this morning. At the bottom of the picture below (and in the news article) is the interstate and just above that is TECO arena where I saw A Perfect Circle a couple weeks ago. This is also where the Everblades (I hate that name) play, if that sort of thing interests you at all.      -intX    boom shaka-laka boom
