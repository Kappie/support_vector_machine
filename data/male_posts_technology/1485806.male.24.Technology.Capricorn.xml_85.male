Notice his utmost expression while placing his hands on the heart .  urlLink     Uhh..Jamie Neoh..the beginning of his journey in SIBKL of serving the Lord , immersing himself in God's presence and SIBKL wonderful culture of encouragement and hospitality and of course the key word Passion.  Jamie's coming even to SIBKL is a miracle itself cause he took the intiative to even ask me to invite him to Simply United, one of the original college cell in Pastor's house. From there he started that journey of discovering how to channel his youthful exuberance and energy to serving God , discovering His wonderful grace and Power. He felt the same calling that have been revealed to him in the earlier days as a potential leader ...and he have felt the burden to serve God ...in  a very powerful way...   need i say more...? Comment on What do ya think about Jamie Neoh?   Keep all encouragement notes here and leave the negatives notes on someone' else blog not here...@!
