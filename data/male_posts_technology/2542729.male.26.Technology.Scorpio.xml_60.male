It hindered the potential to see what was really on the minds of a sea of different females during my time at Ft. Benning. It caused me to be on different terms with my most platonic of friends. Even to this day, at least two of them never knew a thing. One tried to holla back in the day and her efforts resurged near the end of last year andbut when it was all said  done, I knew sacrifices had to be made and I felt it was worth it in the end.        Now I find that the sacrifice for love has taken an intriguing turn for the worst. Not so much because of the breakup and the sarifices that were made but because i've received news today that my X is going thru some really rough times. On the one mind, I had half a mind to say "who cares, she dug her own ditch" but that's not in my nature. Well...it is to an extent, but not in cases like these. I CAN'T HELP IT! To think of all the thingsI said in truth  honesty, and all the things I gave up to be one with the woman I loved. In 6 months, I learned and have applied more about love  relationships than I have in the past six years. There has to be a justice...a method to quench the madness that on occasion rages but every day brings a new opportunity, a new chance. According to her words tho, she might not be so lucky. She says she's really sick. She also says her great grandmother is very sick also. Also says she's losing her job. Apparently a lot of things were lost since the breakup and life for neither of us has been the same.        I have a problem. I have a problem with someone lying to me. I have a problem with dishonest works in general, be it in love, politics, administrations or wherever. I have a problem with giving someone my heart and watch a deterioration process slowly bubble to a screeching explosion. Such is what happened between me  Nicole and the shadow of a failed union haunts me everyday.        I have another problem. I hate the thought of being with a woman that smokes (does not apply to Nicole, just saying). I hate the very essence of cigars/ cigarettes and hope they will one day be wiped from the face of the earth.        I have more problems. I'm often full of crap! I'm conscientious. I'm eclectically inconsistent, often non chalant and sometimes overly judgmental! I'm not in shape! I'm not the musician I planned on being by this age! I'm currently not in my own home yet! I'm 26 and I still live with my mom!!        They say when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Well life threw me vegetables so I have to make V8. Most people don't drink V8 and i'm one of them. All the sugar in the world couldn't make me chug that stuff down my throat yet every day brings another opportunity. God willing I will have another chance tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day. This same air I breathe, I still hope to share it with Nicole, despite what has transpired...despite how I feel.        Happy 22nd birthday Nicole. You  yours are still in my prayers.        .: disconnected
