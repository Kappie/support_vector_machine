Basically, my bedroom is not in the most optimal configuration.  Both of my tall bookshelves are covering up one window completely and part of another window.  So, I started thinking about alternative arrangements.  Knowning me, I couldn't just visualize this or write it out on a sheet paper, I decided to measure and model my room in Photoshop.  

   

It's pretty hard to see on the left, but there is a long window there.  The upper left red line is another window.  The red line on the right is the bathroom door.  Here is my suggested layout:  

   

This clears both windows (since the dresser fits underneath the window and the sides of the bed are not against the bed) and seems like a good idea.  Bah, no time to do it tonight.
