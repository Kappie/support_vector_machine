I think she called me some other time recently but I don't quite remember. We were talking about how laid back I am... I suppose it's pretty true.  laid-back (ldbk) adj. Informal  Having a relaxed or casual atmosphere or character; easygoing: “laid-back, untroubled people”  Yep, that is me, lol. I don't (except for some important things) really take things overly serious, I guess it helps to keep the stress down. I'm getting to wherre I need to take school seriously though, next year is going to be stressful... but livable.  This summer so far has been pretty slow, yet it's gone by quickly (that really doesn't make sense). I'm hoping I can get into the same thing next year, an extra $3000 would be useful.  I put Debian on my work laptop this morning... man, I put Debian on everything I can get my hands on. The first Linux Distro I installed, and by far my favorite. The best part is it works just fine :)
