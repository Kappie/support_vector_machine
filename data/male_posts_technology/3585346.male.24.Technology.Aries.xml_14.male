Different people weigh things differently and worth is of different value to each and everyone. While realising how bad decision people made to you is just a bad decision but to others is a worth while decision made. I believe in my decision, if my decision does not work out then it is not a good decision made. Probably make you seems like you have no foresight which is pretty important in carreer or business aspect. And also part of job nature in decision making, one wrong decision made decide how tough things gonna get. At least this is what i feel in my job, every wrong step made will make you lose your job. Sometimes there isn't a wrong decision or right decision because simply the after effect of the decision is not that strong.  I think I just forgotten to iron my clothes again and I gonna give shit about it now and get some sleep I am left with 5 hrs to sleep. Good Morning! And Sweet Awake!
