Having 2 deaths hit close to home last week, and drastically affect several people close to me and 2 people REALLY close to me has taken it's toll on me!  I never really thought that being here for my loved ones would kick my ass so hard!  I'm run down, in pain, fucked out, and running on empty.  I need a fucken break man!  I need those good times to ROLL!
