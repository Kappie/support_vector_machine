I have to say. Girls confuse me at the moment.. The one I like.. Not interested... I think... (First bit of confusion) and there is a girl that is really nice... but I amn't interested.. Get on really well and hoping we can be friends but haven't decided if I want to see her or not. Might be able to but tbh (to be honest for the non-net-savy) at the moment I don't really see it.. Then there is "Relationship girl" who I amn't seeing at all anymore.  The Girl I am interested in is amazing but I think nothing is ever going to develop there. That is OK in the sense that we get on really well and we make great friends. I just have to try and figure out if that is definitly all that is going to be because I think we would make a great couple.. Hmmm I may just have to sit down and talk to her at some stage.. (Not now tho.. way too soon)  Ah well.. I am full of shit tonight.. Go read something interesting :)
