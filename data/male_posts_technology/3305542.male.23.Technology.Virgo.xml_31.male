What I would like is a giant three-class reunion.  Now, I'm not sure how that would work, because a person would end up having a reunion three years in a row...  and how do you pick which one to go to?  Maybe they just need a better way to set up clique reunions, so anyone who was in your clique could go.  The school could host a reunion every year where any clique could plan their reunion for.  Then it would be up to members of the clique to say what year they will meet again.  I guess the real problem, then, is how do you keep updated contact info.  The members of the clique would almost have to voluntarily update their info.  I don't know, maybe the whole idea is crap.  I just would like to see some other old friends again, is all.  Well, enough rambling...  I need to get back to work.
