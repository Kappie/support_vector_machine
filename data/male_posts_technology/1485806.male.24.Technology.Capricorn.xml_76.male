But let the pics says it all, One of the teambuilding games found in COUZ where leaders from College United Zone actually played..and it involves a listening ear, teamwork in planning, building and executing.         Team A with their masterpiece          Team B with their Ark build with wisdom given by God...(why more canggih commentary?) Cause it is my team ...that is why.. Note: That this team have no engineers from any fields...no scouts...just passionate JesusFreakers.   Wanna see that our arks works or not..whether we can truly walk on water?  The goal is to build a raft that can fit all of us ...with standard materials...like bamboos, canisters and ropes..and rowed across the pond to grab a purplish flower and everyone gets down to push the raft back , bring it shore and dissassembled it asap.  The Race is on....        In the end of the race, my team actually won but all glory be to God because the prize is that we have learned what is the core lesson to be learned...it is not about great leadership or great design or anything like that...  It is the listening ears of everyone , taking note of their opinions and trying them out one by one...  One of the Chunnest Games that is the ideas of people in Borga Campsite..and really though our body aches and hurts..with my deep cut finger bleeding nonstop ...., our hearts burn passionately to work as a team.
