The Left's response : "It's not proof since there's not enough   actual  mustard gas in the shells to be a threat!" Odd, I wonder what  happened  to the gas that was in those shells.. it was never accounted for by Saddam's regime...  May '04- Warhead found containing sarin in roadside bomb. The Left's response : "It's not proof since it's only one warhead - it's not exactly a  stockpile  or anything!". This same argument used about 2 weeks later when a second IED is found. Only one eh.. Oh wait, make that 'only two'...soo, by that logic, 'only 500' would be quite acceptable as an argument too. Ridiculous.  About a month ago- Banned missile engines found in scrapyards in Netherlands and some M.E countries. The Left's response : "It's not proof because they aren't actually IN Iraq, even though there's incontrovertible proof they are of Iraqi origin." Funny. US troops stationed in Germany are still US, last time I checked. So by leftist 'logic', American fighter jets parked off on a base in, say, Germany, are obviously German.. right?  Less than a week ago- Over a dozen warheads found (there's that  stockpile  ya said didn't exist...), containing sarin and mustard gas. The Left's response : "It's not proof of WMD because...er...some were old and busted... and... well... we've already made up our minds! So there! Anyways it's not like they're NUKES or anything..." This one escapes me completely.  Over the past 6 months, if you add all the warheads and other evidence together, you'd have more than enough to conclude that WMD's existed in Iraq during a time period when they were not supposed to - and that is justification for America's invasion of Iraq. By segmenting the evidence into isolated little pieces, the Left is able to convince the entire gullible  planet  that that specific small segment of prof is not substantial enough. Odd. Last I heard, in a criminal court, a guilty person was convicted on a  body  of evidence. Why is that not the case re: Iraq?
