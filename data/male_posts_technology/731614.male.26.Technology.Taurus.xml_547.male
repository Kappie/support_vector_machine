Belle  has already received her xmas in june package and claims that she hasn't opened it yet. Of course she works in a hospital so she has probably x-rayed it, c-scanned it, mri-d it and ultra sounded it.   Marci  has yet to receive her present that was sent by UPS two weeks ago. Hopefully that will be straightened out, but just in case I have submitted marci's name to  Toys For Tots , because no grad student should wake up to an empty xmas in june tree on xmas in june morning.  Big doings in the  Hot Tub  last night.  Jonnie, Belle, Marci  and her friend  Melanie ,  dvl , and our special guess hot tubber  MadMands  all showed up, and NO we didn't talk about you, well ok, yeah we probably did, but what happens in the tub, stays in the tub. So suck it. Oh yeah,  Jonnie  wanted me to apologize for him and to tell  Mands  that he is sorry about that one incident last night and he fully intends to replace the panties that he chewed on.  That's it.
