I've just started using it, but the more I find, the more I like it. My suspicion is that, while it may not yet be quite as good as  urlLink Intellij IDEA , it will over time become the dominant IDE on the basis of it's price (free), and support in the form of numerous  urlLink plugins . Also, the fact that it is language-agnostic is a great bonus for us multi-lingual polyglots ;-)
