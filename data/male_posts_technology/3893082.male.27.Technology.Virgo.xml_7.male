I had to do some blood tests and hopefully will find out today or tomorrow.  Bad part is, if I have it there is nothing that can be done.  I'm just hoping it doesn't worsen beyond the aches and pains, swollen glands, and rash that I have now.  If you want more info on this virus just go to the  urlLink CDC West Nile Virus Homepage .  Other than that, my week has been long and boring!  Atleast it is my Friday today!  YEAH!  Looking forward to resting over the next three days and hoping things get better.  I'm also supposed to be going on a couple of dates with a couple of beautiful young ladies but we will see how those turn out. Wish me luck! Woohoo!  Blog at ya'll later...
