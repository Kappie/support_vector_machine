I first remember using Mozilla when I started playing with linux, oh about 6 years ago, and I can proudly say that IE may just be a thing of the past for me. Ofcourse there are a couple of glitches to be ironed out, but once you start loading the browesr up with extensions or plugins as we call them, you'll figure it out for yourself.  Go here to see what I mean :   urlLink Firefox Extensions   I recommend, the image zoom and nuke anything feature. Tabbed windows are also immensely cool, i can psuedo categorize my browsing experience. AWESOME!!
